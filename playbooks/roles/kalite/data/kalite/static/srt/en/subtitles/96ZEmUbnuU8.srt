I have three word problems in this video.

2
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:05,887
What I want to do in this video is not solve the word problems,

3
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:10,154
but setup the equation that we could solve to get the answer to the word problem.

4
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:13,597
What we are essentially going to do is setup the proportionality for the word problems.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,907
So In this 1st problem

6
00:00:14,907 --> 00:00:18,933
we have 9 markers cost $11.50. And then they ask:

7
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:22,236
How much will 7 markers cost.

8
00:00:22,236 --> 00:00:31,333
Now, let's just set X to be equal to our answer, where X is equal to the cost of 7 markers.

9
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,471
The way to solve a problem like this is to setup two

10
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,333
ratios and set them equal to each other.

11
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,815
So you could say that the ratio of 9 markers

12
00:00:38,815 --> 00:01:10,578
to the cost of 9 markers; 9/ 11.50 = 7/ X

13
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:21,046
This is a completely valid proportion here.

14
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:23,471
You could solve this to figure out how much those

15
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,317
7 markers will cost.

16
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:58,553
You could have 11.50/9 = X/7 .This is also a valid ratio.

17
00:01:58,553 --> 00:02:01,651
You could also think about ratios in other ways

18
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:11,404
You could say, that the ratio of 9 markers to 7 markers,

19
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:22,933
is going to be same as the ratio of their cost

20
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:42,748
9/7 = 11.5/X or 7/9 = X/11.5

21
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:51,061
So all of these would be valid proportion.

22
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:54,933
Sp let's do this problem now. 7 aples cost $5.

23
00:02:54,933 --> 00:03:02,169
How much can I buy with $8.

24
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:11,205
How many apples - let's call that X. We need to solve for X

25
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:13,138
So we have the ratio between number

26
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:34,933
of apples and cost of the apples - 7/5= X/8

27
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:42,800
In this first situation the unknown was cost, in this example

28
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,507
the unknown is number of apples.We can do all the different

29
00:03:49,507 --> 00:04:15,194
scenarios as above. we could say 7/X = 5/8

30
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:19,174
Now lets do the last one. We have a cake recipe for

31
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:32,660
5 people requires 2 eggs. How many eggs? So we want to know how many eggs?

32
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,759
We will call how many eggs, which we

33
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:45,225
need to find out as X, we can call it anything Y,A,B,C anything.

34
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:56,671
So you could say the ratio of people to eggs is constant.

35
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:13,400
We have 5 people for 2 eggs - 5/2 = 15/X

36
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:38,867
Or you could say the ratio between 5/15 = 2/X

37
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:46,933
All of these we setup the proportion and we can

38
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:50,933
solve for X and get the answer.
