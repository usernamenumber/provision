00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,220
What I wanna do this video is prove that the opposite angles

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,120
of a parallelogram are congruent

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,840
So, for example, we wanna prove that CAB is congruent to BDC

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,240
So, that angle is equal to that angle and that ABD,

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,750
which is this angle is congruent to DCA which

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,080
is that angle over here

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,620
And to do that we just have to realize that we have some parallel

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,290
lines, we have some transversals and the parallel lines

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,320
and the transversals actually switch roles

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,710
So, let's just continue these so it looks a little bit more like

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,200
transversals intersecting parallel lines

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,570
And really you could just post it for yourself and try to prove it

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,530
'cause it really just comes out of alternate interior angles and

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,310
corresponding angles of transversals intersecting parallel lines

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,810
So, let's say the angle right over here, let's make this,

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,300
let me do the new color since I've already used that yellow

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,600
So, let's say, let's start right here at angle BDC

18
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,890
Well angle BDC and I'm just gonna mark this up here

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,300
Angle BDC over here, it is an alternate interior angle with this

20
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,270
angle right over here with that angle right over there

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,130
And actually we can extend this point over here

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,710
I could call that point E if I want

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:21,810
So, I could say angle CDB is congruent to angle EBD

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,460
by alternate interior angles

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,020
This is a transversal, these two lines are parallel

26
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,090
AB or AE is parallel to CD

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,560
Fair enough

28
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,330
Now, if we kinda change our thinking a little bit

29
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,220
and instead we now view BD and AC as the parallel line

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:52,620
and now view AB as the transversal, then we see that angle EBD

31
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,180
is going to be congruent to angle BAC because they're

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,920
corresponding angles

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:08,890
So, angle EBD is going to be congruent to angle BAC

34
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:17,780
or I could say CAB they are corresponding angles

35
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,930
And so, if this angle is congruent to that angle,

36
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,250
that angle is congruent to that angle,

37
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,140
then they're congruent to each other

38
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,650
So, angle, let me make sure I get this right, CDB

39
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,430
or we could say BDC is congruent to angle CAB

40
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,160
So, we've proven this first part right over here

41
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,910
And then to prove that these two are congruent,

42
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,110
use the exact same logic

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,880
So, first of all we view this as a transversal

44
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,840
We view AC as a transversal of AB and CD

45
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,900
And let me go here and let me create another point here,

46
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,940
let me call this point, point F right over here

47
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:06,160
So, we know that angle ACD is going to be congruent

48
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:16,780
to angle FAC because they are alternate interior angles

49
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,250
And then we change our thinking a little bit and we view AC

50
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,820
and BD as the parallel line and AB as the transversal

51
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:31,150
And then, angle FAC is going to be congruent to angle ABD

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,150
because they're corresponding angles

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,320
Angle FAC is congruent to angle ABD and

54
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,390
they are corresponding angles

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,740
So, in the first time we view this as the transversal AC

56
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,550
is a transversal of AB and CD which are parallel lines

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,700
Now AB is a transversal and BD and AC are the parallel lines

58
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,320
And obviously if this is congruent to that and that is congruent

59
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,270
to that then these two would have to be congruent to each other

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,530
So, we see that if we have opposite angles that are congruent

61
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,450
then or if we have a parallelogram then the opposite angles

62
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,390
are going to be congruent
