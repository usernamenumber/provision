1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
   

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,290
They want us to subtract these
two numbers and simplify the

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,040
answer and write as
a mixed number.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,370
We're going to do it two ways.

5
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,150
The first way, we're going to
turn both of these into

6
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,650
improper fractions and
see what we get.

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,850
And then the other way, we're
going to subtract the whole

8
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,740
number parts and then subtract
the fraction parts and see

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,690
what we get.

10
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,420
So if we turn them both into
improper fractions, let's

11
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,070
first turn 8 and 2/3 into
an improper fraction.

12
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,380
So it has 3 in the
denominator, and

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,940
3 times 8 is 24.

14
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,210
24 plus 2 is 26.

15
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,760
So 8 and 2/3 is the same
thing as 26/3.

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,490
And 5 and 5/6, so we're
going to subtract.

17
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,200
We're going to have 6
in the denominator.

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,130
6 times 5 is 30.

19
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,420
30 plus 5 is 35.

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,990
So this simplifies as an
improper fraction to 35/6.

21
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,610
Now to subtract, we have to
have a common denominator.

22
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,420
3 and 6 are not the same
denominator, but they are both

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,830
divisible into 6.

24
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,280
6 is the least common
multiple of 3 and 6.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,590
So let's turn them both
into something over 6.

26
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,390
So the 26/3, if we put it over
6, to go from 3 to 6 in the

27
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,730
denominator, we have to multiply
by 2, so we have to

28
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,240
do the same thing in
the numerator.

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,220
We have to multiply 2 times
26, which is 52.

30
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,300
So it's going to be 52/6 minus--
we don't have to

31
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,920
change this one here
in orange.

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,890
It's already over 6-- minus
36/6, which is going to be

33
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,170
equal to-- what's 52 minus 35?

34
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,760
Let's see, if you add 5
to 35, you get to 40.

35
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,980
15 will get you to 50, and
so we want 2 more, so

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,310
it's going to be 17.

37
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,670
So it's 17/6.

38
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,730
This is as an improper
fraction.

39
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,590
Now, if we want to write it as
a mixed number, we say how

40
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,910
many times does 6 go into 17?

41
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,900
Well, 6 times 2 is 12,
so that works.

42
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,210
6 times 3 is too big.

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,990
It's 18, so it goes
in two times.

44
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,110
Now, if you take it into it
two times, you get 12, and

45
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,890
then you have 5 left
over, right?

46
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,610
To go from 12 to 17, you need
5 so you have 5 left over.

47
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,669
You could say 6 goes into 17 two
times, remainder 5, so 17

48
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,600
over 6 is 2 and 5/6.

49
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,500
And we're done!

50
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,620
Now this is kind of the improper
fraction route, which

51
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,160
it'll always work.

52
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,940
It'll always work.

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,260
Sometimes it's easier
or harder, but

54
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,060
it will always work.

55
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,570
Actually, either route will
always work, but I tend to do

56
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,940
it this way.

57
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,910
Let's do it separating out
the whole number and the

58
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,260
fractional parts.

59
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,886
So first we could view
this as 8 minus 5.

60
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:34,940
So let's do this.

61
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,180
8 minus 5-- that's subtracting
the whole number parts-- plus

62
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,780
2/3 minus 5/6.

63
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,300
Now, 8 minus 5, that's easy.

64
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,700
That's 3.

65
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,210
And then over here, though, we
have an interesting-- well,

66
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,800
let's try to work it out.

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,980
Let me do this in a
different color.

68
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,820
We want a common denominator
here, and we already saw that

69
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,520
6 is the least common multiple
of 3 and 5, so we could write

70
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,110
them both with 6 as
the denominator.

71
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,830
5/6 already has 6 as
the denominator.

72
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,930
We don't have to do
anything there.

73
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,380
To go from 3 to 6 in the
denominator here, we have to

74
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,090
multiply by 2, so let's do the
same thing with this 2.

75
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,670
2 times 2 is 4.

76
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,270
So this results in 4/6 minus
5/6, which will give us-- and

77
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,930
we haven't covered it yet--
a negative number.

78
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,780
If you take 5 from 4, you're
going to go below 0.

79
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,620
Now, if we don't want to deal
with that negative number,

80
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,600
what we could do, and this is
essentially the same idea as

81
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,260
regrouping or borrowing,
although they shouldn't call

82
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,380
it borrowing, they should call
it taking, is we can

83
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,560
rewrite this 3.

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,110
That's why this can get a little
bit tricky sometimes.

85
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,060
Let me do it over here.

86
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,790
Let me draw a line here so we
don't get the two ways of

87
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,160
doing the problem confused.

88
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,820
We can rewrite the 3 as 2 plus
1, but instead of writing it

89
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,120
as 1, we could write
it as 6/6, right?

90
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,830
6 over 6 is 1 plus 2 is 3.

91
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,500
And then, if we add it
to these guys, so

92
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,250
plus 4/6 minus 5/6.

93
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,130
Now, what happened
by doing that?

94
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,530
Well, if we throw this 6/6 into
the mix and then we had

95
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,970
the 4/6 and then we subtract
the 5 from it, then we're

96
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,250
going to have a positive number,
so let's to do it.

97
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,110
So we get this 2 right here.

98
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:30,550
So it's 2 plus, and then over
6, we have 6 plus 4--

99
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,120
let me write it.

100
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,140
6 plus 4 minus 5.

101
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,610
Now, what's this
going to equal?

102
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,955
This is going to be this
2 and what over 6?

103
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:43,220
   

104
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,070
6 plus 4 is 10 minus 5 is 5.

105
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,870
So you have 2 and 5/6, which
is exactly what we

106
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,130
got the other way.

107
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,267
