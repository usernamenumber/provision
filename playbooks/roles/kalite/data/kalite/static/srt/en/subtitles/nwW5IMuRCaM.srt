1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,090
We're on problem 8.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,070
How many more degrees of arc are
there in 1/4 of a circle

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,020
than 1/5 of a circle?

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,730
All right.

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,400
So 1/4 of a circle has
how many degrees?

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,240
So it's 1/4 times the degrees
in a circle, so that's 360

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,460
degrees which is
equal to what?

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,860
What's 360 divided by 4?

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,510
That's 90 degrees.

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:23,840
Right?

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,580
1/4 times 360 is 90 degrees.

13
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,200
So that's 1/4 of a circle.

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,090
1/5 fifth of a circle times
360 it equals what?

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,850
360 divided by 5 which is
equal to 72, right?

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,490
35 right.

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,090
72.

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,870
So that equals 72 degrees.

19
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,470
That's in 1/5 of a circle.

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,560
And they're asking, how many
more degrees of an arc are

21
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,890
there in 1/4 of a
circle than 1/5?

22
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,760
So what's 90 minus 72?

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,020
That's 18 degrees.

24
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,120
That's answer B.

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,100
Next problem.

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,220
Problem 9.

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,140
Let me draw the axes.

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,410
   

29
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:18,640
And then they have a curve that
looks something like this

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,080
which goes to the origin and
looks like it's symmetric.

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,040
It goes like this and
it keeps going.

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,715
And they tell us this is the
point minus 6 common 0.

33
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:37,580
And they tell us-- well
do they tell us?

34
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,710
They have this point and they
say that this is 1.

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,370
   

36
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,920
This is the point 7
comma 6 up here.

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,480
7 comma 6.

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,360
And they're saying that
this is 6 comma 0.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,560
Although they don't draw a
little point there, which

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
makes me a little suspicious.

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,550
Maybe they just forgot.

42
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,060
Based on the graph of the
function f above, what are the

43
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,430
values of x for which
f of x is negative?

44
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,930
So when is f of x negative?

45
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,850
Well, it's negative
in this range.

46
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,280
From here to here.

47
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,100
That's when it's negative.

48
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,860
So what values of x
are its negative?

49
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,470
Well, at 0 it's 0, so
0 doesn't count.

50
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,300
So x has to be greater than 0.

51
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,510
Because we can't count 0,
because at 0 the function is

52
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,040
actually 0 and we want to know
negative and 0 isn't a

53
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,550
negative number.

54
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,450
And what does x have
to be less than?

55
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,240
Well this is point 6.

56
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,020
So x has to be less than 6.

57
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,640
So that is choice B.

58
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,380
Not too hard, huh?

59
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,010
You just had to say, when does
it dip below the x-axis?

60
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,370
Well when x is between
0 and 6.

61
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,620
Next problem.

62
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,540
   

63
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,340
Let me switch colors.

64
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,230
In the figure above-- oh what do
I have to draw-- the figure

65
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,910
above shows the dimensions of
a pedestal constructed of 4

66
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,610
layers of marble.

67
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,440
Each layer is a rectangular
solid that is 1 foot high and

68
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,530
has a square base.

69
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,910
How many cubic feet of marble--
yes I have to draw

70
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:09,616
this-- so at the top I have
cube that looks like that.

71
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:18,630
It's 1 by 1 by 1, then they
have another marble-- that

72
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,330
looks like this.

73
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,280
It's 1 high and then, of
course, it's 2 wide.

74
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,700
Right, so let's just start doing
the volumes immediately.

75
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,230
The volume of the
top one is 1.

76
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,230
The volume of the second
one is what?

77
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,730
It's 2 by 2 by 1.

78
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,360
It's 2 times 2 times
1 which equals 4.

79
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,704
The volume of the next
one is what?

80
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:42,670
It goes out like this.

81
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,460
   

82
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,570
It's 3 by 3 by 1, right?

83
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,710
So what is its volume?

84
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,982
3 by 3 by 1.

85
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:58,870
So it equals 9.

86
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,880
I think you start seeing
the pattern here.

87
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,820
And then finally we have
the fourth one.

88
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,390
The fourth one looks
like that.

89
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,180
I'm not going to draw it fully,
you get the point.

90
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,250
It's going to be 4 by 4 by 1.

91
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,970
Which is equal to 16.

92
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,480
So the volume of all of them
combined is 1 plus 4 plus 9

93
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,980
plus 16 that's 5
plus 9 plus 16.

94
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,440
14 plus 16.

95
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,790
That equals 30 and
that's choice C.

96
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,290
Next problem.

97
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:41,890
Problem 11.

98
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:48,780
If x and y are positive integers
and 4 to the 2x is

99
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,600
equal to 2y, what is
x in terms of y?

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,150
Whenever you see something like
this-- when you see a 4

101
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,550
and a 2-- just convert them
all to the same base.

102
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,070
So how do you write 4 as 2 to
some power is 4, right?

103
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,700
How do you write 4 as an
exponential expression with 2?

104
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,240
My brain is malfunctioning.

105
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,870
Well that's the same thing
is 2 squared, right?

106
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,695
So that's 2 squared times 2 to
the x is equal to 2 the y.

107
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:19,280
And we add exponents when
we multiply two numbers

108
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,965
with the same base.

109
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:24,690
So that's 2 to the 2 plus x is
equal to y-- sorry is equal to

110
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,350
2 to the y.

111
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,780
So 2 plus x must equal y.

112
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,230
And they do this all the time
on the SAT so you should

113
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,190
really-- these are easy problems
if you just remember

114
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,210
to do this and remember
exponent rules.

115
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,810
And they want x in terms of y.

116
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,230
So subtract 2 from both sides.

117
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,250
You get x is equal
to y minus 2.

118
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,570
And that is choice A.

119
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,400
Next problem.

120
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,650
Problem 12.

121
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,960
If the degree measures of the
angles of a triangle are the

122
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,840
ratio of 2 to 3 to 4, how many
degrees does the measure of

123
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,760
the largest angle exceed the
measure of the smallest angle?

124
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,090
So let's say that the smallest
angle is-- I don't know--

125
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,920
let's say the smallest
angle is 2x.

126
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,130
Then the middle angle
is going to be 3x.

127
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,870
And then the largest angle
is going to be 4x.

128
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,380
If I were to draw a triangle
it would look like this.

129
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,180
2x, 3x, 4x.

130
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,625
4x, not 45.

131
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,310
4x.

132
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,780
And they all have to add up to
180 because they're the angles

133
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,050
of a triangle.

134
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,270
So 2x plus 3x x plus 4x
is going to equal 180.

135
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,870
And what is this?

136
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,200
This is 2 plus 3 which
is 5, plus 4 is 9.

137
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,940
So 9x is equal to 180.

138
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,990
x is equal to 20.

139
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,640
So the smallest angle is going
to be 40 degrees and the

140
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,680
largest angle is going to
be 80 degrees, right?

141
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,770
4 times 20.

142
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,240
And they want to know, by how
many degrees does the measure

143
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,500
of the largest angle
exceed the measure

144
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,340
the smallest angle?

145
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,180
So it's 80 minus 40.

146
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,360
The largest minus the smallest.
80 minus 40 is equal

147
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,130
to 40 and that is choice C.

148
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,380
Next problem.

149
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,974
   

150
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:16,910
Switch colors.

151
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,920
Problem 13.

152
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,150
The rate for a telephone call
between city A and city B is

153
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:33,400
$0.50 for the first minute and
$0.30 for each minute or

154
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,860
portion thereof.

155
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,310
So $0.50 for the first minute
and then every extra minute it

156
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,210
charges $0.30.

157
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,920
So $0.30 for every
extra minute.

158
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,630
So if n is the number of
minutes-- the first minute is

159
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,160
there, so it's every minute
above the first minute-- so

160
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,370
that's n minus 1, right?

161
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,590
If you do it for 2 minutes you
get charged $0.50, and then 2

162
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,130
minus 1 is 1, so then
plus $0.30.

163
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,150
And this is for n minutes--
I'm assuming n is minutes.

164
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,860
Which of the following functions
describes the cost,

165
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,160
in dollars, of a phone call
between the two cities that

166
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,780
lasts for n minutes, if n
is a positive integer?

167
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,460
All right, well.

168
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,600
What did I write here?

169
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,950
What choice is that?

170
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,980
That is choice D.

171
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,070
And once again, how did
I think about this?

172
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,890
If I say the cost of n minutes--
it's a function of n

173
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,570
minutes-- it equals, well
the first minute

174
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,980
is going to be $0.50.

175
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,680
And then for every minute after
the first minute-- so

176
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,210
every minute after the first
minute can be represented by n

177
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,370
minus 1, right?

178
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,299
The second minute-- so 2 minus
1-- I get charged 1 minute

179
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:37,770
after the first minute, if
I speak for 2 minutes.

180
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,720
For every minute after the first
minute, I'm going to get

181
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,840
charged $0.30.

182
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,750
So that's how we did it.

183
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,169
Problem 14.

184
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,750
I don't know if I have--
actually let me just do this

185
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,840
next video because I have to do
just three more problems so

186
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,740
I might as well just
do a video for it.

187
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,130
I'll see you.
