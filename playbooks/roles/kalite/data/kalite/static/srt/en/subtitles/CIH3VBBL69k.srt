99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are in the Brooklyn Musuem with the George Bellows Pennsylvania Station Excavation

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Circa 1907-08.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Bellows is I think a really fabulous painter and a member of a group of painters

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who are usually reffered to as the "Ash Can"

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Where did they get that name?

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a pretty nasty name

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well you know their work was seen to be sotty and dusty and gritty and dark

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What they were was a small group of realists that was known as the eight

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This was a group of American artist that focused in New York for the most part.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They painted the world around them

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It was a fairly radical idea but they didn't do it like the American impresssionists

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Who mimicked the colors and sort of the light of Paris

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You know this was really about New York at its really industrial moment

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When New York itself was beginning to flex its muscles and really putting itself on the map.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This was the first decade of the 20th century

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So not looking back at Europe to generate its style

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But trying to generate an American style

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's funny to me how American artists are always in dialogue with Europe

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And of course this is also but just not as clearly in the directness of that reference

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is just amazing as a document to me of what 7th avenue is like

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is a moment when the technonlogy was steam and you had these steam powered diggers

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Excavating in this enourmous area in order to put Pennsylvania station here

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you actually sort of see the city rise beyond this new industrial city

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You know there is something that is almost daunting like about this

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You know you've got...it's the pit of hell in a sense

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Cause we've got fires burning and smoke...

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But you know images of industrial scenes always evoke those kinds of scenes.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But this is creating a kind of dramatic beauty out of umm this grit

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Out of this filth really

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You know it's soo stark because you have the sooted snow below

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You have you know sort of the terrible
