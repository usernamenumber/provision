1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,680
We're on problem number 10.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,330
And it says, in a certain class,
one student is to be

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,600
selected at random to read.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,040
What is the probability
that a boy will read?

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,550
OK.

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,940
So I guess we can assume that
everyone in the class can

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,700
read, because they don't really
talk much about that.

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,580
And I think we can assume that
everyone in the class is

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,030
either a boy or a girl, that
we don't have any third

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,040
genders in this reality.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,370
OK.

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,130
So what are the statements?

14
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,690
So we essentially just want to
know, what's the probability

15
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,710
we pick a boy in the
class, right?

16
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,850
Whether or not they read is
kind of -- so what's the

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,490
probably that we pick a boy?

18
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,170
So to figure out whether we're
going to pick a boy, we have

19
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,790
to know, essentially,
what percentage of

20
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,080
the class are boys.

21
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,120
So what are the statements
they give us?

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,200
Statement number one is,
2/3 of the students in

23
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,950
the class are boys.

24
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,070
Well, that's just what
I asked for.

25
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,410
2/3 boys.

26
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,230
Well, that exactly tells
me the probability

27
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,050
that I pick a boy.

28
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,080
It's 2 out of 3, or 66.66
repeating percentage.

29
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,780
So this alone is enough.

30
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,740
So let's see if statement
two is at all useful.

31
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,239
Statement two.

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,090
10 of the students in
the class are girls.

33
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,800
10 girls.

34
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,200
Well, this, especially
by itself, is a

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,680
fairly useless statement.

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,400
Because maybe there are 10
girls, maybe there's 0 boys,

37
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,540
in which case this probability
would be 0.

38
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,770
Maybe there are 10 girls and
10 boys, in which case this

39
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,080
would be 50%.

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,700
So 10 girls, by itself, really
doesn't tell us much.

41
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,660
So in this case, all we
need is statement one.

42
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,940
And statement two alone
is not sufficient.

43
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,870
So that is what?

44
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,540
I always forget these.

45
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,670
a, statement one alone is
sufficient, but statement two

46
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,450
is not sufficient.

47
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,470
That's a.

48
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,850
Problem 11.

49
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,930
Let me switch colors to green.

50
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,880
Problem 11.

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:56,540
If 5x plus 3y is equal to 17.

52
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,940
They want to know what x is
equal to. x is equal to what?

53
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,010
OK.

54
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,170
The first statement
they give us is, x

55
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,420
is a positive integer.

56
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,889
   

57
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,070
Well, that doesn't
help us solve x.

58
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,460
I mean, x could be any
positive integer.

59
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,180
They gave us no constraints
on y.

60
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,590
So we really could pick x
as any positive integer.

61
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,030
So that doesn't help
us with that.

62
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,670
Statement number two is,
y is equal to 4x.

63
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,410
Well, this is a little
bit more interesting.

64
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,030
y is equal to 4x.

65
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,880
Well, here we could substitute
this in for y, and

66
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,480
then solve for x.

67
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,040
And remember, in these problems,
you really don't

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,830
have to solve for x.

69
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,230
You just have to know
that you could.

70
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,300
So I, immediately just
recognizing it, I could say,

71
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,200
well, this is all I need
to do to solve for x.

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,340
And just to prove it to
you, let's do it.

73
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,220
Although you shouldn't have
to do this on the GMAT.

74
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,820
So 5x plus 3 times y,
where y is equal to

75
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,130
4x, is equal to 17.

76
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,590
So you get 5x plus 12x
is equal to 17, or

77
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,020
17x is equal to 17.

78
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,630
x is equal to 1.

79
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,400
So all you needed was
statement two.

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,640
And statement one was
fairly useless.

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,260
So that is b, statement two
alone is sufficient, but

82
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,570
statement one alone
is not sufficient.

83
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:19,160
Problem 12.

84
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:27,900
So they're asking whether the
product jkmn equal 1?

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,650
Does that equal 1?

86
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,250
So the first statement they give
us-- let me scroll down a

87
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,910
little bit-- the first statement
they give us is, jk

88
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,836
over mn is equal to 1.

89
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:46,020
Let's see, we could do a little
algebraic manipulation.

90
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,590
Multiply both sides by mn, you
get jk is equal to mn, right?

91
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,500
I just multiplied both
sides by mn.

92
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,770
But that really doesn't
help me.

93
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,180
I mean, that just tells
me that this part is

94
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,520
equal to this part.

95
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,710
But it doesn't really tell me
that when you multiply them

96
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,880
all together, you equal 1.

97
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,700
Let's see if statement two
is it all helpful.

98
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:16,910
Statement two tells us that j is
equal to 1 over k, and m is

99
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,399
equal to 1 over n.

100
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,370
So let's see if we could do
some interesting algebraic

101
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:21,920
manipulations.

102
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,230
Let's see.

103
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,950
Multiply both sides
of this by k.

104
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:29,350
You get jk is equal to 1.

105
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,450
And do the same thing here.

106
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,180
Multiply both sides times n.

107
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,080
You get mn is equal to 1.

108
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,230
Well, this is useful, because
if j times k is equal to 1,

109
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:47,560
and m times n is equal to 1-- so
the whole product is going

110
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,660
to be 1 times 1.

111
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,640
Well, that's definitely going
to be equal to 1.

112
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,270
So using just the information in
statement two, we were able

113
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,510
to verify that j times
k, times m, times

114
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,750
n is equal to 1.

115
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,060
So this is all we needed.

116
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,660
Statement one was
fairly useless.

117
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,480
So that is what?

118
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,680
That is b, statement two is
sufficient, and statement one

119
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,543
alone is not sufficient.

120
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:13,670
Let's do problem number 13.

121
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:18,060
A certain expressway has exits
J, K, L, and M, in that order.

122
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,940
All right.

123
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,310
My guess is that it's going
to be some type of

124
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,560
a number line problem.

125
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,730
   

126
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,097
So let's see.

127
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:34,980
The exits J, K, L, and M.

128
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,230
   

129
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,140
That's the highway
in that order.

130
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,220
And then they say, what is
the road distance from

131
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,990
exit K to exit L.

132
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,870
So they want to know this
distance right here.

133
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,130
That's what we have to see, if
we have sufficient data to

134
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,290
figure out.

135
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,920
So statement one.

136
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,870
They tell us the road distance
from exit J to L is 21.

137
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,540
So we can just write that in.

138
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,870
So line segment to JL
is equal to 21.

139
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,320
So that tells us that this
distance right here is 21.

140
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,730
Well, that by itself-- because
we don't know where K is

141
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,080
within that 21 miles-- so that
alone doesn't help us.

142
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,850
Let's see if statement two
helps figure out things.

143
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,160
The road distance from
K to M is 26.

144
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,400
K to M is equal to 26.

145
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,870
So this distance
is equal to 26.

146
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,270
This doesn't really help us at
all, because if you think

147
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,800
about it, the distance between
K and M is fixed, right?

148
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,605
But K could be here, which
would put M here.

149
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:43,910
   

150
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,370
And then, of course, that would
change the KL distance.

151
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,860
Or K could be really close to
L, which would put M here.

152
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,740
   

153
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,140
M is definitely 26 miles, or
whatever it is, 26 kilometers

154
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,270
further from K.

155
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,870
So we don't know where K is.

156
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,400
This second constraint still
doesn't tell us where K is,

157
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,610
relative to-- is it closer
to J, is it closer

158
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,970
to L, we don't know.

159
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,580
So both of them combined
are useless.

160
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,310
So that is e.

161
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,350
Problem number 14.

162
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,270
Unless I missed something.

163
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,890
Problem number 14.

164
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,350
Is the integer k
a prime number?

165
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,600
So k prime.

166
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,890
   

167
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,660
So the first statement
they give us, is that

168
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,890
2k is equal to 6.

169
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,950
Well, we could just do a
little algebra here.

170
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,780
Divide both sides by 2, and
we get k is equal to 3.

171
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,440
And 3 is prime.

172
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,990
So this is good, that's
all we needed.

173
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,560
We're done.

174
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,710
Well, let's see what
two gives us.

175
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,320
Maybe two also gives us that.

176
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,650
Let's see, two says that
1 is less than k, which

177
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,950
is less than 6.

178
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,220
Well, this is kind of useless,
because this is just telling

179
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,080
us that k-- we know it's an
integer, because they say, is

180
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,730
the integer k a prime number?--
but k could be 2, in

181
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,490
which case it wouldn't be--
well, 2 is prime-- but k could

182
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,780
be 4, in which case
it's not prime.

183
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,250
Or it could still be 3,
so we don't know.

184
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,010
So this is kind of useless.

185
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,690
So all we need is statement one,
and statement two is not

186
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,160
sufficient.

187
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,630
So that's a.

188
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,375
Problem number 15.

189
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,625
Let me switch colors.

190
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,900
   

191
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:29,350
OK, so they've drawn some
type of x, y axes.

192
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,280
That's the y-axis.

193
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,809
That's is the x-axis.

194
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:36,789
   

195
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,039
All right.

196
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,486
   

197
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:46,250
x, y, and then they have
this, they drew 1, 1.

198
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,460
And then they labeled the
quadrants, quadrant I,

199
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,080
quadrant II, quadrant III.

200
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,970
We're doing roman numerals.

201
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,740
And they say quadrant IV.

202
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,620
And they say if ab
does not equal 0.

203
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,870
So a times b does not equal 0,
which essentially tells us

204
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,700
that neither a or b-- neither
a nor b-- is 0.

205
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,090
OK.

206
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,360
ab does not equal 0.

207
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,310
In what quadrant of the
coordinate system

208
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,190
does point a, b lie?

209
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,890
So they want to know
where a, b is.

210
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,520
So quadrant of a, b.

211
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:23,830
OK.

212
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,990
Let's look at the data.

213
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,390
All right.

214
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,560
So we know a, b-- well, we know
it's not along the axes,

215
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,610
because if one of these were
0, then we'd be along the

216
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,370
axes, if either a or b were 0.

217
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:44,480
It says, this is interesting,
it says b, a

218
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,400
is in quadrant IV.

219
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,470
b, a.

220
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,370
So this is interesting.

221
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,230
So quadrant IV tells us what?

222
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,760
If something is in quadrant
IV-- let me do that in a

223
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,210
different color.

224
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,290
This is, I think, the first
interesting problem we've

225
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,230
encountered.

226
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,290
Quadrant IV tells us that x is
greater than 0, right, because

227
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,920
we're in the positive x-axis.

228
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,720
And tells is that y is less than
0, right, because we're

229
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,630
in the negative y-axis, right?

230
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,770
We're here.

231
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,570
So if b, a is in quadrant IV, in
this case b is playing the

232
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,590
role of x, right?

233
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,980
This is the point b, a.

234
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,140
So that tells us that b has
to be greater than 0.

235
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,680
b is greater than 0.

236
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,970
And this is telling us that a,
because it's playing the

237
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,300
function of the y coordinate
here, a has to be less than 0.

238
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,100
   

239
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:42,290
So if we talk about the point a
comma b, well, now we're in

240
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,630
a situation where we know
that a is less than 0.

241
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,680
So we know that x
is less than 0.

242
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,120
And we know that b is
greater than 0.

243
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,670
And now b is playing
the y coordinate.

244
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,410
So we know that y is
greater than 0.

245
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,160
So if x is less than 0, we're
in the [? plot ?]

246
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,770
negative x, and y is greater
than 0 over here.

247
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,930
So a comma b is going to have
to be there some place.

248
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,090
So statement number one was
all we needed to know that

249
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,790
it's going to be
in quadrant II.

250
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,220
So statement number
one is good.

251
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,990
Now let's take a look at
statement number two.

252
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,650
Well, statement number two is
kind of the same thing.

253
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,210
So we actually don't even
have to work it out.

254
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,770
That statement two alone is
also sufficient, just

255
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,385
eyeballing it, but let
me work it out.

256
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:26,320
But we can apply the
exact same logic.

257
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:35,160
Statement two says a comma
minus b in quadrant III.

258
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,040
Well, if we're in quadrant III,
that means that x is less

259
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,280
than 0, right?

260
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,370
And a plays the x role.

261
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,350
So this tells us that
a is less than 0.

262
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,530
And quadrant III tells us that
y is also less than 0.

263
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,610
And the y coordinate
here is minus b.

264
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,240
So it tells us that minus
b is less than 0.

265
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,410
This point is minus b, so minus
b has to be less than 0,

266
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,240
which tells us-- you can
multiply both sides by

267
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,270
negative 1, or divide-- and
that tells us that b is

268
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,640
greater than 0.

269
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,300
So you get the same information
from statement two

270
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,000
as you get from statement one,
that a is less than 0, and b

271
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,890
as greater than 0.

272
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,250
And then you can use that to
figure out that a, b has to be

273
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,220
in quadrant II.

274
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,230
So each of them independently
are sufficient

275
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,290
to answer the question.

276
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,270
So the answer is d.

277
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,250
See you in the next video.

278
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:26,500
