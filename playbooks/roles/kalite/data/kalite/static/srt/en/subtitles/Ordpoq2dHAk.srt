1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,250
I want to follow up the last
video on the Sn2 ring opening

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,300
of the cyclohexene oxide.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,560
Because the way I explained
it, it might have been a

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,890
little non-intuitive.

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,800
Because when we first learned
about Sn2 and Sn1 reactions,

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,110
we said, well if you have an
aprotic solvent with an OK

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,690
leaving group, but a really good
nucleophile, you'll have

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,940
an Sn2 reaction.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,090
But if you have a protic solvent
with an excellent

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:39,130
leaving group and a weak
nucelophile, then that would

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,860
lead you to an Sn1 reaction.

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,900
All of the ingredients that I
showed you in the last video

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,250
actually were more in
this direction.

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,320
This was actually an acid
catalyzed reaction, so it was

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,430
definitely protic.

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,020
And then this ring is
strained right here.

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,840
This epoxide ring.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,700
And we already protonated this
oxygen, so it was a good

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,820
leaving group.

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,280
And clearly, the water, the
H2O right here, is a weak

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,150
nucleophile.

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,940
So if we just went off of the
checklist that we learned

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,750
about when we just explored the
differences between Sn1

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,270
and Sn2 reactions, we probably
would have predicted an Sn1

26
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,980
reaction here.

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,450
We probably would have said the
first step would have been

28
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,280
that this bond just broke on
its own, and this guy just

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,750
left, forming a carbocation.

30
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,330
And only then would the water,
the weak nucleophile, would

31
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,510
have attacked the carbon.

32
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,920
In that case, it could have
attacked from either side.

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,710
Because all of a sudden it would
lose its handedness,

34
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,670
this carbon right here.

35
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,130
But everything I've read-- and
I've actually never performed

36
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,710
this reaction in the
chemistry lab.

37
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,680
But everything I've read
says that this is the

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,360
reaction that occurs.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,380
That you actually have this,
I guess you could call it

40
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,160
stereospecificity.

41
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,150
The trans version is actually
what predominates.

42
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,730
And actually what is
going on is an Sn2.

43
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,130
So my best explanation is that
this is really more of, you

44
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,520
could call it an Sn2
like reaction.

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,640
Because it really meets the
checklist more for an Sn1 in

46
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,270
terms of what the
reactions are.

47
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,160
But because the end product
is actually selective, you

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,090
actually end up with the trans,
as opposed to both the

49
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,290
cis and the trans.

50
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,630
We're assuming that an Sn2 type

51
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,270
reaction must have occurred.

52
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,540
But I really wanted to
make this clear.

53
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,870
Because it really kind of goes
against the grain of our

54
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,370
checklist of predicting whether
an Sn1 or an Sn2

55
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,150
reaction would occur.

56
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,730
The reason why, at least in my
mind, I think that the Sn1

57
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,930
reaction maybe didn't occur is,
in order for it to occur,

58
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,570
this carbocation
needs to form.

59
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,370
And that carbocation
is secondary.

60
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,530
It's not tertiary.

61
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,550
So it's maybe just not
quite stable enough.

62
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,880
Now Sn1 reactions can
occur with epoxides.

63
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,380
I'll show you two examples.

64
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,450
So if I have-- let me draw
two examples here.

65
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,890
So this is ethane.

66
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,500
If I just did a double bond
here, it would be ethene.

67
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,640
But if I have these bonded
to an oxygen,

68
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,403
this is ethylene oxide.

69
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:14,460
   

70
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,100
And once again, if this was an
alkene, it would be called

71
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,260
either ethene-- that's actually
the official name,

72
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,780
but some people call
it ethylene.

73
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,880
And so the common name
for this is ethylene.

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,300
Actually I spelled it wrong.

75
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,960
It's ethylene, not with
the-- ethylene oxide.

76
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,930
I've even seen on the web a
couple of times, people call

77
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,410
this ethene oxide.

78
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,140
Which, in some ways, would
be more consistent.

79
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,920
Let's say on one hand, we have
ethene oxide, and let's say on

80
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,060
the other hand, we
have something

81
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,310
that looks like this.

82
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,020
   

83
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,130
Let me try my best to draw it.

84
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,680
We have something that
looks like this.

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,180
And so this part, if we just
look at the main chain.

86
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,970
You could either view
this as a propane.

87
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,100
Or having three carbons.

88
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,170
1, 2, 3.

89
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,030
And then a methyl breaking
off of it.

90
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,310
But this y shape, where you
have four carbons here, is

91
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,625
usually called isobutyl.

92
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,500
So you could call this
isobutylene oxide.

93
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,399
So let's call this isobutylene
oxide.

94
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,149
That's what you're more
likely to see.

95
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,279
Isobutylene oxide.

96
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,860
And remember, they
just pretend like

97
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,200
this is a double bond.

98
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,950
That's where we get the
isobutylene oxide.

99
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,240
But then to make it clear that
it's really not a double bond,

100
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,660
that there's really an oxygen
in there, it's really not an

101
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,850
alkene, you put the
oxide there.

102
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,680
Now let's think about the
different reactions that might

103
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,270
occur if we have a nucleophile
in either situation.

104
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:46,470
So if we have a nucleophile
over here for the ethylene

105
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,820
oxide, either of these carbons
are primary carbons.

106
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,430
So if you have a carbon
right here.

107
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,830
Let me draw all of its bonds.

108
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,930
It's bonded to one
other carbon.

109
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,840
It's bonded to a hydrogen, and
another hydrogen right there.

110
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,380
So it's a primary carbon.

111
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,110
It would not be a stable
carbocation.

112
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,530
So in this case, you would
definitely predict that an Sn2

113
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,310
reaction would have to occur
with this epoxide.

114
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,900
That the nucleophile would
attack back here.

115
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,470
And then this electron would be
taken back by the oxygen.

116
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,750
And that would open the ring.

117
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,900
So this would be an
Sn2 situation.

118
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,220
And in my mind, this
is pretty clear.

119
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,720
But in this situation,
you do have a primary

120
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,500
carbon right here.

121
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,190
It's only bonded to
one other carbon.

122
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,850
But over here, you have
a tertiary carbon.

123
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,460
It's bonded to 1,
2, 3 carbons.

124
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,390
So this would be a stable
carbocation.

125
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,980
So in this circumstance, you
would actually expect that

126
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,130
this epoxide ring is so
strained, that the first step

127
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,410
is that the oxygen would
just take the electron.

128
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,530
The oxygen would just
take the electron.

129
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,480
And then you're left
with something

130
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,620
that looks like this.

131
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,380
Let me do it in the same
colors, so it's clear.

132
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,640
You would be left
with something

133
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,680
that looks like this.

134
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,280
And now, since it took the
electron, just like that.

135
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,240
Or actually, maybe let
me take a step back.

136
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,450
It has to be very good
leaving group.

137
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,430
It wouldn't necessarily just
take the electron right there.

138
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,660
The first step in order to make
this a good leaving group

139
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,720
would be if you maybe had a
water around, or something

140
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,260
that it could take, or some type
of acid, that it could

141
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,740
take a hydrogen proton from.

142
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,120
So the first step is it would
take a hydrogen proton.

143
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,170
Let me do this a little
bit neater.

144
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,600
It would take a hydrogen
proton.

145
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,530
So it would give an electron to
a hydrogen proton, so that

146
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,560
it becomes a good
leaving group.

147
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,150
So now our molecule
looks like this.

148
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,910
Do it in the same colors.

149
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,130
Our molecule will
look like that.

150
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,960
That's our carbon.

151
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,720
And now this is an oxygen
bonded to a hydrogen.

152
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,510
And now this has a
positive charge.

153
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,880
This now will just be a water.

154
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,920
I won't draw it anymore.

155
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,070
And now this is an excellent
leaving group.

156
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,060
Tertiary carbon.

157
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,330
This is classic Sn1.

158
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,830
Classic Sn1 reaction.

159
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,270
So this guy can essentially
leave. And then we are left

160
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,750
with down here-- let me
draw it over here.

161
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,580
We're left with something that
will look like this.

162
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,930
We have our carbon
bonded, not to

163
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,300
hydrogens, to other carbons.

164
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,230
So these are carbons
over here.

165
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,960
And then this carbon is
bonded to this OH.

166
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,750
We now have an alcohol.

167
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,390
And this is now a carbocation.

168
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,900
And now this is ready to be
attacked by even a weak

169
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,330
nucleophile.

170
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,540
Even a weak nucleophile
could attack this.

171
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,220
So when you have a tertiary
carbon in your epoxide ring,

172
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,100
look for an Sn1 reaction.

173
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,470
But if you have anything less,
as far as I can tell, based on

174
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,010
the reactions that I've looked
at in multiple books-- if you

175
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,530
have secondary or primary
carbons, it seems like Sn2 is

176
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,860
going to be more likely to
break your epoxide ring.

177
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:57,999
