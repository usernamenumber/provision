00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:03,233
I told you in the last video on calendar notation that

2
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:08,367
regardless of whether you're using BC/AD or BCE and CE,

3
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:11,033
that there is no year zero,

4
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:16,167
that we had 1BC and then we had that theoretical birth of Jesus

5
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:22,767
and most historians don't think he was born right exactly on 1 January 1AD

6
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,567
but there is no year zero

7
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:31,967
right after that you go from 31 December 1BC to 1 January 1AD.

8
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:33,633
There's no year zero.

9
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,300
And despite the fact that I emphasized in the last video,

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,033
I didn't take that into consideration when I calculated

11
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:47,700
how many years there were between Plato's birth and Columbus' discovering of the New Wolrd

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,233
The reason why I didn't take that into consideration

13
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:57,767
is that the year 1492, whether you want to call it AD 1492, Anno Domini 1492,

14
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:01,567
whether you wanna call it that or you wanna call it 1492 in the Common Era

15
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:07,500
it's not 1492 years since the theoretical birth of Jesus,

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,567
which we know is not the actual birth. He was probably born before that.

17
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:15,767
It is 1491 years since the birth of Jesus.

18
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:22,233
And to think about it this way, let's just assume the theoretical date we're talking about here

19
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:26,433
or this theoretical event, this kind of birth of Jesus that our calendars evolve around

20
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:41,433
If we talk about 1 January, let's think about it this way, so 1 January in the Common Era,

21
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:46,300
how long is that since the birth of Jesus? It's not 1 year.

22
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,100
You wouldn't just look at this and say it's been 1 year, because this is theoretically the day that he was born.

23
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,233
So this is zero years, or almost zero years since that theoretical birth of Jesus.

24
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:12,367
Another way to think about it is: How long after 1 January 1BCE, and I can call this AD and I can call this BC,

25
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:14,833
what's the time difference between these two days?

26
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:20,033
So, the way I calculated it before I said "Oh, this is one year after that theoretical birth" that's wrong.

27
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,767
This is during that theoretical birth.

28
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:26,700
The way I did in the last video, I said "Oh, this is one year after, this is one year before

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,967
you add them together and you would get two." But that's wrong.

30
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:30,967
Because there is no year zero.

31
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:41,833
So 1 January 1AD, or 1CE is right over here and then 1 January 1BCE is exactly one year before that.

32
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,900
So there's only one year. One year difference.

33
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,033
And the reason why the math is strange is there is no year zero.

34
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:53,900
If there was a year zero, then my calculation in the last video is correct.

35
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:01,100
So really, the way that you would calculate the time between Plato's birth at 428BC

36
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,167
and Columbus sailing across the Atlantic in 1492

37
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:12,967
you would say "ok, this is 428 years before that theoretical birth of Christ

38
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:18,300
but this isn't 1492 years after that theoretical birth.

39
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,633
This is 1492 minus one. So what you do is you add these two numbers

40
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:28,300
this is 428 before, this is 1492 minus one years after

41
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,433
so you would add them and then subtract one, so the correct answer - this is the correction part

42
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:38,833
it isn't 1920 years between Plato's birth and Columbus.

43
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:42,700
It is, we wanna subtract one from that,

44
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,967
it is 1920 minus one years, so that is 1919 years.

45
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:53,167
The same way that the difference between 1AD and 1BCE,

46
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:57,567
you would say, you could almost do this in positive and negative numbers, you say:

47
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:01,367
"Oh, this is positive one minus negative one and that would give me two, but there is no zero

48
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:06,033
so you just subtract another one, so this is exactly one year difference.

49
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:10,033
Just wanted to clarify that. That's what that "no year zero" stuff does.
