1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,170
We're on problem 66.

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:10,870
And it says what is x squared
minus 4x plus 4, divided by x

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:16,070
squared minus 3x plus 2, reduced
to lowest terms?

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,280
So they probably want us
to factor each of these

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,610
quadratics and see if any of
these terms cancel out.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,060
So let's try to do that.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,550
So the numerator, this seems
pretty easy to factor.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,100
What two numbers when I
multiply them equal 4?

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,910
And when I add them
equal minus 4?

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,010
Well it's minus 2, right?

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,140
Minus 2 and minus
2 is minus 4.

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,930
Minus 2 squared is plus 4.

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:41,380
So this is x minus 2
times x minus 2.

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,820
And you could test it if
you don't believe it.

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,390
Multiply that out.

17
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,580
Divided by, let's see,
what two numbers?

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,250
This looks factorable.

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,490
They both have to be the same
sign because when you multiply

20
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,640
them you get a positive.

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,530
And they're both going to be
negative, because when you add

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,630
them you get a negative 3.

23
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,910
So let's see, minus
2 and minus 1.

24
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,390
Minus 2 times minus
1 is positive 2.

25
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,740
Minus 2 plus minus
1 is minus 3.

26
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:09,140
So x minus 2, times x minus 1.

27
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,810
And if we assume that x is never
equal to 2, because that

28
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,250
would make this expression
undefined, we cancel that out.

29
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,490
You'll learn later that would
cause a hole in the graph,

30
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,240
because the function
is undefined there.

31
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,660
And you're left with minus
2 over minus 1.

32
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,225
And that is choice A.

33
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:28,820
   

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,880
Problem 67.

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,740
This is good practice.

36
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,820
They give a bunch of it.

37
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:42,250
They say what is-- I'll just
write it-- 12a cubed minus 20a

38
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:49,550
squared over 16a squared
plus 8a.

39
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,300
Reduce to lowest terms. So let's
just try to factor out

40
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,270
things on the top and the bottom
and see what happens.

41
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,880
So in the top, in the
numerator-- let me switch

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,980
colors-- both terms are
divisible by 4 and a squared.

43
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,670
So let's fact out
a 4a squared.

44
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,274
So we get 4a squared.

45
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:09,990
   

46
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,490
12 divided by 4 is a 3.

47
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,210
And a cubed divided by
a squared is an a.

48
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,240
So 12a cubed divided by
4a squared is 3a.

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,620
Minus 20-- I could say
plus minus 20--

50
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,750
but you get the idea.

51
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,440
20 divided by 4 is 5.

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,500
And a squared divided by
a squared is just a.

53
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,660
And if you don't believe
this, multiply it out.

54
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,850
4a squared times 3a
is 12a cubed.

55
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,290
And 4a squared times minus
5 is minus 20a squared.

56
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,950
So it works out.

57
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,690
You do the denominator.

58
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,660
Let's see, both of these are
divisible by 8a, so let's

59
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,690
factor that out.

60
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,990
16 divided by 8 is 2.

61
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,950
a squared divided by a is a.

62
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,260
So 16a squared divided
by 8s is 2a.

63
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,540
And if you go the other
way, 8a times 2a

64
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,490
squared is 16a squared.

65
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,960
So it all works out.

66
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,110
Plus 1.

67
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,150
8a times 1 is 8a.

68
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,750
So let's see what we
could do here.

69
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,310
This is becomes a 1.

70
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,820
This becomes a 2.

71
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:15,090
And a squared divided by a, this
becomes a 1 and this just

72
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,340
becomes just an a.

73
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,330
And we're left with a times
3a minus 5, over 2

74
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,290
times 2a plus 1.

75
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:26,920
And let's see.

76
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,520
That is choice D.

77
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,870
I thought maybe they'd want us
to re-multiply this out again.

78
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,350
But that is choice D.

79
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:44,240
Problem 68.

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,280
Oh this is a good one.

81
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,160
I'll just write it.

82
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,490
They want us to multiply
something.

83
00:03:48,490 --> 00:04:00,570
So they say 7z squared plus
7z-- all of that--

84
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,650
over 4z plus 8.

85
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:11,840
Times z squared minus 4-- all of
that-- over z to the third

86
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,649
plus 2z squared plus z equals.

87
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,250
So you must be like oh my god,
I have to multiply all of

88
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,430
these things and I have
to divide them.

89
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,640
But the best thing, I'm
guessing, is to just factor

90
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,070
these out and all sorts of
things will start canceling

91
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,670
out with each other.

92
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,880
And it will turn into a
pretty simple problem.

93
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,280
Let's see, both of these terms
are divisible by 7z.

94
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,960
So le'ts factor that out.

95
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,110
So that top part becomes, 7z
squared divided by 7z, you

96
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,930
just have a z left.

97
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,520
If multiply these, you
get 7z squared.

98
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,950
Plus 1.

99
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,200
If you multiply this out, you
get 7z squared plus 7z.

100
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,450
   

101
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,220
When you multiply fractions,
it's just the numerator times

102
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,300
the numerator, over the
denominator times the

103
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,570
denominator.

104
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,840
So this is times
the numerator.

105
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,020
Z squared minus 4, that's a
squared minus b squared.

106
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,970
So that's z plus 2, a plus b,
times z minus 2, a minus b.

107
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,630
That's just the pattern when I
say all those a's and b's.

108
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,860
So that's z plus 2 times z minus
2, hopefully you can

109
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,660
recognize that at this point.

110
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,930
And then all of that over--
let's see, we can definitely

111
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:24,470
factor out a 4 here, so that's
4 times z plus 2.

112
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,390
8 divided by 4 is 2 times-- so
we can definitely factor out a

113
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:39,020
z here, so we get z times z
squared plus 2z plus 1.

114
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,200
I think we're almost done.

115
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,580
Now we have to factor this.

116
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,840
Let me just rewrite
everything.

117
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:50,520
So this is equal to 7z times
z plus 1, times z plus 2,

118
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,140
times z minus 6.

119
00:05:53,140 --> 00:06:02,400
All of that over 4 times
z plus 2, times z.

120
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,130
And what's this?

121
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,650
This is z plus 1 squared.

122
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,720
Z plus 1 times z plus
1, 1 times 1 is 1,

123
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,790
and 1 plus 1 is 2.

124
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,540
So times z plus 1,
times z plus 1.

125
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,100
And now is fun part.

126
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,350
This is a 1 here, that's
parentheses.

127
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,900
Now we can start
canceling out.

128
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,860
And we assume that the
denominator would never equal

129
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,120
0 and all that.

130
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,400
Let's see, this z plus
2 cancels out

131
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,370
with this z plus 2.

132
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,030
This z plus 1 cancels out with
one of these z plus 1's.

133
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,410
I'll do the one that's
written messier.

134
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,310
And let's see, this z cancels
out with this z.

135
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,920
And what are we left with?

136
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:46,020
Everything simplified to 7
times z minus 6 over 4

137
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,210
times z plus 1.

138
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:59,500
   

139
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,740
I wrote a z minus b here.

140
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,320
It's z plus 2 times z minus 2.

141
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,090
All that pattern matching,
I made a mistake.

142
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,620
Z squared minus 4 is z plus
2 times z minus 2.

143
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,690
Not z minus b, and I though
that was a 6.

144
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,790
So this is z minus 2.

145
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,920
So this is z minus 2.

146
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,550
And so that is choice A.

147
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,640
Sorry about that error.

148
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,760
Brain malfunctions
all the time.

149
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,220
All right, now they want
us to do it again.

150
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:36,790
They want us to find the product
of x plus 5, over 3x

151
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:44,940
plus 2, times 2x minus
3, over x minus 5.

152
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,780
Frankly, there's not a lot of
simplification we can do, we

153
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,740
just have to multiply it out.

154
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,765
So this is going to be equal to
x plus 5 times 2x minus 3.

155
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,240
All of that over 3x--

156
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,240
I'm just multiplying the
numerator and then multiplying

157
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,880
the denominators-- 3x plus
2 times x minus 5.

158
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,040
And now we just multiply
both binomials, x

159
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,470
times 2x, 2x squared.

160
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,780
X times minus 3, minus 3x.

161
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,820
5 times 2x, plus 10x.

162
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,730
5 times minus 3, minus 15.

163
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,290
Fair enough.

164
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,750
Now you do the denominator.

165
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,950
3x times x is 3x squared.

166
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,990
3x times minus 5, minus 15x.

167
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,520
2 times x, plus 2x.

168
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,460
2 times minus 5, minus 10.

169
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,000
And now let's see if
we can simplify.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,690
We have the numerator is
equal to 2x squared

171
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,410
minus 3x plus 10x.

172
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,150
So that's plus 7x minus 15.

173
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,360
All of that over 3x squared.

174
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,060
And minus 15x plus 2x.

175
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,890
That's minus 13x minus 10.

176
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,790
And that is choice D.

177
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,550
   

178
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,260
Next problem.

179
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,290
Problem 70.

180
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,110
Boy, they they want us
to keep this up.

181
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,480
This is good practice.

182
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:30,540
So they write, x squared plus
8x plus 16, over x plus 3,

183
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:41,482
divided by 2x plus 8, over
x squared minus 9.

184
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:44,190
So the first thing you do, when
you divide by a fraction,

185
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,200
it's the same thing is
multiplying by its inverse.

186
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:55,210
So this is equal to x squared
plus 8x plus 16, over x plus 3

187
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,650
times the inverse of this,
x squared minus 9,

188
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,280
over 2x plus 8.

189
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,850
Fair enough.

190
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,870
Now let's see if we can simplify
these a little bit.

191
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,810
I'll do that in yellow.

192
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,980
So this is, 4 plus 4 is
8, 4 times 4 is 16.

193
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,190
So this we can rewrite as
x plus 4 times x plus 4.

194
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,550
   

195
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,680
x squared minus 9, that's a
squared minus b squared.

196
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,720
So this we can rewrite as x
plus 3 times x minus 3.

197
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,070
It's going with the pattern.

198
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,880
We can factor out a 2 here, so
we can rewrite this as 2

199
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,240
times x plus 4.

200
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,510
We have an x plus 3 there.

201
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,440
And of course, when we multiply
fractions, we're just

202
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,770
multiplying all the numerators
over all the denominators.

203
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,480
So it's almost like you
make this one line.

204
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,270
So the numerator is x plus 4
times x plus 4 times x plus 3

205
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,520
times x minus 3.

206
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,580
All of that over x plus 3
times 2 times x plus 4.

207
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,790
So now let's do some
cancellation.

208
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,730
This is the fun part.

209
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,030
So we have an x plus 4 and and
x plus 4, cancel them out.

210
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,710
   

211
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,535
We have an x plus 3 and an x
plus 3, cancel them out.

212
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:07,070
   

213
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,220
And what are we left with?

214
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:18,020
We are left with an x plus
4 times an x minus 3.

215
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,390
All of that over 2.

216
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,320
And that is choice C.

217
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,930
And I will see you in
the next video.

218
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,000
