00:00:00,502 --> 00:00:02,894
PROBLEM: "Consider the following
coordinate pairs."

2
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:04,594
(And they give us a bunch
right over here.)

3
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:07,661
"Which of those pairs
is not graphed below?"

4
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:10,061
So let's see three. (3, -2).

5
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:13,926
So (3,-2).

6
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:16,694
Well, actually, it looks like
that first one is not graphed.

7
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:18,395
So (3, -2) isn't graphed.

8
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:20,230
And you can verify
that all of these others

9
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:21,649
do seem to be graphed.

10
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,277
(4, -8) is right there.

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,278
(-8, 3) is right over here.

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,444
(4, 6) is right there.

13
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:33,794
And (-1, 0) is right there.

14
00:00:34,194 --> 00:00:36,178
So let's do a couple more of these.

15
00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:38,993
So is (-5, 0) graphed?

16
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:40,597
Yep. It's right over there.

17
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:43,729
(-4, 5) should be there.

18
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,974
So that's not graphed.

19
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:48,017
Let's select that one.

20
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:49,762
Let's do one more of these.

21
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:54,510
(-8, 4). So (-8, 4).

22
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,511
We got lucky.

23
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:56,802
The first one is not graphed.

24
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,460
( -8, 4).

25
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:01,267
We're done.
