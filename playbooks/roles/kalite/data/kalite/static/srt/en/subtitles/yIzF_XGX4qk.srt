1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,860
We're on problem 14.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,109
And it asks us what is the
solution to the inequality x

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,710
minus 5 is greater than 14?

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,530
Well, to do this, this
is just like solving

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,820
any equality or equation.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,000
What we do to one side, we have
to do the other side.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,060
And we want to get rid of this
minus 5, and the best way to

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,206
get rid of a minus 5 is to add
5, so lets add 5 to both sides

10
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:26,610
of this equation.

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,910
So 5 plus and then a plus 5.

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,340
And then a 5 plus a
minus 5, that's 0.

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,530
That's why we added the
5 in the first place.

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,240
So we're just left with
an x on that side.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,610
We get x is greater than
14 plus 5, which is 19.

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,650
That's choice B.

17
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,980
Problem 15.

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,195
The lengths of the sides
of a triangle are--

19
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:49,300
so we have a triangle.

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,090
They tell us the lengths of the
sides are y, y plus 1, and

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,180
7 centimeters.

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,530
They also tell us the perimeter
is 56 centimeters.

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,660
The perimeter is equal
to 56 centimeters.

24
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,670
What is the value of y?

25
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,590
So the perimeter of any shape is
just the sum of the sides.

26
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,240
So y plus y plus 1 plus 7.

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,820
That's the distance around
the triangle.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,200
And that is equal to
the perimeter,

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,600
which is equal to 56.

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,110
Let's see, we get y plus y is
2y, plus 1 plus 7 is 8, is

31
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,560
equal to 56, so you get 2y
is equal to what is that?

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,600
56.

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,870
So if we subtract 8 from both
sides of this equation, on the

34
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,240
left-hand side, we
just get 2y.

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,460
On the right-hand side,
56 minus 8, that's 48.

36
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:49,360
Divide both sides by 2 and
you get y is equal to 24.

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,100
And that is choice A.

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,480
Problem 16.

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,690
Now what do they
want us to do?

40
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,620
All right, I think this is one
I should copy and paste.

41
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:08,910
   

42
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,700
OK, now they're telling us--
let me pick a good color.

43
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,970
Which number serves as a
counterexample to the

44
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,410
statement below?

45
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,370
So, a counterexample, an example
that shows that this

46
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,440
isn't always true.

47
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,430
So the statement is all
positive integers are

48
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,480
divisible by 2 or 3.

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,770
So we just have to find a
positive integer that is not

50
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,950
divisible by 2 or 3,
by neither 2 nor 3.

51
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,810
Well, 100 is divisible
by 2, right?

52
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,230
So that just verifies or it's
just another example of a

53
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,350
positive integer that's
divisible by one of these two,

54
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,790
so it's not choice A.

55
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,640
It's not a counterexample.

56
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,670
57, It's not divisible by 2,
but it is divisible by 3.

57
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,550
19 times 3 is 57.

58
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,440
So it's not choice B.

59
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,870
57 is another positive integer
that's divisible by 2 or 3.

60
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,670
It's divisible by 3,
so it's not that.

61
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,390
30's divisible by both, so
that's definitely not a

62
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,010
counterexample.

63
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,360
But here we have 25.

64
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,205
It's a positive integer and it
is neither divisible by 2 nor

65
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:10,600
3, so it disproves
the statement.

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,160
So it is a counterexample.

67
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,230
And so the answer is D.

68
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,260
Problem 17.

69
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,620
Let me copy and paste
this one.

70
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,470
   

71
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,410
Copied it.

72
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,210
Pasted it.

73
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,460
All right.

74
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,550
What is the conclusion of the
statement in the box below?

75
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,330
OK, they say if x squared
is equal to 4.

76
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,470
So if we know that x squared is
equal to 4, then we know,

77
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,440
and we know this from algebra,
we could have solved it, that

78
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,710
x is equal to minus 2 or 2.

79
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,020
All right, so what is the
conclusion of the statement in

80
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,420
the box below?

81
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,380
Oh, OK.

82
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,360
I think I'm reading
this too much.

83
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,840
This is the condition and
this is the conclusion.

84
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,370
They're saying if this
has happened,

85
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,670
then we conclude that.

86
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,910
So they're actually just
asking us to label it.

87
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,450
This is the conclusion.

88
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,060
Then x is equal to
minus 2 or 2.

89
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,810
I don't like that question
so much.

90
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,480
My reaction was, OK, if this is
the whole statement, what

91
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,920
can I conclude from it?

92
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,210
And there's not a lot that I
could conclude from it unless

93
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,090
they told me that this
indeed was true.

94
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,810
But anyway, I don't want
to get too complicated.

95
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,110
They're just saying that if
this is true, then we can

96
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,010
conclude this.

97
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,970
And they're actually just saying
what is the conclusion?

98
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,350
So what part of this statement
can we label as the

99
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,370
conclusion?

100
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,160
Well, that's the conclusion,
so that's choice D.

101
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,410
I didn't like that.

102
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,330
   

103
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,740
That was more meaning
of words than math.

104
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,990
But anyway, problem 18.

105
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,400
All right, let me copy and
paste this one, too.

106
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,830
   

107
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,490
Which of the following
is a valid

108
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,800
conclusion to the statement?

109
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,730
OK.

110
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,100
You see, now if a student is a
high school band member, then

111
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,280
the student is a
good musician.

112
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,130
So if you're in the high school
band, high school band

113
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,450
member, then you're going
to be a good musician.

114
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,510
That's what this says.

115
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,370
And if you compare this
to the last question,

116
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,020
that could be confusing.

117
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,030
Because a valid conclusion--
so once again, here they're

118
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,690
giving us a statement and they
want us to come to some

119
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,490
conclusion.

120
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,310
They might have said
what is the

121
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,410
conclusion of this statement?

122
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,580
And then you would have
said, oh, the

123
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,730
student is a good musician.

124
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,180
But that's not what
they're asking.

125
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,370
They're saying, OK, if this
whole thing is a statement, if

126
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,260
we know that this whole thing
is true, if they're in the

127
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,630
high school band, then they're
a good musician, which I kind

128
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,110
of wrote in shorthand here.

129
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,630
They're asking, OK, if we know
that to be true, which of

130
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,440
these statements can we
conclude from that?

131
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,870
Statement A says, all
good musicians are

132
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,510
high school band members.

133
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,810
Well, that doesn't
tell us that.

134
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,460
It doesn't say that all good
musicians-- the good musicians

135
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,530
could be this circle and the
high school band members would

136
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,580
be a subset of it.

137
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,680
High school band, and this
could be good musicians.

138
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,090
So right, all high school band
members are good musicians,

139
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,410
but there could be people out
here who are good musicians

140
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,890
who aren't high school
band members.

141
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,170
So it's not choice A.

142
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,520
A student is a high school
band member.

143
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
Well, no.

144
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,060
High school band members, they
didn't tell us that all of the

145
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,380
students are high school band
members or the high school

146
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,870
band is comprised of all
of the students.

147
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,010
The student body might
be like this circle.

148
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,680
Some of them might be in
the high school band.

149
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,640
Some of them aren't and
are good musicians.

150
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,410
Some of them aren't and
aren't good musicians.

151
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,300
So, I mean, you don't know
whether someone is a high

152
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,480
school band member just
by being a student.

153
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,950
All students are
good musicians.

154
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,840
Once again, you know, this
could be an example.

155
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,410
There could be people out here
who are students, the yellow

156
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,170
could be students.

157
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,330
There could be people
who are students

158
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,110
who aren't good musicians.

159
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,600
This statement doesn't in
any way constrain that.

160
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,150
So let's get rid of that.

161
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,600
All high school band members
are good musicians.

162
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,140
Well, let's look at
this Venn diagram.

163
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,680
I mean, that's almost like
a restating of what they

164
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,790
already told us.

165
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,070
All high school band members
have to be good musicians

166
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,260
because they told us, if you're
in the high school

167
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,190
band, then you're
a good musician.

168
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,430
So it's almost like repeating
the same statement twice, but

169
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,940
the answer is D.

170
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,050
Problem 19.

171
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,910
Let me erase this one.

172
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,200
This looks like another
one that I'm going to

173
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,400
have to copy and paste.

174
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,520
OK, copied it.

175
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,730
   

176
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,270
OK, let me do a dark color.

177
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,930
The chart below shows an
expression evaluated for four

178
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,500
different values of x.

179
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,000
When x is equal to 1, x squared
plus x plus 5, right.

180
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,550
1 plus 1 plus 5 is 7.

181
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,810
When x is equal to 2, then 2
squared plus 2 plus 5 is 11.

182
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,060
Fair enough.

183
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,740
Josiah or Hosiah, I don't know
how to pronounce that,

184
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,170
concluded that for all positive
values of x, x

185
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:14,220
squared plus x plus 5 produces
a prime number.

186
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:21,440
Which value of x serves as
a counterexample to prove

187
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,180
Josiah's conclusion false?

188
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,580
So a counterexamples says-- he
says that whenever I put any

189
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,840
positive number here, I get
a prime number here.

190
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,650
We have to say which one
proves him false?

191
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:41,605
If you put 5 there, what is-- 5
squared is 25 plus 5 plus 5,

192
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,159
and what is that equal to?

193
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,930
That's equal to 35.

194
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,960
So that's a counterexample
right there.

195
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,930
If x is equal to 5, I produce
35, which is not a prime

196
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,510
number, not prime.

197
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,170
   

198
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,130
So clearly, his statement, his
conclusion, was incorrect,

199
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,480
that when you put a positive
number here, it doesn't always

200
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,540
produce a prime number.

201
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,500
That was his conclusion.

202
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,740
This one isn't prime.

203
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,040
So statement A is a
counterexample, or the number

204
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,740
5 is a counterexample here.

205
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:21,490
Next problem, problem 20.

206
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,870
OK, this is one of those where
we have to pinpoint the

207
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,120
incorrect step.

208
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,960
   

209
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,250
John's solution to an equation
is given below.

210
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,950
For which step of real numbers
did-- oh, which property of

211
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,240
real numbers did John
use for step 2?

212
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,430
OK, so we don't even have
to look at step 1.

213
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,650
We just have to say,
OK, how did he get

214
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,290
from there to there?

215
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,970
   

216
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,810
So when you look at this, when
you say x plus 2 times x plus

217
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,940
3 is equal to 0, you're saying
some number x plus 2 times

218
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,640
some other number x plus
3 is equal to 0.

219
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,060
So that's like saying some
number times some other number

220
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,100
is equal to 0.

221
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,250
So that means that one of those
numbers or both of them

222
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,440
have to be equal
to zero, right?

223
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,610
Because the only way to get
zero is if one of these or

224
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,590
both of these have to
be equal to zero.

225
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,250
And that's where he gets this
conclusion that either x plus

226
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,830
2 has to be 0 or
x plus 3 is 0.

227
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,090
They're both zero.

228
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,560
So let's see how they--
what do they call it?

229
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,770
Multiplication property
of equality.

230
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,020
I don't even know
what that means.

231
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,930
Zero property of
multiplication?

232
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,690
This seems like the closest
one for me so far.

233
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,570
That anything times zero is zero
Or for two things to be

234
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,580
multiplied to equal zero,
at least one of

235
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,750
them has to be zero.

236
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,640
And that's what this
is right here.

237
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,200
Commutative property
of multiplication?

238
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,890
No, that's not it.

239
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,160
Distributive property of
multiplication over addition?

240
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,840
No, we're not doing anything
like that.

241
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,010
If we went from this step
to that step where we're

242
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,730
multiplying it, that might
have been, because you're

243
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,256
really just doing the
distributive property, but I

244
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:49,020
don't want to confuse you.

245
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,070
Yeah, we're just saying that
if two numbers when you

246
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,100
multiply them equal zero,
one of them have

247
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,850
to be equal to zero.

248
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:59,690
And I guess the label for that
is the zero product property

249
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,970
of multiplication.

250
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,120
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

251
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,400
