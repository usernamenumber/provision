1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:08,444
In the last couple of videos,
I had started a cupcake factory and I was the richest
guy in town

2
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:10,080
and I was doing so well that it attracted
competition.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,043
And then Imran came
in and he started his own cupcake factory.

4
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:17,335
And he took all of my
business and he ended up charging $2.90.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,978
And, I think, the number I used
in the last video, he sold 500,000 cupcakes.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,340
And he had this great
return on asset.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,710
I think it was 20%
of something.

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,337
He took away all my business
and I got decimated.

9
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:29,548
I think my cupcakes-- I was
originally charging something like $3.

10
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:34,083
And my cupcakes, I only started
selling 250,000 of them

11
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,390
and then my
return on asset essentially went to zero.

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,545
I was kind of break-even.

13
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:40,842
And at the end of the last
video, not being a great businessman, I said,

14
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:43,152
oh
well, actually let me just raise prices.

15
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:49,991
Because I have this set number
of customers and they like the way I operate the cash register
a little bit,

16
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:54,462
or maybe they live a little bit
closer to my cupcake factory, or my bakery, or whatever
you want to call it.

17
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:57,672
And so I actually
raised prices.

18
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:00,560
I cut out a little bit of a
profit, but actually by doing that,

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,664
I do lose a couple of
these people because they are willing to walk a little bit
further for a cupcake.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,150
But I get an OK return.

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,150
But this is kind of maximizing
it and then, over time,

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,853
more and more people realize that
Imran's charging so much less for cupcakes.

23
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:19,902
So actually my revenue stream
starts to decline because fewer and fewer people
show up.

24
00:01:19,902 --> 00:01:22,400
I say this really isn't a
sustainable situation.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,973
Imran came here. I think he was he was selling
500,000, right?

26
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:31,190
He's getting this great
return on asset.

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,280
I'm getting this crummy
return on asset.

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,351
I'm only making $40,000
a year; he's making $300,000 a year.

29
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:39,080
I need to get back at him.

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,640
So what I do is, I say, let me
lower the price and, besides taking some of his business,

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,756
there will actually be some incremental more people in the
town who will actually start buying it.

32
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,580
So it's not a zero sum game.

33
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,242
A zero sum game means that if I
win, someone else is losing by that amount.

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,920
If I lower prices, I'll take
some business from Imran.

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,526
But there will also be people
who were probably eating something more nutritious than
cupcakes

36
00:02:01,526 --> 00:02:08,472
who might now eat cupcakes to get their daily
requirements of sugar and trans-fat then

37
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:10,663
in the case of my cupcakes, nicotine.

38
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:15,271
So, let's say, I cut prices
below Imran because I realize this increase price strategy
was kind of silly.

39
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:27,899
So I lower my prices to $2.70
and, at $2.70, I'm able to sell, I don't know,
400,000 cupcakes.

40
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,680
And I took some business
from Imran, right?

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,751
I'm not a lot cheaper
than him, but I'm a good bit cheaper.

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,001
So, let's say, I took some
business, so he's only selling 400,000 cupcakes

43
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:41,066
and now, the
aggregate cupcake and-- actually not.

44
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:47,149
Let's ignore this for a little
bit because now, in this reality, I'm getting a 15%
return on my asset.

45
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:49,740
Imran's getting a 7% percent
return on asset.

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,937
Let's say there's a third party,
Vikram and he just has a love for making cupcakes

47
00:02:53,937 --> 00:02:57,760
and
he says, well, you know, what if I could spend my life making
cupcakes

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,952
and, even if I just get a 7% return, that's
a pretty good living.

49
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:02,250
And a 15% return
would be great.

50
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,910
So he also enters the market.

51
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,410
He's kind of a smaller
operator.

52
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,150
He didn't have quite as much so
he puts $500,000 into it.

53
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,190
He has a 400,000 cupcake
per year capacity.

54
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,307
Since there's a smaller
factory, it's a little less efficient.

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,744
And he comes in and he says, you
know, my joy in life isn't so much--

56
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:26,078
he obviously has to
pay his bills, he likes to be rich --

57
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:29,583
but he says, he just
derives joy from seeing people eat cupcakes.

58
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,990
So he undercuts everybody.

59
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,620
And in doing so he just operates
at full capacity.

60
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:43,742
He operates at 400,000. He operates at full capacity.

61
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,380
And then he takes business
from these guys.

62
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,200
And then he takes business
from me as well.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,670
And then, what's the state of
affairs in our city now?

64
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,400
So my return on asset is 7%.

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,244
Imran is essentially
at break-even. He's making no money.

66
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:06,020
And then Vikram is making a 12%
return on asset because--

67
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,480
essentially, he undercut
everyone and was able to take all the volume.

68
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,419
And, if you look at the city
as a whole, that's the aggregate capacity right here.

69
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,867
And this is the second worksheet
in that--

70
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:23,258
Let me tell you where it is again, if
you didn't watch the last video,

71
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:29,218
is khanacademy.org/
downloads/cupcakes.xls.

72
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:35,253
But anyway, Vikram had entered
the market, and now I calculated here aggregate
capacity.

73
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:38,240
This is the total numbers of cupcakes all of the factories in the market can produce.

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
This is the aggregate demand.

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,730
So 1.1 million cupcakes are
getting sold a year

76
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,550
and then this is the average return
on asset, right?

77
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,780
But in this situation, what
continues to happen?

78
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,180
I have all of this
extra capacity.

79
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,460
Only 32% of my capacity is being
utilized and, obviously, right now you can say,

80
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,769
the market
price for cupcakes is well above the marginal cost
of producing a cupcake.

81
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:06,600
And Imran's sitting there with
this huge amount of capacity,

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,080
and maybe he's the richest guy,
because he has a huge inheritance from grandma.

83
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,690
And so he says, this is silly.

84
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,110
I'm the biggest guy in town.

85
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,100
I'm the most efficient
guy in town.

86
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,340
I have all the capacity.

87
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,799
I'm the richest guy in town
and I'm making the worst returns on assets.

88
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:26,675
So what he says is, you know
what, I'm just going to undercut everybody.

89
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:31,955
I'm going to charge
$1.70 per cupcake.

90
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:37,608
At $1.70 per cupcake, all of a
sudden, there's a whole new market for people who want
to eat cupcakes.

91
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:40,878
There's a lot of people who
might have been eating Twinkies and other things,

92
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:44,024
that
maybe they could get at $1.80 per Twinkie,

93
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,140
and now 
cupcakes are the desired source of food.

94
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,875
So, obviously, aggregate demand
is going to go up and, let's say, he just sells out.

95
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:56,095
He just goes and he sells two
million cupcakes a year.

96
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:01,504
And so he makes a huge
return and he just kills our business.

97
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:08,365
So I'm just taking huge losses
and Vikram is taking huge losses, right?

98
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:12,807
He's like, you know what, we
have to match his prices.

99
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:19,650
I sell it at $1.70 and then
Vikram sells at $1.70.

100
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,883
And we said at $1.70, people are
willing to eat two million cupcakes in a year.

101
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,660
So, let's say, at $1.70 it's
split evenly between--

102
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,110
Well Vikram can only produce
400,000 cupcakes.

103
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:38,960
So let's say he sells 400,000.

104
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,790
And then the remainder split
between the other two.

105
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:48,140
So, let's see, 800,000
and 800,000.

106
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,160
And, as you can see here,
there's a general trend that,

107
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,310
as people have extra capacity,
there's almost this incentive

108
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,990
to lower your price relative
to the other person.

109
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,390
Because if you're not using your
capacity,

110
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,254
then that's a cupcake that's not being
made that otherwise could have been made.

111
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,060
And your cost of producing that
incremental cupcake is a lot lower,

112
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,678
so you're just
like, well, as long as I charge something more than that,

113
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:18,600
I'm going to make money that I otherwise wouldn't
have made.

114
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,058
But when you do that,
you're actually lowering the market price.

115
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,300
And then all the parties keep
wanting to do that.

116
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,630
And that's why competition
really is good for customers.

117
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,230
And that's why a monopoly
is bad.

118
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,968
If you were a monopoly, if Sal's
Cupcakes were the only guy in town,

119
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:31,950
he could just
keep his prices high.

120
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,112
And even if his utilization went
down, there would be no incentive for him
to lower prices.

121
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:40,702
But in this reality with
competition, there's this huge incentive

122
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:46,005
that, when you have
extra capacity, especially if you have a lot of extra
capacity,

123
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:50,117
there's this huge incentive to lower prices
so that you can utilize that capacity.

124
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,682
Likewise, if you're running near
full capacity, there's a huge incentive to
raise prices.

125
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:59,449
Because if you're at full
capacity, and we saw that in the last video, when it was
just me,

126
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,742
I went to full capacity and I was able to raise
prices because all that extra money just goes to me.

127
00:08:03,742 --> 00:08:09,378
But, as you can see, there's a
couple of key learning points in this set of videos.

128
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:16,330
When you have huge returns, as
Sal's Cupcakes had in this video or in this worksheet over
here

129
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,730
When you have huge returns, it attracts
competition.

130
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,140
The competition attracts
capacity, right?

131
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,025
We went from aggregate capacity
from one million with my original factory,
to now 3.4 million.

132
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,791
And then, when you have that
extra capacity, everyone's incentive is really to lower
prices

133
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,370
so that they can try to grab some of that utilization.

134
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,786
The only way that you could
avoid this is, if Sal, Imran, and Vikram were to meet in a
room

135
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:46,481
and say, hey guys what we're doing is silly, why don't
we just all agree on a price.

136
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:49,020
And you might say that's a good
business move

137
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,750
and, if you actually did it, you would
end up in jail.

138
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,576
Well, hopefully you'd be
in jail if you had good regulators, because that's
called collusion.

139
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:59,131
You'd be forming a cartel. You'd be forming a group that
is trying to control prices.

140
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:02,170
So in a truly competitive
environment, we're not allowed to communicate

141
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,630
and we're not
allowed to tell each other,

142
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,430
hey, why don't we just
set prices at X.

143
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,894
We always have to be competing
with each other and lowering our prices.

144
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:16,010
But the general theme here
is, when you're at high utilization

145
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,381
the whole reason
why I'm even entering into this whole spreadsheet and all
of that,

146
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:21,081
is to talk about inflation in general.

147
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:26,193
But, in general, prices will
go up when you have high utilization, right?

148
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:30,376
If all of us were running
at 100% utilization--Actually, let's do
that scenario.

149
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,625
Let's say, for whatever reason,
everyone is able to get cheap loans, and they take
home equity loans,

150
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:40,895
and they decide to use all of that extra
money that is coming from their home ATM
to buy cupcakes.

151
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:46,832
So aggregate demand goes up huge
and all of the cupcakes in the market get sold out.

152
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:50,130
So I'm selling a million
cupcakes per year.

153
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,980
Imran is selling two million
cupcakes per year.

154
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,760
And then Vikram is
selling 400.

155
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,620
So we're all tapped out, we're
at 100% capacity utilization.

156
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,940
And then the return on assets
are pretty good.

157
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,337
But we all, as a group, say,
wow, you know, if I'm already sold out,

158
00:10:07,337 --> 00:10:11,175
why don't I just raise
prices because it's not going to affect demand
so much.

159
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,710
People want cupcakes so badly,
so I could raise prices to $2.

160
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,770
That improves my return
on asset.

161
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,357
Imran's no dummy, so he
does the same thing. He raises his price to $2.

162
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,823
And let's say people are getting
so much money from their home equity loans

163
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:27,759
and
they're still willing to buy the cupcakes from us.

164
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,790
And Vikram does the
same at $2.

165
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,170
And so everyone's return on
asset improves even more

166
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,910
And you can even argue that it would
attract competition.

167
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,670
But I think three players
is good enough.

168
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:44,055
And let's say it just keeps
happening and I realize that I can raise my prices all the way
to $3

169
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:51,618
without affecting my utilization, without any
impact on demand.

170
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,520
Let's say it has a slight
impact on utilization.

171
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,620
So I'm selling 950,000
cupcakes a year.

172
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,952
He's selling, I don't
know, 1.8 million cupcakes in a year.

173
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:06,718
And let's say Vikram
is selling 380,000 cupcakes in a year.

174
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,969
But in general, if you look at
returns in the industry, in this situation,

175
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:13,781
by raising our
prices, we're getting better and better returns, right?

176
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:15,670
More money's coming to
the bottom line.

177
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,140
So, as long as we have a pretty
high utilization

178
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,261
and people debate on what is the
level of utilization in lot of industries where it makes
sense to raise prices.

179
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:26,710
But, when you're at a relatively
high utilization,

180
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,880
it really pays to increase
your price hurdle.

181
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,863
And on the other side of the
coin, when you have a low utilization of your asset,

182
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:40,290
even
though it might not be completely-- well, it is
rational if you're a competitor.

183
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,160
But when you have very low
utilization, you essentially want to lower your prices

184
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,089
so
that you can utilize your factory more.

185
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,091
And you can play around with
this and just think about some scenarios yourself.

186
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:52,710
And that's the real big take
away I wanted you to get at, is

187
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,851
that high utilization of
anything, of our aggregate capacity, prices
will increase.

188
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,600
Low utilization, prices
will decrease.

189
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,404
And actually I'll
say two things.

190
00:12:03,404 --> 00:12:09,510
High utilization will allow you
to raise prices

191
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,620
and when you raise price you'll get a
better return on your asset,

192
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,468
and then the other side effect
is, when you have that high return on asset,

193
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:19,199
you'll also
have more investment going on to build more capacity.

194
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:20,990
So aggregate capacity
will go on.

195
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,570
So those are the two side
effects of high utilization.

196
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,160
You have prices increasing and
then you have more capacity or more investment coming on.

197
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,730
Low utilization, you have kind
of the opposite situation.

198
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,668
No incentive for someone to add
a factory, like we did in these situations,

199
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:40,969
and there's
every incentive for every player in the market to
lower prices

200
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,132
because they just want to use their factories.

201
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:46,680
Otherwise their factories
just go unutilized.

202
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,302
Anyway, I think I said the
same thing five times in different ways, but I think
that's your point.

203
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,050
I'll return to the drawing
board, literally, in the next video

204
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:58,155
and we can proceed with
our discussion of inflation and deflation.
