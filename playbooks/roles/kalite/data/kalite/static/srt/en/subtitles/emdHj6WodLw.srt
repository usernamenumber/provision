1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
   

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,090
In the last video, I dropped
myself or a penny from the top

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,630
of a cliff.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,770
We started off at 0 velocity,
obviously because it was

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,290
stationary, and at the bottom,
it was 100 meters per second.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,660
We used that to figure out how
high the cliff was, and we

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,120
figured out that the cliff
was 500 meters high.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,310
What I want to do now is let's
do that same problem, but

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,310
let's do in a general form, and
see if we can figure out a

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,270
general formula for a
problem like that.

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:34,920
Let's say that you have the same
thing, and let's say the

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:43,210
initial velocity-- you're given
the initial velocity,

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,900
you're given the final velocity,
you're given the

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,410
acceleration, and you want to
figure out the distance.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,980
This is what you're given,
and you want to

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,230
figure out the distance.

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,730
   

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,620
Doing it the exact same way we
did in that last presentation,

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,650
but now we're now [INAUDIBLE]

20
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:15,740
formulas, we know that the
change in distance is equal to

21
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,950
the average velocity times--
we could actually say the

22
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,300
change in time, but I'll just
say it with time, because we

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,470
always assume that we
start with time

24
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,810
equals 0-- times time.

25
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,880
We know that the average
velocity is the final velocity

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,190
plus the initial velocity
divided by 2, so that's the

27
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,800
average velocity-- let me
highlight-- this is the same

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,890
thing as this, and then
that times time.

29
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,510
What's the time?

30
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,120
You could figure out the time
by saying, we know how fast

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,430
we're accelerating, and we know
the initial and final

32
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,040
velocity, so we can figure out
how long we had to accelerate

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,580
that fast to get that
change in velocity.

34
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,280
Another way of saying that, or
probably a simpler way of

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,730
saying that, is change in
velocity, which is the same

36
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,220
thing as the final velocity
minus the initial velocity is

37
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,230
equal to acceleration
times time.

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,560
   

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,460
If you want to solve for time,
you could say the time-- if I

40
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,240
just divide both sides of this
equation by a-- is equal to vf

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,920
minus vi divided by a.

42
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,210
We could take that and
substitute that into this

43
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,910
equation, and remember-- this
is all change in distance.

44
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,190
We say change in distance is
equal to-- let me write this

45
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:58,740
term in yellow-- vf
plus vi over 2.

46
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,650
Let me write this
term in green.

47
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:10,520
That's times vf minus
vi over a.

48
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,130
   

49
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,800
Then if we do a little
multiplying of expressions on

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,690
the top-- you might have
recognized this-- this would

51
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,760
be vf squared minus vi squared,
and then we multiply

52
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,040
the denominators over 2a.

53
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,570
So the change in distance is
equal to vf squared minus vi

54
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,630
squared over 2a.

55
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,710
That's exciting-- let me
write that over again.

56
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:45,000
   

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,940
The change in distance is equal
to vf squared minus vi

58
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,300
squared divided by 2
times acceleration.

59
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,710
We could play around with this a
little bit, and if we assume

60
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,290
that we started distance is
equal to 0, we could write d

61
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,150
here, and that might
simplify things.

62
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,600
If we multiply both sides by
2a, we get-- and I'm just

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,710
going to switch this to
distance, if we assume that we

64
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,370
always start at distances
equal to 0.

65
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,230
di, or initial distance,
is always at point 0.

66
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,360
We could right 2ad-- I'm just
multiplying both sides by 2a--

67
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,860
is equal to vf squared minus vi
squared, or you could write

68
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:41,030
it as vf squared is equal
to vi squared plus 2ad.

69
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,330
I don't know what your physics
teacher might show you or

70
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,400
written in your physics book,
but of these variations will

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,010
show up in your physics book.

72
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,870
The reason why I wanted to show
you that previous problem

73
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,470
first is that I wanted to show
you that you could actually

74
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,900
figure out these problems
without having to always

75
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,780
memorize formulas and resort
to the formula.

76
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,930
With that said, it's probably
not bad idea to memorize some

77
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,600
form of this formula, although
you should understand how it

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,892
was derived, and when
to apply it.

79
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:09,670
   

80
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,230
Now that you have memorized it,
or I showed you that maybe

81
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,920
you don't have to memorize
it, let's use this.

82
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,970
Let's say I have the
same cliff, and it

83
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,490
has now turned purple.

84
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,070
It was 500 meters high-- it's
a 500 meter high cliff.

85
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,960
This time, with the penny,
instead of just dropping it

86
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,470
straight down, I'm going to
throw it straight up at

87
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,930
positive 30 meters per second.

88
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,640
The positive matters, because
remember, we said negative is

89
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,450
down, positive is up-- that's
just the convention we use.

90
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,370
Let's use this formula, or any
version of this formula, to

91
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:56,940
figure out what our final
velocity was when we hit the

92
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,000
bottom of the ground.

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,040
This is probably the easiest
formula to use, because it

94
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,240
actually solves for
final velocity.

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,430
We can say the final velocity
vf squared is equal to the

96
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,780
initial velocity squared-- so
what's our initial velocity?

97
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:20,500
It's plus 30 meters per second,
so it's 30 meters per

98
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,600
second squared plus 2ad.

99
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,550
So, 2a is the acceleration of
gravity, which is minus 10,

100
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:36,840
because it's going down, so it's
2a times minus 10-- I'm

101
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,060
going to give up the units for
a second, just so I don't run

102
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,300
out of space-- 2 times minus
10, and what's the height?

103
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,320
What's the change in distance?

104
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,950
Actually, I should be correct
about using change in

105
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,490
distance, because it matters
for this problem.

106
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,520
In this case, the final distance
is equal to minus

107
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,550
500, and the initial distance
is equal to 0.

108
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:07,170
The change in distance
is minus 500.

109
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,450
So what does this get us?

110
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:15,710
We get vf squared is equal to
900, and the negatives cancel

111
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:26,570
out-- 10 times 500 is 5,000, and
5,000 times 2 is 10,000.

112
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:37,220
So vf squared is equal
to 10,900.

113
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:45,460
So the final velocity is equal
to the square root of 10,900.

114
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,000
What is that?

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,310
Let me bring over my trusty
Windows-provided default

116
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,550
calculator.

117
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:01,830
It's 10,900, and the
square root.

118
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:15,110
It's about 104 meters per
second, so my final velocity

119
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,530
is approximately-- that
squiggly equals is

120
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,060
approximately-- 104
meters per second.

121
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,090
That's interesting.

122
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,710
If I just dropped something--
if I just drop it straight

123
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,820
from the top-- we figured out
in the last problem that at

124
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,810
the end, I'm at 100
meters per second.

125
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,000
But this time, if I throw it
straight up at 30 meters per

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,559
second, when the penny hits
the ground, it's actually

127
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,480
going even faster.

128
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,799
You might want to think about
why that is, and you might

129
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,380
realize it.

130
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,960
When I throw it up, the highest
point of the penny--

131
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,230
if I throw it up at 30 meters
per second, the highest point

132
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,320
of the penny is going to be
higher than 500 meters-- is

133
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,250
going to make some positive
distance first, and then it's

134
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,030
going to come down, so it's
going to have even more time

135
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,910
to accelerate.

136
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,660
I think that makes some
intuitive sense to you.

137
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,890
That's all the time I have
now, and in the next

138
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,800
presentation, maybe I'll use
this formula to solve a couple

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,420
of other types of problems.

140
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,900
