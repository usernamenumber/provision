1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,430
   

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,010
In this video, we're going to
look at pairs of molecules and

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,910
see if they relate to each other
in any obvious way or

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,820
maybe less than obvious way.

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,840
So these first two right here,
they actually look like a

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,260
completely different
molecules.

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,110
So your gut impulse might
be to say that these are

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,840
completely different
molecules.

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,870
And it wouldn't be completely
off, but we look a little bit

10
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,890
closer, you see that this guy
on the left has one, two,

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,000
three, four carbons, and so does
this guy on the right.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,010
It has one, two, three,
four carbons.

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,400
This guy on the left
has two, four, six,

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
seven, eight hydrogens.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,080
This guy on the right has two,
four, six, eight hydrogens.

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,680
And they both have one oxygen.

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,030
So both of the molecular
formulas for both of these

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,310
things are four carbons, eight
hydrogens, and one oxygen.

19
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,510
They're both C4H8O.

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,200
So they have the same
molecular formula.

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,650
They're made up of the same
thing, so these are going to

22
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,380
be isomers.

23
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,740
They're going to be isomers,
and they're a

24
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,460
special type of isomers.

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,550
In this situation, we don't
have the same bonds.

26
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,570
We're made up of the same
things, but the bonds, what is

27
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,360
connected to what
is different.

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,190
So we call this a constitutional
isomer.

29
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:17,640
   

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,900
So we are essentially made up of
the same things, but we are

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,200
actually two different molecule,
actually, two very

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,650
different molecules here.

33
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,180
Now let's look at this
next guy over here.

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,600
So if we look at this molecule,
it does look like

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,820
this carbon is chiral.

36
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,970
It is an asymmetric carbon.

37
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,820
It is bonded to four different
groups: fluorine, bromine,

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,090
hydrogen, and then
a methyl group.

39
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,740
And so's this one.

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,200
And they're both made up
of the same things.

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,450
You have the carbon-- and not
only are they made up of the

42
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,440
same things, but the bonding
is the same.

43
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,740
So carbon to a fluorine, carbon
to a fluorine, carbon

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,730
to a bromine, carbon to a
bromine, carbon to hydrogen in

45
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,610
both of then carbon to the
methyl group in both.

46
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,020
But they don't look
quite the same.

47
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,260
Are they mirror images?

48
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,560
Well, no.

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,440
This guy's mirror image would
have the fluorine popping out

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,920
here, the hydrogen going back
here, and then would have the

51
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,930
bromine pointing out here.

52
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,600
Let's see if I can somehow get
from this guy to that guy.

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,270
Let me flip this guy first. So
let me-- a good thing to do

54
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:30,520
would be to just flip to see
the fastest way I could

55
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,340
potentially get there.

56
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,400
Let me just flip it like this.

57
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,700
So I'm going to flip out of
the page, you can imagine.

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,660
I'm going to flip
it like this.

59
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,870
So I'm going to take this methyl
group and then put it

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,810
on the right-hand side.

61
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,430
And you can imagine, I'm going
to turn it so it would come

62
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,770
out of the page and
then go back down.

63
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,950
So if I did that, what
would it look like?

64
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,130
I would have the carbon,
this carbon here.

65
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,080
I would have the methyl group
on that side now.

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,590
And then since I flipped it
over, the bromine was in the

67
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,520
plane of the page.

68
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,910
It'll still be in the plane of
the page, but since I flipped

69
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,060
it over, the hydrogen, which was
in the back, will now be

70
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,740
in the front.

71
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,940
The hydrogen will now be in
the front and the fluorine

72
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,620
will now be in back because
I flipped it over.

73
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,320
So the fluorine is
now in the back.

74
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,870
Now, how does this
compare to that?

75
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,570
Let's see if I can somehow
get there.

76
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,610
Well, if I take this fluorine
and I rotate it to where the

77
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,300
hydrogen is, and I take the
hydrogen and rotate it to

78
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,550
where-- that's all going to
happen at once-- to where the

79
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,720
bromine is, and I take the
bromine and rotate it to where

80
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,530
the fluorine is, I get that.

81
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,860
So I can flip it and then I can
rotate it around this bond

82
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,550
axis right there, and I would
get to that molecule there.

83
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,040
So even though they look pretty
different, with the

84
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,410
flip and a rotation, you
actually see that these are

85
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,660
the same a molecule.

86
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,340
   

87
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,590
Next one.

88
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,050
So let's see, what
do we have here?

89
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,060
Let me switch colors.

90
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,820
So over here, this part
of both of these

91
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,960
molecules look the same.

92
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,380
You have the carbons
on both of them.

93
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,570
This carbon looks like
a chiral center.

94
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,380
It's bonded to one, two,
three different groups.

95
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,470
You might say, oh, it's two
carbons, but this is a methyl

96
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,829
group, and then this side has
all this business over it, so

97
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,700
this is definitely
a chiral carbon.

98
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,829
And over, here same thing.

99
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,500
It's a chiral carbon.

100
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,620
And this has the same thing.

101
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,290
It's bonded to four
different things.

102
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,940
So each of these molecules has
two chiral carbons, and it

103
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,470
looks like they're made
up of the same things.

104
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,250
And not only are they made up
of the same things, but the

105
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,090
bonds are made in
the same way.

106
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,830
So this carbon is bonded to a
hydrogen and a fluorine, and

107
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,760
the two other carbons,
same thing, a

108
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,530
hydrogen and a fluorine.

109
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,890
Carbon, it looks like
it's a hydrogen.

110
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,310
It's bonded to a hydrogen and a
chlorine, so it's made up of

111
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,350
the same constituents
and they're

112
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,410
bonded in the same way.

113
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,630
So these look like--
but the bonding is

114
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,820
a little bit different.

115
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,960
Over here on this one on the
left, the hydrogen goes in the

116
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,510
back, and over here, the
hydrogen's in the front.

117
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,310
And over here, the chlorine's
in back, and over here, the

118
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,560
chlorine's in front.

119
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,290
So these look like
sterioisomers.

120
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,470
   

121
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,630
You saw earlier in this video,
you saw structural isomers,

122
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,290
made up of the same
things but the

123
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,690
connections are all different.

124
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,920
Stereoisomers, they're made
up of the same thing, the

125
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,380
connections are the same, but
the three-dimensional

126
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,800
configuration is a little
bit different.

127
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,060
For example, here on this
carbon, it's connected to the

128
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,810
same things as this carbon, but
over here, the fluorine's

129
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,750
out front, and over here--
out here, the

130
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,400
fluorine's out front.

131
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,100
Over here, the fluorine's
backwards.

132
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,540
And same thing for the
chlorine here.

133
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,570
It's back here and
it's front here.

134
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:52,770
Now, let's see if they're
related in a more nuanced way.

135
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,780
You could imagine putting
a mirror behind.

136
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,470
I guess the best way to
visualize it, imagine putting

137
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,130
a mirror behind this molecule.

138
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,940
If you put a mirror behind this
molecule, what would its

139
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,570
reflection look like?

140
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,940
So if you put a mirror behind
it, in the image of the

141
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,470
mirror, this hydrogen would now,
since the mirror's behind

142
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,750
this whole molecule, this
hydrogen is actually closer to

143
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,450
the mirror.

144
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,307
So then the mirror image, you
would have a hydrogen that's

145
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:19,530
pointed out, and then you would
have the carbon, and

146
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,770
then you would have the fluorine
being further away.

147
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,930
And same thing in the
mirror image here.

148
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,680
You would have the chlorine
coming closer since this

149
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,270
chlorine is further back, closer
to the mirror, and then

150
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,230
you would have the hydrogen
pointing outwards like that.

151
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,290
And then, obviously, the rest
of the molecule would look

152
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,790
exactly the same.

153
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,180
And so this mirror image that I
just thought about in white

154
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,710
is exactly what this molecule
is: hydrogen pointing out in

155
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,800
front, hydrogen pointing
out in front.

156
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,110
You might say, wait, this
hydrogen is on the right, this

157
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,710
one's on the left.

158
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,090
It doesn't matter.

159
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,690
This is actually saying that
the hydrogen's pointing out

160
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,040
front, the fluorine is pointing
out back, hydrogen up

161
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,010
front, fluorine back, chlorine
out front, hydrogen back,

162
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,930
chlorine out front,
hydrogen back.

163
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,930
So these are actually mirror
images, but they're not the

164
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,900
easy mirror images that we've
done in the past where the

165
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,750
mirror was just like that
in between the two.

166
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,260
This one is a mirror image where
you place the mirror

167
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,300
either on top of or behind
one of the molecules.

168
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,570
So this is a class of
stereoisomers, and we've

169
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,130
brought up this word before.

170
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,380
We call this enantiomers.

171
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,000
   

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,030
So if each of these are an
enantiomers, I'll say they are

173
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,830
enantiomers of each other.

174
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,390
They're steroisomers.

175
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,380
They're made up of the same
molecules, so that they have

176
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,680
the same constituents.

177
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,120
They also have the same
connections, and not only do

178
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,090
they have the same connections,
that so far gets

179
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,100
us a steroisomer, but they are a
special kind of stereoisomer

180
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,450
called an enantiomer, where they
are actual mirror images

181
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,500
of each other.

182
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,200
Now, what is this one
over here in blue?

183
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,330
Just like the last one, it looks
like it's made up of the

184
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,540
same things.

185
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,140
You have these carbons, these
carbons, these carbons and

186
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,020
hydrogens up there.

187
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,590
Same thing over there.

188
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,120
You have a hydrogen, bromine,
hydrogen and a bromine,

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,100
hydrogen, chlorine, hydrogen,
chlorine, hydrogen, chlorine,

190
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,210
hydrogen, chlorine.

191
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,500
So it's made up of
the same things.

192
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,010
They're connected in the same
way, so they're definitely

193
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,780
stereoisomers.

194
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,510
Well, we have to make sure
they're not-- well, let's make

195
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,830
sure they're not the same
molecule first. Here,

196
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,520
hydrogen's in the front.

197
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,770
There, hydrogen's in the back.

198
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,600
Here, hydrogen is in the back.

199
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,590
Here, hydrogen is
in the front.

200
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,140
So they're not the
same molecule.

201
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,360
They have a different
three-dimensional

202
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,940
configuration, although their
bond connections are the same,

203
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,190
so these are stereoisomers.

204
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:44,430
   

205
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,350
Let's see if they're
enantiomers.

206
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,410
So if we look at it like this,
you put a mirror here, you

207
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,720
wouldn't get this
guy over here.

208
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,770
Then you would have a chlorine
out front and a hydrogen.

209
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,140
So you won't get it if you
get a mirror over there.

210
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,450
But if we do the same exercise
that we did in the last pair,

211
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,855
if you put a mirror behind this
guy, and I'm just going

212
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:05,170
to focus on the stuff that's
just forward and back, because

213
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,160
that's what's relevant
if the mirror is

214
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,250
sitting behind the molecule.

215
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,570
So if the mirror's sitting
behind the molecule, this

216
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,810
bromine is actually closer to
the mirror than that hydrogen.

217
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,680
So the bromine will now be out
front and then the hydrogen

218
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,380
will be in back.

219
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,930
This hydrogen will
be in the back.

220
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,120
I'm trying to do kind of a
mirror image if it's hard to

221
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,070
conceptualize.

222
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,870
And then that would
all look the same.

223
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,890
And then this chlorine will
now be out front, and this

224
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,725
hydrogen will now be in the back
in our mirror image, if

225
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:39,180
you can visualize it.

226
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,350
And then we have another one.

227
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,230
And this chlorine is closer to
the mirror that it's kind of

228
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,940
been sitting on top of.

229
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,100
So in the mirror image, it would
be pointing out, and

230
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,690
then this hydrogen would
be pointing back.

231
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,550
Now let's see, is our mirror
image the same as this?

232
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,940
So the mirror image, our bromine
is pointing in the

233
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,140
front, hydrogen in
the back there.

234
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,690
Then we have hydrogen in-- then
in our mirror image, we

235
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,270
have the hydrogen in back,
chlorine in front.

236
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,770
Same there.

237
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,460
So far, it's looking like
a mirror image.

238
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,690
And then in this last carbon
over here, chlorine in front,

239
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,310
hydrogen in back.

240
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,800
But here, we have chlorine in
the back, hydrogen in front.

241
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,750
So this part, you could
think of it this way.

242
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,360
This is the mirror image of
this, this is the mirror image

243
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,470
of this part, but this is not
the mirror image of that part.

244
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,790
So when you have a stereoisomer
that is not a

245
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,980
mirror, when you have two
stereoisomers that aren't

246
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,330
mirror images of each other,
we call them diastereomers.

247
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,580
I always have trouble
saying that.

248
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,920
Let me write it.

249
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:45,990
These are diastereomers, which
is essentially saying it's a

250
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,240
stereoisomer that is
not an enantiomer.

251
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,470
That's all it means: a
stereoisomer, not an

252
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,090
enantiomer.

253
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,830
A stereoisomer's either going
to be an enantiomer or a

254
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,960
diastereomer.

255
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,040
Now, let's do this last one.

256
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,650
Let's see we have two-- we have
this cyclohexane ring,

257
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,950
and they have a bromo on the
number one and the number two

258
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,750
group, depending how
you think about it.

259
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,510
It looks like they are mirror
images of each other.

260
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,050
We could put a mirror right
there, and they definitely

261
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,640
look like mirror images.

262
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,520
And this is a chiral
carbon here.

263
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,790
It's bonded to one carbon group
that is different than

264
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,550
this carbon group.

265
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,170
This carbon group
has a bromine.

266
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,080
This carbon group doesn't.

267
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,750
It just has a bunch of hydrogens
on it, if you kind

268
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,210
of go in that direction.

269
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,640
And it's hydrogen and then a
bromine, so that is chiral.

270
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,370
And then, same argument,
that is also chiral.

271
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,050
And obviously, this one is
chiral and that is chiral.

272
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,880
But if you think about it, they
are mirror images of each

273
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,370
other, and they each have
two chiral centers

274
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,350
or two chiral carbons.

275
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,840
But if you think about it, all
you have to do is flip this

276
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,830
guy over and you will
get this molecule.

277
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,970
These are the same molecules.

278
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,380
So it is the same molecule.

279
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,050
So this is interesting, and we
saw this when we first learned

280
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,220
about chirality.

281
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,350
Even though we have two chiral
centers, this is

282
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,650
not a chiral molecule.

283
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,690
It is the same thing as
its mirror image.

284
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,180
It is superimposable on
its mirror image.

285
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:23,410
It is superimposable on
its mirror image.

286
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,540
So even though it has chiral
carbons in it, it is not a

287
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,380
chiral molecule.

288
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,530
And we call these
meso compounds.

289
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,700
   

290
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,510
And we can point to one of them
because they really are

291
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,660
the same compound.

292
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,590
This is a meso compound.

293
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,770
It has chiral centers.

294
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,960
It has chiral carbons, I
guess you could say it.

295
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,360
But it is not a chiral
compound.

296
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,350
And the way to spot these fairly
straightforward is that

297
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,500
you have chiral centers,
but there is a

298
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,170
line of symmetry here.

299
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,110
There's a line of symmetry
right here.

300
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,690
These two sides of the compound
are mirror images of

301
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,430
each other.

302
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:05,190
Now, these would not be the same
molecule if I change that

303
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,310
to a fluorine and I change
that to a fluorine.

304
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,780
Then all of a sudden, you do
not have this symmetry.

305
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,180
These are mirror images,
but they would not be

306
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,060
superimposable.

307
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,650
So if that was a fluorine,
these would actually be

308
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,790
enantiomers.

309
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,110
And this would not be only one
meso compound, it would be two

310
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,860
different enantiomers, and one
of them would have an R

311
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,340
direction and one of them would
have an S direction if

312
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,040
we go with the naming
