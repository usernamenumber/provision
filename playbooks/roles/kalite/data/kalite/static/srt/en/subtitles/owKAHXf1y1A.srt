1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,240
All the parameterizations
we've done so far have been

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,855
parameterizing a curve
using one parameter.

4
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:09,420
What we're going to start doing
this video is parameterizing a

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,990
surface in three dimensions,
using two parameters.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,870
And we'll start with an
example of a torus.

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,320
A torus, or more commonly
known, as a doughnut shape.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,300
And we know what a
doughnut looks like.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,990
Let me draw it in a suitable,
well, I don't have any

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,930
suitable doughnut colors,
so I'll just use green.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,740
A doughnut looks
something like this.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,460
It has a hole in the center,
And maybe the other side of

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,750
the doughnut looks something
like that, and we could

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,840
shade it in like that.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,640
That is what a
doughnut looks like.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,010
So how do we construct that
using two parameters?

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,640
So what we want to do, is you
can just visualize it, a

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,170
doughnut, if you were to
draw some axes here.

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,230
So that's our doughut.

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,310
Let me draw some axes.

21
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,100
So let's say I have the z-axis
that goes straight up and down.

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,030
So we have drawn it here, the
doughnut's a little at a

23
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,430
tilt, so the z-axis, I'll
tilt it a little bit.

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,580
So our z-axis goes straight
through the center

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,650
of the doughnut.

26
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,880
So that right there, this is
going to be an exercise in

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,810
drawing more than
anything else.

28
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,830
So that is my z-axis, and then
you can imagine the z-axis goes

29
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,020
from there, and then this
coming out of here

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,470
will be my x-axis.

31
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,890
That right there is my x-axis,
and then maybe my y-axis

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,190
comes out like that.

33
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,210
And the whole reason why I drew
it this way, is that if you

34
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,860
imagine the cross section of
this doughnut, I'll draw a

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,410
little bit neater, but the
cross section of this doughnut

36
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,710
in the x-z axis, is going to
look something like this.

37
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,820
If I were to slice it in the
x-z axis, it would look

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,570
something like that.

39
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,580
   

40
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,580
That would be the slice.

41
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,510
It would trace out, and
we're thinking about not

42
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,570
a full doughnut, just the
surface of a doughnut.

43
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,440
So it would trace out
a circle like this.

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,570
If you were to cut the doughnut
in the positive z-y axis, it's

45
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:13,620
going to trace out a circle
that looks something

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,600
like that, right there.

47
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,540
And if you go out here, you're
going to get bunch of circles.

48
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,150
So if you think about it, it's
a bunch of circles rotated

49
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,950
around the z-axis.

50
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,940
If you think of it that way,
it'll give us some good

51
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,190
intuition for the best way
to parameterize this thing.

52
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,900
So let's do it that way.

53
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,030
Let's start off with
just the z-y axis.

54
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,690
I'll draw it a little bit
neater than I've done here.

55
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:45,240
So that is the z-axis, and
that is y, just like that.

56
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,630
And let's say that the center
of these circles, let's say it

57
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,350
lies on, you know, it can lie,
when you cross the z-y axis,

58
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,220
the center sits on the y-axis.

59
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,770
I didn't draw it that
neatly here, but I think

60
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,730
you can visualize.

61
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,070
So it sits right
there on the y-axis.

62
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:06,200
And let's say that it is a
distance b away from the center

63
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,330
of the torus, or from the
z-axis it's a distance of b.

64
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,170
It's always going to
be a distance of b.

65
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,510
It's always, if you imagine the
top of the doughnut, let me

66
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,420
draw the top of the doughnut.

67
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,630
If you're looking down on a
doughnut, let me draw a

68
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,420
doughnut right here, if you're
looking down on a doughnut, it

69
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,710
just looks something like that.

70
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,760
The z-axis is just going to
be popping straight out.

71
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,510
The x-axis would come down like
this, and then the y-axis would

72
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,370
go to the right, like that.

73
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,210
So you can imagine, I'm
just flying above this.

74
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,670
I'm sitting on the z-axis
looking down at the doughnut.

75
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,000
It will look just like this.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,720
And if you imagine the cross
section, this circle right

77
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:57,050
here, the top part of the
circle if you're looking down,

78
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,450
would look just like that.

79
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,680
And this distance b is a
distance from the z-axis

80
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,100
to the center of each
of these circles.

81
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,920
So this distance, let me draw
it in the same color, from the

82
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,280
center to the center of these
circles, that is going to be b.

83
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,000
It's just going to keep
going to the center

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,670
of the circles, b.

85
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,840
That's going to be b,
that's going to be b.

86
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,370
That's going to be b.

87
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,590
From the center of our torus
to the center of our circle

88
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,810
that defines the torus,
it's a distance of b.

89
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,380
So this distance right here,
that distance right there is b.

90
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,780
And from b, we can imagine
we have a radius.

91
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,570
A radius of length a.

92
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,860
So these circles have
radius of length a.

93
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,390
So this distance right here is
a, this distance right here is

94
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,520
a, this distance right there
is a, that distance

95
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,250
right there is a.

96
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,910
If I were look at these
circles, these circles

97
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,650
have radius a.

98
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,980
And what we're going to do
is have two parameters.

99
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,710
One is the angle that this
radius makes with the x-z

100
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,520
plane, so you can imagine
the x-axis coming out.

101
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,040
Let me do that in
the same color.

102
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,750
You can imagine the
x-axis coming out here.

103
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,570
So this is the x-z plane.

104
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,480
So one parameter is going to
be the angle between our

105
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,840
radius and the x-z plane.

106
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,670
We're going to call that angle,
or that parameter, we're

107
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,550
going to call that s.

108
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:33,342
And so as s goes between 0 and
2 pi, as s goes between 0 in 2

109
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:37,190
pi, when the 0 is just going to
be at this point right here,

110
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,960
and then as it goes to 2 pi,
you're going to trace out a

111
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,490
circle that looks
just like that.

112
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,070
Now, we only have
one parameter.

113
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,950
What we want to do is then
spin this circle around.

114
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,550
What I just drew is that
circle right there.

115
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,060
What we want to do is spin
the entire circle around.

116
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,210
So let's define
another parameter.

117
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,450
We'll call this one t, and
I'll take the top view again.

118
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,700
This one's getting a
little bit messy.

119
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,470
Let me draw another top view.

120
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,700
As you can see, this is
all about visualization.

121
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,910
So let's say this is my
x-axis, that is my y-axis.

122
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,730
And we said we started
here on the z-y plane.

123
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,580
We are b away from the z-axis,
so that distance is b.

124
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,110
In this diagram, the z-axis
is just popping out at us.

125
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,160
It's popping out of the page.

126
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,490
We're looking straight down.

127
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,540
It's just like the same
view as right there.

128
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,170
And what I just drew, when s is
equal to 0 radians, we're going

129
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,860
to be out here, exactly
one radius further

130
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,700
along the y-axis.

131
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,440
And then we're going to rotate.

132
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,230
As we rotate around, we're
going to rotate and then

133
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,700
come all the way over here.

134
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,760
That's when we're right over
there, and then come back down.

135
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,670
So if you looked on the
top of the circle, it's

136
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,410
going to look like that.

137
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,910
Now, to make the doughnut,
we're going to have to

138
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,010
rotate this whole setup
around the z-axis.

139
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,500
Remember, the z-axis
is popping out.

140
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,920
It's looking straight up at us.

141
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,340
It's coming out of
your video screen.

142
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,820
Now to rotate it, we're
going to rotate this

143
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,840
circle around the z-axis.

144
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,490
And to do that, we'll define a
parameter that tells us how

145
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,210
much we have rotated it.

146
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,940
So this is when we've
rotated 0 radians.

147
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,550
At some point, we're going to
be over here, and we would

148
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,490
have rotated it, this is b as
well, and our circle is going

149
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,390
to be looking like this.

150
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,640
This is maybe this point on
our doughnut, right there.

151
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,390
At that point, we would
have rotated it,

152
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,230
let's say p radians.

153
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,880
So this parameter of how much
have we rotated around the

154
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,240
z-axis, how much have we gone
around that way, we're

155
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
going to call that t.

156
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,900
And t is also going to
vary between 0 and 2 pi.

157
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,960
And I want to make
this very clear.

158
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,830
Let's actually draw the domain
that we're mapping from to

159
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,690
our surface, so that we
understand this fully.

160
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,390
So let me draw some, and then
we'll talk about how we can

161
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,850
actually parameterize
that into a position

162
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,030
vector-valued function.

163
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:21,030
So right here, let's
call that the t-axis.

164
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,330
That's, remember, how much
we're rotated around

165
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,010
the z-axis right there.

166
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:31,610
And let's call this
down here our s-axis.

167
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,410
And I think this will help
things out a good bit.

168
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:39,180
So when s is equal to 0, and
we vary just t, so they're

169
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,270
both going to vary
between 0 and 2 pi.

170
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,190
So this right here is 0,
this right here is 2 pi.

171
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,540
Let me do some
things in between.

172
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,840
This is pi, this would be pi
over 2 obviously, pi over 2,

173
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,250
this would be 3 pi over 4.

174
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,050
You do the same thing
on the p-axis.

175
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,550
It's going to go up to 2 pi.

176
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,560
Let's do that.

177
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,820
So we're going to
go up to 2 pi.

178
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,060
I really want you to visualize
this, because then the

179
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,190
parameterization, I think, will
be fairly straightforward.

180
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:16,240
So that's 2 pi, this is pi,
this is pi over 2, and

181
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,890
then this is 3 pi over 4.

182
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,930
So let's think about what it
looks like if you just hold s

183
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,770
constant at 0, and we just
vary t between zero and 2 pi.

184
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,870
And let me do that in
magenta, right here.

185
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,480
So we're holding s constant,
and we're just varying

186
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,250
the parameter 2 pi.

187
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,800
So this, if you think about it,
should just form a curve in

188
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,030
three dimensions,
not a surface.

189
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,500
Because we're only varying
one parameter right here.

190
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,370
So let's think about
what this is.

191
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:51,360
Remember, s is, let
me draw my axes.

192
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,330
So that is my x-axis, that
is my y-axis, and then

193
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,970
this is my, I'm getting
messier and messier.

194
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,630
That is my z-axis, right--
actually, let me draw it a

195
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,860
little bit bigger than that.

196
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,570
I think it will help all
of our visualizations.

197
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,080
All right.

198
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:20,210
So this is my x-axis, that is
my y-axis, and then my z-axis

199
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,450
goes up like that. z-axis.

200
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,360
Now remember, when s is equal
to 0, that means we haven't

201
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,550
rotated around this
circle at all.

202
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,300
That means we're out here.

203
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,830
We're going to be b away,
and then a away again.

204
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,050
Right?

205
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,990
We haven't rotated
around this at all.

206
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,630
We're setting s as
equal to zero.

207
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,650
So essentially, we're going to
be b away, so this is going to

208
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,800
be a distance of b away, and
then we're going to

209
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
be another a away.

210
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,310
The b is the center of the
circle, and then we're going

211
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,300
to be another a away.

212
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,550
We're going to be
right over there.

213
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,730
So this is a plus b away.

214
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,130
And then we're going to vary t.

215
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,870
Remember, t was how much we've
gone around the z-axis.

216
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,670
These were top views over here.

217
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:07,640
So this line right here, in our
s-t domain, we can say, when we

218
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,940
map it, or parameterize it,
it'll correspond to the curve

219
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,980
that's essentially the outer
edge of are doughnut.

220
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,690
If this is the top view of the
doughnut, it will be the outer

221
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,800
edge of the doughnut,
just like that.

222
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,690
So let me draw the outer edge.

223
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,620
And to do that a little bit
better, let me draw the axes

224
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,440
in both the positive and
the negative domain.

225
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,140
It might make my graph a little
bit easier to visualize things.

226
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,820
Positive and negative domain,
this is negative z right there.

227
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,480
So this line in our t-s plane,
I guess we could say, this

228
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,470
magenta line, we hold s at 0
radians and we increase t, this

229
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:47,750
is t is zero, this is t is
equal to 2 pi, that's t is

230
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:53,290
equal to pi, this is t is equal
to 3 pi over 2, all the way

231
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,780
back to t is equal to 2 pi.

232
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,470
This line corresponds to that
line, as we rotate, as we

233
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,890
increase t and hold
s constant at 0.

234
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,900
Now let's do another point.

235
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,750
Let's say when s is at pi,
right, remember, when s is

236
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,660
at pi, we've gone exactly,
pi is 180 degrees.

237
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,430
When s is at pi, we've
gone exactly 180 degrees

238
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,340
around the circle, around
each of these circles.

239
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,810
So we're right over there.

240
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,520
And now let's hold it constant
at pi, and then rotate it

241
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,710
around to form our doughnut.

242
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,540
So we're going to form the
inside of our doughnut.

243
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,120
So when s is at pie, and we're
going to take t from 0, so when

244
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,620
s is pi and t is 0, we're going
to be, this was the center of

245
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,410
our circle, we're going
to be a below that.

246
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,930
We're going to be
right over there.

247
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:47,430
And then as we vary, as we
increase t, so as we move up

248
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:54,620
along, holding s at pi, and we
increase t, we're going to

249
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:02,070
trace out the inside of our
doughnut, that will look

250
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,170
something like that.

251
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,340
That was my best
shot at drawing it.

252
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,050
And then we can do
that multiple times.

253
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,660
When s is pi over 2, I want to
do multiple different colors,

254
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,960
when s is pi over 2, we've
rotated up here exactly

255
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,980
90 degrees, right?

256
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,900
Pi over 2 is 90 degrees
at this point.

257
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,500
And then if we vary t, we're
essentially tracing out the

258
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,840
top of the doughnut, right?

259
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,110
So let me make sure I draw it .

260
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,990
So the cross section, the top
of the doughnut, we're going

261
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,690
to start off right over here.

262
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,910
So when s is pi over 2, and you
vary it right, and then you

263
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,100
very t, I'm having trouble
drawing straight lines.

264
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,500
And then you vary t, it's
going to look like this.

265
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,980
That's the top of that
circle right there.

266
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,420
The top of this circle is
going to be right there.

267
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,490
The top of this circle is
going to be right over there.

268
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,000
Top of the circle is going
to be right over there.

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,300
So then I just
connect the dots.

270
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,470
It's going to look
something like that.

271
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,770
That is the top
of our doughnut.

272
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,750
If I was doing this top view,
it would be the top of the

273
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,100
doughnut, just like that.

274
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,750
And if I wanted to do the
bottom of the doughnut, just to

275
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,530
make the picture clear, if I
were to make the bottom of the

276
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,350
doughnut, the bottom of the
doughnut would be-- see, if I

277
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,210
take s as 3 pi over 4 and I
vary t, that's the bottoms

278
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:17,850
of our doughnuts.

279
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,870
So let me draw the circle, it's
right there, the circle is

280
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,400
right there, you wouldn't be
able to see the whole thing

281
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,950
if this wasn't transparent.

282
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,660
So you'd be tracing out the
bottom of the doughnut,

283
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,350
just like that.

284
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,860
I know this graph is becoming
a little confusing, but

285
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
hopefully you get the idea.

286
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,470
When s is 2 pi again, you're
going to be back to the outside

287
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,220
of the doughnut again.

288
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,460
That's also going
to be in purple.

289
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,480
So that's what happens when we
hold the s constant at certain

290
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,730
values and vary the t.

291
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,780
Now let's do the opposite.

292
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,140
What happens if we hold t
at 0, and we very the s?

293
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,510
   

294
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,610
So t is 0, that means we
haven't rotated at all yet.

295
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,160
So we're in the z-y plane.

296
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:16,690
So t is 0, and s will start at
0, and it'll go to pi over 2,

297
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,180
that's that point over there.

298
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,670
Then it'll go to pi.

299
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,300
This point is the same
thing as that point.

300
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,020
Then it will go to 3 pi over
4, then it'll come back

301
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,550
all the way to 2 pi.

302
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:34,080
So this line corresponds to
this circle, right there.

303
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:43,270
We could keep doing these if we
pick when t is pi -- let me use

304
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,290
a different color, that's
not different enough.

305
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,870
When t is pi over
2, just like that.

306
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,980
We would have rotated around
the z-axis 90 degrees,

307
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,280
so now we're over here.

308
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,710
And now when we vary s, s will
start off over here, and

309
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,330
it'll go all the way
around like that.

310
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,025
So this line corresponds
to that circle.

311
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:08,180
We could keep doing
it like this.

312
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,610
When t is equal to pi, that
means we've got all the way

313
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,670
around the circle like that,
and now when we vary s from 0

314
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,470
to pi over 2, we're going to
start all the way over here,

315
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,590
and then we're going to vary,
all the way, we're going to go

316
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,430
down and hit all those contours
that we talked about before,

317
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,920
and I'll do one more, just
to kind of make this,

318
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,510
the scaffold, clear.

319
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,540
This dark purple,
hopefully you can see it.

320
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,150
When t is 3 pi over 4,
we've rotated all the way.

321
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,070
So we're in the x-z plane.

322
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,900
And then when you vary s, s
will start off over here, and

323
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:48,460
as you increase s, you're going
to go around the circle, around

324
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,950
the circle, just like that.

325
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,220
And of course, when you get all
the way back full circle, t

326
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,810
over pi over 2, that's
the same thing.

327
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,170
You're back over here again.

328
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,620
So this is going to be, we can
even shade it the same color.

329
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,000
And hopefully you're
getting a sense now of

330
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,130
the parameterization.

331
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,450
I haven't done any math yet.

332
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,450
I haven't actually showed you
how to mathematically represent

333
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,360
it as a vector value function,
but hopefully you're getting

334
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,670
a sense of what it means to
parameterize by two parameters.

335
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:23,080
And just to get an idea of what
these areas on our s-t plane

336
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:30,350
correspond to onto this
surface, in I guess you could

337
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,640
say, in R3, this little square
right here, let's see

338
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,300
what's bounded by.

339
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,900
This little square, I want to
make sure I picked a square

340
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,100
that I can draw neatly.

341
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,755
So this square right here, that
is between, when you look at t,

342
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:50,070
it's between 0 and pi over 2.

343
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,340
   

344
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,740
And s is between
0 and pi over 2.

345
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,120
So this right here is
this part of our torus.

346
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,080
   

347
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,840
If you're looking at it from
the top, it would look

348
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,390
like that, right there.

349
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,020
You can imagine, we've
transformed this square.

350
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,560
I haven't even shown you how
to do it mathematically yet.

351
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,130
But we've transformed
this square to this

352
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,570
part of the doughnut.

353
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,340
Now, I think we've done about
as much as I can do on

354
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,530
the visualization side.

355
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,490
I'll stop this video here.

356
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,970
In the next video, we're going
to actually talk about, how

357
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,290
do we actually parameterize
using these two parameters?

358
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,380
Remember, s takes around each
of these circles, and then t

359
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,090
takes us around the z-axis.

360
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,690
And if you take all of the
combinations of s and t, you're

361
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,050
going to have every point
along the surface of this

362
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,470
torus or this doughnut.

363
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,760
How do you actually go from an
s and a t that goes from 0 to

364
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,030
2 pi, in both cases, and turn
it into a three-dimensional

365
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,130
position vector-valued function
that would define this surface?

366
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,280
We're going to do that
in the next video.
