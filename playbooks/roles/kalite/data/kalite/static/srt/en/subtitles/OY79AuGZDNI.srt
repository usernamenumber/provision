[intro music]

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,487
We're in Louvre and

3
00:00:04,487 --> 00:00:07,841
we're looking at the Victory Stele of Naram-Sin.

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,933
This a really old stele.

5
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:12,647
It's a really old relief sculpture.

6
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:15,197
It is 4200 years old.

7
00:00:15,197 --> 00:00:19,562
It was made, we think, in approximately 2200 BCE.

8
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:23,977
Now, Naram-Sin was the great-great grandson

9
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:27,359
of the founding king of Akkadia, Sargon.

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,748
And this stele

11
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:32,120
commemorates a really important victory of his.

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,785
It commemorates a victory over the Lullubi people

13
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,164
who were mountain people

14
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:40,113
living in the Eastern region of Mesopotamia.

15
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:44,200
Now, normally victory scenes like this from Ancient Mesopotamia

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,425
are shown in registers.

17
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:47,579
In other words,

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,197
the scene is divided into horizontal bands.

19
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:53,354
Here, the artist has created a new kind of composition

20
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,687
where we see Naram-Sin at the top.

21
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:58,341
And diagonally on the left,

22
00:00:58,341 --> 00:01:00,273
underneath Naram-Sin,

23
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:02,713
we see his soldiers climbing the mountain.

24
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:05,531
And then on the right, the vanquished,

25
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:07,781
falling and defeated and wounded.

26
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:09,338
What I find so interesting is that

27
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:11,537
Naram-Sin's army is so disciplined.

28
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:12,721
They don't break ranks,

29
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,507
they're marching in line.

30
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:15,399
There're standard bearers

31
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:17,038
followed by those with weapons

32
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:20,051
whereas on the right there's all kinds of chaos.

33
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:23,733
And Naram-Sin is so erect and noble-looking,

34
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:26,664
and clearly associated with the gods,

35
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:29,140
compared to the mortals that surround him.

36
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,477
One of the things I have noticed immediately is

37
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:34,013
how everyone's gaze, or nearly everyone's gaze,

38
00:01:34,013 --> 00:01:36,649
is directed at Naram-Sin himself.

39
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:39,023
So his soldiers look up at him,

40
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:41,337
the vanquished turn towards him.

41
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:45,067
He's clearly the focal point of this composition.

42
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:47,295
One of aspects that I love most about this

43
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:48,669
are the vanquished, I have to say.

44
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:50,629
You have one of the vanquished mountain people

45
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:53,366
who were actually literally thrown off the mountain.

46
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:55,458
You can see him upside down, falling,

47
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,964
as if he's falling into water.

48
00:01:56,964 --> 00:01:59,444
You see somebody else literally under Naram-Sin's foot,

49
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:02,478
somebody with a spear in his neck.

50
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:04,500
And then, most interestingly, I think,

51
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,909
to the extreme right,

52
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,302
profiled against the mountain,

53
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:08,920
is a man who is fleeing.

54
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,369
Because you can see that

55
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:12,315
his feet are facing away from Naram-Sin,

56
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:14,215
but he's also turned around,

57
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:16,795
turned back and pleading as he flees.

58
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:18,821
Clearly, what we're seeing

59
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:21,330
is using a symbolic language.

60
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,454
This isn't supposed to be a naturalistic representation

61
00:02:23,454 --> 00:02:24,966
of an army climbing a mountain,

62
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:27,018
but a symbolic image that

63
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:30,348
tells the story through symbols of this event.

64
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:32,802
And so we see Naram-Sin,

65
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,600
much larger than everyone else,

66
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,859
with his shoulders frontal, his head in profile,

67
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:41,205
and close to the deities of the top

68
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:44,795
who are represented by... well, they're look like suns.

69
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:48,046
Right, the suns or the stars above are the forces

70
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:49,891
that have helped guide him to victory.

71
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:51,475
But also, and this is important,

72
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:53,460
he's wearing a horned helmet

73
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,338
which is for the Akkadians a symbol of divinity.

74
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:58,195
So through this victory,

75
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:02,382
he's actually assuming the importance and status of the gods.

76
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,152
Right.

77
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:05,352
And in fact, the whole ascension to the mountain top

78
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,155
certainly supports this idea

79
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:09,867
he's rising into the realm of the heavenly.

80
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:15,671
