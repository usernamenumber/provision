1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,220
What I want to do in this video is to show that if we start

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,790
with any arbitrary triangle, this would be the arbitrary triangle

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,670
that we're starting with starting, that we can always make

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,840
this the medial triangle of a larger triangle

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,010
When we say the medial triangle we mean that each of the vertices

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,990
of this tria, of this triangle will be the midpoint

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,730
of the sides of a larger triangle

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,450
I wanted to show you that you can always construct that

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,530
If you start with this triangle, you can always have this be

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,500
the medial triangle of larger triangle

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,300
So to do that, let's draw a line that goes through

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:39,310
this point right over here but that's parallel to this line down here

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,240
So this line and this line up here

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,900
are going to be are going to be parallel

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,660
So just like that

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,030
And immediately we can start to say

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,250
some interesting things about the angles

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,580
So if we have a transversal right over here,

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,960
we can view this side as a transversal

20
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,030
of these two parallel lines or this line and this segment

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,600
We know that alternate interior angles are congruent

22
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,510
So that angle is going to be congruent to that angle

23
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,200
And we also know that this angle, in blue,

24
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,750
is going to be congruent to that angle right over there

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,070
Now let's do that for the other two sides

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,110
So let' create, let's create a line that is parallel

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,870
to this side of the triangle but that goes through

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,750
this point right over here

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,020
So let me draw it as well as possible

30
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,250
And so these two characters are going to be parallel

31
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,770
And you could always construct a line that's parallel to another line

32
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,740
that, that goes thru a point that's not on that line

33
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,470
And so once again we can use alternate interior angles

34
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,600
We know that if this angle right over here

35
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,220
Just let's say we have this orange angle,

36
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,750
its alternate interior angle is this angle right over there

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,590
We also have corresponding angles

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,300
This blue angle corresponds to this angle right over here

39
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,090
So it'll correspond to that angle right over there

40
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,390
And now let's draw another line that is parallel to

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,280
this line right over here, parallel to this one right over here

42
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,060
but it goes through this vertex,

43
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,650
Goes to the vertex that's opposite that line

44
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,140
And so Let me just draw it

45
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,430
You can always construct these parallel lines, and just like that

46
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,800
And let's see what happens

47
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,670
So once again, these two lines are parallel

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,900
So you could view this green line as a transversal

49
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,380
If this green line is transversal, this corresponding angle

50
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,960
is this angle right over here

51
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,810
If we view, if we view this green line as a transversal of both

52
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,090
of these pink lines, then this angle corresponds to

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,640
this angle right over here

54
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,310
If we view this yellow line as a transversal

55
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,780
of both of these pink lines

56
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,530
Actually let's look at, let's look at it this way

57
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,630
View the pink line as a transversal of these two yellow lines

58
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,400
Then we know that this angle corresponds

59
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,310
to this angle right over here

60
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,330
And if you view this yellow line

61
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,640
as a transversal of these two pink lines

62
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,540
Then this angle corresponds to this angle right over here

63
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,710
And then the last thing we would have to, the last

64
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,740
this we should, we need to think about is, if we think about

65
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,060
the two green parallel lines, the two green parallel lines,

66
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,460
and you look at the and you view this yellow line as a transversal

67
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,420
Then this corresponding angle in orange is right over here

68
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,060
This corresponds to that angle

69
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,540
Cause this yellow line is a transversal on both of these green lines

70
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,380
So what I've just show starting with

71
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,160
this inner triangle right over here is that,

72
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,040
If I construct these parallel lines in this way,

73
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,670
that I now have four triangles,

74
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,850
if I include the original one,

75
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,410
and they're all going to be similar to each other

76
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,550
And we know that they're all similar

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,350
because they all have the exact same angles

78
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,300
You just need two angles to prove similarity

79
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,150
but all four of these triangles have the exact three angles

80
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,400
Now, the other thing we can show is that they're congruent

81
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,120
So all of these four are similar

82
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,080
And we also know they're congruent

83
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,660
For example, this side right over here in yellow

84
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,010
is the side in this triangle between the orange and the green side

85
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,980
Is the side between the orange and the green side

86
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,150
on this triangle right over here

87
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,810
So these two, that we have an angle, a side,

88
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,340
and an angle, Angle-Side-Angle congruency

89
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,410
So these two are going to be congruent to each other

90
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,950
Then over here, the, on this inner triangle, our original triangle,

91
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,970
the side that's between the orange and the blue side

92
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,930
is going to be congruent to the sides between the orange

93
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,620
and the blue side on that triangle

94
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,100
Once again, we have Angle-Side-Angle congruency

95
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,760
So this is congruent to this which is congruent to that

96
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,230
All of these are going to be congruent

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,280
And by the same exact argument, same exact argument

98
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,150
this middle triangle is going to be congruent to this bottom triangle

99
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,000
That the, you have an angle, blue angle, purple side, green angle,

100
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,460
blue angle, purple side, green angle,

101
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,190
they're congruent to each other

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,550
So, if all of these triangles are congruent to each other

103
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,180
So the corresponding sides are equal

104
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,520
So if you look at this triangle over here

105
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,570
We know that the side between the blue angle,

106
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,150
between the blue angle and the green angle is,

107
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,710
is going to be equal to this angle right over here,

108
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,460
and sorry, it is equal to this length

109
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,190
So it's going to be equal to this length

110
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,660
between the blue and the green, we have this length

111
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,190
Between the blue and the green we have that length

112
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,300
Between the blue and the green we have that length right over there

113
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,330
So you immediately see that this point

114
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,230
and let me label it now, maybe I should have labeled it before

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,490
If we call that point A,

116
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,920
we see that A is the midpoint of, of, we call

117
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,700
this point B and call this point C right over here

118
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,430
So A is the midpoint of BC

119
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,560
So that's fair enough

120
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,480
So I was able to construct it in that way

121
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,830
Now let's look at the other sides

122
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,360
So this green side on all the triangles

123
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,850
is the, is the, is the side between

124
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,950
the blue and the orange angle

125
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
So between the blue and the orange angle,

126
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,040
you have the green side, between the blue

127
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,410
and the orange angle you have the green side

128
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,410
So once again, this length is equal to this length

129
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,220
and so if we call this point over here D

130
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,360
and maybe this point over here E

131
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,640
You see that D is the midpoint of BE

132
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,880
And then finally, the yellow side is between

133
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,200
the green and the orange

134
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,250
So between the green and the orange we have a yellow side,

135
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,170
between the green and the orange you have a yellow side,

136
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,730
all these triangles are congruent

137
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,220
So once again, let me call this F,

138
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,610
we see that F is the midpoint of EC

139
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,460
So we've done what we wanted to do, we've shown

140
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,760
that if you start with any arbitrary triangle,

141
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,370
triangle ADF, triangle ADF,

142
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:50,760
we can construct a triangle BCE, we can construct, construct

143
00:06:50,770 --> 00:07:05,950
a triangle BCE, so that ADF, ADF is triangle BCE's medial triangle

144
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,710
And all that means, all that means is that the vertices of ADF sit on

145
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,350
the midpoints of BCE

146
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,440
So you might say, "Sal, that by itself is interesting but what's

147
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,690
the whole point of this?"

148
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,770
The whole point of this is actually is I wanted to use this fact

149
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,360
that if you give me any triangle,

150
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,920
I can make it the medial triangle of a large one

151
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,820
To prove that the altitude of this triangle are concurrent

152
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,840
And to see that, let me first draw the altitudes

153
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,730
So an altitude from vertex A looks like this,

154
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,970
it starts with the vertex goes to the opposite side

155
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,380
it is perpendicular to the opposite side

156
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,280
If I draw an altitude from vertex D, it would look like this

157
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:49,360
And if I draw an altitude from vertex F, it will look like this

158
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,150
And what I did, this whole set-up of this video is to show, to prove

159
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,960
that this will always, to prove that this will always be concurrent

160
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,620
And you might say "wait! we How, how do how do we know

161
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,210
that they are concurrent "

162
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,770
Well, all you have to do is think about

163
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,930
how they interact with the larger triangle

164
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,940
How do these altitudes,

165
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,540
what are these altitudes of the larger triangle?

166
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,350
Well this yellow altitude to the larger triangle, remember,

167
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,290
these two yellow lines, line AD and line CE are parallel

168
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,800
So, if this is a 90 degree angle, so its, its core,

169
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,170
its alternate interior angle is also going to be 90 degrees

170
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,570
So this right over here is perpendicular to CE

171
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,580
and it bisects CE because we know that ADE is the medial triangle

172
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,060
This is the midpoint

173
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,640
So this right over here is perpendicular bisector

174
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:43,060
This is a perpendicular bisector, bisector for the larger triangle,

175
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,920
for triangle BCE

176
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,340
So this altitude for the smaller one is a perpendicular bisector

177
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,160
for the larger one

178
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,870
We can do that for all of them

179
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,100
If this angle right over here is 90 degrees,

180
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,680
then this angle right over there is going to be 90 degrees

181
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,860
Cause this line is parallel to this, this is a transversal

182
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,880
Alternate interior angles are the same

183
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,110
So this line right over here, this altitude of the smaller triangle

184
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,340
It bisects right at the midpoint of the larger one on this side

185
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,890
and it's also a perpendicular bisector

186
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,140
So it's a perpendicular bisector of the larger triangle

187
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,400
And then finally the same thing

188
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,750
is true of this altitude right over here

189
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,790
It bisects this side of the larger triangle at a 90 degree angle

190
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,700
We know that because these two magenta lines

191
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,820
is the way we constructed the larger triangle

192
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,970
if they're going to be parallel

193
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,770
So once again this is a perpendicular bisector

194
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,620
So this whole reason, if you just give me any, any triangle

195
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,720
I can take its altitudes and I know that its altitudes are going

196
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,650
to intersect in one point

197
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,670
They're going to be concurrent

198
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,720
Because for any triangle, I can make it the medial triangle

199
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,100
of a larger one and then it's altitude will be

200
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,920
the perpendicular bisector for the larger triangle

201
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,670
And we already know that the perpendicular bisector,

202
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,790
is for any triangle, are concurrent

203
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,370
They do intersect in exactly, in exactly one point
