1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,310
Let's solve another 2nd order
linear homogeneous

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,880
differential equation.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,050
And this one-- well, I won't
give you the details before I

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,760
actually write it down.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,750
So the differential equation is
4 times the 2nd derivative

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:20,160
of y with respect to x, minus
8 times the 1st derivative,

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,540
plus 3 times the function
times y, is equal to 0.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,600
And we have our initial
conditions y of

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,490
0 is equal to 2.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:40,750
And we have y prime of
0 is equal to 1/2.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,710
Now I could go into the whole
thing y is equal to e to the

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,790
rx is a solution, substitute
it in, then factor out e to

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,050
the rx, and have the
characteristic equation.

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,530
And if you want to see all of
that over again, you might

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,550
want to watch the previous
video, just to see where that

17
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,320
characteristic equation
comes from.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,730
But in this video, I'm just
going to show you, literally,

19
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,970
how quickly you can do these
type of problems mechanically.

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,710
So if this is our original
differential equation, the

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,020
characteristic equation is going
to be-- and I'll do this

22
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:20,900
in a different color-- 4r
squared minus 8r plus 3r is

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,370
equal to 0.

24
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,220
And watch the previous video if
you don't know where this

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,940
characteristic equation
comes from.

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,340
But if you want to do these
problems really quick, you

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,780
just substitute the 2nd
derivatives with an r squared,

28
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,100
the first derivatives with an
r, and then the function

29
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,790
with-- oh sorry, no.

30
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,330
This is supposed to
be a constant--

31
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,820
And then the coefficient on the
original function is just

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,830
a constant, right?

33
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,240
I think you see what I did.

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,370
2nd derivative r squared.

35
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,020
1st derivative r.

36
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,100
No derivative-- you could say
that's r to the 0, or just 1.

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,640
But this is our characteristic
equation.

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,210
And now we can just figure
out its roots.

39
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,980
This is not a trivial one for
me to factor so, if it's not

40
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,810
trivial, you can just use
the quadratic equation.

41
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,690
So we could say the solution
of this is r is equal to

42
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:18,050
negative b-- b is negative 8, so
it's positive 8-- 8 plus or

43
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,630
minus the square root
of b squared.

44
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:28,310
So that's 64, minus 4
times a which is 4,

45
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,960
times c which is 3.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,850
All of that over 2a.

47
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,810
2 times 4 is 8.

48
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:42,530
That equals 8 plus or minus
square root of 64 minus--

49
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,250
what's 16 times 3-- minus 48.

50
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,230
All of that over 8.

51
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,430
What's 64 minus 48?

52
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,550
Let's see, it's 16, right?

53
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,880
Right.

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,850
10 plus 48 is 58, then
another-- so it's 16.

55
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,600
So we have r is equal to 8 plus
or minus the square root

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:13,020
of 16, over 8, is equal to
8 plus or minus 4 over 8.

57
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,140
That equals 1 plus
or minus 1/2.

58
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,060
So the two solutions of this
characteristic equation--

59
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,060
ignore that, let me scratch that
out in black so you know

60
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,990
that's not like a 30 or
something-- the two solutions

61
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:34,150
of this characteristic equation
are r is equal to--

62
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,220
well 1 plus 1/2 is equal to
3/2-- and r is equal to 1

63
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,590
minus 1/2, is equal to 1/2.

64
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,380
So we know our two r's, and we
know that, from previous

65
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,445
experience in the last video,
that y is equal to c times e

66
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:51,160
to the rx is a solution.

67
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,880
So the general solution of this
differential equation is

68
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,360
y is equal to c1 times e-- let's
use our first r-- e to

69
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,280
the 3/2 x, plus c2 times
e to the 1/2 x.

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,800
   

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,290
This differential equations
problem was literally just a

72
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,209
problem in using the
quadratic equation.

73
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,839
And once you figure out
the r's you have

74
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,980
your general solution.

75
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,600
And now we just have to use
our initial conditions.

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,630
So to know the initial
conditions, we need to know y

77
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,780
of x, and we need to
know y prime of x.

78
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,720
Let's just do that right now.

79
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
So what's y prime?

80
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,860
y prime of our general solution
is equal to 3/2 times

81
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:43,660
c1 e to the 3/2 x, plus--
derivative of the inside-- 1/2

82
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,730
times c2 e to the 1/2 x.

83
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,600
   

84
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,930
And now let's use our actual
initial conditions.

85
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,940
I don't want to lose them-- let
me rewrite them down here

86
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,860
so I can scroll down.

87
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,345
So we know that y of 0 is equal
to 2, and y prime of 0

88
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:02,690
is equal to 1/2.

89
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,110
Those are our initial
conditions.

90
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,480
So let's use that information.

91
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,240
So y of 0-- what happens
when you substitute x

92
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,140
is equal to 0 here.?

93
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,530
You get c1 times e to the 0,
essentially, so that's just 1,

94
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,010
plus c2-- well that's just e to
the 0 again, because x is

95
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,070
0-- is equal to-- so this is,
when x is equal to 0, what is

96
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,780
y? y is equal to 2.

97
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,150
Y of 0 is equal to 2.

98
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,180
And then let's use the
second equation.

99
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,930
So when we substitute x is equal
to 0 in the derivative--

100
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:45,740
so when x is 0 we get 3/2 c1--
this goes to 1 again-- plus

101
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:53,116
1/2 c2-- this is 1 again, e to
the 1/2 half times 0 is e to

102
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:58,110
the 0, which is 1-- is equal
to-- so when x is 0 for the

103
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,080
derivative, y is equal to 1/2,
or the derivative is 1/2 at

104
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,230
that point, or the slope
is 1/2 at that point.

105
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:09,680
And now we have two equations
and two unknowns, and we could

106
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,630
solve it a ton of ways.

107
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,730
I think you know how
to solve them.

108
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,060
Let's multiply the top
equation-- I don't know--

109
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,360
let's multiply it by 3/2,
and what do we get?

110
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,800
We get-- I'll do it in a
different color-- we get 3/2

111
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:37,970
c1 plus 3/2 c2 is equal to--
what's 3/2 times 2?

112
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,490
It's equal to 3.

113
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,810
And now, let's subtract-- well,
I don't want to confuse

114
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,780
you, so let's just subtract the
bottom from the top, so

115
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,050
this cancels out.

116
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,140
What's 1/2 minus 3/2?

117
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,810
1/2 minus 1 and 1/2.

118
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,940
Well, that's just
minus 1, right?

119
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,970
So minus c2 is equal to--
what's 1/2 minus 3?

120
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,570
It's minus 2 and 1/2,
or minus 5/2.

121
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,910
   

122
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,040
And so we get c2 is
equal to 5/2.

123
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,570
And we can substitute back
in this top equation.

124
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:23,570
c1 plus 5/2 is equal to 2, or c1
is equal to 2, which is the

125
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:30,380
same thing as 4/2, minus 5/2,
which is equal to minus 1/2.

126
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,110
And now we can just substitute
c1 and c2 back into our

127
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,720
general solution and we have
found the particular solution

128
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,790
of this differential equation,
which is y is equal to c1-- c1

129
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:58,320
is minus 1/2-- minus 1/2 e to
the 3/2 x plus c2-- c2 is

130
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:10,920
5/2-- plus c2, which is 5/2, e
to the 1/2 x, and we are done.

131
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,600
And it might seem
really fancy.

132
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,770
We're solving a differential
equation.

133
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,080
Our solution has e in it.

134
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,670
We're taking derivatives
and we're doing

135
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,070
all sorts of things.

136
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,660
But really the meat of this
problem was solving a

137
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,360
quadratic, which was our
characteristic equation.

138
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,650
And watch the previous video
just to see why this

139
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,180
characteristic equation works.

140
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,230
But it's very easy to come up
with the characteristic

141
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,039
equation, right?

142
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,770
I think you obviously see that
y prime turns into r squared,

143
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,620
y prime turns into r, and then
y just turns into 1,

144
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,840
essentially.

145
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,600
So you solve a quadratic.

146
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,750
And then after doing that,
you just have to take one

147
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,880
derivative-- because after
solving the quadratic, you

148
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,410
immediately have the general
solution-- then you take its

149
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,410
derivative, use your
initial conditions.

150
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,040
You have a system of linear
equations which is Algebra I.

151
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,030
And then you solve them for the
two constants, c1 and c2,

152
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,680
and you end up with your
particular solution.

153
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,950
And that's all there is to it.

154
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,800
I will see you in
the next video.

155
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:09,900
