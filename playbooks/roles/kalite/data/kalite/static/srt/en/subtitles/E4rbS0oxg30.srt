1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,956
In the last video, I've mentioned how I've been asked

2
00:00:02,956 --> 00:00:05,903
to make predicitons for the year 2060.

3
00:00:05,903 --> 00:00:08,015
In the last one I've focused on education,

4
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:11,669
that's obviously what I'm working on now, and I have some opinions on that.

5
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:17,109
But what I want to do in this video is do maybe slightly more broad and wild predictions,

6
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:23,273
and my one prediction I'll make is on probably not going to predict the real reality of 2060

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,934
and the probably big things to predict, I will completely miss.

8
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:29,469
But with that out of the way, it's fun to predict things, so let's give it a shot.

9
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:35,669
So the first area that I will predict is what is going to happen in the field of medicine.

10
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:39,870
And in particular I think that the human life span is going to increase dramatically.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,938
So, I'll be conservative, and say that the average human lifespan

12
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:48,273
is going to be, especially in the developed world

13
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:52,136
and hopefully by the year 2060 most of the world is developed,

14
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:55,953
the average human lifespan is going to be over 100 years old.

15
00:00:55,953 --> 00:00:58,964
And I won't say whether that's going to be a good or a bad thing.

16
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:03,957
There's arguments either way about the proper way to live

17
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:06,728
and what happens to global populations.

18
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:10,286
But if the world is for the most part developed and educated,

19
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:16,137
you actually will probably have a lower rate of reproduction

20
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:20,196
and so you might actually have some space in the world for older people.

21
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:24,413
But there is a very strong chance of this happening,

22
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:29,554
Because we are starting to understand the molecular basis of aging.

23
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:34,952
It's not a given thing that because of some form of wear tear

24
00:01:34,952 --> 00:01:39,407
things have to die after 70 years or 80 years or 90 years.

25
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:40,786
And we are starting to understand the mechanisms

26
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:45,017
and how to maybe improve the repair mechanisms or how to augment in some way.

27
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:47,126
So I definietly think this is going to happen.

28
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,563
I don't know if it's going to be a positive or a negative,

29
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:52,052
but it's likely to happen.

30
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:55,607
The next thing, and this is kind of closely related, this is still biological,

31
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:58,800
is you are going to have a close integration between

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,963
the digital and the biological.

33
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:10,208
And once again, I won't make any statement wheter this is a good or a bad thing,

34
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,805
but it seem that like it is just an extrapolation

35
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:14,739
of the direction we are already going in.

36
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:17,870
Digital and biological integration.

37
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,208
So already you are gettin more and more in your hand-held devices,

38
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,733
imagine, when your your screen is no longer in your palm,

39
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,001
but is being projected onto your retina from some little thing.

40
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:30,875
And then eventually, you have a direct connection with your retina

41
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:35,197
and your brain can directly access areas of memory

42
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:40,667
through some biological and digital interface.

43
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:43,287
So I definitely think this is going to happen. This is a big deal,

44
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:48,208
and I think this is already happening with a lot what you see around technology,

45
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:55,001
it is really going to reshape what the individual human experience is going to be,

46
00:02:55,001 --> 00:03:01,137
we already see people kind of living in virtual realities and playing these immersive games

47
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:03,666
and spending all of their time on social networking platforms.

48
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,645
What happens when they are literally plugged in all the time,

49
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,048
when almost their cell phone is in the brain, I don't know,

50
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:12,733
I am not going to comment whether it is a good or a bad thing,

51
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:17,456
but it does look like a trend that is going to keep on going through the next 50 years.

52
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:22,462
Now, if you take that even further, we are talking about digital and biological integration,

53
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:27,468
but if you go to the extreme, and actually it is probably both of these top two things combined in some way,

54
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:31,538
is that we are learning, and once again, not making comment whether it is good or bad,

55
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:33,643
it is just an extrapolation of what we already see,

56
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:38,790
we are seeing more and more ability to understand our genome,

57
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,609
to molecularly target things, to manipulate actual biology.

58
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:51,008
And so, what you have is that you can actually have manipulation of biology.

59
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:56,468
And while this is on some level creepy, it could be creepy or it could be exciting,

60
00:03:56,468 --> 00:04:01,145
depending on how it all plays out, but it could do things like

61
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:04,608
augment human intelligence.

62
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:07,804
Which would, if you think about all of the progress of society

63
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:10,688
and all of the things that are already accelerating,

64
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:16,021
imagine how society will change if intelligence itself is augmented.

65
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:21,736
As someone with a limited intelligence I can't even imagine what will happen as soon as you do this.

66
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:26,708
And obviously, the more you augmented intelligence, the more that you can learn

67
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,010
how to augment intelligence and increase lifespan

68
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,005
and do digital and biological integration even more.

69
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:36,144
So these things I see as some form of a trend.

70
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:39,933
We will se how it all plays out. And hopefully it plays out in

71
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:46,744
the field good carebear version versus the kind of some type of crazy society

72
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,072
and we all turn into the borg in some way.

73
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:54,806
Now the other trend, and these are just the things that popped in my brain today when I pressed record,

74
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:58,560
but the other tred that I think is interesting is some of the things

75
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,805
that we have taken for granted in terms of how nations interact with each other,

76
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:05,733
and nation-states in particular interact with each other.

77
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:12,335
And just a kind of a overview, so there is a notion called a nation-state,

78
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:15,804
in everyday language the word nation and the word state

79
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:18,667
almost mean the same thing, but they kind of mean different things.

80
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:22,873
If you want to be more formal about it, that's why people use the word nation-state,

81
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:26,733
that doen't mean the same thing like saying a state-state,

82
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:30,401
the difference between a nation and a state is

83
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:32,543
these are group of people that feel some type of common identity.

84
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,267
It could be a language, it could be a culture, it could be a value system.

85
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:39,468
So this is some kind of common identity.

86
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:43,539
And it often is somehow associated with geography,

87
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:45,222
but it does not have to be associated with geography,

88
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:48,872
it could even be a religion or it could be whatever else. That's what a nation is.

89
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:53,405
A state is a formal governence structure

90
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:58,801
that makes the laws and has the institutions to make society function.

91
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:02,067
Now, a nation-state is what most of us live in today,

92
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:05,872
because it both has an indentity and some type of formal institutions.

93
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:09,874
So a very pure nation-state would be some place like Japan

94
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:18,121
where there is relatively uniform in term of ethnicity and religion and in terms of culture,

95
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:23,253
and you have that same group of people governing themselves.

96
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:27,228
In a place like the Unites States, ethnicity, religion, that is diverse,

97
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:33,625
but what gives indentity is a notion of shared values, and a notion of maybe a common history

98
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,038
or whatever else for a certain kind of world view

99
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,403
and obiously there is a formal state sructure.

100
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:42,211
Now, what is going to be interesting here, I actually have no idea

101
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:44,621
how all of this is going to play out,

102
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,872
but when you things like the some of the revolitions in the Middle East

103
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:53,145
to do the things like peolple being able to communicate irrespective of the traditional media,

104
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:58,477
I think there is going to be some interesting questions on what happens to the nation-state.

105
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:03,137
Especially nation-states that are able to secure their power

106
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:07,335
by kind of having a bullneck on access to information.

107
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:10,377
And all of that is I think going to change in a very dramatic way,

108
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:14,669
as you have more and more integration between people, cross-border comminication

109
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:17,204
when people realize that people on the other side of the borded

110
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,289
really aren't that different than themselves.

111
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:22,958
And another interesting thing, even the notion of democracy,

112
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,133
and once again, I don't know how it is going to play out,

113
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:29,870
but all notions of representational democracy that we have today

114
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,267
are somewhat based on geography.

115
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:38,874
And that is because when the major representational democracies came about,

116
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:41,000
that was the best way to represent each other:

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,041
hey, let me pick some representatives from our county or from our region

118
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,937
and they will go elect other representatives and they will go to the national government,

119
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:50,410
but now that we have this instantaneous communication with people,

120
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,462
you might be able to have different types of a representational democracy,

121
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:56,676
and maybe you can even have more direct democracy,

122
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:02,621
who knows, because of things like communication and technology and whatever else.

123
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:06,403
And then the other way that the nation, the way they fundamentally interact

124
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,068
is going to change is actually in things like warfare,

125
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:11,469
and once again, already seeing this trend,

126
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:17,545
in particular, I think developed countries are not going to have humans on the front line.

127
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:21,137
No humans on the front line.

128
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:24,137
And depending on you point of view, this could be a very good thing

129
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,136
or could be a kind of a scary thing.

130
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:28,269
Because if you have no humans on the front line,

131
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:33,443
and you are already seeing things like this with these Predator Drones

132
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:41,440
and you see these robot bomb detectors and all things like that,

133
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,714
and it doesn't really have to be these big things,

134
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:46,611
there is already a DARPA-founded project to work on military insects

135
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:48,876
that could be used as some kind of reconnaissance

136
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,403
or you can imagine that eventually they could have these little things on

137
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:53,461
to conduct on someone other, who know what they do.

138
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:59,069
The exciting thing is that all of a sudden a human won't be there to get shot

139
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:02,201
and so hopefully military casualties would go down,

140
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:06,288
the scary thing here is if you don't have humans on the front line,

141
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:11,469
nations might be willing to enter into war, especially developed nations,

142
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:13,628
they might not take it this serioiusly,

143
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:17,622
and so it might be something that they do a little bit more when they are in the mood,

144
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:20,961
and it would actually create a huge disparity between

145
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,865
developed and developing nations when this happends.

146
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:25,291
You already see that to a certain degree.

147
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,210
A developed nation, they don't have to put as many humans in harm's way,

148
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,337
and it is purely driven by their wealth to have capital

149
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:37,958
that can go into these robots and these drones, and their technological innovations,

150
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,735
while in the developing countries they actually would have to

151
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:46,743
use human beings so their cause would be much much higher.

152
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:48,668
So it is an interesting question, and once again,

153
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:54,533
who knows how this plays out, whether it is a good or bad thing in the long term.

154
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:58,958
I think a similar thing with this is we are going to see

155
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,375
more and more non-lethal weapons,

156
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,137
which, once again, it is very similar to this,

157
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,880
it sounds like it is a good thing, you know,

158
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,338
if there is a gun that instead of having to kill someone,

159
00:10:11,338 --> 00:10:15,139
it encompasses them in some way, stuns them in some,

160
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,706
kind of the classic Star Trek 'put your phasers on stun' things.

161
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:23,467
The, I guess, scarier version of non-lethal weapons is

162
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:26,294
the treshold for using it becomes much lower.

163
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:29,469
So for government, you know, once to subjected citizens

164
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:31,709
are subjected to another group of citizens,

165
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:36,136
it can literally just stun them, make them pass out or control them in some way,

166
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,079
so this could be a little bit scarier.

167
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,122
So who knows how all of this plays out.

168
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:46,293
So those are my predictions or things to think about over the next 50 years.

169
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:50,212
These are just the things happened to jump into my brain today,

170
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:54,001
probably basen on some of the science-fiction books I have been reading or whatever else,

171
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,374
but take in what the huge grade of sold,

172
00:10:56,374 --> 00:10:58,569
I don't know whether these things are really going to happen or not,

173
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:01,136
and I don't know if they are even a good thing or not,

174
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:05,136
but they seem to be a bit of an extrapolation of what we have already seen.
