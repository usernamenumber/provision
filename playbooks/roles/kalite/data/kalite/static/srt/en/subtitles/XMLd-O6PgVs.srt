1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,690
In the last video we talked
about ionization energy, or

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,925
the energy required to
remove an electron.

3
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:10,190
And we saw the general trend
in the periodic table, that

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,310
when you're in the bottom
left-hand side close to

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,590
cesium, cesium really wants
to give up electrons.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,820
It's a big atom.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,360
It only has one extra electron
in its sixth shell.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,870
It can just give it up,
and then it'll have

9
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,190
five complete shells.

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,250
So it really wants to give it
away, so it requires very

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,040
little energy to ionize.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,840
On the complete other side of
the spectrum, helium requires

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,220
a lot of energy to ionize.

14
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,170
It's very happy.

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,850
I has a full shell at
the first shell.

16
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,990
It's a very small atom.

17
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,860
The electrons are very
close to the protons.

18
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,920
So the coulomb force is
super-duper-duper strong.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,260
So it takes a lot of energy
to remove that incremental

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,270
electron, and we learned that.

21
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,240
And the one thing I want to
cover before moving on to

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,260
other types of trends or
properties amongst the

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,395
different atoms is the idea of
a second ionization energy.

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,080
And I want to do this because
sometimes it's covered on some

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,280
chemistry exams or some
chemistry standardized tests.

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,810
And it's just the idea that
ionization energy is the

27
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,700
energy required to remove the
first electron, to go from a

28
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,450
neutral state to popping
one electron off of it.

29
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,350
The second ionization energy is,
then, the energy required

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,720
to remove the very
next electron.

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,010
And the reason why this is
interesting, is sometimes

32
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,510
they'll say, OK, what elements
have a very high second

33
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,100
ionization energy?

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,930
And your temptation would be,
OK, high ionization energy,

35
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,740
that also probably means high
second ionization energy.

36
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,860
And that might be true.

37
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,520
For example, neon has a very
high ionization energy, It

38
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,310
really wants to keep that 10th
electron, because it fills out

39
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,090
the second shell.

40
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,900
And then, of course, even if you
were able to remove that

41
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,300
electron, to remove the ninth
electron, when now its

42
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,950
configuration looks a
lot like fluorine,

43
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,950
that's still very difficult.

44
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,620
So you'd say its second
ionization energy

45
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,370
is still very high.

46
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:10,419
But if you think about it, the
elements with the highest

47
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,710
second ionization energies are
going to be some of the

48
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,340
elements with the lowest
ionization energy.

49
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,630
So, think about it.

50
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,880
And that might be kind
of confusing.

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,820
Lithium, for example.

52
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,380
Very low ionization energy.

53
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,150
It's got that extra electron.

54
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,660
It just wants to give it away.

55
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,080
But once it gives it away,
it's in a very stable

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,490
situation, Then its electron

57
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,580
configuration looks like helium.

58
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,730
So to remove that second
electron is

59
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,760
super-duper-duper difficult.

60
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,950
So lithium has a very high
second ionization energy.

61
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,660
And so you might run into a
question where they're like,

62
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,240
which of these elements has the
biggest difference between

63
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,610
their ionization energy and
their second ionization

64
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,940
energy, where their second
ionization energy is higher

65
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,490
than their ionization energy.

66
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,840
And lithium, or anything in
group one, that would be true,

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,040
because as soon as you remove
one electron, its electron

68
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,540
configuration becomes super
stable, so removing that

69
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,320
second one is super-duper
difficult.

70
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,120
And you also see this
in this chart.

71
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,820
This is, of course, the first
ionization energies.

72
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,050
But let's say, the case
with lithium, you

73
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,020
removed that electron.

74
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,790
It was very easy.

75
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,640
You only needed five electron
volts to do it.

76
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,170
But then your configuration
looks a lot like helium.

77
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,210
So that second ionization energy
is going to look a lot

78
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,330
like helium's first
ionization energy.

79
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,860
Anyway, I don't want to
confuse you too much.

80
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,960
But that's an interesting point
that might pop up every

81
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,050
now and then.

82
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,510
Now another property, which is
in a lot of ways, in my mind,

83
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,570
related is the idea of
electronegativity.

84
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:44,000
The concept came up
by Linus Pauling.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,710
I always remember him.

86
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,970
He was a famous chemist. What
I always remember is that he

87
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,180
was famous for being convinced
that Vitamin C was kind of the

88
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,540
key to living forever.

89
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,780
And he would take huge
doses of Vitamin C.

90
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,630
I should probably read
up on that again.

91
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,310
I don't want to spread lies
about Linus Pauling.

92
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,920
But I remember reading that
when I was in high school.

93
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,620
But anyway, he came up with the
idea of electronegativity.

94
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,360
And the idea is that when two
atoms form covalent bonds--

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,860
and I haven't taught you what a
covalent bond is, and I was

96
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,769
planning on doing that in a
couple of videos from now--

97
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,910
but the idea of a covalent
bond is really just atoms

98
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,790
sharing electrons.

99
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,780
Let me draw that out.

100
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,000
So if I have oxygen, oxygen
looks something like this.

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,010
I could draw it like that.

102
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,310
I could also draw oxygen like
this, just because I'm going

103
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,350
to use these extra electrons
to bond.

104
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,540
And if you take oxygen like
that and you add it to two

105
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,300
hydrogens-- hydrogen
has one electron--

106
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,560
what's going to happen?

107
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,440
You might not know yet, if you
haven't seen a covalent bond.

108
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,040
But the atoms will actually
share electrons.

109
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,960
So this oxygen, you put
it in the center.

110
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,706
You have these, over here.

111
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:58,180
Let me draw it like that.

112
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,660
The electrons from oxygen
I'll do in green.

113
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,740
And then hydrogen, I'll just
do it in this orange color.

114
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,640
So we have two of
these hydrogens.

115
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,940
So one hydrogen will be there.

116
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,180
And then the other hydrogen
will be there.

117
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,620
Now what just happened?

118
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,310
Well if this hydrogen can
pretend that both of these

119
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,290
electrons, it has to kind
of share this green

120
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,310
one with the oxygen.

121
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,850
And the deal is, hey, I share
the green one and you let me

122
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,710
borrow the green one, and I'll
let you borrow the orange one,

123
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,410
we both can kind of feel like
we have a stable electron

124
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,420
configuration.

125
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,460
Hydrogen feels good because
the one s-shell

126
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,790
is completely filled.

127
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,420
Oxygen fills great because
it's valence shell is

128
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,840
completely filled with
eight electrons, two

129
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,570
of which are borrowed.

130
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,340
So it feels great.

131
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,200
This is a covalent
bond, where the

132
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,580
atoms are sharing electrons.

133
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,910
And so this sometimes will
be drawn like this.

134
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,320
Oxygen.

135
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,415
Those are the extra electron
pairs of oxygen.

136
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:57,220
And they'll just draw
a line like that.

137
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,650
And that line implicitly is
saying, look, there's two

138
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,310
atoms on either end.

139
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,240
There's the oxygen
electron there.

140
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,660
And then you have the hydrogen
electron there.

141
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,790
And they're kind of shared.

142
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,320
These two things mean
the same thing.

143
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,100
But that line just means
a covalent bond.

144
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,700
Now my whole point behind
talking about covalent bonds a

145
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,890
little prematurely is so
that I can touch on

146
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,140
electronegativity.

147
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,230
And the idea that Linus Pauling
came up with is that

148
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,160
in these covalent bonds, the
sharing is not equal.

149
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,400
That some of the atoms
will hog the

150
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,970
electrons a little more.

151
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,330
So in this case, oxygen.

152
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,720
We learned about oxygen.

153
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,470
Oxygen is way over here.

154
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,080
It loves to grab electrons.

155
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,840
It has a very high ionization
energy.

156
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,780
It's only two away from having
an electron configuration

157
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,560
similar to neon and being
super-duper happy.

158
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,420
So oxygen loves electrons.

159
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,350
Hydrogen is a little
bit here or there.

160
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,420
It could gain an electron
and then it'll

161
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,320
have a stable 1s orbital.

162
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,470
Or it could lose an electron and
it will essentially just

163
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,780
turn into a positive ion.

164
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,700
It can go either way.

165
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,810
So it's a little bit more
ambivalent about what happens

166
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,760
relative to the electrons.

167
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,030
But oxygen really wants
the electrons so

168
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,300
that it can get completed.

169
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,880
So in this relationship between
oxygen and hydrogen,

170
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,950
oxygen is more electronegative.

171
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,090
It's more electronegative, which
means it kind of hogs

172
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,700
the electrons a little
bit more.

173
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,740
So if you were to draw this
relationship here, it might

174
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,660
look something-- If you were
to draw this bond.

175
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,480
This is all abstract.

176
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,590
Maybe you would draw
it a little bit

177
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,770
heavier on that side.

178
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,380
And this is not really at
all a convention, but I

179
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,250
just made that up.

180
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,630
Or if you just drew the hydrogen
and the oxygen part

181
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,680
of it, maybe the electrons
spend most of their time

182
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,120
around-- this is a probability
distribution-- and less of

183
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,790
their time around hydrogen.

184
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,720
And that would be true for
the other hydrogen.

185
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,600
They spend less of their time
around the hydrogen and a lot

186
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,570
more of their time around
the oxygen.

187
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,590
The idea of electronegativity is
just that one atom is going

188
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,670
to hog the electrons more when
you form a covalent bond.

189
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,740
Now if we wanted to figure out
the trend of electronegativity

190
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,870
on the periodic table, what do
you think's going to happen?

191
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,390
Which elements are likely
to hog electrons?

192
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,050
Well, the ones that
love electrons.

193
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,330
The ones that it's
very hard to take

194
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,450
electrons away from them.

195
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:35,039
The ones that are super-close
to completing a full eight

196
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,480
valence electrons in their
outermost shell.

197
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,280
So the most electronegative
atoms are

198
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,760
going to be right here.

199
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,549
They're going to be the
halogens, especially the

200
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,240
fluorine, because the small ones
want the electrons even

201
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,400
more because they're
a small atom.

202
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,670
The electrons are going to get
closer to the nucleus.

203
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,320
And the reason why I'm not
talking about the noble gases

204
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,300
here is because these don't
form covalent bonds.

205
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,150
They're always happy.

206
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,850
They're all these inert gases.

207
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,995
Inert just means that they
don't do anything.

208
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:04,920
A similar word is inertia.

209
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,570
Inertia means the tendency to
want to stay at rest, not do

210
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,600
anything, or stay in motion,
but I won't go

211
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,450
into that too much.

212
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,240
But these are inert.

213
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,020
They don't do anything.

214
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,510
So these guys react.

215
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,180
They form covalent
bonds up here.

216
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,170
And when they form covalent
bonds, they hog the atoms [correction: electrons].

217
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,240
Likewise, when these guys down
here form covalent bonds,

218
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,000
they're like, you know what,
you can have the atoms [correction: electrons]. I

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,640
don't need them.

220
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,500
I'm actually happier without
them altogether.

221
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,330
In fact, sometimes these
guys actually just

222
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,620
give away the atom [correction: electron].

223
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,340
They don't even form
a covalent bond.

224
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,490
It's called an ionic bond.

225
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,320
We'll talk about that
in the next video.

226
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,620
But as you can see, the trend
is the same as it is for

227
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,180
ionization energy.

228
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,010
These guys, a lot of
energy required

229
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,970
to remove an electron.

230
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,730
That's because they
love electrons.

231
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,890
So these guys are also
very electronegative.

232
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,930
They're going to hog the
electrons in a covalent bond.

233
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,620
These guys, very low
ionization energy.

234
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,060
Very easy to take an electron
away from them.

235
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,650
And that's why they have very
low electronegativity.

236
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,480
They're very unlikely to hog
an electron in a bond.

237
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,050
Now the other trend that some
people sometimes talk about is

238
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,095
the metallic nature
of an element.

239
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,680
And so, there's a lot of things
that, in my mind, I

240
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,700
imagine when someone talks
about metallic nature, I

241
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,230
imagine it should conduct
electricity, it should be

242
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,980
shiny, it should be malleable.

243
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,240
I can bend it without
it cracking.

244
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,840
That's how I imagine
metallic nature.

245
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,560
But when people talk about it
in chemistry, they're really

246
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,470
just talking about
a willingness

247
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,270
to give away electrons.

248
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,140
That's metallic nature.

249
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,600
And that is important.

250
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,430
If you talk about something
that's going to conduct

251
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,320
electricity or be malleable or
have this sea of electrons

252
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,280
available that the
atoms can sit in.

253
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,890
But the same trend.

254
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,810
Which atoms are very likely
to give away electrons?

255
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,290
Well, the bottom left, right?

256
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,300
As you go down, the atom gets
bigger, so the electrons are

257
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,850
further away from the nucleus.

258
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:14,400
So the coulomb force is weaker,
so those electrons are

259
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,810
more weakly bound.

260
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,080
And also, if you just have one
extra electron here or two

261
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,162
extra electrons there in your
outermost shell, you're just

262
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:24,420
like, hey, let me get rid of
them and then I'll have a

263
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,030
complete outer shell.

264
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,880
So these guys want to
give away electrons.

265
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,290
So they have a very high
metallic nature.

266
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,450
These guys want to
keep electrons.

267
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,560
And they want to take more.

268
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,460
So they have a very low
metallic nature.

269
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,150
In fact these are completely
non-metallic in any way.

270
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,680
And if you were to say, within a
group, the trend-- I mean, I

271
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,290
did the diagonal, but that's in
general true-- is that the

272
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:52,960
further you go down a group,
the size of the atom is

273
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,340
increasing and the outer
electrons are

274
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,630
further from the nucleus.

275
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,850
So the electron force is going
to be weaker-- or the coulomb

276
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,690
force is going to be weaker.

277
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,060
So you're more likely to
give away electrons.

278
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,990
So your metallic nature will
increase as you go down.

279
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,230
And your metallic nature will
increase as you go to the

280
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,365
left, because when you only have
a couple of electrons in

281
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,800
your outermost shell, you
want to give them away.

282
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,780
So metallic nature, it goes
in the opposite direction.

283
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,660
It goes like that.

284
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,890
But for the same reason.

285
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,440
These guys love to
hog electrons.

286
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,680
These guys love to
give them away.

287
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:23,910
Right?

288
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,070
So ionization energy increased
to the top right.

289
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,010
Electronegativity increased
to the top right.

290
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,920
Metallic nature increased
to the bottom left.

291
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,625
The last trend we could talk
about is just atomic radius.

292
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:43,070
And there's a lot of different
ways to actually measure this.

293
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,890
And there's no one best way,
because obviously, we already

294
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,140
talked about it, an atom doesn't
have a fixed radius.

295
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,830
The electron could show up
pretty much anywhere.

296
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,360
So you could just kind of
do a hard boundary.

297
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,695
OK, 90% chance of finding
the electron.

298
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:58,120
That's your sphere
of the atom.

299
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,890
Or you could say, OK, if this
atom bonds with another atom,

300
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,240
what is half the distance
between the two nucleuses.

301
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,470
Right?

302
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,060
If you make a bond like that.

303
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,325
This is the distance between the
two nucleuses and then you

304
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:12,690
can say the atomic
radius is that.

305
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,580
So there's a lot of ways.

306
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,770
But I think you get
the general idea.

307
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,210
It's just the size
of the atom.

308
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,950
And you could already imagine
that as you go down any one

309
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,370
group, the size of the
atom increases.

310
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,850
You're adding on more and
more energy levels,

311
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,300
more and more shells.

312
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,290
The atom is just getting
larger and larger.

313
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,350
In fact, we've used that as an
argument as to why, as you go

314
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,190
down, ionization energy
goes down, or

315
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,340
electronegativity goes down.

316
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:43,550
So the atoms become larger
as you go down.

317
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,290
Now, the one thing that might
be a little un-intuitive is

318
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,770
what happens as you
go to the right?

319
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,070
You're adding electrons as you
go to the right, but you're

320
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,010
adding them all in the
same shell, right?

321
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,610
So if this is the nucleus, right
there, and you're in

322
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,200
some shell, some
orbital shell.

323
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,560
And obviously, they're
not all spheres.

324
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,470
But let's say you're in
some orbital shell.

325
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,900
As you go to the right in a
period, you just keep adding

326
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,430
electrons to that shell.

327
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,640
Right?

328
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,710
This is a super-gross
oversimplification.

329
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,180
And as you go to the right,
you have more

330
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,040
protons in the nucleus.

331
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,680
So this is only getting more and
more positively charged.

332
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,800
So what happens is that these
electrons get pulled inwards.

333
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,170
They get pulled inwards.

334
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,150
So as you move to
the right on the

335
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,670
periodic table, size decreases.

336
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,870
And then you say, OK, but
what about when you

337
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,900
go to the next period?

338
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,210
You're getting more
protons there.

339
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,280
Won't that decrease?

340
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,120
You are.

341
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,330
But at the same time, you're now
adding the electrons in a

342
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,740
new shell that's further
from them.

343
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,390
So it gets larger when you
go to the new period.

344
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,310
So electron size, as
you go down, large.

345
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,405
And as you go to the left,
you get larger.

346
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:10,000
So electron size goes from the
bottom right to the top left.

347
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,940
Although in general, the things
that are in a lower

348
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,420
period will have a larger size
than most things in a higher

349
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,120
period, regardless of
what group it's in.

350
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,950
But the general trend within a
group, the higher the number,

351
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,340
the larger the atom.

352
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,780
Within a period, the more
protons you have,

353
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,690
the smaller the atom.

354
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,080
Anyway, I hope you found
those interesting.

355
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,390
In the next few videos we'll
start with bonding.
