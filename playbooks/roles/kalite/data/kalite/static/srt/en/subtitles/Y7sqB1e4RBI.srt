1
00:00:00,702 --> 00:00:08,503
Let's say that f(x) is equal to the absolute value of x minus three over x minus three

2
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:18,469
and what I'm curious about is the limit of f(x) as x approaches three

3
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:26,767
and just from an inspection you can see that the function is not defined when x is equal to three - you get zero over zero: it's not defined

4
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:32,978
So to answer this question let's try to re-write the same exact function definition slightly differently

5
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:37,768
So let's say f(x) is going to be equal to - and I'm going to think of two cases:

6
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:40,035
I'm going to think of the case when x is greater than three

7
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:42,700
and when x is less than three

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,142
So when x is - I'll do this in two different colors actually

9
00:00:47,142 --> 00:00:51,367
When x - I'll do it in green - that's not green

10
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:53,767
When x is greater than three...

11
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:57,434
When x is greater than three, what does this function simplify to?

12
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,835
Well, whatever I get up here, I'm just taking the..

13
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:02,375
I'm going to get a positive value up here and then I'm...

14
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:05,421
Well, if I take the absolute value it's going to be the exact same thing, so let me...

15
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:13,412
For x is greater than three, this is going to be the exact same thing as x minus three over x minus three

16
00:01:13,412 --> 00:01:21,300
because if x is greater than three, the numerator's going to be positive, you take the absolute value of that, you're not going to change its value

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,500
so you get this right over here or, if we were to re-write it...

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,633
...if we were to re-write it, this is equal to, for x is greater than three, you're going to have f(x) is equal to one

19
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,696
for x is greater than three

20
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:38,012
Similarly, let's think about what happens when x is less than three

21
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:44,224
When x is less than three, well, x minus three is going to be a negative number

22
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:47,471
When you take the absolute value of that, you're essentially negating it

23
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:53,939
so it's going to be the negative of x minus three over x minus three

24
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,644
or if you were to simplify these two things, for any value as long as x doesn't equal three

25
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:03,235
this part right over her simplifies to one, so you are left with a negative one

26
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:06,738
negative one for x is less than three

27
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:09,761
I encourage you, if you don't believe what I just said, try it out with some numbers

28
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:10,834
Try out some numbers:

29
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:15,302
3.1, 3.001, 3.5, 4, 7

30
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,900
Any number greater than three, you're going to get one

31
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,963
You're going to get the same thing divided by the same thing

32
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:21,969
and try values for x less than three:

33
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:24,963
you're going to get negative one no matter what you try

34
00:02:24,963 --> 00:02:28,635
So let's visualise this function now

35
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:32,070
So, now you draw some axes...

36
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,849
That's my x- axis

37
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,769
and then this is my...

38
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:40,500
This is my f(x) axis - y is equal to f(x)

39
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,633
and what we care about is x is equal to three

40
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:47,635
so x is equal to one, two, three, four, five

41
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,872
and we could keep going...

42
00:02:48,872 --> 00:02:53,233
and let's say this is positive one, two, so that's y is equal to one

43
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:56,233
this is y is equal to negative one and negative two

44
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,548
and we can keep going...

45
00:02:57,548 --> 00:02:59,969
So this way that we have re-written the function

46
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,040
is the exact same function as this

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,567
we've just written [it] in a different way

48
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,003
and so what we're saying is...

49
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:05,634
is we're...

50
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:07,161
Our function is undefined at three

51
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:10,796
but if our x is greater than three, our function is equal to one

52
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:14,501
so if our x is greater than three, our function is equal to one

53
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,752
so it looks like...

54
00:03:15,752 --> 00:03:19,838
It looks like that, and it's undefined at three

55
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:23,312
and if x is less than three our function is equal to negative one

56
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:26,678
so it looks like - I'll be doing that same color

57
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:28,212
It looks like this...

58
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:30,169
It looks like...

59
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,567
Looks like this...

60
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:34,836
Once again, it's undefined at three

61
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:36,498
So it looks like that

62
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:38,303
So now let's try to answer our question:

63
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:41,833
What is the limit as x approaches three?

64
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,230
Well, let's think about the limit as x approaches three

65
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,567
from the negative direction, from values less than three

66
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,924
So let's think about first the limit...

67
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:52,831
...the limit, as x approaches three...

68
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:57,767
...as x approaches three, the limit of f(x)...

69
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:00,512
...as x approaches three from the negative direction

70
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:04,400
and all this notation here - I wrote this negative as a superscript right after the three - says

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,567
Let's think about the limit as we're approaching...

72
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:07,636
...let me make this clear...

73
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:11,069
Let's think about the limit as we're approaching from the left

74
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,033
So in this case, if we get closer...

75
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:14,235
If we get...

76
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:16,450
If we start with values lower than three

77
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,620
as we get closer and closer and closer...

78
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,034
So, say we start at zero, f(x) is equal to negative one

79
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:23,634
We go to one, f(x) is equal to negative one

80
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:25,767
We go to two, f(x) is equal to negative one

81
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:30,769
If you go to 2.999999, f(x) is equal to negative one

82
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,380
So it looks like it is approaching negative one if you approach..

83
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,367
...if you approach from the left-hand side

84
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,285
Now let's think about the limit...

85
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:41,625
...the limit of f(x)...

86
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:48,690
...the limit of f(x) as x approaches three from the positive direction, from values greater than three

87
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,149
So here we see, when x is equal to five, f(x) is equal to one

88
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:55,968
When x is equal to four, f(x) is equal to one

89
00:04:55,968 --> 00:05:01,368
When x is equal to 3.0000001, f(x) is equal to one

90
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,305
So it seems to be approaching...

91
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:06,033
It seems to be approaching positive one

92
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:08,101
So now we have something strange

93
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:11,367
We seem to be approaching a different value when we approach from the left

94
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:14,094
than when we approach from the right

95
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:19,347
and if we are approaching two different values then the limit does not exist

96
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:27,951
So this limit right over here does not exist

97
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:30,209
or another way of saying it:

98
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,403
The limit...

99
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:34,165
...the limit of...

100
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:37,563
(Let me write this in a new color - I have a little idea here)

101
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:47,968
...the limit of a function f(x) as x approaches some value c is equal to L if and only if...

102
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:57,763
...if and only if the limit of f(x) as x approaches c from the negative direction is equal to the limit

103
00:05:57,763 --> 00:06:06,033
of f(x) as x approaches c from the positive direction which is equal to L

104
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,354
This did not happen here -

105
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:10,093
the limit when we approached the left was negative one,

106
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:12,351
the limit when we approached from the right was positive one,

107
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,401
So we did not get the same limits when we approached from either side

108
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:19,401
So the limit does not exist in this case
