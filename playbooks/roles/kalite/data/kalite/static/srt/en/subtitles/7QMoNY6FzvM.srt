1
00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:06,689
We're asked to graph the equation y=-2(x-2)^2 + 5.

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,469
So let me get my scratchpad out so we can think about this.

3
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:16,806
So it's y=-2(x-2)^2 + 5

4
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:22,870
So one thing when you see a quadratic, or a parabola, a graph expressed in this way,

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,354
a thing that might jump out at you

6
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:26,803
is that this term right over here

7
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:30,944
is always going to be positive cause it's some quantity squared

8
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:35,290
non-negative, it could be equal to zero, so it's always going to be

9
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:39,876
some quantity squared, and then we're multiplying it by a negative, so this whole quantity

10
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:42,937
this whole quantity right over here is going to be non-positive

11
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:46,101
it's always going to be less than or equal to zero

12
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:51,775
so this thing is always less than or equal to zero, the maximum

13
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:55,853
value that y will take on

14
00:00:55,853 --> 00:00:59,689
is when this thing actually does equal zero. So the maximum value

15
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:02,538
for y is at 5, so y

16
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:08,003
the maximum value for y is 5, and when does that happen?

17
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:12,266
Well y hits 5 when this whole thing is 0, and when does this thing equal 0?

18
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:15,964
Well this whole thing equals 0 when x-2 = 0

19
00:01:15,964 --> 00:01:18,540
and x-2 = 0 when x=2

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,144
so the point (2, 5) is the maximum point for this parabola and it is

21
00:01:23,144 --> 00:01:27,269
actually going to be the vertex. So if we were to graph this,

22
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:30,467
so the point (2, 5)

23
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:35,351
so that's my y-axis, this is my x-axis

24
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:39,334
so this is 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

25
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,875
so this right over here is a point (2, 5).

26
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:47,471
This is a maximum point for this parabola, and

27
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:51,105
now I want to find two more points so that I can really determine the parabola. 3 points

28
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:54,534
determine, completely determine, a parabola. So that's one,

29
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:59,106
the vertex, that's interesting. Now what I like to do is just get two points that are

30
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:02,882
equidistant from the vertex, and the easiest way to do that is to

31
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:06,945
maybe just figure out what happens when x=1

32
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:11,192
and when x=3. So I can make a table here actually

33
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:15,276
to do that. So I care about x

34
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:19,025
being equal to 1, 2, and 3, and what the corresponding y is

35
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:22,968
We already know that when x=2, y=5.

36
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:26,804
(2, 5) is our vertex. When x=1,

37
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:30,601
1-2 is -1, squared is just 1

38
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:34,620
so this thing is going to be -2 + 5, so it's gonna be 3

39
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,206
and when x=3, this is 3-2, which is 1, squared is 1

40
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:42,268
times -2 is -2 + 5 is 3 as well

41
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:45,363
so we have 3 points. We have the point (1, 3),

42
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:50,608
the point (2, 5), and the point

43
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:55,026
(3, 3) for

44
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:57,212
this parabola. So let me go back to the exercise and I should

45
00:02:57,212 --> 00:03:01,541
put those three points in. So we have the point

46
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:07,517
(1, 3), there's a point (2, 5)

47
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:10,538
and we have the point (3, 3)

48
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:14,538
and we have now fully determined our parabola.
