1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:08,951
The number 36 is 3 times as large as 12. Write this comparison as a multiplication equation.

2
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:20,149
So they're saying the number 36 (I'll type "36") is equal to 3 times 12.

3
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:24,275
And I used this little star thing (asterick "*")... let's see, if I put an "x" there, would that have worked as well?

4
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,149
No, they would have viewed that as 3x.

5
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:32,483
So... to get this little star thing (asterick) which is normally how you would show multiplication on a computer...

6
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:40,718
You have to press "shift" and the number "8". And it also shows up on a numeric keypad.

7
00:00:40,718 --> 00:00:43,018
By doing that I was able to show multiplication.

8
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:50,846
So this can be read as, "36 is equal to 3 times 12". Or "36 is 3 times as large as 12".

9
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:56,051
So let's check our answer. Got it right! Let's do a couple more of these...

10
00:00:56,051 --> 00:01:04,578
We can compare 4 and 20 using addition by saying that 20 is 16 more than 4.

11
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:06,180
Fair enough, that's right.

12
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,468
We could also compare 4 and 20 using multiplication.

13
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:13,646
Fill in the blank correctly to compare the numbers 4 and 20 using multiplication.

14
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:18,470
So they're saying "20 is (blank) times as large as 4".

15
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,245
Well we know that 4 times 5 is 20. Or that 5 times 4 is 20.

16
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:30,581
So 20 is 5 times as large as 4. If I take 4 five times, I'll get to 20.

17
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:33,885
(So let me check my answer... there you go.)

18
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,447
Let's do one more...

19
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:38,913
The number 6 is 3 times as large as 2.

20
00:01:38,913 --> 00:01:41,911
Write this comparison as a multiplication equation.

21
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:52,581
We could write that 6 is equal to 2 (and then I press "shift" and the number "8" to get that "times" symbol... that little asterick snowflake looking thing...)

22
00:01:52,581 --> 00:02:00,051
2 times 3. So I could write it like that, or I could write "2 times 3 is equal to 6." Either of those would be completely valid things to say.

23
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:04,884
So here I'm saying 6 is... Well... I could say... I'd like to say it this way:

24
00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:08,646
"3 times as large as 2." I think that's a little more fun.

25
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:12,469
So this is exactly: "6 is 3 times as large as 2."

26
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:17,000
And we're done.
