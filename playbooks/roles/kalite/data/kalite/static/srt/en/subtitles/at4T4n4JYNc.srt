1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,080
Jason bicycled from home to
the train station at an

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,120
average speed of 10
miles per hour.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,910
Then he boarded a train and
traveled into the city at an

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,100
average speed of 50
miles per hour.

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,360
The entire distance
was 30 miles; the

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,440
entire trip took 1 hour.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,360
How many miles did Jason
travel by train?

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,980
So let's write that down
as a variable.

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,620
So let's say distance, and we'll
write a little small t

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,060
right here, a little
subscript t.

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,840
This is the distance by train,
so train distance.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,720
Right there.

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,280
And let's have a d with
a little bit of a

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,250
little b right there.

16
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,570
That is the bike distance.

17
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,180
   

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,990
Now, they give us one piece of
information, that the total

19
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,920
distance, the entire distance,
was 30 miles.

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,200
So that means that the distance
by train plus the

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,030
distance by bike is 30 miles.

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,140
So I could write that
right here.

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,680
The distance by train plus
the distance by bike

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,910
is equal to 30 miles.

25
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,650
That's what that constraint
tells us.

26
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,810
Now the next one, they
tell us that the

27
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,150
entire trip took 1 hour.

28
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,980
So the time by train plus the
time by bike took 1 hour.

29
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,450
And you might be thinking,
hey, gee, that's going to

30
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,040
introduce two new variables.

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,760
But let's think a little bit
about whether we can express

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,970
the time by train and the
time by bike in terms

33
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,540
of these two variables.

34
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,560
So just as a bit of review-- I
think this is review-- you're

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,630
probably familiar with distance
is equal to rate

36
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,960
times time.

37
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,780
Or if you divide both sides of
this equation by rate, you get

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,095
time is equal to distance
divided by rate.

39
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:42,890
   

40
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,700
So let's think about
the situation for

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,800
each of these guys.

42
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,340
What is the time by train?

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,200
I'll write it like this.

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,130
The time by train is going to
be equal to the distance by

45
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,220
train divided by the rate that
the train was going at.

46
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,200
And they gave us that
information.

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,140
They told us that the train
traveled into the city at an

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,200
average speed of 50
miles per hour.

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,350
That is the rate of the train.

50
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,259
So the time of the train was
the distance of the train

51
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,320
divided by 50.

52
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,420
Same exact argument.

53
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,990
The time of the bicycle, the
time traveled on the bicycle,

54
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,950
will be the distance traveled on
the bicycle divided by the

55
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,050
speed of the bicycle.

56
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,340
And they give us the
speed right there,

57
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,510
10 miles per hour.

58
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,530
And everything in this problem
we're assuming is going to be

59
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,050
in either miles or hours.

60
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,350
There's not any major
unit conversion.

61
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,610
So that's there right there.

62
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,690
So the second statement
is that the

63
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,110
entire trip took 1 hour.

64
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,470
So the time by train plus
the time by bicycle is

65
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,000
going to be 1 hour.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,765
Actually, let me do that
in a different color.

67
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:46,570
The entire trip took 1 hour.

68
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,210
So this time plus this
time is 1 hour.

69
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,100
And I'm going to write it in
terms of the distances so I

70
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,210
only have two unknowns.

71
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,780
So the time by train is the
distance by train divided by

72
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,050
50 plus the time by bicycle
is the distance by bicycle

73
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,510
divided by 10.

74
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,250
And then that is equal
to 1 hour.

75
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,020
That's what this statement
right here is telling us,

76
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,200
although we had to use that
information and that

77
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,150
information to divide by the
10 and to divide by the 50.

78
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,810
Now we have two equations
of two unknowns.

79
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,570
And our whole goal, the whole
purpose of this problem, they

80
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,510
want to know how many miles
did Jason travel by train.

81
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,440
So we want to figure out that
variable, or we want to figure

82
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,730
out that variable.

83
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,710
Now, the easiest way to do
this is if we can just

84
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,020
eliminate the distance by
bicycle and then solve for the

85
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,050
distance by train.

86
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,640
Then we're done.

87
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,630
We would have solved
the problem.

88
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,530
Now, the easiest way I can think
of doing that is this

89
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,990
one is pretty simple already.

90
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,020
Let me just rewrite it
to the right here.

91
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,700
So the distance by train plus
the distance by bicycle is

92
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,230
equal to 30.

93
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,500
And I want to cancel out the
distance by bicycle.

94
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,330
So if I could make this into
just a negative distance by

95
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,030
bicycle, then I'm all set.

96
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,960
And if I add the two equations,
they'll cancel out.

97
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,950
So the easiest way to just make
this a negative distance

98
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,210
by bicycle is multiply both
sides of this equation by

99
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:10,100
negative 10.

100
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,360
Because you multiply negative 10
times this, the 10's cancel

101
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,920
out, this just becomes a
negative distance by bicycle.

102
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,740
So let's write it over here.

103
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,180
Negative 10 times the distance
by train over 50.

104
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,420
10 divided by 50 is 1/5,
so it's negative

105
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,050
1/5 distance by train.

106
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,620
And then negative 10 times this
expression right here,

107
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,470
the 10's cancel out.

108
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,160
It's just negative distance by
bicycle is equal to-- forgot

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,890
that parentheses-- is equal
to negative 10.

110
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,000
The whole point here was so that
this becomes the negative

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,700
version of that.

112
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,460
So when I add these two
equations, they'll cancel out.

113
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,830
So let's do that.

114
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,410
Let's add these two equations.

115
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,470
So if you add the left-hand
side, these guys cancel out.

116
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,760
You have 1 dt minus 1/5 dt.

117
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,910
1 dt you can view as 5/5 dt.

118
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:06,140
So 5/5 minus 1/5, you have 4/5
distance by train is equal to

119
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,990
30 plus negative 10,
or is equal to 20.

120
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,270
Now to solve for distance by
train, we can just multiply

121
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,060
both sides of this expression,
both sides of this equation,

122
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,970
by the inverse of 4/5.

123
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,630
So we'll multiply both
sides by 5/4.

124
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,920
The whole point of that is that
this cancels out, and we

125
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,530
are left with the distance by
train is equal to 20 times

126
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,840
5/4, that's the same thing
as 20/1 times 5/4.

127
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,850
20 divided by 4 is 5,
4 divided by 4 is 1.

128
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,850
So it's just 5 times 5.

129
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,210
So the distance traveled
by train is 25 miles.

130
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:45,830
And we're done.

131
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,620
And we could go back if we
wanted to figure out any of

132
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,270
the times, or the distance
by bicycle.

133
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,060
Actually, it's very easy.

134
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,280
The distance by train is 25,
distance by bicycle has to be

135
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,630
5 if they're going to add
up to be 30 miles.

136
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,133
