1
00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:02,438
We're asked to simply, or expand

2
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:05,875
(7x + 10) ^ 2

3
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:07,872
Now the first thing I will show you

4
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:10,008
is exactly what you should NOT do,

5
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:11,819
well there's this huge temptation.

6
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:13,444
A lot of people will look at this and say

7
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:17,438
oh, that's (7x)^2 + 10^2.

8
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:19,900
This is WRONG.

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,082
And I'll write it in caps.

10
00:00:22,082 --> 00:00:24,311
This is WRONG!

11
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:25,844
What your brain is doing is thinking

12
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:29,838
if I had 7x times 10 and I squared that,

13
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:35,689
this would be (7x)^2 times 10^2.

14
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:38,893
We aren't multiplying here, we're adding 7x to 10.

15
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:41,726
So you can't just square each of these terms.

16
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:43,398
I just wanted to highlight,

17
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:46,788
this is completely wrong,

18
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:49,250
and to see why it's wrong,

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,689
you have to remind yourself

20
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:54,637
that (7x + 10)^2 is the exact same thing

21
00:00:54,637 --> 00:01:00,767
as (7x + 10)(7x + 10).

22
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:02,624
That's what it means to square something.

23
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:08,058
You're multiplying it by itself twice here.

24
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:09,451
So this is what it is,

25
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:14,095
so we're really just multiplying

26
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:16,278
a binomial, or two binomials,

27
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:17,857
they just happen to be the same one,

28
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:19,203
and you could use F.O.I.L.,

29
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:20,782
you could use the distributive method,

30
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,268
but this is actually a special case:

31
00:01:22,268 --> 00:01:23,754
when you're squaring a binomial,

32
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:25,055
so let's just think about it

33
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:26,541
as a special case first then we can

34
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,677
apply whatever we learn to this.

35
00:01:28,677 --> 00:01:30,256
So we could've just done it straight here,

36
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,881
but I want to learn the general case

37
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:33,367
so you can apply it to any problem

38
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:34,854
that you might see.

39
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:38,104
If I have (a+b) squared

40
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:40,751
We already realised that it's not a squared plus b squared

41
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:45,535
That is a plus b times a plus b.

42
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:48,785
and now we can use the distributive property

43
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:51,618
We can distribute this a + b times this a

44
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:56,495
So we get, we get a times a plus b

45
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:59,188
and we can distribute the a plus b times this b

46
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:04,296
plus b times a plus b, and we distribute this a

47
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:09,683
we get a squared plus ab plus b times a is another ab

48
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:12,516
And I'm just swapping the order so it's the same as this.

49
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:15,488
plus b times b wich is b squared.

50
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:18,553
These are the same or these are like terms.

51
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:21,015
So we can add them. One of something plus another of

52
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,033
that something will give you two of that something. 2 ab.

53
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:27,609
We have a squared plus 2 ab plus b squared.

54
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:32,346
So the pattern here, the pattern here, if I have a plus b squared

55
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:37,176
it's equal to a squared plus 2 times the product of these numbers

56
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:42,238
plus b squared. So over here I have seven x plus ten squared

57
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:45,674
So this is going to be equal to seven x squared

58
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:50,690
seven x squared plus 2 times the product of seven x and 10.

59
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,752
2 times seven x times 10 plus 10 squared.

60
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:59,374
So, the difference between the rigth answer and the wrong answer

61
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:02,718
is that you have this middle term here that you migth have

62
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:04,854
forgot about if you did it this way.

63
00:03:04,854 --> 00:03:07,780
And this comes out when you multiplying all the different

64
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,219
combinations of the terms here.

65
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:12,563
if we simplify this, if we simplify seven x squared

66
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:15,024
That's seven squared times x squared.

67
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:18,136
So seven squared is 49 times x squared

68
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:22,733
When you multiply this part out 2 times 7 times 10

69
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:28,353
which is 140 and then we have our x.

70
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:32,346
No other x there. And then plus 10 squared.

71
00:03:32,346 --> 99:59:59,999
So plus 100. And we are done.
