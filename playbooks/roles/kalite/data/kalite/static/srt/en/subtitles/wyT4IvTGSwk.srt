1
00:00:07,397 --> 00:00:09,104
Barnett Newman's paintings

2
00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:14,747
are those which, among the Abstract Expressionist themselves,

3
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:18,541
caused the greatest amount of skepticism and doubt.

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:24,956
Newman epitomizes the common sense of many Abstract Expressionist painters works

5
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:27,869
that anybody can do that.

6
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,880
I think Newman's paintings push that to its is for the sticks stream

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,791
not so much in that they look like

8
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,130
something a child could do –

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,119
because it's pretty hard to make those straight lines –

10
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,846
but something that a house painter could do.

11
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:42,677
And in fact,

12
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:49,466
one of the critics of one of his early shows at the Betty Parsons Gallery wrote

13
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,966
that when you went into the gallery you thought you were looking at the wall

14
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:54,920
but then you realize

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,878
don't know

16
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:57,087
you were looking at the paintings

17
00:00:57,087 --> 00:01:01,043
so our question is what really does suck three these paintings?

18
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:05,164
Well for one thing the layers of color ana Newman painting

19
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:08,575
are not the one or two that house painter might make

20
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:11,108
but in fact countless layers

21
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:16,014
to achieve the saturation and the subtlety of tone

22
00:01:16,014 --> 00:01:20,334
that Newman was looking for in the surface of his painting.

23
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:25,690
Also, he's not dealing with a predetermined area

24
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:36,760
if you have a Newman that's smaller than you as opposed to one that I keep house the whole length of the room communicate very different feelings

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,089
so of all the decisions that Newman is making

26
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:42,337
to get the effect that we see today

27
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:45,635
none of them is actually that simple

28
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:47,171
Instead, what Newman is doing

29
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:50,305
is trying to communicate a mood,

30
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:52,668
a profound feeling,

31
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:54,935
one might call it a spiritual feeling

32
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:57,260
at that time he would have

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,406
today that would be quite unfashionable to use

34
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:08,826
but there's no doubt in my mind that for Newman what he was expressing in a rather secular medium painting

35
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:16,015
was the kind of thing that in a previous times would have been called religious

36
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:18,680
The idea behind Newman painting

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,125
is not that you look at it and understand it or get it.

38
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:28,969
I think that's one of the things that's partly people about Newman ever since these paintings first was shown sixty years ago.

39
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:29,685
With a Newman,

40
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:34,424
you have to step aside all expectations of that

41
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:36,676
and surrender yourself to the physical experience

42
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:38,501
and the psychic experience

43
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:41,529
of being in the space of this picture

44
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:46,197
in fact, if you look through New Yorker Magazines of the nineteen fifties and nineteen sixties

45
00:02:46,197 --> 00:02:48,713
you'll find many many cartoons filling its pages

46
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:54,054
of perplexed viewers standing in front of of Abstract Expressionist paintings

47
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:57,084
probably right here at the Museum of Modern Art.

48
00:02:57,084 --> 00:03:00,587
But instead, really, what they were trying to convey

49
00:03:00,587 --> 00:03:03,406
is that it wasn't easy for them is painters

50
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:04,840
to make the art that they were making

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,415
nor should it be easy for the viewers to experience what they made

52
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,579
For all of these artists,

53
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:17,333
it was essential that they form a signature style

54
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:22,723
and much as Pollock is somebody we associate with his drips

55
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:27,836
Newman is somebody we associate with what we now call his zips.

56
00:03:27,836 --> 00:03:29,561
This is something new in modern art

57
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:31,739
and yet at the same time

58
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,799
as they were concerned with making rock goes or Newman's

59
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,383
with these very clearly identifiable styles,

60
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:41,437
at the same time they maintained

61
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:44,445
that these pictures were not about them –

62
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:48,085
that they were not about their mood

63
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:52,587
or their story they wanted to tell –

64
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:55,908
certainly not about any biographical detail.

65
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:58,632
And instead, they were about the much larger issues

66
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:03,086
of values and ideals of humankind

67
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:06,140
This is something that should take you

68
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,631
above your daily routine –

69
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:09,440
out of your ordinary work,

70
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,547
out of your ordinary family life.

71
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:13,276
When you're with these paintings,

72
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:14,784
you're going somewhere else

73
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:16,612
and you're bringing your soul

74
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:18,125
you're bringing your brain

75
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,465
you're bringing your physical body

76
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:23,347
into a different realm.
