1
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:13,090
Your body is made up of 50 trillion cells,

2
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:18,669
cells come in many different varieties,

3
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:20,669
with different functions,

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,514
but inside, almost of every cell is a nucleus,

5
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:30,009
containing 99.9% of your genes,

6
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:34,644
and mitochondria, containing a few more genes.

7
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:38,927
All told, you've nearly 20,000 genes,

8
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:46,448
your genes are small parts of a long molecule, called DNA,

9
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:49,019
or deoxyribonucleic acid.

10
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:55,701
If you lined up all the DNA containing all of your genes,

11
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:58,468
it would measure 6 feet long,

12
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:05,484
but it's coiled, so tightly that it fits in just one cell nucleus.

13
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:13,191
DNA is a double stranded molecule composed of sugar,

14
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:16,769
phosphate, and four different bases,

15
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:21,677
adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine.

16
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:27,740
These bases spell out the language known as the genetic code.

17
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:34,271
The number and order of these four bases determine

18
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:40,439
for example, whether you're a chimp, a cow, a banana,

19
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,273
or a human.

20
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:47,020
Most genes are recipes for making specific proteins,

21
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,635
these recipes are passed down from parents to children,

22
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:56,117
from generation to generation.

23
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:02,093
When someone says "You have your father's hair.",

24
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:07,124
what they mean is "You appear to have inherited a gene

25
00:02:07,124 --> 00:02:10,090
or genes from your father that makes a protein

26
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,274
that instructs your hair follicle cells to

27
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:17,223
produce hair that curls like your father's",

28
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:20,806
but they usually opt for the shorter version.

29
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,036
Genes tell a cell how to function

30
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,709
and what traits to express

31
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:39,342
more specifically, gene regulators turn other genes on and off

32
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:43,593
in different cells, to control cell function.

33
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:49,520
The long molecules of DNA, containing your genes,

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,520
are organized into pieces called chromosomes.

35
00:02:56,797 --> 00:03:01,219
different species have different numbers of chromosomes.

36
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,522
Humans usually have 46 chromosomes,

37
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:14,278
two sets of 23, or simply 23 pairs of chromosomes.

38
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:21,712
Chimpanzees have two sets of 24, or 24 pairs of chromosomes.

39
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:26,829
Rhesus monkeys have 21 pairs of chromosomes.

40
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,995
Cows have 30 pairs of chromosomes.

41
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:32,712
Chickens have 39 pairs.

42
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,640
Fruit flies have 4 pairs,

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,390
and bananas have 11 pairs.

44
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:45,115
So, what percentage of the DNA in your chromosomes

45
00:03:45,115 --> 00:03:47,672
do you share with other species?

46
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:54,875
You shared 93% of your DNA with Rhesus monkey,

47
00:03:54,875 --> 00:04:00,360
and 98.5% with our friend, chimpanzee.

48
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,485
How about with other humans?

49
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:07,094
99.5%

50
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:12,027
So, what makes us different, from one another?

51
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:18,497
Well, for one thing, SNiPs.
