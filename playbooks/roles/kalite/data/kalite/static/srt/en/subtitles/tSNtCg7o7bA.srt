1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,220
We're on problem 53.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,820
It says Toni is solving this
equation by completing the

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,430
square. ax squared plus bx plus
c is equal to 0, where a

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,325
is greater than 0.

5
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:11,525
So this is just a traditional
quadratic right here.

6
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:13,550
And let's see what they did.

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,660
First, he subtracted c from
both sides and he got ax

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,950
squared plus bx is
equal to minus c.

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,570
OK, that's fair enough.

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,380
And then let's see.

11
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,410
He divided both sides by a.

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,530
Right, that's fair enough.

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,800
He got minus c/a.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,970
Which step should be Step
3 in the solution?

15
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,159
So he's completing the square.

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,260
So essentially, he wants this
to become a perfect square.

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,870
So let's see how
we can do that.

18
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,783
So we have x squared plus b/a
x-- and I'm going to leave a

19
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:52,020
little space here-- is
equal to minus c/a.

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,110
So for this to be a perfect
square we have to add

21
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,810
something here, we have
to add a number.

22
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,190
And we learned from several
videos in the past and we kind

23
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:00,860
of pseudo-proved it.

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,710
And actually, I have several
videos I do solely on

25
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,730
completing the square.

26
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,010
You essentially have to add
whatever number this is, add

27
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,830
half of it squared.

28
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,340
And if that doesn't make sense
to you, watch the Khan Academy

29
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,680
video on completing
the square.

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,340
But what is half of b/a?

31
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,590
Well it's b over 2a.

32
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:26,510
So 1/2 times b/a is equal
to b over 2a.

33
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,115
And then, we want to
add this squared.

34
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:30,330
So let's add that to both
sides of this equation.

35
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:36,860
So we're left with x
squared plus b/a x.

36
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,830
And we want to add
this squared.

37
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:47,980
Plus b over 2a squared is
equal to minus c/a.

38
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,940
Anything you add to one side of
the equation, you have to

39
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,580
add to the other.

40
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,090
So we have to add that
to both sides.

41
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,220
Plus b over 2a squared.

42
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,580
And let's see if we've
solved the problem so

43
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,943
far, what they want.

44
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:02,760
X, b over 2-- right.

45
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,640
This is exactly what we did. x
squared plus b/a plus b over

46
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,720
2a squared, and they add it to
both sides of the equation.

47
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,560
So D is the right answer.

48
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,290
Now if you find that a little
confusing or if it wasn't

49
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,400
intuitive for you, I
don't want you to

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,350
memorize the steps.

51
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,730
Watch the Khan Academy video
on completing the square.

52
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,970
Next problem, 56.

53
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,480
No, 54.

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,790
All right, this is another one
that should be cut and pasted.

55
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,490
All right, four steps to derive
the quadratic formula

56
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,000
are shown below.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,490
I said in previous videos that
you can derive the quadratic

58
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,830
formula by completing
the square.

59
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,090
And we actually do that
in another video.

60
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,080
I don't want to give too much
of a plug for other videos,

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,410
but let's see what
they want to do.

62
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,630
What is the correct order
of these steps?

63
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,500
So the first thing you want to
start off with is just a

64
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,900
quadratic equation.

65
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,900
And this one is the
first step.

66
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,060
This is where we started off
with in the last problem.

67
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,870
Then what you want to do is
add 1/2 of this squared to

68
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,210
both sides.

69
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,040
So b over 2a squared you want
to add to both sides, and

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,360
that's what they did here.

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,012
So our order is I.

72
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:10,440
And then you want to do IV.

73
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,620
That's what we did in
the last problem.

74
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,860
We did IV.

75
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,110
And then from here, you know
that this expression right

76
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,740
here is going to be equal to
x plus b over 2a squared.

77
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,490
And once again, watch soon.
the completing the squared

78
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,640
video if that didn't
make sense.

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,170
But the whole reason why you
added this here is so that you

80
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,780
know that, OK, what two numbers,
when I multiply them

81
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,480
equal b over 2a squared, and
when I add them equal b/a?

82
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,250
Well that's obviously,
b over 2a.

83
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,100
If you add it twice you're
going to get b over a.

84
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,982
If you square it, you're going
to get this whole expression.

85
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:44,560
So you say, oh, this is just x
plus b over 2a squared and you

86
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,690
get that there.

87
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,840
And then, is equal to--
and then they just

88
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,950
simplify this fraction.

89
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,160
They found a common denominator
and all the rest.

90
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,170
And so the next step
is Step II.

91
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,800
And then all you have
left is Step III.

92
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,970
And you've pretty much derived
the quadratic equation.

93
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,450
So I, IV, II, III.

94
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,660
That's choice A.

95
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,520
Problem 55.

96
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,450
Which of the solutions--
OK, I'll put all

97
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,700
of the choices down.

98
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,089
So which is one of the solutions
to the equation?

99
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,670
So immediately when you see all
of the choices, they have

100
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,170
these square roots
and all that.

101
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,420
This isn't something that
you would factor.

102
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,950
You would use a quadratic
equation here.

103
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,670
So let's do that.

104
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:34,510
So the quadratic equation is, so
if this is Ax squared plus

105
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,370
Bx plus C is equal to 0.

106
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,270
The quadratic equation
is minus b.

107
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,270
Well they do it lowercase.

108
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,280
Plus or minus the square root of
b squared minus 4ac, all of

109
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,500
that over 2a.

110
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,250
And this is just derived from
completing the square with

111
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,440
this, but we do that
in another video.

112
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,540
And so let's substitute it in.

113
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,170
What is b?

114
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,310
b is minus 1, right?

115
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,870
So minus minus 1, that's
a positive 1.

116
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,220
Plus or minus the square
root of b squared.

117
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,290
Minus 1 squared is 1.

118
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,220
Minus 4 times a.

119
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,560
a is 2.

120
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,030
Times 2.

121
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,040
Times c.

122
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,080
c is minus 4.

123
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,690
So times minus 4.

124
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,930
All of that over 2a.

125
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,995
a is 2, so 2 times a is 4.

126
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:31,540
So that becomes 1 plus or
minus the square root.

127
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,560
So we have a 1.

128
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,170
So we have minus 4 times
a 2 times a minus 4.

129
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,530
That's the same thing as a plus
4 times 2 times a plus 4.

130
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,490
Let's just take that
minus out.

131
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,490
So it's plus.

132
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,210
There's no minus here.

133
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,670
So let's see, 4 times 2 is 8.

134
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,860
Times 4 is 32.

135
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,140
Plus 1 is 33.

136
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,840
All of that over 4.

137
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,030
Let's see, we're not
quite there yet.

138
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,740
Well they say, which is one of
the solutions to the equation?

139
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,200
So let's see.

140
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,080
If we wanted to simplify
this out a-- well,

141
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,770
this is right here.

142
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,800
Because we have 1 plus
or minus the square

143
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,750
root of 33 over 4.

144
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,740
Well they wrote just
one of them.

145
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,300
They wrote just the plus.

146
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,800
So C is one of the solutions.

147
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,310
The other one would have been if
you had a minus sign here.

148
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,600
Anyway, next problem.

149
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,810
56.

150
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,960
And this is another one I
need to cut and paste.

151
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,280
It says, which statement best
explains why there's no real

152
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,010
solution to the quadratic
equation?

153
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,670
OK, so I already have
a guess of why this

154
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,960
won't have a solution.

155
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,700
But in general-- well, let's
try the quadratic equation.

156
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,870
Before even looking
at this problem,

157
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,480
let's get an intuition.

158
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,260
It's negative b plus or minus
you the square root of b

159
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:55,520
squared minus 4ac, all
of that over 2a.

160
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,310
My question is to you, when does
this not make any sense?

161
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,075
Well you know, this'll work
for any b, any 2a.

162
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:05,400
But when does the square root
sign really fall apart, at

163
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,920
least when we're dealing
with real numbers,

164
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,200
and that's a clue?

165
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,050
Well, it's when you have a
negative number under here.

166
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,820
If you end up with a negative
number under the square root

167
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,230
sign, at least if we haven't
learned imaginary numbers yet,

168
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,810
you don't know what to do.

169
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,320
There's no real solution to
the quadratic equation.

170
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,210
So if b squared minus
4ac is less than

171
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,810
0, you're in trouble.

172
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,540
There's no real solution.

173
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,420
You can't take a square root of
a negative sign if you're

174
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,090
doing with real numbers.

175
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,730
So that's probably going
to be the problem here.

176
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,970
So let's see what b squared
minus 4ac is.

177
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,410
You have b is 1.

178
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,320
So 1 minus 4 times a.

179
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,410
a is 2.

180
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,030
2 times c is 7.

181
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,680
And sure enough, 1 times 4 times
2 times 7 is going to be

182
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,330
less than 0.

183
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,610
So let's just see what
they have here.

184
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,890
Right, the value of 1
squared-- oh, right.

185
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,080
It's b squared.

186
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,520
Well 1 squared, same
thing as 1.

187
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,000
1 squared minus 4
times 2 times 7,

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,090
sure enough is negative.

189
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,150
So that's why we don't
have a real

190
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,270
solution to this equation.

191
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,100
Next problem.

192
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,350
I'm actually out of space.

193
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,360
OK, they want to know
the solution set to

194
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,400
this quadratic equation.

195
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,210
I'll just copy and paste.

196
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,250
So that's essentially the
set of the x's that

197
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,020
satisfy this equation.

198
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,480
And obviously, for any x that
you put in this, the left-hand

199
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,630
side is going to
be equal to 0.

200
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,990
So what x's are valid?

201
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,929
And they just want us to apply
the quadratic equation.

202
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,600
So we've written it a couple of
times, but let's just do it

203
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,250
straight up.

204
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,919
So it's negative b.

205
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,169
b is 2.

206
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,169
So it's negative 2
plus or minus the

207
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,740
square root of b squared.

208
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,970
Well that's 2 squared.

209
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,520
Minus 4 times a.

210
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,410
a is 8.

211
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,070
Times c, which is 1.

212
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,560
All of that over 2 times a.

213
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,800
So 2 times 8, which is equal to
minus 2 plus or minus the

214
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:11,215
square root of 4-- let's see.

215
00:09:11,215 --> 00:09:13,040
Did I write this down?

216
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:21,160
Negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared minus

217
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,650
4 times a times c.

218
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,270
Right.

219
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,890
So you get 4 minus 32.

220
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,900
That's why I was double checking
to see if I did this

221
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,460
right because I'm going to get
a negative number here.

222
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,700
All of that over 16.

223
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,690
And so we're going to end up
with the same conundrum we had

224
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,480
in the last. 4 minus 32, we're
going to end with minus 2 plus

225
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,785
or minus the square root
of minus 28 over 16.

226
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:46,200
And if we're dealing with real
numbers, I mean there's no

227
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,080
real solution here.

228
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,950
And at first I was worried.

229
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,650
I thought I made a careless
mistake or there was an error

230
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,360
in the problem.

231
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,460
But then I look at
the choices.

232
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,440
They have choice D.

233
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,500
And I'll copy and paste
choice D here.

234
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,350
Choice D.

235
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,370
No real solution.

236
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,780
So that's the answer, because
you can't take a square root

237
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,860
of a negative number and stay
in the set of real numbers.

238
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,620
Let's see, do I have time
for another one?

239
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,910
I'm over the 10 minutes.

240
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,330
I'll wait for the next video.

241
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,580
See you soon.
