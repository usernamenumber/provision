1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Greek vases were made of terracota or baked clay.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Before the clay could be used for pottery,

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pebbles and other impurities had to be removed.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
First, the potter mixed the raw clay with water

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in large outdoor pools, to make a thick silty liquid.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This liquid clay stood until the heavier impurities had settled to the bottom.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The refined liquid was then drained off into a second pool.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The potter repeated this settling process several times.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The pool was then left to evaporate in the sun,

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
leaving behind the refined clay.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The final step in preparing the clay for potting

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
was called "wedging".

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The potter systematically compressed and folded the clay,

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
making it more malleable and mixing together

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
any parts that may have settled into layers.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The clay was now ready for use.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Most Greek vases were thrown or formed on the potter's wheel.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The complex shapes of Greek pottery often required

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the vase be thrown in pieces

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then assembled.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For example, to make a kylix or cup,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the potter first centered the clay on the wheel.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When it stopped wobbling,

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the potter began a central hole.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Pressure from the potter's fingers inside the hole

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
gradually widened this opening

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and formed the bowl of the cup.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Aside from the wheel,

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the potter's main tools were his hands,

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
although a wet sponge was often used to smooth the surface.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
To make the foot of the cup,

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the potter again centered the clay,

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
drew it up and then hollowed out the stem.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The next day, when the formed pieces had dried slightly,

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the bowl of the cup was trimmed with a metal shaver

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and received a final smoothing.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The potter used wet clay

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to bond the separately made bowl and foot

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then smoothed over the joint.
