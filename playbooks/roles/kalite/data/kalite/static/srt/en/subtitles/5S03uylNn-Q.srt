1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have the same setup here as we had in the previous problem

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in problem number 42 where p is an odd prime number

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they say let T sub p be the following set of 2 by 2 matrices

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where each of those matrices are of the form a is along the diagonals

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and a b there and a c there and each of those numbers

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are between 0 and p-1 inclusive. So they can be

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1,2,3 all the way upto p-1

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then the number of A in the set such that

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the trace of A is not divisible by p

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but the determinate of A is divisible by p is

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they tell us the trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal entries.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Its actually the sum of its main diagonals. Its not going to be the that diagonal,

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
its only the sum of this. So if you sum this you are going to get the trace of the matrix. So lets use

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this first piece of information. The trace of A is not divisible by p.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the trace of A is going to be a+a

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or 2a not divisible by p.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let us think of a situation where 2a is divisible by p.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 2a could be equal to 0, because 0 is a multiple of p.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In which case a would be equal to zero. So this is a possibility.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if a is equal to 0 then 2a is divisible by p. So this tells us

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one of the constraints from this sentence right here is that a cannot be equal to 0

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because if a is 0 then the trace is divisible by p. So a cannot be equal to 0.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's think about it. Can 2a become any other multiple of p?

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Can 2a equal p? Well, if 2a equalled p then 2 and a would be factors of p

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then p would not be prime. So we can cross that out.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then 2a cannot be equal to 2p, that would make a equal p which is impossible because a can only be p-1

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So thats not possible. You can keep going to higher and higher multiples of p. Not possible.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because a is going to be smaller than p. So the only constraint that we get from this first sentence that the trace of a

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is not divisible by p tells us that a does not equal 0. So now look at the second constraint.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The determinant of a is divisible by p. So the determinant of a is equal to a times a

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equals a squared minus b times c or c times b. So this is going to be divisible by p.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is going to be equal to some integer times p. Now one thing, just looking at this there is no obvious

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
simplification here. But one thing I am starting to appreciate not having taken the IIT Joint Entrance Exam in high school

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not growing up in India is that when they have multiple choices, sometimes it might be faster

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to do just the brute force method. Now when I say brute force method not just proving mathematically

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which one of these expressions are true. But lets just try a simple p and then lets find the members of the set that

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
would satisfy for that p and then see which of these expressions equal that p

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
To simplify this, lets just say p is equal to 3 and i pick p is equal to 3

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because that is the smallest odd prime number. So it is the smallest number that satisfies this constraint up here.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets say p is equal to 3. If p is equal to 3 our possibilities for a are that a can't be equal to 0

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We know that already. So a could be equal to 1 or a could be equal to 2. And if a is equal to 1

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then the determinate of a is going to be equal to 1-bc.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which needs to be equal to some integer multiple of 3.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because we said our p is equal to 3. This must be equal to 3k.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If a is equal to 2, then the determinate is going to be equal to 4.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because its a squared, so its going to be 4-bc.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
must be equal to some integer multiple of 3. So lets see how many combinations of

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
b and c we can find in each of these constraints.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 1 minus bc. So 1 possibility is 1 minus bc is equal to 3 times 0. That is one possibility.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe another possibilty is 1 minus bc is equal to 3.
