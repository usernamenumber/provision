1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,870
I want to make a quick
correction to the last video

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,510
where we introduced the
carboxylic acid videos, and

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,860
then we can actually compare
them in terms of their

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,060
relative stability.

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,810
And that one mistake I did is
when I named the ester, all I

7
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,630
did is I named the main
carbon backbone.

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,910
I didn't actually tell you how
many carbons you have attached

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,130
to the oxygen over here.

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,400
Acetate really just refers to
this part over here, knowing

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,720
that it is bonded to-- or maybe
I should say it refers

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,780
to this part over here.

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,080
But you also have to specify
how many carbons

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,960
you have over here.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,460
So this molecule that
we drew over here is

16
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,940
actually methyl acetate.

17
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,140
   

18
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,890
Or if you want it's systematic
name, it's methyl ethanoate.

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,015
And this is where we get
the methyl from.

20
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:54,010
It is methyl ethanoate.

21
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,800
Now, with that out of the way,
let's actually compared these

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,010
carboxylic acid derivatives,
and I'll compare the

23
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,540
derivatives of acetic acid.

24
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,280
So the first one we saw was
the amide acetamide.

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,930
Acetamide looks just
like this.

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,580
This is acetamide.

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,180
Then the next one we looked
at was the ether.

28
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,710
And that's the one I just
pointed out the mistake on.

29
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:29,250
So this was ethyl acetate.

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,520
You have CH3 right here.

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,060
This is methyl acetate.

32
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,190
This is where the methyl
part comes from.

33
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:42,220
So this is methyl acetate.

34
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,180
And then we will compare that
to the anhydride version.

35
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,135
So this is acetic anhydride.

36
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:50,740
Let me do this in a new color.

37
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,000
Acetic anhydride looks
like this.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:05,700
   

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,990
And finally, we had the
acetyl chloride.

40
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,430
   

41
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,700
Acetyl chloride looked
just like this.

42
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,620
   

43
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,510
And, of course, these are all
derivatives of acetic acid,

44
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,260
which we drew at the top of the
last video, which is right

45
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,700
over there.

46
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,790
Now, let's think about which
of these may or may not be

47
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,280
more stable.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
And to think about it, we're
going to think about any

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,220
resonance structures that these
molecules might have. So

50
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,190
if we first focus on acetamide,
we know that

51
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,260
nitrogen forms three bonds and
then has two extra electrons

52
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,440
that form another lone pair.

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,330
And it's actually electron rich,
because it's a good bit

54
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,240
more electronegative than the
hydrogens here and actually

55
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,180
reasonably more electronegative
then the

56
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,600
carbon it's attached to.

57
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,610
So you could imagine a situation
where a nitrogen

58
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,300
could donate an electron to this
carbon right over here,

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,255
and then that carbon can let go
of one of the electrons in

60
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:16,260
a double bond with the oxygen.

61
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,900
And so it could go back to the
oxygen and you would have a

62
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,880
resonance structure that
would look like this.

63
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,135
Let me actually use
the same colors.

64
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:29,670
   

65
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,525
This oxygen just gained
an electron up there.

66
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:34,840
And, actually, let me
draw the electron.

67
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,010
Well, actually, I'll just put
the negative charge due to

68
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,250
that electron.

69
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,920
And then we had this bond right

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,970
over here to the nitrogen.

71
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,790
But the nitrogen just a gave
an electron to this carbon

72
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,920
right here, the carbonyl, or
what was the carbonyl carbon,

73
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,770
and so now we have a double
bond over here.

74
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,910
And the nitrogen just to gave
an electron, so it now has a

75
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,790
positive charge.

76
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,830
But this is a resonance
structure of acetamide, so

77
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,180
pretty stable.

78
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,705
So this is maybe I should
even say quite stable.

79
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:13,960
   

80
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,170
Now, let's think about an
ether here, and we could

81
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,240
probably do something
fairly similar.

82
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:25,360
So if we think about this ether
here, oxygen has two

83
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,730
extra lone pairs.

84
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,480
It is more electronegative than
the things that it is

85
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,720
bonded to, so it could do a
very similar thing to what

86
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,920
this nitrogen did.

87
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,650
It could give an electron to
this carbon right over here,

88
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,640
and then that carbon can give
back an electron to the

89
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,380
carbonyl oxygen, to that
oxygen over there.

90
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,950
And so it's resonance structure

91
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,600
would look like this.

92
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,790
It would have a resonance
structure, so it's almost the

93
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,790
exact same thing is as what
we saw with the amide.

94
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,550
So it would have a resonance
structure.

95
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,120
This oxygen just gained
an electron.

96
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,250
Now it will have a
negative charge.

97
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,470
This bond to the oxygen is still
there, but this oxygen

98
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,400
just gave another electron,
formed another bond with what

99
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,820
was the carbonyl carbon.

100
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,270
It actually forms a new carbonyl
group, if you want to

101
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,990
view it that way, and so
it will look like this.

102
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,690
And this oxygen gave away an
electron so now it has a

103
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,120
positive charge.

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,700
So this seems like a pretty
good resonance structure.

105
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,050
So the question is which
of these two are

106
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,720
going to be more stable?

107
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,490
And the answer there really
just comes out of

108
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,440
the Periodic Table.

109
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,010
If you look at nitrogen and
oxygen, they're right there.

110
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,610
They're both near
the top right.

111
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,660
They're both pretty
electronegative, but oxygen is

112
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,030
more electronegative.

113
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,530
It is to the right
of nitrogen.

114
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,360
So because oxygen is more
electronegative, remember,

115
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,430
electronegativity is just the
tendency to hog electrons.

116
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,450
How much do you like
to hog electrons?

117
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,590
Oxygen likes to hog electrons
more than nitrogen likes to

118
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,590
hog electrons.

119
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,520
So it would be less likely,
marginally less likely, to

120
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,880
give away an electron than
nitrogen would be, so this

121
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,330
resonance structure is a little
bit less likely, or

122
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,930
when you think of it
probabilistically, it's going

123
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,100
to happen a little bit
less frequently than

124
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,170
this resonance structure.

125
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,710
So this one right here, this is
going to stabilize it less.

126
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,210
So this is going to be
a little bit less

127
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,850
stable then the amide.

128
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,380
So if we called this quite
stable, I'll just say this is

129
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,610
just stable over here.

130
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,580
Now let's think about
what's going to

131
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,035
happen with the anhydride.

132
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:41,610
The anhydride, once again, we
have an oxygen right here.

133
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,000
It's got its spare electrons.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,870
It's more electronegative
than the things

135
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,210
that it's bonded to.

136
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,330
So it seems like you could do
something very similar to what

137
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,360
we saw with the actual ether.

138
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,660
It could donate an electron to
this bond right over here, in

139
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,920
which case, you would have
a resonance structure

140
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,780
that looks like this.

141
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,920
And if it donates an electron to
this carbon over here, then

142
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,890
an electron can be taken away
from the carbon and given back

143
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,670
to that oxygen.

144
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,730
So that would give us a
resonance structure that would

145
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,930
look like this.

146
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,670
That guy now has a
negative charge.

147
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,160
We now have a double bond
to this oxygen.

148
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,630
it still has another bond
to the other acyl

149
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,020
group, just like that.

150
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,140
And now this oxygen gave away
an electron, so it has a

151
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,090
positive charge.

152
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,050
So it seems like a very similar
situation to what we

153
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,280
saw with an ether.

154
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,810
But there's another resonance
structure here.

155
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,810
You could also have a situation
where instead of the

156
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,990
electron being donated to this
carbon bond and that

157
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,620
happening, you could have a
situation like this, where the

158
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,955
electron gets donated to that
carbon bond and then this

159
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:53,560
electron gets taken back by that
oxygen, so you would have

160
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
this situation.

161
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,320
You would have a situation where
this acyl group still

162
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,340
looks the same bonded to this
oxygen, but now we have a

163
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,990
double bond over here.

164
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,060
This guy took away
an electron.

165
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,190
So one of the bonds in the
double bonds goes away.

166
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,980
It now has a negative charge,
and then you have the rest of

167
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,020
the molecule.

168
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,280
So you actually have these
two resonance structures.

169
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,690
And, of course, this is now a
positive charge since it gave

170
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,850
away electron.

171
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,200
So you might say, hey,
more resonance

172
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,860
structures, more stability.

173
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,230
But the key here is to realize
that both resonance structures

174
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,510
are dependent from
the same oxygen.

175
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,080
They essentially have to share
this oxygen's electrons.

176
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,159
So each one of these
individually is less likely to

177
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,030
occur than just what occurs
with the ether.

178
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,360
You can kind of view it as both
of these bonds have to

179
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,470
share what in the ether this
one gets on its own.

180
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,750
And we even saw that this is
still less likely to occur

181
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,930
than this over here.

182
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,730
So in this situation, in an
anhydride, if one guy's

183
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,110
getting the double bond, the
other guy's-- if there's a

184
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,500
resonance structure on one side
of the anhydride, the

185
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,000
other side is still reactive.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,830
If there's a resonance structure
on the left side,

187
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,770
then the right side is still
reactive, so we'll call this

188
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,350
less stable.

189
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,920
This right here is
less stable.

190
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,890
Then finally, you have
your acetyl chloride.

191
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,830
And acetyl chloride, there
really is no resonance

192
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,660
structure here.

193
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,180
Chlorine is so electronegative
that it is unlikely to give

194
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,430
away an electron.

195
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,560
   

196
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,160
It is sitting pretty with
eight electrons.

197
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,260
That's actually true
from these other

198
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,010
characters right here.

199
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,280
But chlorine is very, very
unlikely to contribute a

200
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,400
resonance structure here.

201
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:47,180
So this gets no stability, so
this is the least stable of

202
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,040
the carboxylic acid
derivatives that

203
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,880
we're looking at.

204
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,350
Now, why am I even bothering
with all of this hierarchy of

205
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,790
stability for carboxylic
acid derivatives?

206
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,890
And I'm bothering with it
because we know-- or we don't

207
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,860
know quite yet, but I've
already shown you some

208
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,690
mechanisms that can take us from
a carboxylic acid to an

209
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,200
ether or carboxylic acid
to an acyl halide.

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,810
And, in general, you can go
between all of these and a

211
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,900
carboxylic acid.

212
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,890
But since we know their relative
stabilities, we know

213
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,920
that if you start with an acetyl
chloride, you're much

214
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,500
more likely to go to an
acetamide if you have the

215
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,680
proper ingredients in there.

216
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,490
If you have some amides floating
around than the other

217
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:28,970
way around.

218
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,040
You're much more likely to go
from that to that, because

219
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,370
this is much less stable than
that, then you are to go from

220
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,670
acetamide to acetyl chloride.

221
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,850
Likewise, you're much more a
likely to go from a carboxylic

222
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,700
acid to-- let me put
it this way.

223
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,030
You're much more likely to go
from a carboxylic acid to an

224
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,100
acetamide, and I haven't drawn
the carboxylic acid here, but

225
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,050
this has better resonance than
even its original carboxylic

226
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,540
acid than the other
way around.

227
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,000
Or you're much more likely
to go from an

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,770
anhydride to an ether.

229
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,380
So that's why I'm doing
this hierarchy.

230
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,710
You're much more likely to go
from something on the right to

231
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,840
something on the left.

232
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,950
And we'll explore some of those
mechanisms in the next

233
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,320
few videos.

234
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,734
