1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,260
We are on problem 7.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,990
Let me draw what they have drawn.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,160
They drew a right triangle.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,610
The right triangle looks something like this.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,290
And then they drew another triangle.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,690
And it looks like an isosceles triangle,

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,660
although we can't assume anything in this life.

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:35,630
Nothing comes for free. So this is x. This is y.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,400
u, v, w. Those are the angles.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,300
In the triangles above, what is the average--

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,350
arithmetic mean-- of u, v, w, x, and y

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,540
So you have to just add up the sum of the angles

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,470
and then divide by the number of angles.

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:02,840
So we want to take u plus v plus w plus x plus y,

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,320
and then divide by the number of angles.

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,510
So there's one, two, three,four, five angles.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,240
First question. What is u plus v plus w?

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,780
Well, they form the angles in a triangle,

19
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,800
so they're going to add up to 180 degrees.

20
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,090
And what's x plus y? Well, it's a right triangle.

21
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,700
And all three of these angles have to add up to 180.

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,120
x plus y plus this 90 have to add up to 180.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,300
So x plus y is going to be equal to 90.

24
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,080
Just subtract 90 from both sides.

25
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,260
So x plus y is equal to 90.

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,160
So if we take the sum of the top, 180 plus 90, that's 270.

27
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,800
Divided by 5.

28
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:56,660
5 goes into 270-- 5, 25, 7, 20, 54.

29
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,190
So the average is 54 degrees.

30
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,280
That's the arithmetic mean of all of those angles.

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,600
And that is choice E.

32
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,000
Next problem.

33
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,000
I just inadvertently switched back to my bad-luck yellow.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,040
All right. Problem 8.

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Looks like they've drawn--It looks like a ray.

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,030
I'm going to put an arrow on one side. Let me switch colors.

37
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,210
They say that this is x to the third.

38
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,950
This is x squared. This is x.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,880
If x, x squared, and x to the third lie on a number line

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,040
in the order shown above,

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,930
which of the following could be the value of x?

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,900
So the first thing we know, x has got to be--

43
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,150
well, the first thing we know, that x is a positive number.

44
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,160
How do I know that?

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,410
Because if x was not a positive number--

46
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,220
well, let me think about that. Right.

47
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,290
x has to be a positive number.

48
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,720
Because-- let me put it this way.

49
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,500
If any negative number-- let's say it's negative 1/2.

50
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:24,840
If you square negative 1/2, you get positive 1/4.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,340
So for any negative number,

52
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,410
the square is going to be bigger than the number itself.

53
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,980
So we know that x is greater than 0.

54
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,280
That's one thing we know. What else do we know?

55
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,460
We also know that x is going to be less than 1.

56
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,300
How do I know that?

57
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,690
Because x squared is less than x,right?

58
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,230
And that only applies for numbers less than 1.

59
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,810
Because 1/2 squared is equal to 1/4,and 1/4 is less than 1/2.

60
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,970
So we also know that x is less than 1.

61
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,250
So we just have to find a choice

62
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,380
where x is greater than 0 and less than 1.

63
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,960
And if we look at the choices,greater than 0 and less than 1,

64
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,610
there's only one choice that that applies to.

65
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,470
And that's 3/4. Choice C.

66
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,550
You might want to say 3/2,but that's 1 and 1/2.

67
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,200
That's greater than 1.

68
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,890
The first two choices are negative.

69
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,970
The last two choices are greater than 1--

70
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,220
or greater than or equal to 1.

71
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,070
So we know it's choice C.

72
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,830
Next problem.

73
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,990
And if you didn't want to do it in an abstract way,

74
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,960
and if you have a lot of time,

75
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,240
if you're really fast on the problems you do know how to do,

76
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,350
you can always try out the numbers. But that takes longer.

77
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,010
They drew a coordinate system right here.

78
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,910
And this is my y-axis. This is the x-axis.

79
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,380
And then they draw a line that goes through the origin.

80
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,910
And then they tell us that

81
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,300
this point right here is the point 1 comma 3.

82
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,060
So this is 1. This is 3.

83
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,570
And what do they want us to do with this?

84
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,750
In the figure above, line l passes through the origin.

85
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,780
This is line l. What is the value of k/h?

86
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,980
Oh, and then they label another point here.

87
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,020
They say this is h comma k.

88
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,940
So what is the value of k divided by h?

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,050
So the y value over the x value, right?

90
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,660
And I'm going to tell you right now,

91
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,740
the value of it is going to be the slope of this line.

92
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,340
And how do we know that?

93
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,120
If you wanted to figure out the slope

94
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,600
from the origin to this point, what would it be?

95
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,000
The origin of course is 0, 0. So it would be change in y.

96
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
Change in y is 0 minus k.

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,900
You wouldn't have to do this on the SAT.

98
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,400
I just want to show you that it would be the slope.

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,680
And then change in x would be 0 minus h.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,140
And that of course is equal to minus k over minus h.

101
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,220
The negatives cancel out,and that equals k/h.

102
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,740
So they're essentially just asking us,

103
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,110
what is the slope of this line?

104
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,780
Well, that's easy enough, because it gives us another point.

105
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,760
And so we can say, well, we could do this rise over run.

106
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,940
So here, what is the change in y?

107
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,280
Change in y is equal to 3 minus 0.

108
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,220
I'm taking this as kind of the initial point.

109
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,210
3 minus 0. Change in x is 1 minus 0.

110
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,380
So change in y over change in x is equal to 3.

111
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,460
And that's our slope, and that's our answer.

112
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,160
So the answer is A.

113
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,280
Next problem. Problem 10.

114
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,730
They're saying the absolute value of m minus 3 is equal to 5.

115
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,120
They're also telling us that the absolute value of k

116
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,480
plus 7 is equal to 15.

117
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,480
In the equations above,m is less than 0 and k is less than 0.

118
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:26,700
What is the value of m minus k? So m is less than 0, right?

119
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,310
So there's two possibilities here.

120
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,150
This first equation, if we didn't see that,

121
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,440
it could mean two different things.

122
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,910
You could say m minus 3 is equal to 5

123
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,540
or m minus 3 is equal to negative 5.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,160
This one would solve to m is equal to 8,

125
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,900
and this one would solve to m is equal to minus 2.

126
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,230
Well, we know m is not 8,because m is less than 0.

127
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,340
And to solve this, I just added 3 to both sides.

128
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,230
So we know that m is minus 2.

129
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,040
Similarly, let's take that second equation.

130
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,210
That tells us that k plus 7 is equal to 15,

131
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,530
or k plus 7 is equal to minus 15.

132
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,810
Subtract 7 from both sides of this, you get k equals 8.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,530
Subtract 7 from both sides of this,

134
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,430
you get k is equal to minus 22.

135
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,010
And they tell us that k is also less than 0.

136
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,950
So we know that this is k.

137
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,600
And they want us to know what m minus k is.

138
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,470
Well, m is minus 2,and k is minus 22.

139
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,740
So minus 2 minus minus 22.

140
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,410
So that's the same thing as minus 2 plus 22.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,920
And that is of course 20. And that is choice E.

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,060
I will see you in the next video.
