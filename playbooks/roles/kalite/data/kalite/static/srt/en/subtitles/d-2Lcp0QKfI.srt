1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
   

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,890
We need to factor negative 12f
squared minus 38f, plus 22.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,200
So a good place to start is just
to see if, is there any

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,480
common factor for all three
of these terms?

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,000
When we look at them,
they're all even.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,320
And we don't like a negative
number out here.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,130
So let's divide everything, or
let's factor out a negative 2.

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,780
So this expression right here is
the same thing as negative

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,390
2 times-- what's negative 12f
squared divided by negative 2?

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,920
It's positive 6f squared.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,680
Negative 38 divided by negative
2 is positive 19, so

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,750
it'll be positive 19f.

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,350
And then 22 divided by negative
22-- oh, sorry, 22

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,620
divided by negative
2 is negative 11.

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,830
So we've simplified it a bit.

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,470
We have the 6f squared
plus 19f, minus 11.

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,090
We'll just focus on that
part right now.

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,360
And the best way to factor this
thing, since we don't

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,810
have a 1 here as the coefficient
on the f squared,

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,490
is to factor it by grouping.

21
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,230
So we need to look for two
numbers whose product is 6

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,840
times negative 11.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,480
So two numbers, so a times b,
needs to be equal to 6 times

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,080
negative 11, or negative 66.

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,230
And a plus b needs to
be equal to 19.

26
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,190
So let's try a few
numbers here.

27
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,170
So let's see, 22, I'm just
thinking of numbers that are

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,820
roughly 19 apart, because
they're going to be of

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,530
different signs.

30
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,880
So 22 and 3, I think
will work.

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,430
Right.

32
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:41,840
If we take 22 times negative 3,
that is negative 66, and 22

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,460
plus negative 3 is
equal to 19.

34
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,990
And the way I kind of got pretty
close to this number

35
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,310
is, well, you know, they're
going to be of different

36
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,180
signs, so the positive versions
of them have to be

37
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,340
about 19 apart, and
that worked out.

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,470
22 and negative 3.

39
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:03,860
So now we can rewrite this 19f
right here as the sum of

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:10,870
negative 3f and 22f.

41
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,440
That's the same thing as 19f.

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,220
I just kind of broke it apart.

43
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,320
And, of course, we have the
6f squared and we have

44
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,800
the minus 11 here.

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,410
Now, you're probably saying, hey
Sal, why did you put the

46
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,240
22 here and the negative
3 there?

47
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,680
Why didn't you do it the
other way around?

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,340
Why didn't you put the 22 and
then the negative 3 there?

49
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,590
And my main motivation for doing
it, I like to put the

50
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,020
negative 3 on the same side with
the 6 because they have

51
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,710
the common factor of the 3.

52
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,280
I like to put the 22 with the
negative 11, they have the

53
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,430
same common factor of 11.

54
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,660
So that's why I decided
to do it that way.

55
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,700
So now let's do the grouping.

56
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,140
And, of course, you can't forget
this negative 2 that we

57
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,850
have sitting out here
the whole time.

58
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,370
So let me put that negative 2
out there, but that'll just

59
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,820
kind of hang out for awhile.

60
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,630
But let's do some grouping.

61
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,390
So let's group these
first two.

62
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,785
And then we're going to group
this-- let me get a nice color

63
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:01,230
here-- and then we're going
to group this second two.

64
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,840
Well, that's almost an
identical color.

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,620
Let me do it in this
purple color.

66
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,660
And then we can group that
second two right there.

67
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,760
So these first two, we could
factor out a negative 3f, so

68
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,700
it's negative 3f times-- 6f
squared divided by negative 3f

69
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,950
is negative 2f.

70
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,510
   

71
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,080
And then negative 3f divided
by negative 3f is just

72
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
positive f.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,560
Actually, a better way to start,
instead of factoring

74
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,445
out a negative 3f, let's just
factor out 3f, so we don't

75
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:35,480
have a negative out here.

76
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,435
We could do it either way.

77
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:39,520
But if we just factor
out a 3f, 6f squared

78
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,970
divided by 3f is 2f.

79
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,330
And then negative 3f divided
by 3f is negative 1.

80
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,510
So that's what that
factors into.

81
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,800
And then that second part, in
that dark purple color, can

82
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,420
factor out an 11.

83
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,600
And if we factor that out, 22f
divided by 11 is 2f, and

84
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,610
negative 11 divided by
11 is negative 1.

85
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,150
And, of course, once again,
you have that negative 2

86
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,400
hanging out there.

87
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,550
   

88
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:13,790
Now, inside the parentheses,
we have two terms, both of

89
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:20,640
which have 2f minus
1 as a factor.

90
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,490
So we can factor that out.

91
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,490
This whole thing is just an
exercise in doing the reverse

92
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,660
distributive property,
if you will.

93
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,260
So let's factor that out, so
you have 2f minus 1, times

94
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:41,265
this 3f, and then times
that plus 11.

95
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:45,920
Let me do that in the
same shade of

96
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,200
purple right over there.

97
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,240
And you know, you can distribute
it if you like.

98
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,760
2f minus 1 times 3f will give
you this term, 2f f minus 1

99
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,650
times 11 will give
you that term.

100
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,010
And we can't forget that we
still have that negative 2

101
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,470
hanging out outside.

102
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,800
I want to change the
colors on it.

103
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,770
   

104
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,830
And we're done factoring it.

105
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,980
Negative 12f squared minus 38f,
plus 22 is negative 2

106
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,230
times 2f minus 1, times
3f plus 11.

107
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,733
