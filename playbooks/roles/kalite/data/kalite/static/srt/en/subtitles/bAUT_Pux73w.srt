00:00:01,323 --> 00:00:04,462
Welcome to the presentation on age word problems. Let's get started.

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:07,600
Well, I have one written down here, it says:

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,201
"In 4 years, Ali will be 3 times as old as he is today. How old is Ali today?"

4
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:22,802
Well, let's just say that x,

5
00:00:22,802 --> 00:00:27,524
(that's a little too big for what I want to write)

6
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:32,246
x equals Ali's current age or his age today.

7
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:41,703
(Please forgive my handwriting)

8
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:55,416
If x is Ali's current age and here we say in 4 years

9
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,702
So, how old Ali is going to be in 4 years?

10
00:00:57,702 --> 00:00:59,988
Well, if x is his current age, in 4 years he is going to be x plus 4 years old.

11
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:06,394
So, that is equal to Ali's age in 4 years.

12
00:01:06,394 --> 00:01:12,800
Let's read what other information there is for the problem.

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,423
It says in 4 years, so, in, this situation -- that's a 4, x plus 4 --

14
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:21,235
In 4 years, Ali will be 3 times as old as he is today.

15
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:24,046
Well, today he is x.

16
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:29,596
So, we say in 4 years -- x plus 4 -- and that's just so,

17
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:32,348
So, in 4 years, so we can translate that into x plus 4

18
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:35,100
That's going to equal 3 times as old as he is today.

19
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:40,052
Well, we know today he is x , so that's going to be equal to 3x.

20
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:44,856
And now, we just well solve for x.

21
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:50,016
Subtract x from both sides, you get 2x=4, x=2.

22
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:52,524
So, Ali is 2 years old today.

23
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:55,032
Let's do another problem.

24
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:59,118
And that makes sense, cuz if he is 2 today, in 4 years he is going to be 6,

25
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,205
which is going to be 3 times as old as he is today.

26
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:07,780
So, it all that works out.

27
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,067
Let's do another problem. Let's clear this

28
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:12,354
and I am going to attempt to type, hope I don't miss up, ok.

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:43,100
The problem is: Nazrat is 4 years older than Umiama.

30
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,854
2 years ago Nazrat was 5 times as old as Umaima.

31
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:50,231
How old is Nazrat today?

32
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,608
Ah,this one seems more difficult, I think we will be able to get trough it.

33
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:56,926
Let's figure it out.

34
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,400
All right, so once again what are we trying to solve for? We're trying to solve for Nazrat today.

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,492
So, let's say this is Nazrat, we'll say Naz for short,

36
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:16,585
and let's say this is Umaima and this is today,

37
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:22,173
(I'm making a little chart)

38
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:27,762
and let's say 4 years from now, 4 ...

39
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:32,825
oh no no no not 4 years from now, I'm confusing myself,

40
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:35,356
This would be 2 years ago.

41
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:37,888
I'm still remembering the last problem,

42
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:42,187
2 years ago, ok, so this is today, 2 years in the future, let me make a little chart

43
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:46,302
It's not the cleanest chart, but I think it will do the job.

44
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:52,251
Ok, so we're trying to solve for x, How old is Nazrat today?

45
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:58,200
So, let's just say Naz today that is equal to x.

46
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,631
It says Nazrat is 4 years older than Umaima.

47
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:05,062
So this piece of information up here, let me underline it;

48
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,177
Nazrat is 4 years older than Umaima.

49
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:10,854
Well that piece of information tells us that Umaima today,

50
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:16,209
if Nazrat is x , then Umaima is going to be x - 4.

51
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:22,004
Which makes sense because Naz is 4 years older than Umaima.

52
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:27,800
Now we go into the past. Let's write, let's look at this.

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,502
So 2 years ago: so, if Naz is x today, how old was she 2 years ago?

54
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:35,203
Well, she was going to be x minus 2.

55
00:04:35,203 --> 00:04:39,502
That makes sense, if I'm 10 years old today,

56
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:41,650
2 years ago I'll be 2 years less, I would be 8 years old.

57
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,800
So, if she is x today, two years ago she was x - 2.

58
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,975
And, if Umaima is x - 4 today,

59
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:54,150
then 2 years ago she'll be 2 less than that.

60
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,516
She'll be x - 4 - 2 and that equals x - 6.

61
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:02,881
Which makes sense and

62
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:05,168
notice that she is still 4 years younger than Naz or Nazrat.

63
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:07,456
Now, we have one final piece of information in this problem:

64
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:12,030
It says 2 years ago Nazrat was 5 times as old as Umaima.

65
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:22,100
so in this situation 2 years ago that's what the sentence says; 2 years ago Nazrat was 5 times as old as Umaima so

66
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:31,627
Nazrat which x belonges to was 5 times older than Umaima which is x minus 6 so let just right it down so Nazrat 2 years

67
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:38,700
ago was x minus 2 we get that from the chart; Nazrat was x minus 2, two years ago and that says that Nazrat was

68
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:49,507
5 times older than Umaima was 2 years ago, then Umaima was 2 years ago was x minus 6, well now we'll just solve for x

69
00:05:49,785 --> 00:06:01,500
x minus 2 is equal to 5 x minus 30, now we can subtract x from both sides and we get 4x and I switch it around 2

70
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:15,546
hopefully confuse you more, 4x minus 30 equals minus 2 and then we get 4x is equal to 28 and x is equal to 7

71
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:16,062
so we solved the problem; Nazrat today is 7 years old. Is that makes sense? Well if Nazrat today is 7 years old

72
00:06:25,759 --> 99:59:59,999
And then does it make sense? Umaima today is going to be 3 years old and that makes sense cause there are 4 years different

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Two years ago Nazrat was 5 years old and 2 years ago Umaima was only 1 year old.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right? Cause x minus 6. So it makes sense.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Narat is 4 years older than Umaima. Nazrat is 7, Umaima is 3 right now.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And 2 years ago Nazrat was 5 times older tham Umaima

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2 years ago Nazrat was 5 and Umaima was 1.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, it all works out. Pretty neat, no?

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
On the way I think you are ready to at least try some of these age problems.

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'm gonna do some more example promlems so you can come back to the this video page

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and see more if you're a little bit confused.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Have fun!
