1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,260
the ancient roman emperor hadrian built the lavish

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,888
river nuteiville. and in the dining room

3
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:13,405
there was a formal deck and we are looking at a fragment

4
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:17,673
of that, which shows two centaurs and three large cats

5
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:22,500
and it is made of tiny pieces of natural stone

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,332
which must have taken an enormous amount of

7
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:28,017
patience to create. especially if we consider

8
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:30,758
that this is a small fragment of the very large floor mosaic.

9
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:34,418
these are tiny pieces of drawing and they are put together so that

10
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:37,596
they can create and can be read very clearly

11
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:41,151
even now that they are pieces of stone. in fact

12
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:44,051
these kinds of mosaics might give us an indication

13
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:46,886
of what greek painting looked like. so good a great

14
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:49,194
painting has come down to us. we know from

15
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:51,505
from written accounts that the greeks believed that their

16
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:55,074
painting was the greatest art. we generally think of ancient greek sculpture

17
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:58,110
and ancient greek architecture. but perhaps thher is painting

18
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,540
and all that the greek themselves pailed the comparison

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,269
to the work they did on the walls and yet none of them survived.

20
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:09,763
the mosaics are really valuable in giving us a sense of what the greeks

21
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:13,892
had been able to achieve. well i thought about this mosaic is

22
00:01:13,892 --> 00:01:17,015
the drama. we have the centaur, amythical creature

23
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:21,220
that is half man and half horse. and he is

24
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,099
involved in a battle agains these three wild cats

25
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:29,003
He raises his arms and is about to toll a rock down

26
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:33,236
onto a tiger who has atatcked another centaur.

27
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:37,718
behind him is abother wild cat who has been felled, probably a lion.

28
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:40,634
you will notice that the centaur is about to

29
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,015
hurl a rock aat the tiger down to his left,

30
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:45,734
looks up and leapord is about to attack him

31
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:49,373
so we really have a sense of of split second in time.

32
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:52,335
its true. in fact if you look at the glances

33
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:55,598
it is really interesting. our eyes first go from the centaur to the tiger

34
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:59,152
and we notice that the tiger has just felled another centaur.

35
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,577
the tiger looks back aat the centaur, but the centaur

36
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:05,421
does not look at the tiger the centaurs eyes have been caught by

37
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:07,320
the leapord. he knows he is about to throw the

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,993
large boulder, which tells us bout the strength of centaurs

39
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:13,429
but also we realise that he is in danger from the leapord.

40
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:16,173
so this is the kind of triangular relations

41
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:18,476
of the glances of the figures. so that centaur that

42
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:24,158
we see at the centre really expresses physical strength.

43
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:25,662
but also a sense of his body and concern. yes its intersting

44
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:26,593
my guess is that the greeks and later the romans

45
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:28,362
might have identified with the centaur thah the wild cats

46
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:34,994
usually when we see centaurs, they in battle with

47
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:38,247
the greeks and the greeks are for those we have sympathy for

48
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:41,046
the greeks were frothe civilised, where as the

49
00:02:41,046 --> 00:02:44,827
centaurs , who are still half wild are the agressors.

50
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:48,195
here that is reversed. here our sympathy goes to the centaurs

51
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:50,048
because of the human qualities

52
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:53,458
even if they are still half of nature. you know the greeks

53
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,707
and later the romans saw themselves as separate from the chaos of nature.

54
00:02:56,707 --> 00:03:02,023
and here the centaur represents a kind of brutality but nothing

55
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:04,305
compared to those of the cats.and i think that is

56
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:07,046
beautifully expressed by the emotion , we see on the

57
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:14,196
centaurs face. we read that as a complex union of emotion, of worry fear and also of strength.

58
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:17,391
and of the animal of no emotion. so i think

59
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:20,718
you are right. we are meant to identify with that figure

60
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:23,312
at the centre though he is half animal

61
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:27,178
and he is almost draped over hsi arm. he has actually got

62
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:30,344
the pelt of the leapord. so there is a good reason for the leapord to be annoyed

63
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:34,979
you said that this may give an idea of what ancient greek painting looked like

64
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,105
and in this miosaic we see what we see in ancint greek sculpture

65
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:42,221
this does revive and there is even an intteresting anamoly

66
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,977
qand naturalism. in fact if youlook at the rendering

67
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:48,391
of this cental creature, which is obviously impossible

68
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:52,840
this is beautifully rendered that it looks almost possible anatomically.

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,744
look at the way in which the abdomen of the man moves into the chest of the horse.

70
00:03:56,744 --> 00:04:00,170
and we can imagine the way the backbone of both the animals might have

71
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,597
united to become one. there is really a sense of believability even in this impossible creature.

72
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:09,397
and we have a very realisstic vision of the rocky landscape.

73
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:13,761
these figures have to occupy. the figures of fallen centaur on the left

74
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:17,661
and fallen lion on the right are foreshortened, helping to create this illusion of space. look at the

75
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:22,210
beautiful foreshortening in this still operating centaur.

76
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,165
and the way in which the horses legs are going back

77
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:29,031
in space is really beautifully done and the fact that it is done in stone

78
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:32,202
makes it even more impressive. that is really a remarkable achievement.

79
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:37,482
and i would have loved to seen this in it's greater context, in hadrians dining room

80
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:43,371
in his palace
