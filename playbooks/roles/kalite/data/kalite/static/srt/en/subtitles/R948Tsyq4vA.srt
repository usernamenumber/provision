1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,740
Find the slope of the
line in the graph.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,020
And just as a bit of a review,
slope is just telling us how

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,490
steep a line is.

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:19,850
And the best way to view it,
slope is equal to change in y

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,510
over change in x.

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,510
   

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:31,080
And for a line, this will
always be constant.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,940
And sometimes you might see it
written like this: you might

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,590
see this triangle, that's a
capital delta, that means

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,730
change in, change in
y over change in x.

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,560
That's just a fancy way
of saying change in y

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,740
over change in x.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,760
So let's see what this change
in y is for any change in x.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,010
So let's start at some point
that seems pretty reasonable

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,810
to read from this table right
here, from this graph.

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,560
So let's see, we're starting
here-- let me do it in a more

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,160
vibrant color-- so let's
say we start at

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,520
that point right there.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,350
And we want to go to another
point that's pretty

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,379
straightforward to read,
so we can move to

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,450
that point right there.

23
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,340
We could literally pick any
two points on this line.

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,490
I'm just picking ones that are
nice integer coordinates, so

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,610
it's easy to read.

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,510
So what is the change in y and
what is the change in x?

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,540
So first let's look at
the change in x.

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,750
So if we go from there
to there, what is

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,510
the change in x?

30
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,660
My change in x is
equal to what?

31
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,340
Well, I can just count it out.

32
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,480
I went 1 steps, 2
steps, 3 steps.

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,620
My change in x is 3.

34
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,400
And you could even see
it from the x values.

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,060
If I go from negative 3
to 0, I went up by 3.

36
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,105
So my change in x is 3.

37
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:48,200
So let me write this, change in
x, delta x is equal to 3.

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,860
And what's my change in y?

39
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,200
Well, my change in y, I'm going
from negative 3 up to

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,580
negative 1, or you could
just say 1, 2.

41
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:05,260
So my change in y, is
equal to positive 2.

42
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,360
So let me write that down.

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,710
Change in y is equal to 2.

44
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,450
So what is my change in
y for a change in x?

45
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:19,560
Well, when my change in x was
3, my change in y is 2.

46
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,870
So this is my slope.

47
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,490
And one thing I want to do, I
want to show you that I could

48
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,910
have really picked any
two points here.

49
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,670
Let's say I didn't pick-- let me
clear this out-- let's say

50
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,970
I didn't pick those two points,
let me pick some other

51
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,700
points, and I'll even go in
a different direction.

52
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,510
I want to show you that you're
going to get the same answer.

53
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,440
Let's say I've used this as my
starting point, and I want to

54
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,300
go all the way over there.

55
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,640
Well, let's think about the
change in y first. So the

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,960
change in y, I'm going down
by how many units?

57
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,490
1, 2, 3, 4 units, so my change
in y, in this example, is

58
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,000
negative 4.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,710
I went from 1 to negative
3, that's negative 4.

60
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,400
That's my change in y.

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,950
Change in y is equal
to negative 4.

62
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,820
Now what is my change in x?

63
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,320
Well I'm going from this point,
or from this x value,

64
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,020
all the way-- let me do that in
a different color-- all the

65
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,080
way back like this.

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,880
So I'm going to the left, so
it's going to be a negative

67
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,060
change in x, and I went 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 units back.

68
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,845
So my change in x is equal
to negative 6.

69
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:38,380
   

70
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,470
And you can even see I started
it at x is equal to 3, and I

71
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,910
went all the way to x is
equal to negative 3.

72
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,430
That's a change of negative 6.

73
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,050
I went 6 to the left, or
a change of negative 6.

74
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,270
So what is my change in
y over change in x?

75
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,670
My change in y over change in x
is equal to negative 4 over

76
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,790
negative 6.

77
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,370
The negatives cancel out
and what's 4 over 6?

78
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,380
Well, that's just 2 over 3.

79
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,610
So it's the same value, you just
have to be consistent.

80
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,200
If this is my start point,
I went down 4, and

81
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,930
then I went back 6.

82
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,330
Negative 4 over negative 6.

83
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,800
If I viewed this as my starting
point, I could say

84
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:21,040
that I went up 4, so it would
be a change in y would be 4,

85
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,480
and then my change
in x would be 6.

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,640
And either way, once again,
change in y over change in x

87
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,370
is going to be 4 over 6, 2/3.

88
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,440
So no matter which point you
choose, as long as you kind of

89
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,570
think about it in a consistent
way, you're going to get the

90
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,870
same value for slope.

91
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,200
