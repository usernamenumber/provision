1
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:11,028
Whenever we talk about money, the amount of money

2
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:12,204
is not the only thing that matters

3
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:15,429
what also matters is when you have to get, or

4
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:18,850
when you have to give the money.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,637
So to think about this or to make it a little more

6
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:23,763
concrete, let's assume that we live in a world

7
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,279
that if you put money in a bank, you are guaranteed

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,062
10% interest.

9
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:34,831
10% risk free interest in a bank.

10
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,697
And this is high by historical standards,

11
00:00:36,697 --> 00:00:37,663
but it will make our math easy.

12
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,954
So let's just assume that you can always get

13
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:43,843
10% risk free interest in the bank.

14
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,301
Now, given that, let me through out scenarios

15
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:47,756
and have you think about which of these

16
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,233
that you would most want.

17
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:54,746
So I could give you $100 right now

18
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:56,541
that's option 1,

19
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,706
I could in 1 year, instead of giving you the

20
00:00:58,706 --> 00:01:01,162
$100 immediately,

21
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:09,302
in 1 year I could give you $109

22
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:13,893
and then in 2 years, this is kind of option 3

23
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:17,235
I'd be willing to give you

24
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:20,954
$120

25
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:23,387
So your choice is, someone walks up to you in the street

26
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:24,933
"I could give you $100 bill now,

27
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:30,882
"...$109 in a year, or a $120 2 years from now"

28
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,236
And you know in the back of your mind

29
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:36,008
you can get 10% risk free interest.

30
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:37,795
So given that you don't have an immediate

31
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:38,975
need for money

32
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:41,248
we're assuming that this money you will save.

33
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:43,531
That you don't have a bill to pay immediately.

34
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:46,931
Which of these things are the most desirable?

35
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:49,074
which of these would you most want to have?

36
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:52,754
Well, if you just cared about the absolute value

37
00:01:52,754 --> 00:01:54,414
or the absolute amount of the money

38
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,164
you'd say, "hey look! $120! that's the biggest

39
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:59,516
amount of money. I'm gonna take that one"

40
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:01,097
because that's just the biggest number,

41
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:02,131
but you probably have in the back of your mind

42
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:04,192
"well I'm getting that later"

43
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:06,078
so there may be something I'm losing out on there

44
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:07,873
and you're right, you would be losing out on

45
00:02:07,873 --> 00:02:09,968
the opportunity to get the 10% risk free interest

46
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:13,400
if you were to get the money earlier.

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,897
And if you want to

48
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:16,420
if you wanted to compare them

49
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,811
directly, the thought process would be

50
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:19,869
well let's see

51
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:23,143
if I got the, if I took option 1, if I got the $100

52
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,550
if you were to put it in the bank, what would that grow to

53
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,526
based on that 10% risk free interest?

54
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:34,641
Well after 1 year, 10% of $100 dollars is $10

55
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:36,946
So you would get $10 in interest

56
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:40,656
so after 1 year, your entire savings in the bank

57
00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:43,962
will now be $110.

58
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:45,431
So just doing that little exercise,

59
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,147
we actually see that $100 given now

60
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:51,119
put in the bank at 10% risk free

61
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:54,502
will actually turn into $110 a year from now

62
00:02:54,502 --> 00:02:58,136
which is better than the $109 a year from now

63
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,403
So, given this scenario, or this kind of situation

64
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:04,437
or this option, you would rather do this than do this

65
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:08,006
A year from now you're better off by a dollar

66
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:09,944
What about 2 years from now?

67
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:12,143
Well if you take that $100 after 1 year

68
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:15,835
it becomes $110, then 10% of $110

69
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:20,680
is $11, you want to add $11 to it

70
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,715
so it becomes $121

71
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:27,545
so once again, you're better off taking the $100

72
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:29,847
investing it in the bank risk free

73
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:33,917
10% per year. It turns into $121

74
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:36,312
that is a better situation than just someone

75
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:38,772
guaranteeing you to give the $120 in 2 years

76
00:03:38,772 --> 00:03:43,452
once again you are better off by $1.

77
00:03:43,452 --> 00:03:45,359
And so this idea, not just the amount matters

78
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,884
but when you get it,

79
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:56,429
this idea is called "the time value of money,"

80
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:58,309
Or another way to think about it is,

81
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:00,506
think about what the value of this money is

82
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,539
over time, given some expected interest rate

83
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,214
and when you do that, you could compare this

84
00:04:05,214 --> 00:04:08,911
money to equal amounts of money at some future date.

85
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:11,578
Now another way of thinking about the time value,

86
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:14,008
or I guess another related concept

87
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,596
to the time value of money, is the idea of

88
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:21,204
present value.

89
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:23,090
and maybe I'll talk about present value and

90
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,641
future value.

91
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:30,998
So, present and future value.

92
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:34,386
So, given this assumption, this $110, this 10% assumption

93
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:36,437
if someone were to ask you,

94
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:41,724
"what is the present value of $121 2 years in the future?"

95
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:45,471
They're essentially asking you

96
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:48,682
So what is the present value?

97
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:50,031
PV stands for Present Value

98
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:54,022
So what is the present value of $121 2 years in the future?

99
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:56,564
That's equivalent to asking,

100
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,369
what type of money, what amount of money

101
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:01,108
would you have put into the bank, risk free

102
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:03,865
over the next 2 years to get $121?

103
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:06,578
Now we know that, if you put $100 in the bank

104
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:09,241
for 2 years, at 10% risk free

105
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:14,360
you would get $121. So the present value here

106
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,262
The present value of $121 is the $100

107
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:22,973
or another way to think about present and future value

108
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:24,757
if someone were to ask, what is the future value?

109
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:32,027
What is the future value of this $100 in 1 year?

110
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:34,685
So, in 1 year, if you put

111
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:37,040
if you get 10% in the bank that's guaranteed

112
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,724
it's future value is $110,

113
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:44,016
after 2 years, it's 2 year future value is

114
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:46,280
$121

115
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,401
and so with that in mind let me give you one

116
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:48,824
slightly more interesting problem:

117
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,893
so let's say that I have

118
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,257
Let's say, we're going to assume this the whole time,

119
00:05:53,257 --> 00:05:56,012
that makes our math easy at 10% risk free interest,

120
00:05:56,012 --> 00:06:01,093
and let's say someone says that they're willing to give us

121
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:11,268
$65 in 1 year, and we were to ask ourselves,

122
00:06:11,268 --> 00:06:16,947
"what is the present value of this?"

123
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:19,878
So, remember, the present value is

124
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,905
just asking you, what amount of money

125
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:23,898
that if you were to put it in the bank

126
00:06:23,898 --> 00:06:25,650
at this risk free interest

127
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,768
would be equivalent to this $65

128
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:30,548
which of these two are equivalent to you?

129
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:33,179
And so you would say, well look

130
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:36,723
whatever amount of money that is, let's call that "x"

131
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:38,454
whatever amount of money that is,

132
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:40,222
times, if I grow it at 10%

133
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:44,182
That's literally, I'm taking x plus 10% x

134
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:46,912
let me write it this way,

135
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:48,513
plus 10% times x

136
00:06:48,513 --> 00:06:50,147
or let me write it, let me make it clearer this way

137
00:06:50,147 --> 00:07:00,451
x plus 10% of x should be equal to our $65

138
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:03,012
If I take the amount, I get 10% of that amount

139
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,920
over the year, that should be equal to

140
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,699
$65.

141
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,345
And this is the same thing as 1x

142
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:12,459
or we could say that 1x plus 10% is the same thing as

143
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:16,371
0.10x is equal to 65, or you add these two

144
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:18,838
1.10x is equal to 65

145
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:23,053
and if you want to solve for the actual amount

146
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:24,415
of the present value here

147
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,715
you would just divide both sides by the 1.10

148
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:30,125
So you'd get x is equal to

149
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,317
Let me do it this way, be a little bit more clear about it

150
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:37,156
So let's divide both sides by 1.1

151
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,454
and really that trailing zero doesn't matter

152
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:40,736
we're not really too worried about the precision here

153
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:43,232
because this is actually exactly 10%

154
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:46,289
So this is going to be, these cancel out

155
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,263
and x is going to be equal to

156
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:51,129
get the calculator out

157
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:54,896
x is going to be equal to

158
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:57,764
65 divided by 1.1

159
00:07:57,764 --> 00:08:02,286
$59.09 rounding it

160

So, x is equal to $59.09

161
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:09,772
which was the present value

162
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:11,988
of $65 in 1 year

163
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:13,873
or another way to think about it is

00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:19,130
if you wanted to know what the future value is of $59.09 is in 1 year

165
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,701
assuming that 10% interest

166
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,824
