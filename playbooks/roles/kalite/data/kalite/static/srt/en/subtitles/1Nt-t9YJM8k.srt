00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,580
Welcome to the presentation on the Level two exponents.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,470
In Level two exponents,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,105
the only thing we're going to add to the mix now

4
00:00:08,105 --> 00:00:09,730
is the concept of a negative exponent.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,170
So we learned already that 2 to the third power,

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,130
well, that just equals 2 x 2 x 2.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,100
Hopefully, by now, that's second nature to you,

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,310
and that equals 8.

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,240
Now I'm going to teach you

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,620
what 2 to the negative third power is.

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,130
I know a lot of you are going to say, oh no, that's -8,

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,640
but whenever you see exponents,

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,218
you always have to remind yourself,

14
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:34,321
exponents are not multiplication.

15
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:35,690
I know there's that temptation to say,

16
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,653
well, 2 x -3 is -6,

17
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:40,725
so maybe 2 to the negative third power is -8,

18
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:41,939
but that's not the case.

19
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:44,406
And I'll explain in a future module

20
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:46,571
why we use this convention

21
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:50,146
but 2 to the negative 3rd power, it turns out,

22
00:00:50,146 --> 00:00:57,560
is equivalent to 1/2 to the 3rd power.

23
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,270
So it turns out that the negative exponent,

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,430
what it does is it means to take the inverse of the base,

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,930
we'll call the number 2 as the base--

26
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,060
and take that to the positive version of the exponent.

27
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,010
And 1/2 to the third power?

28
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:16,781
Well, we already learned that's 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2,

29
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:19,160
and that equals 1/8.

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,590
So we say 2 to the negative third power.

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,030
That didn't come out right.

32
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,290
2 to the negative third power is equal to 1/8.

33
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,800
Let's do another one.

34
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:38,520
Let's say 3 to the -2 power.

35
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,344
Once again, immediately when we see

36
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:42,728
that negative in the exponent, the easiest thing to do

37
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,880
is just immediately take the reciprocal of the base.

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,770
So we take 1/3.

39
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,900
And we raise that to the +2 power.

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,030
And that's easy now.

41
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,260
1/3 squared, well, that's equal to 1/9.

42
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:00,397
Let's do some more problems.

43
00:02:00,397 --> 00:02:11,940
What if I had 2/3 to the negative third power?

44
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,950
Once again, just to make it simple, whenever I see

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,890
that negative in the exponent, I want to get rid of it.

46
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,090
So I immediately take the reciprocal of the base.

47
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,098
The reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2 ,

48
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:27,180
and I raise that to the positive third power.

49
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,490
So what changed between the left and the right side?

50
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,477
The 2/3 I flipped,

51
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:34,520
and I turned the -3 into a +3.

52
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,500
And now this just becomes a Level one exponent.

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:52,700
This equals 3/2 x 3/2 x 3/2, and that equals 27/8.

54
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,960
So that's interesting.

55
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,140
2/3 to the -3 is equal to 27/8.

56
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,095
Let's do some more.

57
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:12,139
Let's do 4/7 to the -1.

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,860
Once again, we have a negative number in the exponent.

59
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,690
That's the same thing as taking the reciprocal of the base

60
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,710
and raising it to the positive exponent.

61
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,410
Well, 7/4 to the 1, any number to the first power

62
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,560
is just the same number.

63
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,370
It's equal to 7/4.

64
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,760
So when take it to the -1 power, all you're essentially doing

65
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,480
is getting the reciprocal of the number.

66
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,430
Let's do some more problems.

67
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,390
2 to the -5.

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,637
Once again, we take the reciprocal of 2,

69
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:47,900
and we say 1/2

70
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,680
and now that can be raised to the 5th power,

71
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:00,520
and that equals 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2,

72
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,740
and that equals 1/32.

73
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,030
Another way we could have viewed 2 to the negative 5th

74
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,260
is that, 2 to the negative 5th,

75
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,046
we could have said that equals 1/2 to the 5th.

76
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:18,587
We know that 2 to the 5th is 32.

77
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:20,171
That would be the same thing.

78
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:21,299
Two ways to do it,

79
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,272
pretty much just changing the order of when you flip

80
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:27,200
versus when you actually calculate the exponent.

81
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,100
Let me do two or three more problems.

82
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,989
And after I write down each of these problems,

83
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:34,602
you might just want to pause it

84
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:36,100
and see if you can do the problem yourself,

85
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,090
and then compare your answer to mine.

86
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:46,750
So let's say I had -4 to the negative 3rd power.

87
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,070
Immediately, I like to get rid of the negative in the exponent,

88
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:57,571
and I know that that equals -1/4 to the 3rd power,

89
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:03,490
and that equals -1/4 x -1/4

90
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,110
x -1/4.

91
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,620
The negative times a negative is a positive,

92
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,497
but then we're multiplying that times another negative,

93
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:11,868
so we get a negative.

94
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:14,142
1 x 1 x 1 is 1.

95
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:18,360
4 x 4 is 16 x 4 is 64.

96
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,330
So it equals -1/64.

97
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,422
Let's do another problem.

98
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:29,338
Let me think of a good number.

99
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:31,140
8/9.

100
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,260
Let's make it negative.

101
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:40,220
-8/9 to the negative 2nd power.

102
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,740
Well, once again, that equals -9/8.

103
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,560
Notice, I immediately just took the reciprocal of the base

104
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,864
to the +2 power,

105
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:57,470
and now that equals -9/8 x -9/8.

106
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,170
A negative times a negative is a positive,

107
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,937
so we get 9 x 9 is 81/64.

108
00:06:04,937 --> 00:06:06,250
I think you get the point now.

109
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,720
The only new thing we've learned, really, is that

110
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,907
when you have a negative exponent,

111
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:14,201
it's the same thing as taking the reciprocal of the base

112
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:16,240
and raising it to the positive exponent.

113
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,140
Hopefully, that last statement didn't confuse you more,

114
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,480
did more good than damage,

115
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,810
but I think you're ready to try some problems now.

116
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,000
Have fun.
