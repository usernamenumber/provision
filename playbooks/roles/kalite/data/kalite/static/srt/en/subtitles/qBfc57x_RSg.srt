1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
   

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,420
I've got this matrix, A, here,
it's a 2 by 3 matrix.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,210
And just as a bit of review,
let's figure out its nullspace

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,920
and its columnspace.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,300
So the nullspace of A is the set
of all vectors x that are

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,550
member of-- let's see we have
3 columns here-- so a member

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,580
of R3, such that A times the
vector are going to be equal

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,210
to the 0 vector.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,820
So we can just set this up.

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,800
Let me just-- we just need to
figure out all of the x's that

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,990
satisfy this in R3.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,710
So we take our matrix
A 2, minus 1, minus

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,120
3, minus 4, 2, 6.

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,965
Multiply them times some
arbitrary vector in R3 here.

15
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:47,060
So you get x1, x2, x3.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,210
And you set them equal
to the 0 vector.

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,930
It's going to be the
0 vector in R2.

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,120
Because we have 2 rows here.

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,770
You multiply a 2 by 3 matrix
times a vector in R3, you're

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,250
going to get a 2 by 1 vector
or 2 by 1 matrix.

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,560
So you're going to get
the 0 vector in R3.

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,590
And to solve what is essentially
a system of

23
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,570
equations-- you get 2 x1 minus
x2 minus 3 x3 is equal to 0

24
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,930
and so on and so forth.

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,610
We can just set up an
augmented matrix.

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,890
So we can just set up this
augmented matrix right here.

27
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,240
2 minus 1 minus 3
minus 4, 2, 6.

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,140
And then augment it with what
we're trying to set it equal

29
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,420
to to solve the system.

30
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,690
And you know we're going to
perform a bunch of row

31
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,690
operations here to put this in
reduced row echelon form.

32
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,610
And they're not going to change
the right-hand side of

33
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,560
this augmented matrix.

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,700
And that's essentially the
argument as to why the

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,390
nullspace of the reduced row
echelon form of A is the same

36
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,600
thing as the nullspace of A.

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,430
But anyway, that's just
a bit of review.

38
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,690
So let's perform some row
operations to solve this a

39
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,680
little bit better.

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,600
So, the first thing I might
want to do is divide the

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,145
first row by 2.

42
00:01:57,145 --> 00:02:02,970
So if I divide the first row by
2 I get a 1 minus 1/2 minus

43
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,220
3/2 and then of course
0 divided by 2 is 0.

44
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:14,200
And let's just divide this row
right here by-- I don't know

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,680
just to simplify things--
let's divide it by 4.

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,890
So I'm doing two row operations
in one step.

47
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,560
And you can do that.

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,510
I could have done it in
two separate steps.

49
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,100
So if we divide it by 4, this
becomes minus 1, 1/2 and then

50
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,640
you get 3/2 and then
you get 0.

51
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,570
And now, let's keep my
first row the same.

52
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,150
I'm going to keep my
first row the same.

53
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,960
It's 1 minus 1/2 minus 3/2 and
of course the 0 is the

54
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,070
right-hand side.

55
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,420
Now let's replace my second
row with my second row

56
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,550
plus my first row.

57
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,580
So these are just linear
operations on these guys.

58
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,170
So negative 1 plus 1 is 0.

59
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,190
1/2 plus minus 1/2 is 0.

60
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,400
3/2 plus minus 3/2 is 0.

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,190
And of course, 0 plus 0 is 0.

62
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,800
So what are we left with?

63
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,430
we're left with this
right here.

64
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,310
This is another way of saying
that x1-- let me write it this

65
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:19,940
way-- x1-- I guess the easiest
way to think about it is--

66
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,070
you're multiplying the reduced
row echelon form of A now.

67
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,750
1 minus 1/2 minus 3/2.

68
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,950
You have a bunch of 0's here.

69
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:37,310
Times x1, x2, x3 is equal
to the R2 0 vector.

70
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,680
This is another interpretation
of this augmented matrix.

71
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,150
So this is just saying,
this is useless.

72
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,540
This is saying 0 times that plus
0 times that plus 0 times

73
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,680
that is equal to 0.

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,690
So it's giving us
no information.

75
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:54,280
But this first row tells us
that-- let me switch colors--

76
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:04,740
1 times x1 minus 1/2 times
x2 minus 3/2 times

77
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,010
x3 is equal to 0.

78
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,240
All of the vectors whose
components satisfy this are in

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,580
my nullspace.

80
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,950
If I want to write it a little
bit differently I could write

81
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:22,079
as, x1 is equal to 1/2
x2 plus 3/2 x3.

82
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,450
Or if I wanted to write my
solution set in vector form, I

83
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,170
could write that my nullspace is
going to be the set of all

84
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:34,960
the vectors x1, x2, x3 that
satisfy these conditions.

85
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,150
That are equal to what?

86
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,950
Well, x2 and x3 are
free variables.

87
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,760
They're associated with the
non-pivot entries, or the

88
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,670
non-pivot columns in our reduced
row echelon form.

89
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,500
That is a pivot column
right there.

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,720
   

91
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,595
So let me write it this way.

92
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,670
It's going to be x2
times something

93
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,100
plus x3 times something.

94
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,180
Those are my two
free variables.

95
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,270
And we have here,
x1 is 1/2 x2.

96
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,690
1/2 times x2 plus
3/2 times x3.

97
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,850
   

98
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,790
x2 is just going to be x2
times 1 plus 0 times x3.

99
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:25,060
x3 is going to be 0 times
x2 plus 1 times x3.

100
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,310
So, our nullspace, these
can be any real

101
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,470
numbers right here.

102
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,780
They're free variables.

103
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,440
So our nullspace is essentially
all of the linear

104
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,420
combinations of this
guy and that guy.

105
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:45,430
Or another way to write it, the
nullspace of A is equal to

106
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,730
the span, which is the same
thing as all the linear

107
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:55,280
combinations of the
span of 1/2, 1, 0.

108
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,050
Notice these are
vectors in R3.

109
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,620
And that makes sense because the
nullspace is going to be a

110
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,710
set of vectors in R3.

111
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,310
So it's the span of that.

112
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,560
And that right there.

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,080
   

114
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,850
So 3/2, 0, and 1.

115
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,460
Just like that.

116
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:20,600
And what is the columnspace
of our original matrix, A?

117
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:27,850
So the columnspace of A is equal
to just, the subspace

118
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,430
created by all of the linear
combinations of these guys.

119
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,830
Or essentially the span
of the column vectors.

120
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:39,310
Is equal to the span
of 2 minus 4 minus

121
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,550
1, 2, minus 3, 6.

122
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,180
These are all each
separate vectors.

123
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,360
So it's the span of
these 3 vectors.

124
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,540
Now, these guys might not
be linearly independent.

125
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,394
And actually, when you put
this guy in reduced row

126
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:57,960
echelon form, you know that the
basis vectors for this are

127
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,010
the vectors that are associated

128
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,530
with our pivot columns.

129
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,760
So we have one pivot
column here.

130
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,740
It's our first column.

131
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,900
So we could say that we could
use this as a basis vector.

132
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,780
And it makes sense.

133
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,280
Because this guy right here
is minus 2 times this guy.

134
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,660
This guy right here is minus
3/2 times that guy.

135
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,030
So these two guys can definitely
be represented as

136
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,870
linear combinations
of that guy.

137
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:30,670
So it's equal to the span of
just the vector, 2, minus 4.

138
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,570
So if you were to ask me, and
this is the basis for our

139
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,300
columnspace.

140
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,160
So if you wanted to know the
rank-- and this is all a bit

141
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,050
of review-- the rank of A is
equal to the number of vectors

142
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,290
in our basis for our
columnspace.

143
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,370
So it's going to
be equal to 1.

144
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,580
Now, everything I just did
is a bit of review.

145
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,740
But with the last couple of
videos, we've been dealing

146
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,520
with transposes.

147
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,540
So let's actually figure out
the same ideas for the

148
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,790
transpose of A.

149
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,120
   

150
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,160
So A transpose looks
like this.

151
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:18,790
A transpose is equal to the
matrix 2, minus 1, minus 3 is

152
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,470
the first column right there.

153
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,910
And then the second column is
going to be minus 4, 2 and 6.

154
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,240
That is our transpose.

155
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,100
So let's figure out the
nullspace and the columnspace

156
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,350
of our transpose.

157
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:37,080
   

158
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,940
Let me put this in reduced
row echelon form so

159
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,159
we can get the nullspace.

160
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,919
Let me get the nullspace
of this guy.

161
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,900
So we could do the exact
same exercise.

162
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,660
Let me write it this way.

163
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,090
The nullspace of
A transpose-- A

164
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,480
transpose is a 3 by 2 matrix.

165
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,350
So it's equal to all of
the vectors, x, that

166
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,540
are members of R2.

167
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,040
Not R3 anymore-- because now we
are taking the transpose's

168
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,810
nullspace-- such that A
transpose times R vectors are

169
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,880
equal to the 0 vector in R3.

170
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,210
   

171
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,930
And we can do that the same
exact way we did before.

172
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,230
We set up an augmented matrix.

173
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,740
We could just put it in reduced
row echelon form and

174
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,770
set them all equal to 0.

175
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,980
So let's just do that.

176
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,480
So if we-- let me just put it
in reduced row echelon form.

177
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,460
So let me divide my
first row by 2.

178
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,460
Let's divide the
first row by 2.

179
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,770
I'm just going to put it in
reduced row echelon form.

180
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,760
The first row divided
by 2 is 1 minus 2.

181
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,090
And then the second row, let
me divide it-- let me just,

182
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,900
I'll just keep it the same--
so minus 1, 2.

183
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,460
And then this last row,
let me divide it by 3.

184
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,490
So it becomes minus 1 and 2.

185
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,420
And now, let me keep my
first row the same.

186
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,910
1 minus 2.

187
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,190
And now let me replace my second
row with my second row

188
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,050
plus my first row.

189
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,480
So minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

190
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,440
2 plus minus 2 is 0.

191
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,830
You get some 0's.

192
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,160
I'm going to do the same thing
with the third row.

193
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,420
Replace it with it plus
the first row.

194
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,800
Once again you're going
to get some 0's.

195
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,840
So this is the reduced row
echelon form of A transpose.

196
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,830
   

197
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,190
And its nullspace is the same
as A transpose's nullspace.

198
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,990
   

199
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,770
We could say, to find this
nullspace we can find all of

200
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:42,740
the solutions to this equation
times the vectors x1 and x2 is

201
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:50,060
equal to 0, 0, and 0.

202
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,830
These aren't vectors.

203
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,650
These are just entries
right here.

204
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,830
0, 0, 0.

205
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,190
So these two lines give
us no information, but

206
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,140
this first one does.

207
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,620
So we get 1 times x1-- and
notice, this is the pivot

208
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,580
column right here.

209
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,640
It's associated.

210
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,930
So x1 is going to be
a pivot variable.

211
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,530
x2 will be a free variable.

212
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,390
And just to be clear that
the first column

213
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,260
is our pivot column.

214
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,420
So if we go back to A transpose,
it's this first

215
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,470
column here that is associated
with the pivot column.

216
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,770
So when we talk about its
columnspace, this by itself

217
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,660
will span the columnspace.

218
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,310
This is all a review of
what we did before.

219
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,190
We're just applying it
to the transpose.

220
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,600
Let's go back to
our nullspace.

221
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,610
So this tells us that 1 times
x1, so x1, minus 2 times x2,

222
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,030
is equal to 0.

223
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,830
Or we could say that x1 is
equal to 2 times x2.

224
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,620
So all of the vectors in R2 that
satisfy these conditions

225
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,190
with these entries will be in
the nullspace of A transpose.

226
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,440
Let me write it this way.

227
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,010
   

228
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,700
So the nullspace of A is going
to be the set of all the

229
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,930
vectors-- let me write it here--
the set of all the

230
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:12,130
vectors, x1, x2, that are member
of R2, clearly, such

231
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:19,670
that x1, x2 is going to be
equal to-- well, our free

232
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:26,800
variable is x2-- so it's
x2 times the vector.

233
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,860
So x1 has to be 2 times x2.

234
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,140
And obviously x2-- that's a 2--
is going to be 1 times x2.

235
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,710
So what is this going to be?

236
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,100
Well this is all of the linear
combinations of this vector

237
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,080
right here.

238
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:50,460
So we could say it's equal to
the span of our vector 2, 1.

239
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,540
Now, that's the nullspace.

240
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,200
Sorry, this was the nullspace
of A transpose.

241
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,090
I have to be very
careful there.

242
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,970
Now what is the columnspace?

243
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,210
The columnspace of A tranpose?

244
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,690
Well, the columnspace of A
transpose is the set of all

245
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,795
vectors spanned by
the columns of A.

246
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:10,590
So you could just say the span
of this column vector and this

247
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,570
column vector.

248
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,020
But we know, when we put it into
reduced row echelon form,

249
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,620
only this column vector
was associated

250
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,210
with a pivot column.

251
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,750
So this by itself, this
guy is a linear

252
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,640
combination of this guy.

253
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,690
If you multiply him by
minus 2, you get

254
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,523
that guy right there.

255
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:29,960
So it's consistent with
everything we've learned.

256
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:37,610
So it equals the span of just
this guy right here.

257
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:47,380
Of just the vector 2, minus
1, and minus 3.

258
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,620
That's just a nice, neat
exercise that we did.

259
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,260
Notice that your span here,
it's in R3, but it's just

260
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,190
going to be a line in R3.

261
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,490
Maybe in the next video I'll
do a more graphical

262
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,130
representation of it.

263
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,700
But I did this whole exercise to
introduce you to the ideas

264
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,760
of the nullspace of your
transpose and the columnspace

265
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,900
of your transpose.

266
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,140
Think about what the
columnspace of

267
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,580
your transpose is.

268
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:19,390
It's the subspace spanned by
that vector-- sorry-- spanned

269
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,810
by this vector and
that vector.

270
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,880
And it turns out that this guy
is a multiple of that guy.

271
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,890
So we could say just
by that guy.

272
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:31,370
But these were the rows of
our original matrix, A.

273
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:40,080
So we could also view this as
the span of the row vectors of

274
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,420
our original guy.

275
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,190
This is that column that is the
basis for the column span

276
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,410
of the R transpose matrix.

277
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,250
And of course this guy was a
linear combination of that.

278
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,600
So we could also view
the column span of

279
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,750
our transpose matrix.

280
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,570
It's equivalent to the subspace

281
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,010
spanned by these rows.

282
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,320
Or we could call that
the row space of A.

283
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,750
Let me write that down.

284
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,110
So the columnspace of
A transpose-- and

285
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,000
this is just general.

286
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,840
Let me write this generally.

287
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,870
It doesn't just apply
to this example.

288
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,310
So the columnspace of the
transpose of any matrix, this

289
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:24,030
is called the rowspace of A.

290
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,370
And it's a very natural name.

291
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,850
Because if A's got a bunch of
rows, we could call them the

292
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,360
transpose of some vectors.

293
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,150
So that's first row.

294
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,390
You got the second row.

295
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,430
All the way to, maybe,
the nth row.

296
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,290
Just like that.

297
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,530
These are vector transposes.

298
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,890
They're really just rows.

299
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,680
If you imagine the space
that's spanned by these

300
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,830
vectors, by the different rows,
that's essentially the

301
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,320
columnspace of the transpose.

302
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,660
Because when you transpose
it, each of

303
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,550
these guys become columns.

304
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,210
So that's what the
rowspace is.

305
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:01,100
Now, the nullspace of our
transpose-- let's write it

306
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,430
like this-- it was all
of the vectors x that

307
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,770
satisfied this equation.

308
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,870
Equals the 0 vector
right there.

309
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:18,460
Now, what happens if we take the
transpose of both sides of

310
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,710
this equation?

311
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:24,360
   

312
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,900
Well, we've learned from our
transpose properties, this is

313
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,375
equal to the reverse product of
each of those transposes.

314
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,950
So this is going to be equal
to, this is a vector, the

315
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,890
vector x transpose.

316
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,260
If this is a column vector
before, now it's going to

317
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,830
become a row vector.

318
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,610
And then, times A transpose
transpose.

319
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,210
And that's going to
be equal to the

320
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,300
transpose of the 0 vector.

321
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,130
Or, we could just write
this like this.

322
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,910
We could write this as some
matrix-- well let me just

323
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,070
write it like this.

324
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:06,130
Some column vector x-- what's
the transpose of A transpose?

325
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,290
Well that's just equal to A.

326
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,940
So you take the transpose
of this column vector.

327
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,000
You now get a row vector.

328
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,079
You could view it as a
matrix if you want.

329
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,790
If this was a member of Rn, this
is now going to be an 1

330
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,349
by n matrix.

331
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,170
If this was a member of Rn.

332
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,550
   

333
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,930
We kind of switched
the orders.

334
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,990
And we multiply it times the
transpose of the transpose.

335
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,580
We just get the matrix, A.

336
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,230
And we set that equal to the
transpose of the 0 vector.

337
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,080
Now this is interesting.

338
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,290
We now have it in terms of
our original matrix, A.

339
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,540
Now what did the nullspace of
our matrix, A look like?

340
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,140
The nullspace where all of the
vectors x that satisfied this

341
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,180
equation is equal to 0.

342
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,170
So the x was on the right.

343
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,230
So the nullspace is all the
x's that satisfy this.

344
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,780
The nullspace of our transpose
is all of the x's that satisfy

345
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,030
this equation.

346
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,610
   

347
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:14,260
So let me say the set of all
of the x's such that A

348
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,560
transpose times x
is equal to 0.

349
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,730
That is the nullspace
of A transpose.

350
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,380
   

351
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,700
Or we could also write this as
the set of all of the x's such

352
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,620
that the transpose of our x
times A is equal to the

353
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,970
transpose of the 0 vector.

354
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,880
And we have another
name for this.

355
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:48,390
This is called the left
nullspace of A.

356
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,490
Why is it called the
left nullspace?

357
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,270
Because now we have
x on our left.

358
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,920
In just a regular nullspace
you have x on the right.

359
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,660
But now, if you take the
nullspace of the transpose,

360
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,690
using just our transpose
properties, that's equivalent

361
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,890
to this transpose vector
right here.

362
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,800
Actually let me write this.

363
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,380
The transpose right there.

364
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,140
This transpose vector
multiplying A from the

365
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,080
left-hand side.

366
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,360
So all of the x's that satisfy
this is the left nullspace.

367
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,730
And it's going to be different
than your nullspace.

368
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,400
Notice, your nullspace of A
transpose was the span of this

369
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,750
right here.

370
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:31,040
This is also the left
nullspace of A.

371
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,690
Now what was just the regular
nullspace of A?

372
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,500
The regular nullspace of A was
essentially a plane in R3.

373
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,150
That's the nullspace of A.

374
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:48,070
The left nullspace of A
is just a line in R2.

375
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,320
Very different things.

376
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:57,330
And if you go to the rowspace,
what is the rowspace of A?

377
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,570
The rowspace of A
is a line in R3.

378
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,980
The rowspace of A
is a line in R3.

379
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,590
Well what is the columnspace
of A?

380
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,700
The columnspace of A, right
here, where did I have it?

381
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,100
Well, this is the only linearly
independent vector.

382
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,600
It was essentially
a line in R2.

383
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,290
So they're all very
different things.

384
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,450
And we'll study a little bit
more how they're all related.

385
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,330
Now there's one thing I
want to relate to you.

386
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,980
We figured out that the
rank of this vector

387
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,290
right here is 1.

388
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,210
Because when you put it in
reduced row echelon form there

389
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,130
was one pivot column.

390
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,780
And the basis vectors are those
associated with that

391
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,610
pivot column.

392
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,400
And if you count your basis
vectors, that's your dimension

393
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,180
of your space.

394
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,870
So the dimension of your
columnspace is 1.

395
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,760
And that's the same thing
as your rank.

396
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,620
Now what is the rank
of A transpose?

397
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,460
The rank of A transpose in the
example, when you put it in

398
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,260
reduced row echelon form, you
got one linearly independent

399
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,050
column vector.

400
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,770
So the basis for our
columnspace was

401
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,500
also equal to 1.

402
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,840
And in general, that's always
going to be the case.

403
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,860
   

404
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,340
That the rank of A, which
is the dimension of its

405
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,590
columnspace, is equal to the
rank of A transpose.

406
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,360
And if you think about it,
it makes a lot of sense.

407
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,140
To figure out the rank of A, you
essentially figure out how

408
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,200
many pivot columns they have.
Or another way to say it is

409
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:45,030
how many pivot entries they
have. When you want to find

410
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:51,760
the rank of your transpose
vector, you're essentially

411
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,810
just saying-- and I know this is
maybe getting a little bit

412
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,150
confusing-- but when you want
the rank of your transpose

413
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,090
vector, you're saying, how
many of these columns are

414
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,080
linearly independent?

415
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,880
Or which of these are linearly
independent?

416
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,730
And that's the same question
as saying, how many of your

417
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,250
rows up here are linearly
independent?

418
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,410
If you want to know how many
columns in your transpose are

419
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,320
linearly independent, that's
equivalent to asking how many

420
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,300
rows in your original matrix
are linearly independent.

421
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,770
And when you put this matrix in
reduced row echelon form,

422
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,180
everything in reduced row
echelon form are just row

423
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,810
operations.

424
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,240
So they are just linear
combinations of

425
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,560
these things up here.

426
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,130
Or you could go vice versa.

427
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,680
Everything up here is just
linear combinations of your

428
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,830
matrix in reduced row
echelon form.

429
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,940
So if you only have one pivot
entry, then this guy right

430
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,560
here, by himself, or one pivot
row, that guy by himself can

431
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,780
represent a basis for
your rowspace.

432
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,480
Or, all of your rows can be
represented by a linear

433
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,570
combination of your
pivot rows.

434
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,570
And because of that, you
just count that.

435
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,530
You say, OK there's
one in this case.

436
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,190
So the dimension of
my rowspace is 1.

437
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:05,980
And that's the same thing
as the dimension of my

438
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,430
transpose's columnspace.

439
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,890
I know it's getting all
confusing and it's late in the

440
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,270
day for me as well.

441
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,820
So that, hopefully, will
convince you that the rank of

442
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,280
our transpose is the
same as the rank of

443
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,950
our original matrix.

444
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,000
