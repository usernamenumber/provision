1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,220
A jogger and a walker set out
at 9:00 AM from the same

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,080
point, headed in the
same direction.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,660
The average speed of the jogger
is 1 mile per hour

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,080
slower than twice the
speed of the walker.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,140
So that's going to be an
equation right there.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,420
The average speed of the jogger
is 1 mile per hour

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,170
slower than twice the
speed of the walker.

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,740
And then they say, in 2 hours,
the jogger is 3 miles ahead of

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,200
the walker.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,350
That's going to be
another equation.

12
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,240
In 2 hours, the jogger is 3
miles ahead of the walker.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,250
Find the rate of the jogger.

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,580
So let's write down that first
statement in equation form.

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,610
The average speed of the jogger,
let's call that the

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,450
speed of the jogger.

17
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,380
That's the average speed of the
jogger is 1 mile per hour

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,700
slower than twice the
speed of the walker.

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,550
So that's equal to 2 times
the speed of the

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,940
walker, minus 1, right?

21
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,370
It's 1 mile per hour slower
than twice the

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,700
speed of the walker.

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,730
So that's that first
statement.

24
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,920
And then they say, in 2 hours,
the jogger is 3 miles ahead of

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,200
the walker.

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,890
So if we go 2 hours
into the future.

27
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,780
So in 2 hours, the second
statement is the jogger is 3

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,370
miles ahead of the walker.

29
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,100
So we could say that the
distance that the jogger has

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,550
traveled, so the distance of
the jogger, is 3 miles more

31
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,685
than the distance
of the walker.

32
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:34,510
It is equal to the distance
of the walker plus 3.

33
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,130
That's all I'm saying.

34
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,670
This is how far the
jogger's traveled.

35
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,710
He's traveled 3 miles more
than the walker.

36
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,640
Now right now I have two
equations with four unknowns.

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,750
That's not cool.

38
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,320
But they've given us
some information.

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,840
They said this has happened
after 2 hours.

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,830
So we can express the distances
they've traveled in

41
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,900
terms of the speed
they traveled at.

42
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,310
Just as a bit of a review,
distance is equal to rate

43
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,560
times time.

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,850
   

45
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,740
In this situation,
the time is 2.

46
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,470
The rate is the speed
of each person.

47
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,270
So we can figure out
the distance.

48
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,560
So if you want to know the
distance that the jogger

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,010
traveled, that's just going to
be 2 hours times the speed of

50
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,020
the jogger.

51
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,270
So it's just going to
be 2 times the speed

52
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,510
of the jogger, right?

53
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,580
Distance is equal to
rate times time,

54
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,280
or time times rate.

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,260
Either way.

56
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,450
What's the distance
of the walker?

57
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,350
Well, it's going to be 2
hours times the speed

58
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,890
of the walker, right?

59
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,750
Distance is equal to
rate times time.

60
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,880
So now we can rewrite this
equation in terms of the

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,850
speeds of the jogger
and the walker.

62
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,670
So this equation right here.

63
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,100
We can rewrite it as, instead of
writing the distance of the

64
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,460
jogger, we could write 2 times
the speed of the jogger--

65
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,230
that's that right there-- is
equal to-- instead of writing

66
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,800
the distance of the walker, we
could write 2 times the speed

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,900
of the walker, make sure that's
a subscript-- speed of

68
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,770
the walker plus 3.

69
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,830
Now we have two equations and
two unknowns, and it looks

70
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,410
pretty tempting to eliminate
one of the variables.

71
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,660
In particular, we have a 2 times
the speed of the walker,

72
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,605
we have a 2 times the speed
of the walker here.

73
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:21,040
What we can do is we can
multiply this second equation

74
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,230
by negative 1 and then
add the 2's.

75
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,720
Then these guys will
cancel out.

76
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,300
So let's do that.

77
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,380
Actually let's do it
even a better way.

78
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,780
Let's multiply the top equation
by negative 1 and

79
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,840
then add them.

80
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,020
So let's multiply the top
equation by negative 1.

81
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,250
This becomes a negative times
the speed of the jogger.

82
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,270
This becomes a negative 2 times
the speed of the walker.

83
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:43,260
Negative 1 times negative 1
times negative 1 is plus 1.

84
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,040
And now if we add these
two equations.

85
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,690
These two guys are going
to cancel out.

86
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,990
And what do we get?

87
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,650
We get 2 times the speed of the
jogger minus the speed of

88
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,120
the jogger.

89
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,160
Well that's just going
to be the speed

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,850
of the jogger, right?

91
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,420
2 of something minus
1 of something is

92
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,430
just 1 of that thing.

93
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,760
These two guys cancel out.

94
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,740
That was the whole point behind
multiplying the top

95
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,280
equation by negative 1.

96
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,840
Then you have 1 plus 3, so the
speed of the jogger is 4.

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,580
And we're done.

98
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,090
That's all they want
us to find.

99
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,360
Find the rate of the jogger.

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,860
And we just figured it out.

101
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,260
If we also wanted to figure out
the rate of the walker, we

102
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,360
could substitute back into this
top equation right here,

103
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,580
or the original version of it,
which was the speed of the

104
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,350
jogger is equal to 2 times the
speed of the walker minus 1.

105
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,880
We know the speed of the jogger
is 4, so you get 4 is

106
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,340
equal to 2 times the speed
of the walker minus 1.

107
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,480
Add 1 to both sides, you get 5
is equal to 2 times the speed

108
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,530
of the walker.

109
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,590
Divide both sides by 2, and
you get the speed of the

110
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:51,080
walker is 2-1/2 miles
per hour.

111
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,120
But we didn't even
have to do that.

112
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,420
This was the answer that the
problem was looking for.

113
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,670
