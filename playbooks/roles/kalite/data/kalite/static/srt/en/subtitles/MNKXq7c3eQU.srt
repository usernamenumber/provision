1
00:00:02,914 --> 00:00:05,816
Let's talk about exactly how flu causes so much damage

2
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:07,858
to ourselves and why it makes us feel

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,377
so lousy whenever we get the flu.

4
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:13,455
And I start up with drawing the flu virus here.

5
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:17,222
This is our influenza virus,INFLUENZA VIRUS.

6
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:21,880
And we have on influenza a couple of features

7
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:23,789
that we have to remember.

8
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:25,689
So you know, on the out side there is a sort of envelope.

9
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:27,593
And what's on the inside of this envelope

10
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:32,321
are 8 bits of RNA, 8 pieces of RNA.

11
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:37,045
And so this RNA is important to remember

12
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:40,809
because in the human cell in our cells, I'm going to draw one of our cells right here,

13
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,242
we have instead of RNA we have DNA, remember.

14
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:48,012
And so this is our nucleus.

15
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:50,745
And on the inside of the nucleus is our DNA.

16
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:52,814
So this is our DNA over here.

17
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:55,322
So the virus has RNA and we have DNA.

18
00:00:55,322 --> 00:01:01,605
In the outside of the human cell, I should have been labelling this over here, this is HUMAN CELL.

19
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:05,158
The outside of the human cell has something called

20
00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:06,140
SIALIC ACID

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,927
There are these little strings over here. They are coming of

22
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:12,621
and I'm drawing them far larger than they are in real life.

23
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:14,060
They're not nearly this big.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,171
But there are these little, tiny little things called sialic acid.

25
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:23,578
And this sialic acid becomes very important in understanding how the influenza virus

26
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:24,510
gets into and out of our cells

27
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:30,908
So the outside, remember, of the influenza virus there were couple of proteins

28
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:34,126
And I'm gonna draw one of these proteins here.

29
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:36,006
I'm gonna make it look like a hand.

30
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:41,839
So this is a little hand and this protein is called HEMAGGLUTININ

31
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:46,041
In fact previously I called the H protein and you can call that if you want.

32
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,378
But the full name is hemagglutenin.

33
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:56,444
And what hemagglutenin does is that it actually holds onto sialic acid.

34
00:01:56,444 --> 00:02:00,490
In fact that's an easy way to remember, right, because H and H go together

35
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,806
It holds sialic acid.

36
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:08,238
That becomes very important because that allows it the first step towards getting into the cell

37
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,125
That is another protein on the outside here.

38
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:13,567
I'm gonna make it look like a pair of scissors.

39
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:16,251
Because it will kind of remind us what this one does.

40
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:22,381
And this is called neurominidase.This one is called neurominidase.

41
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:30,326
And I'm gonna pass on explaining what it does just for the moment.

42
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,831
I'll tell you a little bit what it does.

43
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:36,903
So then the first step to get into the cell is for hemagglutinin to hold on sialic acid.

44
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:41,725
And than there are few other small molecular steps that happen,

45
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:44,961
important ones but I'm gonna suffice to say gets inside.

46
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:48,212
And once the influenza virus gets inside,

47
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:51,481
these are RNA segments they're let loose.

48
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:56,924
So these segments are gonna start making their way towards the nucleus.

49
00:02:56,924 --> 00:03:01,736
So once they get into the nucleus they are in the same kind of area that DNA is.

50
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,612
And what they do is remarkable.

51
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:06,611
They basically take over.

52
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:11,246
These little RNA start making many copies of themselves.

53
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:16,578
And what they want to do is make our human cell into a factory.

54
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:21,792
They want to make a factory and this factory is gonna make little proteins, viroproteins.

55
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:25,234
And it's gonna make viral RNA.

56
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:31,343
And what it's not gonna do the one thing that cell is no longer gonna to be very good at doing

57
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:33,077
is its normal job.

58
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:35,875
So the human cell of course had some job to do

59
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:40,011
and it's not gonna have the resources or the time to do it

60
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:44,959
because it's basically been taken over by this viral RNA.

61
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,463
So what happens then is that the viral RNA is basically turned into a factory and

62
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,959
what it wants to do is make more and more copies of it selves.

63
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,756
Let me just show you what that would look like.

64
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:57,689
Here is a daughter cell, lets say it goes over here.

65
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:02,409
And I'm gonna clean this up a little bit, just to make sure that we're looking at a nice and neat picture.

66
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,178
Let's say something like this.

67
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,872
So this is our daughter cell on the other side.

68
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,689
And these cells are gonna try to make their way out of the human cell, right?

69
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:14,546
Because now they're a package, they are ready to go.

70
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,513
And where these suppose they wanna go next?

71
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:18,599
Where they gonna wanna find their own human cell to invade.

72
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:20,793
Because they wanna to continue this process.

73
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,586
We've got more human cells over here down below.

74
00:04:24,586 --> 00:04:27,595
We've got maybe let's say one human cell up here.

75
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:30,909
So we've got new targets for this virus.

76
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:35,662
And this virus is going to seek out these targets and try to make its way inside

77
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:39,456
again using its hemagglutinin.

78
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,378
But before it can do that it's gotta break loose, right?

79
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:45,136
Because it's still attached to that sialic acid.

80
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:47,577
It's here where neurominidase comes in.

81
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:50,746
And neurominidase it basically, it nicks.

82
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:54,578
And there is with the N is helpful for remembering it.

83
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,327
It nicks or cuts sialic acid.

84
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,287
It's if a nicker cut that sialic acid it can break free.

85
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:09,107
As I remember the two proteins as hemagglutinin holds sialic acid to enter the cell

86
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:15,591
that is on entry and the neuraminidase is gonna nick the sialic acid

87
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:18,963
and that important for exiting the cell.

88
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:23,459
But we still haven't answered the question : how does all this cause our symptoms?

89
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:28,208
or what happens is as these cells get turned into factories

90
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,934
they start dying or getting damaged.

91
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:35,358
And all their content start leaking out.

92
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:38,777
So all these contents from the cell start leaking out and as they do they create inflammation.

93
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:41,040
Let me bring a little bit up the canvas.

94
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:45,874
If you have an inflammation, let's say that inflammation is happening in your nose

95
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:49,209
well you might say : well I have a runny nose or a stuffy nose.

96
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:56,316
Or if that inflammation is happening in your throat you might say: well I have a sore throat, might hurt.

97
00:05:56,316 --> 00:06:00,071
And if it's happening in your lungs you might have a cough.

98
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:05,830
So one of those respiratory symptoms, remember that we've got two categories,

99
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,713
All other respiratory symptoms, I'm gonna shorten it as RESP.

100
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:14,262
Those are gonna be explained by inflammation or at least a part of inflammation.

101
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:18,984
And remember there are also constitutional symptoms, right?

102
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:25,300
With constitutional symptoms, those were things like having a fever or having fatigue.

103
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,843
And the reason for that is that your immune system is going wild and crazy

104
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:33,040
when you have influenza.

105
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,114
It's gonna be attracted to all of those chemicals, we call these cytokines that were being released .

106
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:43,376
And it's gonna to be attracted to the fact that you've got actual virus particles in the area,

107
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,571
you know that is being infected.

108
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,190
So that strong immune system is going to create some of your symptoms.

109
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,644
It's actually gonna rave up your temperature.

110
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:55,079
You'll start having a fever, chills.

111
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,314
And because your energy is spent on this attack

112
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:01,344
you're going to be fatigued.

113
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:04,556
you're going to be fighting off the virus so you going to be fatigued,

114
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:05,753
you might have the body aches.

115
00:07:05,753 --> 00:07:13,100
So lot of these kinds of symptoms you get as result of a strong immune response.
