1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870
   

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,630
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,860
And I've made this balance
sheet so messy I think it

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,950
would make sense to redraw it
cleaned up a little bit.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,540
So what's our new balance sheet,
after we've unloaded a

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,790
lot of those assets?

7
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:18,610
   

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,920
All I have now, I have a little
bit of cash, let me

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,490
write that down, I had
$1 billion of cash.

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,090
   

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,520
I'll write the 'b' there
so you know.

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,300
   

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,259
And just so you know, a bank
needs cash to operate.

14
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,610
It can't just use all of its
cash to pay off things.

15
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,320
Because then it won't be able
to even transact with its

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,500
customers, or pay its rent, or
send its executives on their

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,070
Learjets, whatever
it needs to do.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,490
But anyway, you have
$1 billion of cash.

19
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,420
So you might have been thinking,
why not just use its

20
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,730
cash to unload some
of that debt?

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,770
Well, you always have to keep
some cash on line just to

22
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,480
conduct business.

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,190
And actually, that's called
working capital.

24
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,860
But anyway, back to the
point of this video.

25
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,650
So you have $1 billion
in cash.

26
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,240
And at least the management of
this company thinks that it

27
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,349
has $4 billion worth of
residential CDOs.

28
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,710
And this is the toxic stuff
that's the focus of this

29
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,370
government bailout, which is
really historic in its

30
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:10,880
proportions.

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,630
And I'll talk more
about that later.

32
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:22,080
And on the liabilities
side, what was left?

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,500
I think I had called
it Loan C.

34
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,085
I'll write liabilities in red,
just because they're bad.

35
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,720
They're not bad, but they're
something you owe, so they're

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
not as pleasant.

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,950
So Loan C, we said
was $3 billion.

38
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,280
   

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,490
And then what is the equity?

40
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,740
I'll do that in yellow.

41
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,500
   

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,825
So the total assets were
$5 billion in assets.

43
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:50,190
   

44
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,870
Total assets.

45
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,800
You have $3 billion
in liabilities.

46
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,860
So if you believe what the
accountants or the bank

47
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,610
management has said about their
assets, if you wanted to

48
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,900
just liquidate everything.

49
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,440
If you had $5 billion in assets,
you liquidate them,

50
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,880
got $5 billion, you paid off
your $3 billion in loans,

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,330
you'd be left with $2 billion.

52
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,580
So that's the equity.

53
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,280
   

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,830
And just as a reminder, how
many shares where there?

55
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,760
I think I originally set in
the original video that we

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,840
have 500 million shares.

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,670
So each of those shares is one
500 millionth of this equity.

58
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:37,500
So let's see, the book value
per share is what?

59
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,770
It's going to be the book value,
$2 billion, divided by

60
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,740
500 million.

61
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,990
So it's $4.

62
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,030
   

63
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,870
Remember, it was $6
not too long ago.

64
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,065
But we had to take those
commercial mortgages that we

65
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:52,560
thought were worth $10 billion,
actually ended up

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,050
being worth $9 billion.

67
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,190
So we lost $1 billion
of our book value.

68
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,640
And $1 billion translates to
$2 of the share price.

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,320
Anyway, fair enough.

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:11,480
And maybe at this point the
market value of the share, so

71
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,300
that's essentially the stock
price if you were to look up

72
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,600
this company's ticker price,
let's say it's at $1.

73
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,930
Because they're like, boy, after
all this Bear Stearns

74
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,920
and Lehman Brothers, this
is all getting a

75
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,390
little nerve racking.

76
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,970
And they have this shady
thing over here.

77
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,170
So we have to be careful.

78
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,840
So if the market value
is $1, what are they

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,170
saying about the assets?

80
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,650
Or what are they saying
about the equity?

81
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,270
Well, what's the market cap?

82
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,990
It's the share price times
the number of shares.

83
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,870
So they're saying essentially
that the market cap, and

84
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,560
that's equivalent to the market
value of the equity, or

85
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,390
what the market thinks the
equity is worth, that's $1

86
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,760
times 500 million shares.

87
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,530
So it's worth $500 million.

88
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,980
Or $0.5 billion.

89
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,240
So the market is actually
saying, no, you don't have $2

90
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,840
billion of equity, you only have
half a billion of equity.

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,290
And it's probably because they
think this is worth a billion

92
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,140
and a half left.

93
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,600
But anyway, we'll leave
that aside for now.

94
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,940
But now we're getting to
the crux of the issue.

95
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,980
Two of those other loans, they
came due, no-one was willing

96
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,840
to renew the loans, or
give them new loans.

97
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,279
So the company had to liquidate
some of their assets

98
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,050
in order to pay those
loans down.

99
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,040
Now, this is the endgame.

100
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,220
We have Loan C.

101
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,640
And let's say Loan
C comes due.

102
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,890
So they say, things are really
shady, your assets they look

103
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,030
very similar to Lehman Brothers
and Bear Stearns,

104
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,480
we're not going to
renew your loan.

105
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,510
You go out to the credit
markets, you try to issue

106
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,980
bonds, you try to do
anything you can.

107
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,290
No-one's willing to give you a
loan, just because they're all

108
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,230
a little bit scared.

109
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,340
So what do you do?

110
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,170
Well, you have to pay
$3 billion of loans.

111
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,130
You just have to.

112
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,480
Because no-one's willing
to give you $3 billion.

113
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,180
Well you say, out of this cash
I can't use all of it.

114
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,560
If I just wanted to operate
bare-bones, maybe I could give

115
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,030
$0.5 billion in cash.

116
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,460
But that's not going to help
my situation at all.

117
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,190
Because I still would have
$2.5 billion left.

118
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,950
So you're like, wow I'm in a
situation where I have to sell

119
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,680
these CDOs.

120
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,070
So now, all my models and all
my assumptions are going to

121
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,880
see if they were even
vaguely accurate.

122
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,760
If these things are really
worth $4 billion.

123
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,220
So I go out there and I
try to sell my CDOs.

124
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,190
I try to sell them for whatever
I can get for them,

125
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,390
because I have to sell them.

126
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,610
And one, there's no
market for them.

127
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,540
Because there's a lot of people
who want to unload

128
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,020
them, but there's not
really anybody who's

129
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,770
keen on buying it.

130
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,510
So there there might not
even be any market.

131
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,840
But you're like, no I
want to sell them.

132
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,400
So you broadcast it out to every
hedge fund and private

133
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,090
equity fund and every
bank out there.

134
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,270
And you say, who wants
to buy my CDOs?

135
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,760
And some private equity firm
comes and says, OK well, I

136
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,570
think that those things are
pretty toxic, but they're

137
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,710
probably worth maybe
something.

138
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm pretty optimistic about
the real estate market.

139
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,560
And maybe in 10 years they
might come back.

140
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,930
So I'm willing to give you $1
billion for those CDOs.

141
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,220
So essentially, what's the
market price of something?

142
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,260
It's the best price that
someone's willing to give you

143
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,650
for something.

144
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,560
So the market price of this,
because you've shopped it

145
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,400
around, you've gone to the
market, you've gone to

146
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,450
everyone you can, the market
price for this is,

147
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,130
essentially, the market
is offering you $1

148
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,760
billion for this CDO.

149
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,000
So what do you do?

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,060
Well, if you sell it for
$1 billion, does

151
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,380
that help your situation?

152
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,020
If you sell this for $1 billion,
you get $1 billion

153
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,680
here, you have $1 billion of
cash, you have a total of $2

154
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,920
billion, that still won't
pay your loan.

155
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,420
You're still going
to be bankrupt.

156
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,780
And even more, the company
management is very stubborn.

157
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,000
They say, if I sell it I'm
going to go bankrupt.

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,890
And I think that that's some
kind of fire sale price,

159
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,420
quote-unquote.

160
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,040
That's not the real price.

161
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,230
All of a sudden for the first
time in my career when I was

162
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,700
getting $30 million a year
bonuses, I heavily believed in

163
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,380
the market.

164
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,240
But now I'm in denial
of the market.

165
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,720
I say, the only reason why I'm
only getting $1 billion for

166
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,770
this is because everyone
is afraid.

167
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,580
And these things, if someone
were to just hold them to

168
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,380
maturity, if someone were to
just hold these assets for the

169
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,520
30 years over which the
underlying mortgages will just

170
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,390
pay out, someone's going to
collect roughly $4 billion.

171
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,800
Or maybe at worst,
$3.5 billion.

172
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,270
So I'm not going to do this.

173
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,190
But really, you have
no choice.

174
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,830
So what you try to do is you
say, well can someone give me

175
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,520
some type of a loan?

176
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,590
Just lend me some money in the
short term just so that I

177
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,970
could get this paid off.

178
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,030
And I'll be willing to give
this as collateral.

179
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,500
Collateral on a loan is you give
me a loan, and you take

180
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,900
this as collateral, and if I
don't pay the loan, you just

181
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,110
keep the asset.

182
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,130
And that's essentially what
the Fed was doing.

183
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,310
The Fed traditionally only
gives loans if you give

184
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,940
something really nice as a
collateral, like treasuries,

185
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,320
essentially just treasuries.

186
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
And they'll still take a
little discount of your

187
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,700
collateral.

188
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,960
Like if you give the Federal
Reserve $1 of treasuries, they

189
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,550
might give you $0.80 of loans.

190
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,750
But over this whole credit
crunch, the Fed has gotten

191
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,200
looser and looser in terms of
what it's willing to accept as

192
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,090
collateral.

193
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,680
So actually, the Fed, I don't
know the details of how toxic

194
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,640
of an asset they were willing
to take as collateral, but

195
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,210
they started loosening it up
to pretty toxic assets.

196
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,600
So maybe you could get a loan.

197
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,750
But let's just put that
aside right now.

198
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,660
But this is the situation
we're facing.

199
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,690
You have a bank, and it's
essentially being forced, or

200
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,049
it perceives it, forced
into bankruptcy.

201
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:40,260
Even though, it thinks that
it has positive equity.

202
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,059
So you could get a loan from
the Fed or someone else if

203
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,540
they're willing to take this
kind of toxic stuff as

204
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:45,970
collateral.

205
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,870
Let's assume that they're
not for now.

206
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,920
The other option is you
can recapitalize.

207
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,950
You can get someone to
invest in the firm.

208
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,460
You can sell equity in the firm
and get some more cash to

209
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,340
pay off this loan.

210
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,600
If you can convince someone that
no, your firm is really

211
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,630
in the future going to
be worth a lot more.

212
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,500
This is just a stressful
situation.

213
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,870
So you go to some sovereign
wealth fund, and that's just a

214
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,640
way of saying some foreign
government that's been

215
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,090
collecting dollars because
they've been selling us oil or

216
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,170
cheap manufactured goods.

217
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:20,110
So you go those and say, look,
we are Goldman Brothers or

218
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,120
we're Lehman Sachs.

219
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,020
We are this great brand in the
banking industry, wouldn't you

220
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,270
like to have a piece of this
thing that represents American

221
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,300
capitalism?

222
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,350
And they say sure, we'll be
interested in investing.

223
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,830
So they say, well the market
price is $1 and I think that's

224
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,950
probably a little distressed,
so we'll be willing to pay

225
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,520
$1.50 per share.

226
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,740
And we'll buy, how
much do you need?

227
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,540
We'll buy 2 billion shares
at $1.50 per share.

228
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,260
So what happens?

229
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,480
So let's say the sovereign
wealth fund, they're going to

230
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:09,020
buy 2 billion shares
at $1.50 per share.

231
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,340
So now what does the balance
sheet look like?

232
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:19,150
So 2 billion, $1.50 per share,
that is equal to $3 billion.

233
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,090
So now you get $3 billion
more in cash, so

234
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,700
this becomes $4 billion.

235
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,270
But you can't get something for
free, so what happened?

236
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,590
Are our liabilities
increasing?

237
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,200
Well no, our liabilities
didn't increase.

238
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,890
They didn't give us a loan.

239
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,755
They invested in us.

240
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:37,870
They essentially bought
shares of the company.

241
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,950
They bought 2 billion shares.

242
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,890
So how does that get
accounted for?

243
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,630
Well instead of our share
account being 500 million

244
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,680
shares, this is how many shares
we had before, the

245
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,240
company essentially created
2 billion new shares.

246
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,375
So now the company has
2.5 billion shares.

247
00:10:55,375 --> 00:11:00,240
   

248
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
And it's something
interesting here.

249
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,130
What is the new book value
of the shares?

250
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,940
So what are our total assets?
$4 billion plus $4 billion,

251
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,970
it's $8 billion of assets.

252
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,150
Our liabilities are
still $3 billion.

253
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,620
Now the the value of our share
after the investment, and you

254
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,370
can kind of call this the post
money valuation or book value,

255
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,960
is $5 billion.

256
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,510
$8 billion minus $3 billion.

257
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,360
And now what's the book
value of our shares?

258
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,920
$5 billion divided by $2.5
billion, it's $2 per share.

259
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,040
   

260
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,290
And that's interesting.

261
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,860
   

262
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,220
It's someplace in between our
old book value and the price

263
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,920
that the company paid, or the
sovereign wealth fund paid,

264
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,310
$1.50 per share.

265
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,380
But anyway, I just realized I'm
out of time again, I'll

266
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,650
continue this in
the next video.
