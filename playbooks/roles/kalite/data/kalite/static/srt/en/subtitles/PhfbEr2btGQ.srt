1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:06,870
For any transformation that maps
from Rn to Rn, we've done

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,590
it implicitly, but it's been
interesting for us to find the

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,460
vectors that essentially just
get scaled up by the

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,880
transformations.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,230
So the vectors that have the
form-- the transformation of

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,950
my vector, is just equal
to some scaled-up

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,035
version of a vector.

8
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:24,290
And if this doesn't look
familiar, I can jog your memory

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,750
a little bit.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,690
When we were looking for
basis vectors for the

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,986
transformation--
let me draw it.

12
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:31,190
This was from R2 to R2,

13
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:33,970
from R2 to R2.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,529
So let me draw R2 right here.

15
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:44,305
Now let's say I had the vector...let's add the vector...let's say v1 was equal to

16
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:45,732
the vector 1, 2.

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,728
And we had the lines spanned
by that vector.

18
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:52,000
We did this problem several
videos ago.

19
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:55,350
And I had the transformation
that flipped across this line.

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,230
So if we call that line l, T was
the transformation from R2

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,933
to R2 that flipped vectors
across this line.

22
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:12,933
So it flipped, flipped vectors, flipped vectors,
across l.

23
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:15,740
So if you remember that
transformation, if I had some

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,050
random vector that looked like
that, let's say that's x,

25
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,548
that's vector x, then the
transformation of x looks

26
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,410
something like this.

27
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,640
Which is flipped across
that line.

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,770
That was the transformation
of x.

29
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,990
And, if you remember that video,
we were looking for a

30
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,670
change of basis that would allow
us to at least figure

31
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,640
out the, the matrix for the
transformation, at least an

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,500
alternate basis.

33
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,900
And then we could figure
out the matrix for the

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,950
transformation in the
standard basis.

35
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,698
And the basis we picked were
basis vectors that didn't get

36
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:44,950
changed much by the
transformation, or ones that

37
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,817
only got scaled by the
transformation.

38
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:52,750
For example, when I took the
transformation of v1, when I took the transformation of v1, it just

39
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,320
equaled to v1.

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,380
Or we could say, that the
transformation of v1, just

41
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,800
equaled 1 times v1.

42
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,780
So if you just follow this, this
little format that I set up

43
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,860
here, lambda, in this
case, would be 1.

44
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,360
And of course, the vector
in this case is v1.

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,057
The transformation just
scaled up v1 by 1.

46
00:02:15,057 --> 00:02:18,860
Now if you also or if you,
that same problem, 
we had the other vector that

47
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,065
we also looked at.

48
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:27,670
OK, it was the vector...
it was the vector...minus
let's say it's the vector v2,

49
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:32,210
which is-- let's say
it's 2 minus 1.

50
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,420
And then if you take the
transformation of it, since it

51
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,250
was orthogonal to the
line, it just got

52
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,840
flipped over like that.

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
And that was a pretty
interesting vector force as

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,960
well, because the transformation
of v2 in this

55
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,050
situation is equal to what?

56
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,930
Just minus v2.

57
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,270
It's equal to minus v2.

58
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,920
Or, you could say, that the
transformation of v2 is equal

59
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,230
to minus 1 times v2.

60
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,870
And these were interesting
vectors for us because when we

61
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,390
defined a new basis with these
guys as the basis vector, it

62
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,065
was very easy to figure out
our transformation matrix.

63
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:12,000
And actually, that basis was
very easy to compute with.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,390
And we'll explore that a little
bit more in the future.

65
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,620
But hopefully you realize that
these are interesting vectors.

66
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,750
There was also the cases where
we had the planes spanned by

67
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,630
some vectors.

68
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,820
And then we had another vector
that was popping out of the

69
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,040
plane like that.

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,320
And we were transforming things
by taking the mirror

71
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,200
image across this and we're
like, well in that

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,360
transformation, these red
vectors don't change at all

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
and this guy gets
flipped over.

74
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,290
So maybe those would make
for good bases.

75
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,250
Or those would make for
good basis vectors.

76
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,240
And they did.

77
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,850
So in general, we're always
interested with the vectors

78
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,240
that just get scaled up
by a transformation.

79
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,080
It's not going to be
all vectors, right?

80
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,320
This vector that I drew here,
this vector x, it doesn't just

81
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,650
get scaled up, it actually gets
changed, this direction

82
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,730
gets changed.

83
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,360
The vectors that get scaled up
might switch direct-- might go

84
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,020
from this direction to that
direction, or maybe

85
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,430
they go from that.

86
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,270
Maybe that's x and then the
transformation of x might be a

87
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,460
scaled up version of x.

88
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,710
Maybe it's that.

89
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,970
The actual, I guess, line that
they span will not change.

90
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,350
And so that's what we're going
to concern ourselves with.

91
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,019
These have a special name.

92
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,660
And they have a special name and
I want to make this very

93
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,050
clear because they're useful.

94
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,360
It's not just some mathematical
game we're

95
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,970
playing, although sometimes
we do fall into that trap.

96
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,250
But they're actually useful.

97
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,140
They're useful for defining
bases because in those bases

98
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,730
it's easier to find
transformation matrices.

99
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,950
They're more natural coordinate
systems. And

100
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,700
oftentimes, the transformation
matrices in those bases are

101
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,620
easier to compute with.

102
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,060
And so these have
special names.

103
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,040
Any vector that satisfies this
right here is called an

104
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,810
eigenvector for the
transformation T.

105
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,680
And the lambda, the multiple
that it becomes-- this is the

106
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:12,410
eigenvalue associated with
that eigenvector.

107
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,590
So in the example I just gave
where the transformation is

108
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,020
flipping around this line,
v1, the vector 1, 2 is an

109
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,210
eigenvector of our
transformation.

110
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,080
So 1, 2 is an eigenvector.

111
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,305
And it's corresponding
eigenvalue is 1.

112
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,820
This guy is also an
eigenvector-- the

113
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,270
vector 2, minus 1.

114
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,520
He's also an eigenvector.

115
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,440
A very fancy word, but all it
means is a vector that's just

116
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,920
scaled up by a transformation.

117
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,030
It doesn't get changed in any
more meaningful way than just

118
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,270
the scaling factor.

119
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:03,860
And it's corresponding
eigenvalue is minus 1.

120
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,580
If this transformation--
I don't know what its

121
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,750
transformation matrix is.

122
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,990
I forgot what it was.

123
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,820
We actually figured it
out a while ago.

124
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:16,490
If this transformation matrix
can be represented as a matrix

125
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,180
vector product-- and it should
be; it's a linear

126
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,940
transformation-- then any
v that satisfies the

127
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,610
transformation of-- I'll say
transformation of v is equal

128
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,520
to lambda v, which also would
be-- you know, the

129
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,180
transformation of [? v ?]

130
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,380
would just be A times v.

131
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,390
These are also called
eigenvectors of A, because A

132
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,570
is just really the matrix
representation of the

133
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,090
transformation.

134
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:51,560
So in this case, this would be
an eigenvector of A, and this

135
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,690
would be the eigenvalue
associated with the

136
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,940
eigenvector.

137
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,940
So if you give me a matrix that
represents some linear

138
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,880
transformation.

139
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,880
You can also figure
these things out.

140
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,730
Now the next video we're
actually going to figure out a

141
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,080
way to figure these
things out.

142
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,320
But what I want you to
appreciate in this video is

143
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,920
that it's easy to say,
oh, the vectors that

144
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,130
don't get changed much.

145
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,620
But I want you to understand
what that means.

146
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,860
It literally just gets scaled up
or maybe they get reversed.

147
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,060
Their direction or the
lines they span

148
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,460
fundamentally don't change.

149
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,400
And the reason why they're
interesting for us is, well,

150
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,790
one of the reasons why they're
interesting for us is that

151
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,590
they make for interesting basis
vectors-- basis vectors

152
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,530
whose transformation matrices
are maybe computationally more

153
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,610
simpler, or ones that make for
better coordinate systems.
