1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,650
Before moving on, I want to address problem 180 again.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,320
Because we got it right in the last video,

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,450
but then as soon as I finished the video,

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,890
I realized there was a much, much simpler way of doing that.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,660
They said in a nationwide poll, n people were interviewed.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,400
1/4 of them answered yes to question one.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,420
And of those, 1/3 answered yes to question two.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,300
So then you have another 1/3.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,830
So what fraction of the entire population said yes to both?

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,100
Well, it would be 1/4 of--

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:34,040
or 1/3 of 1/4 which is equal to 1/12.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,640
1/12 of the population said yes to both.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,330
Or you could say 1/12 of n said yes to both.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,530
And they ask us which of the following expressions

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,780
represents the number of people interviewed

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,670
who did not answer yes to both?

17
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,000
So it's everybody else.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,770
These are the people who said yes to both.

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,930
So essentially you just subtract that from 1.

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,170
So 1 minus 1/12 is equal to 12/12 minus 1/12,

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,510
which is equal to 11/12 of the population

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,000
did not say yes to both.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,630
And so 11/12 and then the population is n,

24
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,960
so it's 11n over 12.

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,020
And that's how we got choice E.

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,790
Problem 181.

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,330
The ratio of two quantities is 3:4.

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,440
So, let's say one is x, one is y, and it equals 3:4.

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,490
If each of the quantities is increased by 5,

30
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,130
what is the ratio of these new quantities?

31
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,060
x plus 5 to y plus 5.

32
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,550
Well, it really depends on what multiple these

33
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,210
are of 3 and 4.

34
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,940
Well, I already have a sense that it's choice E.

35
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,020
It cannot be determined from the information given.

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,450
And let's prove it.

37
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,760
I'm going to show you two different x's and y's,

38
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,040
and when you add 5 to both

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,540
you're going to get a completely different answer.

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,940
So you cannot determine it from the information.

41
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,800
So they snuck in a data sufficiency question into the

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,720
problem solving.

43
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,310
So, x could be 3.

44
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,920
If x is equal to 3 and y is equal to 4,

45
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,640
that definitely satisfies this condition.

46
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,460
Or we could have x is equal to 6 and y is equal to 8. Right?

47
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,020
That also satisfies the 3 to 4 ratio.

48
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,580
What happens when we add 5 to both of these?

49
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,010
x plus 5 would be equal to 8.

50
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,720
And y plus 5 would be equal to 9.

51
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,020
So, the new ratio becomes 8:9.

52
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,540
What about this case?

53
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,040
You would have x plus 5 is equal to 6 plus 5, which is 11.

54
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,890
And then y plus 5 is equal to 8 plus 5, which is 13.

55
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,000
And 8/9 is a very different fraction than 11/13.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,010
It's not like you can reduce one into the other.

57
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,120
So I can find an x and a y to satisfy this,

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,610
but when I add 5 to the top and bottom

59
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,650
I get two different answers.

60
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,040
So you cannot determine this with the information given.

61
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,980
So the choice is E.

62
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,050
Sneaky data sufficiency problem.

63
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,010
182.

64
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,830
If the average arithmetic mean of x and y is 60--

65
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,030
so essentially you're saying x plus y over 2 is equal to 60.

66
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,000
The average of them is 60.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
And the average of y and z is 80.

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,010
So, y plus z over 2 is equal to 80.

69
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,000
What is the value of z minus x?

70
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,420
So let's see if we can do that.

71
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,970
So let's rewrite this.

72
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,010
Let's solve for x in terms of y.

73
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,020
I'll do it in a different color.

74
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,150
We get x plus y is equal to 120.

75
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,890
Just multiplied both sides by 2.

76
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,050
You get x is equal to 120 minus y.

77
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,760
Now let's solve for z in terms of y here.

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,060
Multiply both sides by 2, you get y plus z is equal to 160.

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,070
z is equal to 160 minus y.

80
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,540
So what's z minus x?

81
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:19,090
So z is 160 minus y, minus x, 120 minus y.

82
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:27,010
So that is equal to 160 minus y, minus 120 plus y.

83
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,310
And it's good that the y's are canceling out.

84
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,680
Whenever they give you something like this,

85
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,290
it's usually a safe guess that if you just go forth

86
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,960
with the algebra that nice things will happen like this.

87
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,760
So these y's cancel out and we're left with 160 minus 120

88
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,000
which is 40.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,280
And that is choice B.

90
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,830
Problem 183.

91
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,180
If 1/2 of the air in a tank is removed

92
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,520
with each stroke of a vacuum pump--

93
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:10,530
so we have 1/2 tank per stroke.

94
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,610
I'm guessing this is going to be a rate of change.

95
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,000
What fraction of the original amount of air has been removed

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,190
after four strokes?

97
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,200
Oh no. This is interesting.

98
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,390
OK. So, after one stroke,

99
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,530
what fraction of the original amount of air has been removed?

100
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,340
Let's just figure out how much has been left.

101
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,200
We could do both actually.

102
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,320
Left and then removed.

103
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,920
So, after one stroke--

104
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,410
1/2 of the air in the tank is removed with each stroke.

105
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,250
So after one stroke,

106
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,050
you have 1/2 left and you have 1/2 removed.

107
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,730
But, after two strokes, it takes out half of the air. Right.

108
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,080
So it takes out 1/2 of this half.

109
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,420
So if you take out 1/2 of this half you have 1/4 left over.

110
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,470
And you've also removed another 1/4. Right?

111
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,020
Because these add up to what was left before.

112
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,720
After three strokes,

113
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,830
you take out 1/2 of this. So you have 1/8 left over.

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,010
And you took out another 1/8.

115
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,220
And then after four strokes,

116
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,560
you have 1/16 of the air left over.

117
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,570
Actually I didn't even have to do this column.

118
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,070
After four strokes you have 1/16 of the original air.

119
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,850
But they want to know

120
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,220
what fraction of the original amount of air has been removed.

121
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,000
So this is what you have left.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,320
So what's been removed is 1 minus this.

123
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,880
So, 1 minus 1/16.

124
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, that's 16 over 16 minus 1 over 16.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,340
Which is equal to 15 over 16.

126
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,260
Choice A.

127
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,000
I didn't even have to worry about that column.

128
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,530
Problem 184.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,260
If the 2 digit integers M and N are positive

130
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,900
and have the same digits, but in reverse order,

131
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,000
which of the following cannot be the sum of M and N?

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,880
All right, same digits in reverse order.

133
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,040
So M could be AB.

134
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,030
And N could be BA.

135
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,660
So which cannot be the sum?

136
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,980
I'm just experimenting.

137
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,540
Let's see you if you add AB and BA.

138
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:27,740
So, if B plus A-- I guess there's two assumptions.

139
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,000
If B plus A is less 10, let's do this one.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,390
B plus A is less than 10.

141
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,080
Then you would have-- this digit would be B plus A.

142
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,040
And then this digit over here would also be B plus A.

143
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,370
So, definitely choices D and E work.

144
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,560
So we're left with choices A, B, and C.

145
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,980
Because none of these fit this paradigm

146
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,370
where we have the same digit twice.

147
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,000
So, all of those assume that B plus A is greater than 10.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,030
So, if B plus A is greater than 10, then what happens?

149
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,000
A plus B.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,090
B plus A.

151
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,400
So let's think about it a little bit.

152
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:24,020
If B plus A, you'll have the ones digit from B plus A.

153
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,030
And then you'll have a 1 up here.

154
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,470
You add 1 plus A plus B.

155
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:34,020
So, you'd have B plus A plus 1.

156
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,510
And so this will be a two-digit number.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,530
And if you think about it--

158
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,690
if we do the three digits of the number,

159
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,050
this is going to be the ones digit from B plus A right?

160
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,680
This is going to be the ones digit from B plus A plus 1.

161
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,990
So this number is going to be one more than this number.

162
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,960
That's an interesting problem.

163
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,800
This one has to be one more than that one.

164
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,520
And so both B and C satisfy that, right.

165
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,040
165.

166
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,430
6 is one more than 5.

167
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,360
And it should work out.

168
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,480
We should be able to figure out a B and an A

169
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,000
that satisfy that.

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,190
And then C also satisfies that.

171
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,920
121.

172
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,440
2 is one more than 1.

173
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,540
I want to make sure you understand that

174
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,090
because it's actually pretty interesting.

175
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,550
Deductive reasoning, A is the answer.

176
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,240
But if you think about it,

177
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,000
we're assuming B plus A is greater than 0.

178
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,790
So, here, you'd have the ones digit of B plus A

179
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,010
and you'd carry a 1.

180
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,080
Now when you add A plus B and that 1,

181
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,020
the ones digit is going to be 1 greater.

182
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,530
This is going to be the ones digit of B plus A plus 1.

183
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,000
And that's why I'm saying that the tens digit

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,420
has to be 1 greater than the ones.

185
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,840
That was an interesting problem.

186
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,020
Anyway, see you in the next video.
