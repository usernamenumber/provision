1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:08,433
Let's multiply 7 times 253 and see what we get.

2
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:11,101
So just like in the last example what I'd like to do is

3
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:18,233
I'd like to rewrite the largest number first (so that's 253) and then write the smaller number below it

4
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:21,367
and align the place value, the 7, it only has an ones place.

5
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:27,367
I'll put the 7 right over here below the ones place in 253 and put the multiplication symbol right over here.

6
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:32,633
So you could read this as 253 times 7 which we know is the same as 7 times 253.

7
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:39,767
And now we are ready to compute. And there are many ways of doing this but this is what you could call the standard way.

8
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:46,674
So what I do is I start with my 7 and I multiply times each of the numbers up here and I carry appropriately.

9
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:53,900
So first I start with 7 times 3. Well 7 times 3 we know is 21.

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,633
(Let me write that down.)
7 times 3 is equal to 21.

11
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:01,167
You could do this part in your head but I just want to make it clear where I'm getting these numbers from.

12
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:05,833
What I would do in the standard method is I would write the 1 in the 21 down here

13
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,767
but then carry the 2 to the tens place.

14
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:13,167
Now I want to figure out what 7 times 5 is.

15
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:20,767
We know from our multiplication tables that 7 times 5 is equal to 35.

16
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:26,433
Now, we can't just somehow put the 35 down here, we still have to deal with this 2 that we carried.

17
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:30,700
So we compute 7 times 5 as 35 but then we also add that 2.

18
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,767
So it's 35, plus 2 is 37.

19
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:41,334
Now, we write the 7 right over here in the tens place and carry the 3.

20
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:47,700
Now we need to compute what 7 times 2 is.

21
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,100
We know that 7 times 2 is 14 from out multiplication tables.

22
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,100
We can't just put a 14 down here, we have this 3 to add.

23
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,567
So 7 times 2 is 14, plus 3 is 17.

24
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:06,900
So now we can write this 17 down here, because the 2 is the last number that we have to deal with.

25
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,268
And so we have our answer!

26
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:12,268
7 times 253 is 1771.
