1
00:00:02,113 --> 00:00:12,051
Let's say that we have some function f of x, and let me graph an arbitrary f of x... that's my y axis, and that's my x axis...

2
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:14,698
and maybe f of x looks something like that...

3
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:23,708
and what I want to do is approximate f of x with a Taylor Polynomial centered around "x" is equal to "a"

4
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:27,237
so this is the x axis, this is the y axis, so I want a Taylor Polynomial centered around there

5
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:33,000
You've seen how this works; the Taylor Polynomial comes out of the idea

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,968
that for all of the derivatives up to and including

7
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:38,893
the degree of the polynomial, those derivatives of that polynomial

8
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:43,400
evaluated at "a" should be equal to the derivatives of our function

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,600
evaluated at "a". And that polynomial evaluated at "a" should also

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,575
be equal to that function evaluated at "a".

11
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:54,265
So our polynomial, our Taylor Polynomial approximation, would look something like this;

12
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:58,909
So I'll call it p of x, and sometimes you might see a subscript

13
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:02,717
of big N there to say it's an nth degree approximation and sometimes

14
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:09,172
you'll see something like this, something like N comma a to say it's an nth degree approximation centered a

15
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:12,377
at a. Actually I'll write that right now... maybe we'll lose it

16
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:14,513
if we have to keep writing it over and over, but you should assume

17
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:18,042
that it's an nth degree polynomial centered at "a",

18
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:21,200
and it's going to look like this; it is going to be f of "a" plus

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,723
f prime of a, f prime of a, times x minus a, plus f prime prime of "a"

20
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:39,637
times x minus a squared over (either you could write two or two factorial, there's the same value)

21
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:44,374
I'll write two factorial, you could write divided by one factorial over here if you like.

22
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:52,315
And then plus go to the third derivative of f at a times x minus a to the third power,

23
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:56,402
(I think you see where this is going) over three factorial,

24
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:57,981
and you keep going, I'll go to this line right here, all the way

25
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:03,925
to your nth degree term, which is the nth derivative of f evaluated at a

26
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:11,495
times x minus a to the n over n factorial.

27
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:15,674
And this polynomial right over here, this nth degree polynimal centered at "a",

28
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:21,108
it's definitely f of a is going to be the same, or p of a is going to be the same thing

29
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:24,591
as f of a, and you can verify that, because all of these other terms have

30
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:27,267
an x minus a here, so if you put an a in the polynomial, all of these other

31
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:32,253
terms are going to be zero, and you'll have p of a is equal to f of a, let me write that down

32
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:38,523
: p of a is equal to f of a. And so it might look something like this.

33
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:42,867
It's going to fit the curve better the more of these terms

34
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:45,210
that we actually have. So it might look something like this.

35
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:51,533
I'll try my best to show what it might look like.

36
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:54,777
And what I want to do in this video, since this is all review,

37
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:57,795
I have this polynomial that's approximating this function,

38
00:02:57,795 --> 00:03:00,767
the more terms I have the higher degree of this polynomial,

39
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:05,133
the better that it will fit this curve the further that I get away from "a".

40
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:08,151
But what I want to do in this video is think about, if we can bound

41
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:13,400
how good it's fitting this function as we move away

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,904
from "a". So what I want to do is define a remainder function,

43
00:03:17,904 --> 00:03:21,387
or sometimes I've seen textbooks call it an error function.

44
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:28,733
And I'm going to call this, hmm, just so you're consistent with

45
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:31,836
all the different notations you might see in a book... some people will call this

46
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:37,316
a remainder function for an nth degree polynomial centered at "a",

47
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:39,963
sometimes you'll see this as an "error" function,

48
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:43,585
but the "error" function is sometimes avoided because

49
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:47,254
it looks like "expected value" from probability,

50
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:50,504
but you'll see this often, this is e for error, r for remainder

51
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:55,520
and sometimes they will also have the subscripts over there like that,

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,585
and what we'll do is define this function to be the difference between

53
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:05,505
f of x and our approximation of f of x for any given x.

54
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:10,533
So it's really just going to be (doing the same colors), it's going to be

55
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:16,836
f of x minus p of x. Where this is an nth degree polynomial

56
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:22,873
centered at "a". So for example, if someone were to ask:

57
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:26,449
or if you wanted to visualize, "what are they talking about":

58
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:30,800
if they're saying the error of this nth degree polynomial centered at "a"

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,133
when we are at x is equal to b. What is this thing equal to,

60
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:38,802
or how should you think about this. Well, if b is right over here,

61
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:43,818
so the error of b is going to be f of b minus the polynomial at b.

62
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:47,733
So, f of be there, the polynomial is right over there, so it will be

63
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:50,598
this distance right over here. So if you measure the error at a,

64
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:55,733
it would actually be zero, because the polynomial and the function

65
00:04:55,733 --> 00:05:00,257
are the same there. F of a is equal to p of a, so there error at "a" is equal to zero.

66
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:03,415
Let me actually write that down, because it's an interesting property.

67
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:08,988
It will help us bound it eventually, so let me write that. The error function at "a"

68
00:05:08,988 --> 00:05:14,839
, and for the rest of this video you can assume that I could write a subscript for the nth

69
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,183
degree polynomial centered at "a". I'm just going to not write that every

70
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:23,600
time just to save ourselves some writing. So the error at "a" is equal to

71
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,257
f of a minus p of a, and once again I won't write the sub n and sub a, you can just assume it

72
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:33,276
, this is an nth degree polynomial centered at "a",

73
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:37,733
and these two things are equal to each other. So this is going to be equal to zero

74
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,453
, and we see that right over here. The distance between

75
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:43,200
the two functions is zero there. Now let's think about something else.

76
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:52,038
Let's think about what the derivative of the error function evaluated at "a" is.

77
00:05:52,038 --> 00:06:00,304
That's going to be the derivative of our function at "a" minus the first deriviative of our polynomial at "a".

78
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:05,459
If we assume that this is higher than degree one, we know that

79
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,360
these derivatives are going to be the same at "a". You can try to take the first

80
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,378
derivative here. If you take the first derivative of this whole

81
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:16,140
mess, and this is actually why Taylor Polynomials are so useful,

82
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,066
is that up to and including the degree of the polynomial,

83
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,574
when you evaluate the derivatives of your polynomial at

84
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:25,200
"a" they're going to be the same as the derivatives of the function at "a".

85
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,982
That's what makes it start to be a good approximation.

86
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:30,733
But if you took a derivative here, this term right here will disappear,

87
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:34,067
it will go to zero, I'll cross it out for now, this term right over here

88
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:37,667
will be just f prime of "a", and then all of these other terms are going

89
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:42,239
to be left with some type of an x minus a in them. And so when you

90
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,840
evaluate it at "a" all the terms with an x minus a disappear because

91
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,998
you have an a minus a on them... this one already disappeared,

92
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:53,338
and you're literally just left with p prime of a will equal to f prime of a.

93
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:56,264
And we've seen that before. So let me write that.

94
00:06:56,264 --> 00:07:00,258
So because we know that p prime of a is equal to f prime of a

95
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:06,109
when we evaluate the error function, the derivative of the error function at "a"

96
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:10,939
that also is going to be equal to zero. And this general property

97
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:16,048
right over here, is true up to and including n. So let me write this down.

98
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:21,527
So, we already know that p of a is equal to f of a, we already know that

99
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:25,846
p prime of a is equal to f prime of a, this really comes straight

100
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:29,376
out of the definition of polynomials, and this is going to be true

101
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:35,970
all the way until the nth derivative of our polynomial is evaluated at "a",

102
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,639
not everywhere, just evaluated at "a", is going to be equal to the nth

103
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,800
derivative of our function evaluated at "a".

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,045
So what that tells us is that we could keep doing this with the error function

105
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:53,200
all the way to the nth derivative of the error function evaluated at "a"

106
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,237
is going to be equal to the nth derivative of f evaluated at "a" minus

107
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:03,370
the nth derivative of our polynomial evaluated at "a".

108
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,063
And we already said that these are going to be equal to each other

109
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:08,385
up to the nth derivative when we evaluate them at "a".

110
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:12,333
So these are all going to be equal to zero. So this is an interesting property.

111
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:16,977
but it's also going to be useful when we start to try to bound this error function.

112
00:08:16,977 --> 00:08:19,577
And that's the whole point of where I'm trying to go with this video, and

113
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:20,924
probably the next video

114
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:24,000
We're going to bound it so we know how good of an estimate we have

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,262
especially as we go further and further from where we are centered...

116
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:30,584
from where our approximation is centered.

117
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:33,927
Now let's think about when we take a derivative beyond that.

118
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:36,899
Let's think about what happens when we take the (n+1)th derivative.

119
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:49,392
What is the (n+1)th derivative of our error function. And not even

120
00:08:49,392 --> 00:08:51,203
if I'm just evaluating at "a". If I just say generally, the error function

121
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:54,872
e of x... what's the n+1th derivative of it. Well, it's going to be the

122
00:08:54,872 --> 00:09:01,513
n+1th derivative of our function minus the n+1th derivative of...

123
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:14,051
we're not just evaluating at "a" here either, let me write an x there...

124
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:15,723
of our function... I'm literally just taking the n+1th derivative of

125
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:20,692
both sides of this equation right over here.

126
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:23,061
So it's literally the n+1th derivative of our function minus

127
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:26,729
the n+1th derivative of our nth degree polynomial.

128
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:33,800
The n+1th derivative of our nth degree polynomial.

129
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,467
Once again, I could write an n here, I could write an a here to show

130
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:39,082
it's an nth degree centered at "a".

131
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:45,584
Now, what is the n+1th derivative of an nth degree polynomial?

132
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:53,667
If you want some hints, take the second derivative of y equal to x.

133
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:56,497
It's a first degree polynomial... take the second derivative, you're going to get

134
00:09:56,497 --> 00:10:01,931
a zero. Take the 3rd derivative of y equal x squared.

135
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:07,600
The first derivative is 2x, the second derivative is 2, the third derivative is zero.

136
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,776
In general, if you take an n+1th derivative, of an nth degree polynomial,

137
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:14,191
and you can prove it for yourself, you can even prove it generally,

138
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:19,857
but I think it might make a little sense to you, it's going to be equal to zero.

139
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:25,867
So this thing right here, this is an n+1th derivative of an nth degree polynomial.

140
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:38,804
This is going to be equal to zero. So the n+1th derivative of our error function,

141
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,637
or our remainder function you could call it, is equal to

142
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:51,297
the n+1th derivative of our function. What we can continue in the next video,

143
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:57,984
is figure out, at least can we bound this, and if we're able to bound this,

144
00:10:57,984 --> 00:11:00,724
if we're able to figure out an upper bound on its magnitude,

145
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:04,393
actually what we want to do is bound its overall magnitude, to bound

146
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:06,993
its absolute value.

147
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:11,405
If we can determine that it is less than or equal to some value m...

148
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:15,260
if we can actually bound it, maybe we can do a bit of calculus,

149
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,333
we can keep integrating it, and maybe we can go back to

150
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,321
the original function, and maybe we can bound that in some way.

151
00:11:20,321 --> 99:59:59,999
If we do know some type of bound like this over here, so I'll take that up in the next video.
