1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400
   

2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,100
In the last video, we hopefully
got ourselves a respectable

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,760
understanding of how a
vector-valued function works,

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,340
or even better, a position
vector-valued function, that

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,460
is, in some ways, a
replacement for traditional

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,110
parameterization to
describe a curve.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,050
And what I want to do in this
video is just get a little bit

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,910
of gut sense of what it means
to take of a derivative of

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,730
a vector-valued function.

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,190
In this case, it'll be with
respect to our parameter t.

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,510
So let me draw some
new stuff right here.

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,580
So let's say I have the
vector-valued function r of t,

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,450
and this is no different than
what I did in last video. x of

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,830
t times unit vector i plus y of
t times the unit factor j.

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,460
If we were doing it in 3
dimensions, we'd add a z of t

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,510
times k, but let's keep things
relatively simple, and let's

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,950
say that this describes a
curve, and let's say the curve

18
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:03,630
we're dealing with, t is
between a and b, and this curve

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,870
will look something like, let
me do my best effort to draw

20
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,600
the curve, I'll just draw some
random curve here, so

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,900
let's say the curve looks
something like that.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,890
This is when t is equal
to a, so it's going to

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,750
go in this direction.

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,620
This is when t is equal to b
right here, this is t is equal

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,790
to a, so this right here would
be x of a, this right here is y

26
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,730
of a, and similarly, this up
here, this is x of b, and

27
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,240
this over here is y of b.

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,150
Now, we saw in the last video
that the endpoints of these

29
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,720
position vectors are what's
describing this curve.

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,400
So r of a we saw in the
last video, it describes

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,300
that point right there.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,270
I don't want to review
that too much.

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,800
But what I want to do is
think about, what is the

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,930
difference between 2 points?

35
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,410
So let's say that we take
some random point here.

36
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,760
Let's say, some random t here.

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,780
Let's call that r of t.

38
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,197
Well actually, I'm going to do
a different point, just because

39
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:10,100
I want to make it a
little bit clearer.

40
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,370
So let's say-- I'm going to
switch colors-- let's say

41
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,080
that that right there
is r of some t.

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,980
Some particular t, right there.

43
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,410
That is r of t.

44
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,050
It's going to be, you
know, a plus something.

45
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,950
So that's some a particular t.

46
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,080
And let's say that we want to
figure out, and let's say we

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,560
increase t by a little bit.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,650
By h.

49
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,250
So let's say that r of t plus
h, well, if we view the

50
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,430
parameter t as time, we've
moved in forward in time by

51
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,310
some amount, so our little
particle has moved

52
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,180
a little bit.

53
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,650
And let's say that
we're over here.

54
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:52,530
So that is that right there,
in yellow, is r of t plus h.

55
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,360
Just a slightly
larger value for h.

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,040
Now, one question we might ask
ourselves, is how quickly is f

57
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,650
changing with respect to t?

58
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,380
So the first thing we might
want to say, well, what's the

59
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,550
difference between these two?

60
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,010
If I were to take, and I
want to visualize it.

61
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,880
If I were to take r, the
position vector, that we get by

62
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,080
evaluating r at t plus h, and
from that, I would

63
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,590
subtract r of t.

64
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,580
   

65
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,690
What do we get?

66
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,730
Well, you might want to review
some of your vector algebra

67
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,130
but we're essentially just
going to get this vector.

68
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,210
Let me do it in a
nice, vibrant color.

69
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,820
We're going to get this
vector right there, that

70
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,320
I'm doing in magenta.

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,010
So that magenta vector right
there is, let me do it, that

72
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,080
magenta one right there,
is the vector r of t

73
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,120
plus h minus r of t.

74
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,110
And it should make sense,
because when you add vectors,

75
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,050
you go heads to tails.

76
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:04,060
You could alternatively write
this as r of t plus this

77
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:11,490
character right here, plus r
of t plus h minus r of t.

78
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,630
When you add two vectors,
you're adding, let me make

79
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,180
it very clear, I'm adding
this vector to this

80
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,350
vector right here.

81
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,260
You put the tail of the
second vector at the

82
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,450
head of the first.

83
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,850
So this is the first vector,
and I put the tail of the

84
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,000
second there, and then the sum
of those two, as we predicted,

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,470
should be equal to
this last one.

86
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,050
It should be equal
to r of t plus h.

87
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,000
And we see that is the case,
and algebraically, you would

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,240
see that obviously this
guy and that guy are

89
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,080
going to cancel out.

90
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,270
So hopefully that
satisfies you.

91
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,510
And I want to be clear.

92
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,450
This, all of a sudden, this
isn't a position vector.

93
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,560
We're not saying that hey,
let's nail this guy's tail at

94
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,870
the origin and use this guy to
describe a unique position.

95
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,610
Now all of a sudden he's, it's
just kind of a pure vector.

96
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,700
It's describing just
a change between two

97
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,140
other position vectors.

98
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,790
So this guy is right out here.

99
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,930
But this vector literally
describes the change.

100
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,070
But say we care, and how would
this look algebraically if we

101
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,460
were to expand it like that?

102
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,740
So this is going to be equal
to, what's r of t plus h?

103
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,520
That's the same thing as x
of, let me do it over here.

104
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,190
This is the same thing as x of
t plus h times the unit vector

105
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:35,040
i plus y of t plus h times the
unit vector j, that's just that

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,570
piece, that piece right there
is that piece, minus this

107
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,300
piece, so minus, I'll do it in
the second line, I could have

108
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,240
done it out here, but I'm
running out of space.

109
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,650
Minus x of t, right r of t is
just x of t times i, plus, but

110
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,700
I'll just distribute the minus
sign, so it's minus

111
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,690
y of t times j.

112
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,660
Actually let me write it,
this would be minus, let me

113
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,130
write this way, plus this.

114
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,200
So you realize that this
is really just this

115
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,950
guy right here.

116
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm just evaluating at t.

117
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,030
So you have x of t and y
of t, and then later we

118
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,970
can distribute, right?

119
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,255
If you distribute this minus
sign, you get a minus x

120
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:15,920
of t and a minus y of t.

121
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,380
And in vector addition, you
might need a little review on

122
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,920
this if you haven't seen it in
a while, you know that you can

123
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,990
just add the corresponding
components.

124
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,450
You can add the x-components
and you can add

125
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,750
the y-components.

126
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,790
So this is going to be equal
to, let me rewrite it over

127
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,810
here, because I think I'm going
to need some space later on.

128
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,510
So let me rewrite it over here.

129
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:42,930
So I have r of t plus h minus r
of t is equal to, and I'm just

130
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,100
going to group the x- and the
y-components, this is equal to

131
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,920
the x-components added
together, but this is a

132
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,400
negative, so we're going to
subtract this guy

133
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,100
from that guy.

134
00:06:52,100 --> 00:07:02,400
So x of t plus h minus x of t,
and then all of that times our

135
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,840
unit vector in the x-direction,
and then we'll have plus y of t

136
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,900
plus h minus y of t times a
unit vector the j-direction,

137
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,490
I'm just rearranging things
right now, and this will tell

138
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:25,870
us what is our change between
any 2 r's for given

139
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,610
change in distance.

140
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,140
And our change in distance
here is h between any

141
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,000
2 position vectors.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
Now, what I set out at the
beginning of this video, I

143
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,100
said, well, I wanted to figure
out the change, and we're going

144
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,990
to think about the
instantaneous change

145
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,790
with respect to t.

146
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,920
So I want to see, well,
how much did this change

147
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,570
over a period of h?

148
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,750
Instead of writing h we could
have written delta t, it

149
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,010
would've been the same thing.

150
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,570
So I want to divide this by h.

151
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,410
So I want to say, look.

152
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,200
My vectors changed this much,
but I want to say it's

153
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,310
over a period of h.

154
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,250
And this is analogous
to when we do slope.

155
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,090
We say rise over run, over
delta y, or change in

156
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,290
y, over change in x.

157
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,160
This is kind of the change in
our function per change in x.

158
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,960
Let's just divide everything,
or I shouldn't say change

159
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,470
x, per change in t.

160
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,100
So here, our change
in t is h, right?

161
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,290
The difference between t plus h
and t is just going to be h.

162
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,650
And so we're going to
divide everything by h.

163
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,750
When you multiply a vector by
some scale, or divide it by

164
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,070
some scale, or you're just the
taking each of its components

165
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,140
and multiplying or dividing
by that scalar, and we

166
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,660
get that right there.

167
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,540
So this, for any finite
difference right here, h,

168
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,300
this'll tell us how much
our vector changes per h.

169
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,220
But if we want to find the
instantaneous change, right,

170
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,230
just like what we did when we
first learned differential

171
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,520
calculus, we said, ok.

172
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,670
This is kind of
analogous to a slope.

173
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,520
This would be good, this would
work out well for us, if the

174
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,220
path under question looked
something like this.

175
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,920
If it was a linear path.

176
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,240
If our path looked
something like this.

177
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,800
We could just calculate this,
and we'll essentially have the

178
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,080
average change in our position
vectors, so you could imagine,

179
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,880
2 position vectors,
that's one of them.

180
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,050
Well, actually, they'd
all be parallel.

181
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:24,470
Well, the position vectors,
they don't have to be parallel.

182
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,740
They could be like that.

183
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,340
And then, this would just
describe the change between

184
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,940
these 2 per h, or how quickly
are the position vectors

185
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,230
changing per our change
in our parameter, right?

186
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,530
This is, the h, you could also
consider, is kind of a delta t.

187
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,050
Sometimes people find the
h simpler, or sometimes

188
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:44,900
they find the delta t.

189
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,230
But anyway, I'm concerned
with the instantaneous.

190
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,140
We're dealing with curves,
we're dealing with calculus.

191
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,870
This would have been OK
if we were just in an

192
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,670
algebraic, linear world.

193
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,850
So what do we do?

194
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,080
Well maybe, we can just take
the limit as h approaches 0.

195
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
Let me scroll this over.

196
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,700
So let's just take the limit,
let me do this in a nice

197
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,910
vibrant color, let's take, I'm
running out of colors, the

198
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,170
limit as h approaches 0
of both sides of this.

199
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,440
So here, too, I'm going to take
the limit as h approaches 0,

200
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,520
and here, too, I'm going to
take the limit as

201
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,380
h approaches 0.

202
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,970
So I just want to say, well,
what happens, how much do I

203
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,866
change per a change in my
parameter t, but what's kind of

204
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:30,480
the instantaneous change, as
the difference gets smaller

205
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,280
and smaller and smaller?

206
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,870
This is exactly what we first
learned when we learned about

207
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,810
instantaneous slope, or
instantaneous velocity, or

208
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,330
slope of a tangent line.

209
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,270
Well, this thing looks a little
bit undefined to me, right now.

210
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,260
We haven't defined limits for
vector-valued functions, we

211
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,820
haven't defined derivatives
for vector-valued functions.

212
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,250
But lucky for us, all of
this stuff here looks

213
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,160
pretty familiar.

214
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,400
This is actually the
definition of our derivative.

215
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,310
And these are scalar-valued
functions right here.

216
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,340
They're multiplied by vectors,
in order for us to get

217
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,880
vector-valued functions.

218
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,100
But this right here, by
definition, this is the

219
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,330
derivative, this
is x prime of t.

220
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,020
Or this is dx dt.

221
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,280
This right here is y
prime of t, or we could

222
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,950
write that as dy dt.

223
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,520
So all of a sudden we can
define, we can say, and I'm

224
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,220
being a little hand-wavy here,
but I want to give you the

225
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,590
intuition, more than anything.

226
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,890
We can say that the derivative,
we can call this expression

227
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:30,100
right here, as the derivative
of my vector-valued function r

228
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,440
with respect to t, or we could
call it dr dt, notice I keep

229
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,170
the vector signs there.

230
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:44,470
This is its derivative, and all
it's going to be equal to, r

231
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,700
prime of t, is going to be
equal to, well, this is just

232
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,450
the derivative of x with
respect to t, is equal to x

233
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,230
prime of t times the x-unit
vector, the horizontal unit

234
00:11:54,230 --> 00:12:01,170
vector, plus y prime of t,
times the y-unit vector, times

235
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,240
j, the unit vector in the
horizontal direction.

236
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,800
That's a pretty nice
and simple outcome.

237
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,340
But the hard thing may be
to a kind of visualize

238
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,730
what it represents.

239
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,490
So if we think about what
happens, let me draw a big

240
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:19,730
graph, just to get the
visualization in a healthy way.

241
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,310
So let's say my curve looks
something like this.

242
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,700
That's my curve.

243
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,860
And let's say that this is,
we want to figure out the

244
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,210
instantaneous change at
this point right here.

245
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,550
So that is r of t.

246
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,520
And then if we take r of t plus
h, we saw this already, you

247
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,740
know, t plus h might be
something like right there.

248
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,090
So this is r of t plus h.

249
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,290
Right now, the difference
between these two, and this is

250
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,250
just the numerator when you
take the difference, or how

251
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:55,170
fast we're changing from this
vector to that vector in terms

252
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,140
of t, and it's hard
to visualize here.

253
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,960
And I'm going to do a whole
video so we can think about

254
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,160
the magnitudes here.

255
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,200
That might be some vector.

256
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,560
Well, the difference
between these two is

257
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,070
just going to be that.

258
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,470
But then when you divide it by
h, it's going to be a larger

259
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,840
vector, right, if we assume
that h is a small number.

260
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,410
Let's say h is less than one.

261
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,410
We're going to get a
larger vector, right?

262
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,100
But this is kind of the average
change over this time.

263
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,910
But as h gets smaller and
smaller and smaller, this r

264
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,100
prime of t is going to, its
direction is going to be

265
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,090
tangential to the curve.

266
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,900
And I think you can
visualize that, right?

267
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,320
As these two guys get closer
and closer and closer, the dr's

268
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,790
get smaller, so the change, the
dr, the difference between the

269
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,220
two, the delta r's, get smaller
and smaller, you can imagine if

270
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,790
h was even smaller, if
it was right here.

271
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,510
Then all of a sudden, the
difference between those two

272
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,795
vectors is getting smaller.

273
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:50,500
And it's getting more and more
tangential to the curve.

274
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,770
   

275
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,800
But then we're also dividing by
a smaller h, so the actual

276
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,670
derivative, as the limit of h
approaches 0, it might be you

277
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,120
know, maybe it's even a
bigger number there.

278
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,420
And actually, the magnitude
of this vector, it's a

279
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,720
little hard to visualize.

280
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,510
It's going to be dependent our
parameterization for the curve.

281
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,990
it's not dependent on
the shape of the curve.

282
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,170
The direction of this vector is
dependent on the shape of this

283
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,860
curve, and the direction, so
the direction, this will

284
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,460
be tangent to the curve.

285
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,830
Or you could imagine that this
vector is on the tangent

286
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,220
line to the curve.

287
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,960
The magnitude of it is a little
bit hard to understand.

288
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,050
I'll try to give you a
little bit of intuition on

289
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,060
that in the next video.

290
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,380
But this is what I want you to
understand right now, because

291
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,990
we're going to be able to use
this in the future, when we do

292
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,400
the line integral over
vector-valued functions.

293
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,666
