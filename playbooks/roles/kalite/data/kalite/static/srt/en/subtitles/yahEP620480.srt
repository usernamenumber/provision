1
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:07,036
Inflation - and when most people talk about inflation, they talk

2
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:11,703
about price inflation. And that's just the increase in general level of prices for goods and services.

3
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:15,395
And you probably have a sense of that. That every year in kind of a normal

4
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:18,228
economy things seem to a little bit more expensive, although not

5
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:20,944
everything does. Especially if you look at something like

6
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:25,403
healthcare, cost of education, you definitely see things getting

7
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:29,443
more expensive. One interesting question is how do you

8
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:33,692
measure it? How do you measure inflation? And what the

9
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:37,082
Bureau of Labor Statistics does - this is actually the most used

10
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:39,288
measurement of inflation. They create something called a

11
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:43,003
Consumer Price Index. And the way they do it is they define a

12
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:46,858
basket of goods - actually a basket of goods and services.

13
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:49,946
So what they do is go and look at the average urban consumer

14
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:53,731
and they say "what do they need in their life?". "They may need some

15
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:58,073
housing, they might need some fuel - natural gas for their home

16
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:03,205
they need gasoline for their cars, energy in other ways. They might need

17
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:09,265
some type of services - they might need transportation". And they try to come up

18
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:14,211
with a basket of all of the things that the average consumer in

19
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:17,926
an urban environment might need. And they figure out how much

20
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:21,734
that would cost them in year One. And let's say that in year One,

21
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:26,076
that it costs them a hundred dollars - the actual basket CPI constructs would not

22
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:29,258
cost a hundred dollars. But I am going to do this for the sake of

23
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:33,019
simplicity. And they will weight these based on how much - what percentage they think

24
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:35,457
people spend on housing vs. fuel vs. services vs. transportation.

25
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:40,728
Then, they will look at the same basket each year after that.

26
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:43,886
So then they will do the same things - Housing, fuel, services,

27
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:50,527
transportation. And this will be in year Two now. And let's say

28
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:55,775
the same basket costs one hundred and two dollars. Well, then they

29
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:59,374
will say the general level of price and services for this consumer

30
00:01:59,374 --> 00:02:02,207
went up by two dollars or went up by more important

31
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:06,874
thing is by the percentage - by two percent. So, based on this

32
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:12,098
measure, based on this basket of goods, prices went up by two percent.

33
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,117
Or you'll hear the people on news say this "Inflation rate went

34
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:21,293
up by two percent". Now, I want to clarify - what inflation - sometimes talks to inflation

35
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:24,916
in the money supply. People talk about there's more money being

36
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,538
printed. And often increase in money supply is one of the factors

37
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:33,020
that is driving price inflation. When most people talk

38
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,876
about inflation, they are talking about price inflation. They are

39
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:40,009
talking about increase in prices. They are not directly talking about

40
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:43,538
the increase in the money supply. Now this seems like a pretty

41
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,232
simple thing to do - but it is not as simple as you might first

42
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:51,340
think. Because think about something like TV sets or especially anything

43
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,052
that is technological. Do you look at the same TV set that is getting probably cheaper every year or do you look at the average

44
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,351
TV Set that the American household is having. Do you look

45
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:03,484
at the same computer that is getting significantly cheaper every

46
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:06,874
year or you look at the average computer every year? Then you

47
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:09,475
would actually be looking at a different product. So there's actually a lot

48
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:11,866
of things to think about and a lot of things how can weight this.

49
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:16,023
And there's been a lot of controversy in when the weightings

50
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:18,577
change in different periods of time. But this is the general idea

51
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:22,199
and it is really just the best attempt to figure out on average

52
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,192
how much more expensive or how much purchasing power are

53
00:03:27,192 --> 99:59:59,999
we loosing from one year to the next.
