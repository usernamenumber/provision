1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,590
I will now introduce you to
the idea of a homogeneous

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,840
differential equation.

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,210
   

5
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,580
Homogeneous is the same word
that we use for milk, when we

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,490
say that the milk has been--
that all the fat clumps have

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,640
been spread out.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,690
But the application here,
at least I don't see the

9
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,510
connection.

10
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,340
Homogeneous differential
equation.

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,880
And even within differential
equations, we'll learn later

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,180
there's a different type
of homogeneous

13
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,950
differential equation.

14
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,050
Those are called homogeneous
linear differential equations,

15
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,210
but they mean something actually
quite different.

16
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,930
But anyway, for this purpose,
I'm going to show you

17
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,640
homogeneous differential
equations.

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,190
And what we're dealing
with are going to

19
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,750
be first order equations.

20
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,450
What does a homogeneous
differential equation mean?

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,110
Well, say I had just a regular
first order differential

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,650
equation that could be
written like this.

23
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:57,140
So dy dx is equal to some
function of x and y.

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,350
And let's say we try to do this,
and it's not separable,

25
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,900
and it's not exact.

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,985
What we learn is that if it can
be homogeneous, if this is

27
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:09,680
a homogeneous differential
equation, that we can make a

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,860
variable substitution.

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,310
And that variable substitution
allows this equation to turn

30
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,710
into a separable one.

31
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,690
But before I need to show you
that, I need to tell you, what

32
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,550
does it mean to be
homogeneous?

33
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,310
Well, if I can algebraically
manipulate this right side of

34
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,310
this equation, so that I can
actually rewrite it.

35
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,890
Instead of a function x and
y, if I could rewrite this

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,990
differential equation so that
dy dx is equal to some

37
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:41,440
function, let's call that G,
or we'll call it capital F.

38
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,410
If I can rewrite it
algebraically, so it's a

39
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,090
function of y divided by x.

40
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,790
Then I can make a variable
substitution

41
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,350
that makes it separable.

42
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,870
So right now, it seems
all confusing.

43
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,120
Let me show you an example.

44
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,740
   

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,800
And I'll just show you the
examples, show you some items,

46
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,850
and then we'll just do
the substitutions.

47
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,100
So let's say that my
differential equation is the

48
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,216
derivative of y with respect
to x is equal to

49
00:02:08,216 --> 00:02:12,170
x plus y over x.

50
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,100
And you can, if you'd like,
you can try to make this a

51
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,380
separable, but it's not
that trivial to solve.

52
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,240
Or at least, I'm looking at an
inspection, and it doesn't

53
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,130
seem that trivial to solve.

54
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,860
And as we see right here,
we have the derivative.

55
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,870
It's equal to some function
of x and y.

56
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,570
And my question is to you, can
I just algebraically rewrite

57
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,270
this so it becomes a function
of y over x?

58
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,240
Well, sure, if we just divide
both of these top terms by x.

59
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:45,380
This is the same thing as
x over x plus y over x.

60
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,110
This equation is the same
thing as dy over

61
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,310
dx is equal to this.

62
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,970
Which is same thing as
rewriting this whole

63
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,300
equation-- I'm going to switch
colors arbitrarily-- as this,

64
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,890
dy over dx is equal to x divided
by x is equal to 1, if

65
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,120
we assume x doesn't equal 0.

66
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,790
Plus y over x.

67
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,340
So you're probably wondering
what did I mean by a function

68
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,650
of y over x?

69
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,090
Well, you can see it here.

70
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,070
When I just algebraically
manipulated this equation, I

71
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,350
got 1 plus y over x.

72
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,350
So if I said that y over x is
equal to some third variable,

73
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,750
this is just a function of
that third variable.

74
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,330
And actually, I'm going
to do that right now.

75
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,140
So let's make a substitution
for y over x.

76
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,380
Let's say that v-- and I'll do v
in a different color-- let's

77
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,550
say that v is equal
to y over x.

78
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,380
Or another way, if you just
multiply both sides by x, you

79
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,240
could write that y
is equal to xv.

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,060
And we're going to substitute v
for y over x, but we're also

81
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,050
going to have to substitute
dy over dx.

82
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,530
So let's figure out what
that is in terms of the

83
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,520
derivatives of v.

84
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,640
So the derivative of y with
respect to x is equal to--

85
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,750
what's the derivative of
this with respect to x?

86
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,970
Well, if we assume that v is
also a function of x, then

87
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,350
we're just going to use
the product rule.

88
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:09,790
So the derivative of x is 1
times v plus x times the

89
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,700
derivative of v with
respect to x.

90
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,290
And now, we can substitute this
and this back into this

91
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,070
equation, and we get--
so dy over dx,

92
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,000
that is equal to this.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,440
So we get v plus x dv dx, the
derivative of v with respect

94
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,450
to x, is equal to-- that's just
the left hand side-- it's

95
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,370
equal to 1 plus y over x.

96
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,900
But we're making this
substitution that v is equal

97
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,720
to y over x.

98
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,790
So we'll do 1 plus v.

99
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,190
And now, this should be pretty
straightforward.

100
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,720
So let's see, we can subtract
v from both

101
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,970
sides of this equation.

102
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,880
   

103
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,980
And then what do we have left?

104
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,620
We have x dv dx is equal to 1.

105
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,670
Let's divide both sides by x.

106
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,490
And we get the derivative of
v with respect to x is

107
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,710
equal to 1 over x.

108
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,110
It should maybe start becoming
a little bit clearer what the

109
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,980
solution here is, but let's
just keep going forward.

110
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,150
So if we multiply both sides by
dx, we get dv is equal to 1

111
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,120
over x times dx.

112
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,440
Now, we can take the
antiderivative of both sides,

113
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,130
integrate both sides.

114
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,490
And we're left with v is equal
to the natural log of the

115
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,530
absolute value of x plus c.

116
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,680
And we are kind of done, but it
would be nice to get this

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,180
solution in terms of just y and
x, and not have this third

118
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,980
variable v here.

119
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,390
Because our original problem was
just in terms of y and x.

120
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,100
So let's do that.

121
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,230
What was v?

122
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,765
We made the substitution that
v is equal to y over x.

123
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:52,850
So let's reverse substitute it
now, or unsubstitute it.

124
00:05:52,850 --> 00:06:00,790
So we get y over x is equal to
the natural log of x plus c,

125
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,840
some constant.

126
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,770
Multiply both sides times x.

127
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,510
And you get y is equal to
x times the natural

128
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,590
log of x plus c.

129
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,490
And we're done.

130
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,340
We solved that seemingly
inseparable differential

131
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,320
equation by recognizing that it
was homogeneous, and making

132
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,320
that variable substitution
v is equal to y over x.

133
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,540
That turned it into a separable

134
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,700
equation in terms of v.

135
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,150
And then we solved it.

136
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,290
And then we unsubstituted
it back.

137
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,390
And we got the solution to the
differential equation.

138
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,410
You can verify it for yourself,
that y is equal to

139
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,520
the x natural log of the
absolute value of x plus c.

140
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,050
Oh, actually, I made
a mistake.

141
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,960
y over x is equal to the natural
log of x plus c.

142
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,740
If I multiply both sides of this
equation times x, what's

143
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,790
the solution?

144
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,500
It's not just x natural
log of x.

145
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,250
I have to multiply this
times x, too, right?

146
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,970
Distributive property-- that
was an amateur mistake.

147
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,580
So the correct solution is y is
equal to x natural log of

148
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,710
the absolute value of
x plus x times c.

149
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,020
And if you want to figure out
c, I would have to give you

150
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,030
some initial conditions.

151
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,980
And then you could
solve for c.

152
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,600
And that would be the particular
solution, then, for

153
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,900
this differential equation.

154
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,610
In the next video, I'll just
do a couple more of these

155
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,100
problems. I'll see you then.

156
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,000
