00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:01,776
PROBLEM: "What is the image of

2
00:00:01,776 --> 00:00:04,687
the polygon below after the translation T

3
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:07,922
[with the subscript] (5, 2)?"

4
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:09,543
So that means, "Let's translate 5

5
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:10,910
in the horizontal direction,

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,282
and 2 in the vertical direction."

7
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:13,117
So let's do that.

8
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:14,000
So I'm going to focus

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,201
on this point right over here â€“

10
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:18,088
so that point is the point 3, 3.

11
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:21,169
If I want translate 5 in the horizontal direction,

12
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,801
the x value is going to get to 8.

13
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:29,307
So the x value will increase by (1, 2, 3, 4) 5.

14
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:32,286
And then we want to increase the y value by 2.

15
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:34,066
1, 2.

16
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:35,809
Let's check our answer.

17
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:36,870
Let's do a couple more of these.

18
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,733
That was a lot of fun.

19
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:40,320
So here we need to shift it by

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,778
-8 in the horizontal direction.

21
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:45,062
So this one right over here, its x value is 0.

22
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:46,685
So we need to go essentially -8.

23
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:48,432
[Counting as he shifts]: -1, -2.

24
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:50,055
Or we need to move to the left 1.

25
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:56,704
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) 8.

26
00:00:56,704 --> 00:00:59,267
And then we have to move it down by 2.

27
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,794
So we have to move it down 1, 2.

28
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:04,667
And we're done.
