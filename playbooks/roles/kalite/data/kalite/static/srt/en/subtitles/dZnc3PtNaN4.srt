1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,000
I just did several videos on
the binomial theorem, so I

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,550
think, now that they're done, I
think now is good time to do

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:13,660
the proof of the derivative
of the general form.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,500
Let's take the derivative
of x to the n.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,300
Now that we know the
binomial theorem, we

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,440
have the tools to do it.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,830
How do we take the derivative?

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,070
Well, what's the classic
definition of the derivative?

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:36,220
It is the limit as delta x
approaches zero of f of

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,130
x plus delta x, right?

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,210
So f of x plus delta x in this
situation is x plus delta

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,000
x to the nth power, right?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,720
Minus f of x, well f of x
here is just x to the n.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,100
All of that over delta x.

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,710
   

17
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,610
Now that we know the binomial
theorem we can figure out

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,200
what the expansion of x plus
delta x is to the nth power.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,340
And if you don't know the
binomial theorem, go to my

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,040
pre-calculus play list
and watch the videos on

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,710
the binomial theorem.

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,290
The binomial theorem tells us
that this is equal to-- I'm

23
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,170
going to need some space for
this one-- the limit as

24
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,310
delta x approaches zero.

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,860
And what's the
binomial theorem?

26
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,960
This is going to be equal to--
I'm just going to do the

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:39,630
numerator-- x to the
n plus n choose 1.

28
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,440
Once again, review the binomial
theorem if this is looks like

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,340
latin to you and you
don't know latin.

30
00:01:44,340 --> 00:02:00,780
n choose 1 of x to the n minus
1 delta x plus n choose 2 x to

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,650
the n minus 2, that's x n
minus 2, delta x squared.

32
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,490
Then plus, and we have a bunch
of the digits, and in this

33
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,560
proof we don't have to go
through all the digits but the

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,810
binomial theorem tells us what
they are and, of course, the

35
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,790
last digit we just keep adding
is going to be 1-- it would

36
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,450
be n choose n which is 1.

37
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,030
Let me just write that
down. n choose n.

38
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:36,920
It's going to be x to the
zero times delta x to the n.

39
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,030
So that's the
binomial expansion.

40
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,450
Let me switch back to minus,
green that's x plus delta x

41
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,740
to the n, so minus
x to the n power.

42
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,840
That's x to the n, I know
I squashed it there.

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,810
All of that over delta x.

44
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,590
Let's see if we can simplify.

45
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,940
First of all we have an x to
the n here, and at the very end

46
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,880
we subtract out an x to the
n, so these two cancel out.

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,080
If we look at every term here,
every term in the numerator has

48
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,310
a delta x, so we can divide
the numerator and the

49
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,820
denominator by delta x.

50
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,210
This is the same thing
as 1 over delta x times

51
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,960
this whole thing.

52
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:29,670
So that is equal to the limit
as delta x approaches zero of,

53
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,910
so we divide the top and the
bottom by delta x, or we

54
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,530
multiply the numerator
times 1 over delta x.

55
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:42,310
We get n choose 1 x
to the n minus 1.

56
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,580
What's delta x divided by
delta x, that's just 1.

57
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:52,440
Plus n choose 2, x
to the n minus 2.

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,310
This is delta x squared, but
we divide by delta x we

59
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,940
just get a delta x here.

60
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,490
Delta x.

61
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,100
And then we keep having a bunch
of terms, we're going to divide

62
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,180
all of them by delta x.

63
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,190
And then the last term is
delta x to the n, but then

64
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,130
we're going to divide
that by delta x.

65
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,550
So the last term becomes n
choose n, x to the zero is 1,

66
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,940
we can ignore that. delta x
to the n divided by delta x.

67
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,910
Well that's delta x
to the n minus 1.

68
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,150
   

69
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,690
Then what are we doing now?

70
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,505
Remember, we're taking
the limit as delta

71
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:30,760
x approaches zero.

72
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,220
As delta x approaches zero,
pretty much every term that

73
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,290
has a delta x in it,
it becomes zero.

74
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,850
When you multiply but
zero, you get zero.

75
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,650
This first term has no
delta x in it, but

76
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,730
every other term does.

77
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,950
Every other term, even after
we divided by delta x

78
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,680
has a delta x in it.

79
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,930
So that's a zero.

80
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,970
Every term is zero, all
of the other n minus 1

81
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,940
terms, they're all zeros.

82
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,390
All we're left with is that
this is equal to n choose

83
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,520
1 of x the n minus 1.

84
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,530
And what's n choose 1?

85
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:13,070
That equals n factorial over 1
factorial divided by n minus 1

86
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,170
factorial times x
to the n minus 1.

87
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,390
1 factorial is 1.

88
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,430
If I have 7 factorial divided
by 6 factorial, that's just 1.

89
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,070
Or if I have 3 factorial
divided by 2 factorial, that's

90
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,650
just 3, you can work it out.

91
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,660
10 factorial divided by
9 factorial that's 10.

92
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,830
So n factorial divided
by n minus 1 factorial,

93
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,600
that's just equal to n.

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,540
So this is equal to n
times x to the n minus 1.

95
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,866
That's the derivative
of x to the n. n times

96
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,900
x to the n minus 1.

97
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:52,470
We just proved the derivative
for any positive integer when

98
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,610
x to the power n, where n
is any positive integer.

99
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,790
And we see later it actually
works for all real

100
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,990
numbers and the exponent.

101
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,980
I will see you in
a future video.

102
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,860
Another thing I wanted to point
out is, you know I said that

103
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,150
we had to know the
binomial theorem.

104
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,050
But if you think about it, we
really didn't even have to know

105
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,630
the binomial theorem because we
knew in any binomial

106
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,960
expansion-- I mean, you'd have
to know a little bit-- but if

107
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,350
you did a little
experimentation you would

108
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,470
realize that whenever you
expand a plus b to the nth

109
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,040
power, first term is going to
be a to the n, and the second

110
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,670
term is going to be plus n a to
the n minus 1 b.

111
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,320
And then you are going to keep
having a bunch of terms.

112
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,190
But these are the only terms
that are relevant to this proof

113
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,575
because all the other terms get
canceled out when delta

114
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:44,980
x approaches zero.

115
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,110
So if you just knew that you
could have done this, but it's

116
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,150
much better to do it with
the binomial theorem.

117
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,880
Ignore what I just said
if it confused you.

118
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,280
I'm just saying that we could
have just said the rest of

119
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,950
these terms all go to zero.

120
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,700
Anyway, hopefully you
found that fulfilling.

121
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,960
I will see you in
future videos.

122
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,400
