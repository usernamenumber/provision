1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
   

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,370
In the last couple of videos
we saw that looking just

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,800
purely at market capitalization
can be a little

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,190
bit misleading, when you look at
companies that have a good

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,380
bit of leverage or companies
that have a good bit of debt.

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,530
For example, if that's the
assets of the company, and

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,181
let's say that they have
this much debt.

8
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:19,810
And this is their equity.

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,430
   

10
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,180
And then let's say they
have some excess cash.

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,420
Cash that's not necessary to
actually operate the business.

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,150
I'll draw that up here.

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,520
So this is excess cash.

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,850
Some cash is necessary, and
oftentimes people don't make

15
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,220
the distinction.

16
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,800
And they'll just view this
as all the cash.

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,420
But we really want to separate
the value of the enterprise

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,620
out of the market value
of the equity or the

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,720
value of the debt.

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,900
So let me just write
all this down.

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,230
So this right here, this is
the value of the business.

22
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,480
The enterprise value.

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,500
   

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,160
Here is the debt.

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,490
There's the debt.

26
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,175
And this is the equity.

27
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:03,920
   

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,870
And this is a little bit of
a slight, I would say,

29
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,190
technicality.

30
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,950
And you don't have to worry
about this if it

31
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,100
confuses you at all.

32
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,780
When I write the enterprise
here, this is the value of the

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,730
business itself.

34
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,060
So it's kind of the operational
assets net of the

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,230
operational liabilities.

36
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,560
It's literally-- if you had
to go out in the past two

37
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,500
examples and buy the pizzeria--
how much net would

38
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,150
you have to pay for
that pizzeria?

39
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,150
And that's what we're trying to
figure out right here when

40
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,440
we're talking about the
enterprise value.

41
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,585
And we saw in the last couple
of videos how you calculate

42
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:35,370
it, but it never hurts
to review it.

43
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,070
This is actually one of those
less intuitive calculations

44
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,380
the first few times you
see it, so it doesn't

45
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,970
hurt to do it again.

46
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,950
So the first thing to figure out
is, how do you figure out

47
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,680
the market value
of the equity?

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,400
The book value of the
equity is very easy.

49
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,570
You could go into a company's
balance sheet and they'll

50
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,070
write down a number.

51
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,120
They'll say, this is what our
accountants say that the book

52
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,730
value of our equity is worth.

53
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,260
But the market value, figure it
out from what the market's

54
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,580
willing to pay for a share.

55
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:07,670
So the market value of equity or
the market cap is equal to

56
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,520
price per share times the
number of shares.

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,040
   

58
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,240
And that's the market value
of this equity.

59
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,800
And you can see, just even from
this diagram, that the

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,230
enterprise value plus the
non-operating cash or

61
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,590
investments or liquid
investments, whatever you want

62
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,280
to call them.

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:37,580
Enterprise value plus the cash
is equal to the debt plus,

64
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,420
let's just say the market cap.

65
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,970
Because we want to know, when we
look at a price, we want to

66
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,230
be able to figure out what
is the market saying the

67
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,970
enterprise value of
the company is?

68
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,500
What is the market value
of the enterprise?

69
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,820
So debt plus-- instead of
equity-- I'll write market

70
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,020
capitalization, because
it's the same thing.

71
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,150
Market capitalization is the
market's value of the equity

72
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,840
plus market cap.

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,690
So we know market cap.

74
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,240
We can look up the debt on a
company's balance sheet.

75
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,820
We can look up the cash.

76
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,470
So we just subtract cash from
both sides, and we get

77
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:20,480
enterprise value is equal
to market cap

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,120
plus debt minus cash.

79
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,500
We're just taking cash
onto the right-hand

80
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,730
side of this equation.

81
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,070
So for example, if I have a
stock that is trading at-

82
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,650
let's say the price is $10.

83
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:45,290
And let's say that there
are 1 million shares.

84
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:52,450
And let's say that the company
has $50 million of debt.

85
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:59,400
And let's say it has $5 million
of excess cash, what's

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,880
its enterprise value?

87
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,510
Well, you first figure
out its market cap.

88
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,750
Its market cap is $10 per share
times a million shares.

89
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,670
So that's 10 million shares.

90
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,510
That's the market cap.

91
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,410
You add the debt.

92
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,560
So, plus $50 million.

93
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,760
And once again, I said this in
the last video, it's very

94
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,390
unintuitive when you figure
out the value of the

95
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,459
enterprise to add the debt.

96
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,480
And the intuition is that if
someone were to want to buy

97
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,040
this company from the
stakeholders and be debt free,

98
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,750
they would have to pay these
people the total amount of

99
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,270
debt, and they'd have to pay
these people the total amount

100
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,060
of the market value.

101
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,610
So they'd have to pay the
debt plus the equity.

102
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,830
And they get a refund
of the cash.

103
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,100
This would be extra stuff that
they would be buying that they

104
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,970
could get money back for.

105
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,260
So you have to pay the equity
holders, you have to pay the

106
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,720
debt holders, and then you
get a refund of the cash.

107
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,630
And so the enterprise value's
what? $60 million minus 5.

108
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,200
That's $55 million.

109
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,780
Fair enough.

110
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,170
This is all just review of the
enterprise value video.

111
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,980
But the question is, now that
you've figured out enterprise

112
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,490
value, how do you figure
out if that's a

113
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,130
fair enterprise value?

114
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,290
When you looked at market
capitalization you compared

115
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,440
that to earnings.

116
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,560
The price to earnings ratio.

117
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,880
You were doing this
on a per share.

118
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,320
This is price per share divided
by earnings per share.

119
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,350
This ratio's equivalent to
market cap divided by the

120
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,810
actual net income
of the company.

121
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,570
   

122
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,520
Where if you just multiply the
numerator and the denominator

123
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,370
by the number of shares, you get
market cap and net income.

124
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,490
This is EPS.

125
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,210
P/E is actually price
per share divided by

126
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,240
earnings per share.

127
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,880
And that was one way
to look at it.

128
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,210
You could compare
two companies.

129
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,570
And we saw it breaks down if
they have different types of

130
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,310
capital structure.

131
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,880
So what do you compare
enterprise value to?

132
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,670
Here we did market cap
to net income.

133
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,450
Enterprise value should
be compared to what?

134
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,460
Now I made an argument in the
last video that, well if we're

135
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,340
looking at the enterprise, we
should look at essentially the

136
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,850
earnings that are popping
out of the enterprise.

137
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,640
We should look at the earnings
that are coming out of this

138
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,100
asset right here.

139
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,280
And on the very first video
on the income statement, I

140
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,180
implied that-- let's do
a balance sheet--

141
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,370
you have your revenue.

142
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,740
Your revenue could be 100.

143
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,730
You have your cost
of goods sold.

144
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,130
Cost of goods sold could be,
let's say it's minus 50.

145
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,520
And I'll show you another
convention.

146
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,720
One of the commenters suggested
that I do this

147
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,100
convention.

148
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,380
Which is actually the most
typical convention for a lot

149
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,260
of accountants and financial
analysts.

150
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,050
Instead of writing a negative,
they'll write it in

151
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,720
parentheses.

152
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,000
That means negative.

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,270
Minus 50.

154
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:45,060
And then the gross profit
would be 50.

155
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,350
And then, actually I want to
do something a little bit

156
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,750
interesting.

157
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,830
Let's say that this cost of
goods sold, it involves no

158
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,170
depreciation or amortization.

159
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,360
And watch those videos if
those words confuse you.

160
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,720
And all of the appreciation and
amortization is actually

161
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,850
occurring at the corporate
level.

162
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:04,760
So let's say that there
is some SG&A.

163
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,240
But this is without the
depreciation and amortization.

164
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:14,630
So let's say that this
is an expense of 10.

165
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,110
Let's say there's some
depreciation and

166
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,505
amortization as well.

167
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,990
D&A.

168
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,250
In the last couple of videos
I kind of grouped.

169
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,490
And that tends to be the case.

170
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,540
On a lot of income statements
they won't separate out the

171
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,060
depreciation and amortization.

172
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,470
And you'll actually have to
look at the cash flow

173
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,890
statement to figure
out what this is.

174
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,920
And I'm going to do that
in a future video.

175
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,560
But let's say that we actually
do break it out.

176
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,700
Sometimes that does happen.

177
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,200
And let's say that
that's another 5.

178
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,620
Maybe these are in thousands.

179
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,160
And then you're left with
the operating profit.

180
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,410
   

181
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,740
In this case, which is 50
minus 15, so it's 35.

182
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,010
And then you have things
below that.

183
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,360
You have interest. And I'll do
those just for-- you have the

184
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,420
non-operating income and
interest and all that.

185
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,150
Let me just do that.

186
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:08,160
Interest. Let's say that that is
also 5,000, if that's what

187
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,430
we care about.

188
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,750
And then you have pre-tax.

189
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,500
I didn't put the non-operating
income.

190
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,820
Let's say this cash isn't
generating anything.

191
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,570
So pre-tax income is 30,000,
if that's what

192
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,710
we're dealing with.

193
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,920
It's getting a little messy.

194
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,480
So then you have taxes.

195
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,390
Let's say it's 1/3.

196
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,380
It's 10,000 of taxes.

197
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,630
And then you have earnings.

198
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,090
   

199
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,409
30 minus 10 is 20,000.

200
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,250
So I suggested, what part of
this income statement is

201
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,059
dependent purely on this
piece right here?

202
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:45,450
   

203
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,180
Well all this stuff with
interest, that's

204
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,570
dependent on the debt.

205
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,810
And essentially taxes is also
dependent on the debt.

206
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,630
Because the more interest
you have, the more

207
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,500
you can deduct it.

208
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,980
And so all of this down
here is dependent on

209
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,300
your capital structure.

210
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,620
So if you wanted to look just
what the enterprise value is

211
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,810
generating, it's generating
the operating profit.

212
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,220
   

213
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,220
So I suggested that a pretty
good ratio, although this is

214
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,200
very non traditional.

215
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,050
It's not very not traditional,
but you don't

216
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,970
hear it said a lot.

217
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,730
I'd argue that you could look at
EV to operating profit as a

218
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,980
good metric.

219
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,300
   

220
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:36,550
Which in a lot of cases is the
inverse of the return on

221
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,200
assets, as I defined it
in the first video.

222
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,770
There's a lot of different
return on asset definitions.

223
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,350
But it's essentially saying, for
every dollar of operating

224
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,940
profit, how much are you paying
for the enterprise.

225
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,010
Which I think is a pretty
good metric.

226
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,340
Now, the more conventional
metric that you'll see when

227
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,100
you see people talk about
enterprise values, enterprise

228
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,370
value to EBITDA.

229
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,340
And if you go and get a job as
a research analyst at some

230
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,550
firm, this is going to be
something that you're going to

231
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,620
be expected to calculate
for a company.

232
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,410
And hopefully talk reasonably
intelligently about it.

233
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,080
So the first question, to talk
reasonably intelligently about

234
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,720
anything is, what is EBITDA?

235
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,460
So EBITDA is Earnings Before
Interest, Taxes, Depreciation

236
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,300
and Amortization.

237
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,560
So let's see what that
would be here.

238
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,890
So it's earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation

239
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,900
and amortization.

240
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,280
So it's before all
of this stuff.

241
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,920
Actually, let's compare that to

242
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,120
something we covered before.

243
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,370
So you have EBITDA.

244
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,280
   

245
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,660
And you have EBIT.

246
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,660
EBIT is Earnings Before
Interest and Taxes.

247
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,520
So EBIT is earnings.

248
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,240
You add back taxes and
interest. You're

249
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,350
at operating profit.

250
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,530
And I've gone over this in the
past, but the distinction

251
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,220
between operating profit and
EBIT is that EBIT might

252
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,080
include some non-operating
income, which

253
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,890
I haven't put here.

254
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,790
But if this cash was generating
some profit

255
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,740
unrelated to the operations
of the business, it'd

256
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,620
be included in EBIT.

257
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,810
It wouldn't be an operating
profit.

258
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,900
But they're usually pretty close
if we're talking about,

259
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,310
let's say, a non-financial
type of business.

260
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,370
So this is EBIT.

261
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,440
And if you want to get EBITDA,
you just add back the

262
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,670
depreciation and amortization.

263
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,310
So EBITDA would be here.

264
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,510
   

265
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,440
So the EBIT is 35,000.

266
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,380
If you add that back,
it would be 40,000.

267
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,510
So the EBITDA in this
case is 40.

268
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,360
And if my units are in
thousands, it's 40,000.

269
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,450
Now the question is, why do
people care about EBITDA?

270
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,710
Why is EBITDA used instead
of operating profit?

271
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,610
And the logic is that
depreciation and amortization,

272
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,040
and we did this in the
depreciation and amortization

273
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,860
videos, these are just
spread-out costs that

274
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,240
necessarily aren't cash going
out the door in this period.

275
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,390
We saw that this depreciation
and amortization.

276
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:01,120
Maybe this is, I bought
a $100 or $100,000

277
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,020
object 10 years ago.

278
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:09,250
And every year I depreciate
1/20 of it.

279
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,180
But the cash went out the
door 20 years ago.

280
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,220
And so this depreciation and
amortization in this period,

281
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,040
it isn't necessarily cash
out of the door.

282
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,350
In fact, it isn't cash
out the door.

283
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,190
We'll talk in future videos
about how do you find out what

284
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,390
the cash out the door
is in a period.

285
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,175
So it's considered a
non-cash expense.

286
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:27,210
   

287
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,580
So when you figure out EBITDA,
when you add back taxes, you

288
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,290
add back interest, and you
add back depreciation and

289
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,360
amortization.

290
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,820
What you're left with is
essentially, how much raw cash

291
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,925
is the enterprise
spitting out?

292
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,720
   

293
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,950
And a lot of people care about
this because this is an

294
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,510
indication of, one,
the company's

295
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,150
ability to do things.

296
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,010
To do things like pay its
interest, pay its taxes, or

297
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,630
invest in the business itself.

298
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:03,010
Or another way to view it is,
if you look at EV to EBITDA,

299
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,030
you're saying for every dollar
of raw cash that this

300
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,360
business spits out.

301
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,490
And let's say I were not to
reinvest in the business or

302
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,590
buy new equipment.

303
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,850
If it's just raw dollars, how
much am I paying for the

304
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,760
enterprise?

305
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,860
And a general rule of thumb, and
we'll do more on this in

306
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,290
the future.

307
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,210
I think I'm already well over my
regular time limit, is that

308
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:26,090
for a very, stable, simple,
non-declining non-growing

309
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,330
business, five times EBITDA is
considered a good valuation.

310
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,340
But what matters more is what
other companies in that

311
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,490
industry are trading at.

312
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,270
So all of these ratios
are better as

313
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,160
relative valuation metrics.

314
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,240
In the future I'll show you how
to do maybe a discounted

315
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,160
cash flow or a discounted free
cash flow type of analysis.

316
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,410
Or a dividend discount model or
something, so you can kind

317
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,890
of figure out an
absolute value.

318
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,830
But when you're looking in
public markets, when you're

319
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,330
picking to decide something,
you're also implicitly picking

320
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,650
not to buy other things.

321
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,690
When you're choosing to sell
something, you're also

322
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,800
implicitly choosing not
to sell other things.

323
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,110
So relative value starts to
matter a little bit more.

324
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,910
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
