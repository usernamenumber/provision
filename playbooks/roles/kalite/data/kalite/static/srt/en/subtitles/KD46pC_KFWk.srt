1
00:00:00,858 --> 00:00:04,590
The members of a distinguished committee were choosing a president

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,858
and each member gave one vote to one of the

3
00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:14,507
27 candidates. So each member gave one vote to one of the 27 candidates

4
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:16,340
so it looks like they all got at least one vote

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,275
For each candidate, the exact percentage of votes the candidate got

6
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:27,041
was smaller by at least 1 than the number of votes for that candidate.

7
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:30,590
Let me underline that. It's kind of a confusing statement.

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:37,040
For each candidate, the exact percentage of votes the candidate got

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,908
was smaller by at least one than the number of votes for that candidate.

10
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:47,757
was smaller by at least one than the number of votes for that candidate

11
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:53,576
What is the smallest possible number of members of the committe?

12
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:58,058
So, let's define some variables here. Maybe we can get our heads around this.

13
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,758
let's just say that "m" is equal to the number of members of the committee

14
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:10,610
members thats equal to members. and lets just think about each candidate

15
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,076
let's say that, we just have 27 candidates but lets just pick some arbitrary candidate "i"

16
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:17,592
so then "i" can be any number from 1-27.

17
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:18,975
any integer.

18
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:22,407
so, candidate "i." This sentence right here, let me write it in blue

19
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:33,891
since i underlined it in blue. Candidate C sub-"i" equals the number of votes for the "i"-th candidate

20
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:40,924
Now, let's see if we can do something with what i underlined.

21
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:43,876
The exact percentage of votes the candidate got was sma-

22
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:46,008
So lets just, the exact percentage of votes the candidate got would be

23
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:51,308
The votes he got (or she got) divided by the total number of members

24
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:54,158
Now, this will give you a decimal

25
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:57,221
If you want it as a percentage, if you want it as a percentage

26
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,325
you want to multiply it by 100

27
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:01,425
so times 100 so thats this part

28
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:04,241
the exact percentage of votes the candidate got

29
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,558
so, thats this right here

30
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:11,097
was smaller by at least 1 than the number of votes for that candidate

31
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:15,991
so smaller than- smaller by at least 1

32
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:19,426
so the number of votes for the candidate is "C" sub-"i"

33
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:24,659
and its smaller, its not less than or equal to the number of votes they got

34
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:25,559
its less--

35
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:30,042
its smaller than or -- its less than or equal to one less than the number of votes they got

36
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,459
at least one less

37
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,459
was smaller by at least one

38
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,225
so we're gonna put the minus 1 here

39
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:39,726
so this tells us that the percentage of votes that any candidate got

40
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:43,277
is less than the number of votes they got minus one

41
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:45,209
which is really what that sentence is saying

42
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,759
which is really the hardest part: understanding what that sentence is saying

43
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:52,709
Now what is the smallest possible number of members on the committee?

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now think about it, we want to minimize the number of members

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we really want to minimize, the number of votes that each candidate gets.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's just think about, the minimum number of votes,

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the minimum votes per candidate.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So can we have 0 votes for each candidate?

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well they tell us here, they say each member gave one vote to one of the 27 candidates,

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So everyone got at least 1 vote.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So no, we cannot have 0 votes.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Can we have 1 vote per candidate?

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It seems fair, that they each got at least 1 vote, but if we look over here,
