00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:03,704
Why does sweating cool you down?

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:06,774
That is an excellent question LeBron,

3
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:11,345
and to answer it, let's zoom in on a little droplet of sweat.

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:15,583
And sweat is mostly water, so when we zoom in, and we've really zoomed in,

5
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,083
even more than I've drawn over here.

6
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:21,288
When we really zoom in, we'll start seeing mainly these water molecules.

7
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,757
And the water molecules, just to be a little more accurate,

8
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:29,964
I've drawn the oxygen in blue, and then the hydrogens that are bonded with that oxygen I've done in white.

9
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:36,961
We all know that water is sometimes refered to as H2 -- that's for the two hydrogens -- H20.

10
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:42,009
So each of these are a molecule of H20, or a molecule of water.

11
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:47,348
What I've drawn down here, and this is an oversimplification of the molecules of your skin,

12
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:52,620
but just for simplification, these are molecules of your skin.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,856
really, the parts of the skin cells. These aren't even the skin cells themselves,

14
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,692
these are the molecules that make up the skin cells.

15
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:05,927
And right over here, these are molecules of sweat, or it's really just molecules of water.

16
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:10,504
So the question of why does sweat cool you down could really be restated as:

17
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:15,476
Why does having water on the surface of your skin actually cool you down?

18
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,445
And to answer that, or to think about that question,

19
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:22,516
we have to think about what it means to have temperature, or what temperature even really means.

20
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:28,756
Temperature, what we perceive as temperature, is really just the motion of the molecules of something.

21
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,126
So higher temperature means that they're moving around more.

22
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:36,630
So high temperature they're moving around more, and low temperature they're moving around less.

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,332
And they can move around in different ways,

24
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:42,670
they can have translational motion, which is they're actually moving around.

25
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,540
They could be vibrating. They could be rotating in some way.

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:53,981
And in general, on average, the more of this motional energy, often referred to as kinetic energy,

27
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:58,986
that these molecules have on average, the higher the perceived temperature would be.

28
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:03,457
Now, how does having this water here cool down the skin?

29
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,726
And well, first of all, why is the skin warming up?

30
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:09,275
Because the muscles are doing all of this work. They're releasing heat.

31
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:11,811
That heat is being transferred to the skin.

32
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:15,336
But then how does having this water here help?

33
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:19,506
Well, the skin has a certain temperature, a certain kinetic energy, or motional energy.

34
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:25,579
But when we say that it doesn't mean that all of these molecules have the exact same motion.

35
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:32,739
The temperature is the average motion. Some of these are bumping around at a faster speed.

36
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,856
Or vibrating at a faster speed, or rotating at a faster speed

37
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,025
Some are doing it at a slower speed.

38
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:43,130
But as these bump around, they're going to bump into these water molecules and get them moving around.

39
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,133
They would probably be moving around a little bit to begin with,

40
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:50,037
but then the warmer this is, the more energy here, they'll bump into these molecules.

41
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,941
So let's say this guy bumps into that, then he'll bump over there ,

42
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:58,011
so that energy, this bumping energy, or this kinetic energy,

43
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,848
well, some of it will be transferred, or you could even say some of that temperature,

44
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:06,372
some of that heat will be transferred to these water molecules.

45
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:11,358
But the important thing to remember is this is a really kind of crazy thing, they're all bumping into eachother

46
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,061
and rotating in all sorts of crazy ways.

47
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:18,098
They will have an average kinetic energy, which we perceive as temperature,

48
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:22,970
but this one might be going really, really, really fast in that direction,

49
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,839
while this one might be going really, really, really slow,

50
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,276
this one might be going really really really fast in that direction

51
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:33,147
this one might be going really slow in this direction

52
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:41,193
So the thing to think about is, given that you have all of this variation in the energy of each of these articles,

53
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:46,059
which of these are most likely to escape, to actually evaporate?

54
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,663
And to think about evaporation, you just have to think about that most water molecules

55
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,232
or the water molecules that are in that droplet

56
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,640
they do have an attraction to eachother, we call those hydrogen bonds.

57
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,274
They do have an attraction to eachother,

58
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,543
that's why a droplet kind of sticks together.

59
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:07,347
But if one of these molecules is moving fast enough and if it's moving in the right direction

60
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,684
it has a higher probability of being able to escape,

61
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,287
being able to actually escape that droplet.

62
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:18,592
And the process of these molecules actually escaping, that's what we refer to as evaporation.

63
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:24,965
If a molecule has enough energy it will escape this, escape the bonds of the other water molecules,

64
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:31,538
and just evaporate into the air.

65
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,041
But we still haven't fully answered our question.

66
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:38,078
So let's say that this is one that has evaporated, it has fully escaped.

67
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:42,583
Why would that actually cool down this entire system?

68
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:49,556
Why would it cool down the droplet and essentially give it more capability to accept more energy from the skin?

69
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:55,229
Well, we just said the ones that have the highest energy are the ones that are most likely to escape,

70
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,098
the ones that have the highest kinetic energy.

71
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:02,402
So if you have a bunch of stuff, some are fast, some are slow, some are vibrating a lot, vibrating less

72
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:08,942
but the ones that have a high kinetic energy are the most likely to escape, what happens when they escape?

73
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,879
Well then the average kinetic energy will go down.

74
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,985
Or you could say the temperature would go down,

75
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:24,024
which is really just the average amount of motion or kinetic energy that's in this droplet.

76
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:28,529
If the really fast ones, the ones with a lot of energy, are leaving, then the ones are left over, on average,

77
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:33,000
are going to have a lower kinetic energy, or a lower temperature.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,172
And so that is what is cooling you down at a molecular level.
