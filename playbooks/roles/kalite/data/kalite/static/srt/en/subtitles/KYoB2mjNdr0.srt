1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,630
We finished the last video
with the Reign of Terror –

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:17,940
which lasted essentially from
April of 1793 to July of 1794 –

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,691
where Robespierre himself got
the losing end of the guillotine.

4
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:27,509
So it looks like France was done
with the low point of the Revolution.

5
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:30,941
And that is true – especially from the 
point of view of the French people.

6
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:36,530
Then we go into 1795.

7
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,210
France is doing well
in its wars with

8
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,830
essentially the rest of Europe.

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,575
And peace is declared with
Prussia and Spain.

10
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:52,010
(WRITING: Peace with Prussia and Spain.)

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,720
So the only two major
enemies left are

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,710
Great Britain and Austria.

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,590
So slowly, France is dealing
with its enemies.

14
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,130
And this was essentially
a victory for France.

15
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:08,480
So France is victorious, with
this huge citizen

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,290
army that it created.

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,440
And then this was in
April of 1795.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,515
And then in August of 1795 – let
me do that in a different color –

19
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:30,443
in August of 1795, the new republic 
constitution gets approved.

20
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:33,691
And it gets ratified through
a vote of the people –

21
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:41,710
(WRITING)

22
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,160
– which makes France 
officially a republic.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,430
They don't need kings anymore.

24
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,580
And it set up a governing
structure where the executive

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,940
was essentially this group
five directors.

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,900
So the executive is called
the Directory.

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,841
So you didn't have one president –
you had five directors.

28
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:05,250
And then the legislature – 
(And this was significant, because

29
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,070
this was the first bicameral
legislature for France.)

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,920
– it had two houses.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,170
It had the Council of 500, which
is analogous to the U.S.

32
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,095
House of Representatives.

33
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:19,740
It had 500 members in it,
500 representatives.

34
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,600
Let me write that down.

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,520
It was by bicameral.

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,000
It had two houses, just like
the U.S. Congress.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,480
So it's Council of 500.

38
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:35,640
And then you had your Counsel
of Elders, which had 250

39
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,400
representatives.

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,730
And that, if you want to view it
from a U.S. point of view,

41
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,420
that was analogous to
the U.S. Senate.

42
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,420
And the Directory, the
directors, the candidates were

43
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,520
submitted by the Council of
500 to the Council of

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,870
Elders, who then picked the
five directors-- the five

45
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,870
people who would essentially
be the executive in France.

46
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,480
Already, things are looking
really well.

47
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,770
But, even though they had the
military victories, there was

48
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,910
still a lot of unrest.

49
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,450
You still had Royalist
out there.

50
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,870
You still had Great Britain
causing trouble.

51
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,020
Great Britain was attacking the
western regions of France.

52
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,560
There were Royalists
throughout Paris.

53
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:28,850
And then, in October of 1795,
there was a Royalist uprising.

54
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,130
And Royalists are the
people who wanted to

55
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,420
bring back the crown.

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,900
Or they were against the
revolutionary government.

57
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,900
And to a large degree, they
weren't just upset about the

58
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,590
fact that the royalty is gone.

59
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,910
There were also upset
that they were

60
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,690
excluded from the Directory.

61
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,330
So it excluded the Royalists.

62
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,020
So before the Directory could
even form in any major way,

63
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,790
you had a Royalist uprising
in Paris.

64
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,510
Royalist uprising in Paris.

65
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,530
And they stormed
the Tuileries.

66
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,940
This is the same place that you
might remember earlier on,

67
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,190
a couple of videos ago, where
the King and Queen were in

68
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,100
house arrest. And later, they
were assaulted by the

69
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,360
revolutionary government.

70
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,120
That was this painting
right here.

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,600
This was only three years ago.

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
This was in 1792 and this is
when they actually took the

73
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,660
King and Queen prisoner.

74
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,690
And then they executed
Louis XVI only a few

75
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,040
months after that.

76
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,500
So now it was on
the other way.

77
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,950
Instead of the royalty being
in the Tuileries, and being

78
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,020
sieged by the revolutionaries,
the revolutionary government

79
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,720
was in the Tuileries and it was
being sieged by Royalists.

80
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,940
And actually, the situation
did not look good for the

81
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,030
revolutionary government.

82
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,470
They were out numbered.

83
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,075
It looked like the Royalists
had better numbers.

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,980
But lucky for the revolutionary
government,

85
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:52,830
there was a young, very
ambitious, very egotistical,

86
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,300
military captain at this point,
who had observed the

87
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,470
Siege of the Tuileries when
Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette

88
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,420
were captured.

89
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,830
And back then, he made
a mental note.

90
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,030
He said, they would have been
able to stop the siege if only

91
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,080
they had good artillery.

92
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,860
Remember, he was an
artillery captain.

93
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,900
That's where he first
became famous.

94
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,520
In the Siege of Toulon he was
able to use artillery

95
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,680
effectively to suppress
a rebellion.

96
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,850
So he was actually observing
this scene three years later.

97
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,450
And now, in 1795, as the
revolutionary government is in

98
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,110
the Tuileries and the Royalists
are about to

99
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,750
essentially take it over,
Napoleon, using what he

100
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,070
learned when he observed the
first time, he was able to

101
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,460
place cannons and artillery
in such a way.

102
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,750
And he shot what they
call grapeshot.

103
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,240
And it's essentially like a
shotgun coming out of a canon.

104
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,410
And even though they were
significantly outnumbered by

105
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,270
the Royalists, he was
essentially able to mow them

106
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,240
down with the canons.

107
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,620
So even though you had
more numbers, you

108
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,840
had all these cannons.

109
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,780
Let me draw one.

110
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,560
You had a canon and the actual
ammunition would have these

111
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,470
little pellets.

112
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,290
That's why it was called
grapeshot, it looked like a

113
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,670
bundle of grapes.

114
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,080
And when you shot it out, it
would go in every direction.

115
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,850
So you could imagine, it would
just mow down whoever is in

116
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,150
the way of the canon.

117
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,160
And so essentially, Napoleon
was able to save the

118
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,660
revolutionary government.

119
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,630
And allow the actual Directory
to come to power.

120
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,370
So this once again, Napoleon was
in the right place at the

121
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:24,790
right time.

122
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,740
And he was very competent
at military tactics.

123
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,330
By all measure he was
egotistical, he was narcisistic,

124
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,350
but the dude knew what
he was doing.

125
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,350
And so Napoleon becomes
even more famous.

126
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,540
This event, October 5, 1795
where Napoleon is able to

127
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,276
defend the revolutionary
government, this is know as

128
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:48,880
13 Vendemiaire.

129
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,180
I know I'm saying it wrong.

130
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,310
But once again, this was the
month of October in the new

131
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,580
French Revolutionary Calendar.

132
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:03,690
But it made Napoleon even more
of a national hero, or even

133
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,040
revolutionary hero.

134
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,320
People are starting to realize
that this guy, he definitely

135
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,220
knows what he's doing.

136
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,390
But you could imagine at the
same time, the Directory

137
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,790
really didn't like this dude
hanging around too close to

138
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,650
the seats of power.

139
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,110
He was obviously ambitious.

140
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,100
He was obviously competent.

141
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,180
And at some point, he
might be a threat

142
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,140
himself to the Directory.

143
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,030
So they gave him power.

144
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,620
But they made sure that he
was far away from France.

145
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,570
So he was essentially
put in charge of the

146
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,420
campaign into Italy.

147
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,410
So Napoleon gets put in charge.

148
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,800
Remember, we're still fighting
Austria and Great Britain.

149
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,810
So we're fighting Austria
in Italy.

150
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,710
And Napoleon is made a Commander
in Chief of the

151
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,390
Italian forces.

152
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,010
And he's tremendously
successful.

153
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,630
This was kind of the least
important front of the war

154
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,170
with Austria at this point.

155
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,620
But out of all of the generals
of the different fronts,

156
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,010
Napoleon is the one that
proves himself to be

157
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,650
tremendously innovative
and tactical and an

158
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,820
all-route good general.

159
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,700
So this Napoleon kicking
butt in Italy.

160
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,330
Napoleon in Italy.

161
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,940
So once again, he becomes
even more famous,

162
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,850
even more well known.

163
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:28,010
Eventually, Austria admits that
hey gee, we're not going

164
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,300
to beat the French anymore.

165
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,780
They're really taking care
of us quite well.

166
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:43,370
And they make peace with the
French in October of 1797.

167
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,890
The Italian campaign
occurred in 1796.

168
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,350
So he defended the
revolutionary

169
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,890
government in 1795.

170
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,320
He kicks butt in
1796 in Italy.

171
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,330
In 1797 there's peace
with Austria.

172
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,740
So you only have Great
Britain left.

173
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,150
But this peace with Austria
is actually

174
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,400
going to be very temporary.

175
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,015
This is from the Treaty
of Campo-Formio.

176
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:12,265
Let me write that down.

177
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,090
And once again, this was
peace with Austria.

178
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,160
But France was the victor.

179
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,040
So this is another
French victory.

180
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,610
And the only real enemy left
was Great Britain.

181
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,530
But the main problem was that
Great Britain had the dominant

182
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,170
navy in the world at the time.

183
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,500
So France, and especially
Napoleon, wasn't in a position

184
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,030
to confront Great Britain
on the water.

185
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,660
And this was kind of a
controversial decision.

186
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,070
In 1798-- and remember, the
Directory really didn't want

187
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,470
Napoleon hanging
around France.

188
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,490
They're like OK, you're hugely
popular, you're a good

189
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,460
general, you're a
great general.

190
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,690
You go do what you want.

191
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,920
Whatever you think is proper.

192
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,080
So Napoleon gets it into his
head to attack Egypt.

193
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,090
And people aren't 100% sure what
was the main strategic

194
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,090
goal of attacking Egypt.

195
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,140
So in 1798, he leaves
from Toulon.

196
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,450
Remember Toulon was the port
that he helped suppress.

197
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,200
He leaves from Toulon, he takes
Malta along the way.

198
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,510
And then eventually, he
arrives in Egypt to

199
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,730
essentially take over Egypt.

200
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,770
And people believe that his
desire to take over Egypt was

201
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,730
essentially to, at some
point, undermine

202
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,720
the British in India.

203
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,520
He'd maybe make some Muslim
allies in Egypt and then maybe

204
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,710
befriend some of the Muslim
insurgents, if you will.

205
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,240
Especially they were talking
about Tipu Sultan, who he

206
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,660
wanted to meet up with and
maybe help undermine the

207
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,150
British in India.

208
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,290
But people aren't quite sure.

209
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,230
It might have been just Napoleon
having some visions

210
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,500
of grandeur.

211
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,130
And he wanted to go to Egypt
because Egypt was a formerly

212
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,480
great empire.

213
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,600
So in 1798, Napoleon
goes to Egypt.

214
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,050
These are paintings
of him in Egypt.

215
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,780
And once again, he was able to
kind of route the Mamluk

216
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,680
forces who are in power
at the time in Egypt.

217
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,330
This is the Battle
of the Pyramids.

218
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,610
Once again, Napoleon is
hugely successful.

219
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,800
Except for one problem.

220
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,390
He brings his 20,000 troops into
Egypt, obviously by ship.

221
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,150
They're sitting here, they're
kicking butt in Egypt.

222
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,050
But they're still at war
with the British.

223
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,130
So what the British do, with
their dominant Navy, they send

224
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,760
Horatio Nelson in charge
of a fleet.

225
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,800
And he comes here where the
French Navy was parked.

226
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,630
And he just destroys them.

227
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,580
So Horatio Nelson destroys
the French fleet in the

228
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,700
Battle of the Nile.

229
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,520
And this is a depiction.

230
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,100
This is Horatio Nelson
right here.

231
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:05,210
This is a depiction of the
Battle of the Nile, which

232
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,040
essentially strands Napoleon's
20,000-person army.

233
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,010
They're stuck in Egypt.

234
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,440
So not knowing what else to do--
they can't leave with all

235
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,670
of their forces-- Napoleon
then goes into

236
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,340
Damascus and Syria.

237
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,950
And then he causes all sorts
of havoc in raping and

238
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,420
pillaging and whatnot.

239
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,850
But still that kind of begs the
question of, how are they

240
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,740
going to get back?

241
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,620
And you could imagine, for
someone as ambitious and

242
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,380
egotistical as Napoleon, he
didn't really care a lot about

243
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,230
what happened to his troops.

244
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:43,680
And so when an opportunity
arose in 1799, he left.

245
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,050
He left his entire army.

246
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,970
This gives you a lot of view
into Napoleon's character,

247
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,170
that he was willing to leave his
entire army in Egypt and

248
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,235
in Syria to essentially be left
to die at the hands of

249
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:58,935
the Ottomans.

250
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:03,460
And then he sneaks his
way back to France.

251
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,160
So in 1799, Napoleon goes
back to France.

252
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,170
Let me write this down.

253
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,110
And once he gets back there, he
sees that the Directory is

254
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,870
unbelievably unpopular.

255
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,180
And the main reason is the
reason that every government

256
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,080
in France throughout this whole
series of videos has

257
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,010
been unpopular.

258
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,640
People are still hungry.

259
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,770
France is still poor.

260
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,960
Notice in everything I've talked
about, in all of these

261
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,590
videos, we still haven't
addressed the issue that

262
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,470
France is essentially broke
and that people are still

263
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,150
going hungry.

264
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,440
So throughout all of the
violence, all of the wars, the

265
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,810
Directory is hugely unpopular.

266
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,690
And then a few of the directors,
two in particular,

267
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,650
actually three of the directors,
want to plot with

268
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,190
Napoleon, who was
hugely popular.

269
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,190
And they essentially
plan a coup.

270
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,100
And the way that they allow
themselves to come to power is

271
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,370
they resign.

272
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,480
And then they tell the
legislature that's meeting at

273
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,970
the Tuileries, hey, there's
a Jacobian revolt

274
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,200
and you're in danger.

275
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,320
Why don't you go to this
estate west of Paris.

276
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,450
So that's Paris, where
they normally meet.

277
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,260
They tell them to go to an
estate west of Paris.

278
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,960
So the legislature goes
here to this estate.

279
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,710
And you'll be protected
by Napoleon.

280
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,580
And they're protected by
Napoleon and his army.

281
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,410
Now once they're there, Napoleon
goes in and starts

282
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,440
making these speeches about
you guys being essentially

283
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,190
illegitimate.

284
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,230
And he looks like he really
wants to take power.

285
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,250
And they just jostle him
out of the room.

286
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,230
But once he gets jostled out
of the room, his brother

287
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,420
points to the bruises
on Napoleon.

288
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,000
He tells the guards outside of
where the legislature is

289
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,840
meeting, hey those
guys in there,

290
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,150
they're becoming violent.

291
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,490
You have to go in there
and take order.

292
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,560
So that convinces
the military.

293
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,370
And they go in and they
essentially dissolve the

294
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,890
Council of 500.

295
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,930
So essentially, you've dissolved
the legislature,

296
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,660
Napoleon is in charge of the
military that dissolved the

297
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,470
legislature.

298
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,220
And so that allowed Napoleon
and two of the plotting

299
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,000
directors to take power.

300
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,170
They became the three
consuls of France.

301
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,950
They form the Consulate, or the
new executive of France.

302
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,940
And very shortly they'll have
their own constitution.

303
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,650
But this really marks the point
where Napoleon takes

304
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,910
power of France.

305
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,500
Because even though he took
power with these other two

306
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,330
dudes, he eventually is able to
scheme his way to be called

307
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,580
First Consul.

308
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,630
At which point he is the
authoritarian ruler of France.

309
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,540
So we've gone from, over the
course of the French

310
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:28,730
Revolution, from 1789 where we
had an absolute monarch in

311
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:34,620
Louis XVI, now we go all the way
to 1799, 10 years later,

312
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,280
after all of this bloodshed,
after multiple revolutions and

313
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,170
counter revolutions.

314
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,880
We end up with Napoleon,
essentially being

315
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,860
in charge of France.
