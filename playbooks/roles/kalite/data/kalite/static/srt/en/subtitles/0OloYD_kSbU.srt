1
00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:08,771
I think it's important [that] people look at art,

2
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:11,305
because we live in a visual world.

3
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:14,671
And understanding, and looking at,

4
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:17,591
and thinking about the way images communicate –

5
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:19,022
in all kinds of ways –

6
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:22,913
is important to being alive today.

7
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:25,609
If one has heightened visual acumen –

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,938
which you get from spending time looking at things –

9
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:31,538
whether it's looking at newspaper photos closely

10
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:33,455
or looking at works in a museum

11
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:36,948
or looking at your surroundings – or birds – more closely,

12
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:39,525
that sort of attention to an environment

13
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:40,885
makes you a better person.

14
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:46,185
You are existing in a more aware, alert, present space.

15
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:47,579
Sometimes people think that

16
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,261
the only way of looking at art is

17
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,353
going to museum constantly – at places like that.

18
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:53,298
But, maybe sometimes, art is everywhere –

19
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:55,389
in the street – if you look at architecture,

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,455
places, or everything.

21
00:00:56,455 --> 00:00:59,038
So, you really don't need to go to a museum to see art.

22
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:01,681
It could be anywhere – in a park, or

23
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:03,863
looking at buildings, or going to the movies.

24
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,564
So I think that [art's] in everyday life.

25
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:07,556
It's all about noticing, for me.

26
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:11,706
It's all about trying to see beyond the first impression.

27
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:13,537
People look at art and they say,

28
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:15,921
"I like this. I don't like this." And they move on.

29
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:17,155
They have predetermined notions.

30
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:19,311
But if you can stop, and take a breath,

31
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:21,337
and look a little deeper at something,

32
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,179
you can really start to notice some kind of detail

33
00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:24,509
that you might have not noticed before.

34
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:25,867
And I think that that skill applies

35
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:27,800
to so many things in life – aside from art.

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,705
About being able just to slow down

37
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:32,172
and be aware of where, actually – where you're standing –

38
00:01:32,172 --> 00:01:34,022
and just even stop talking.

39
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:36,342
And just, maybe, open up your ears, for example.

40
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:39,071
There's so much detail around that you can absorb,

41
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:41,126
if you really just take a moment

42
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:44,291
and just let it come in – and listen.
