1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
Sal: In the last video, we
learned that if you just leave

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,470
water to itself,
it autoionizes.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,320
So let me see.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,330
I have 2 molecules of water.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,420
There's some probability, and
it's an equilibrium, that one

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,520
of the hydrogens on one of the
waters bumps off and just

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,760
joins the other one.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,880
So you could end up with
a hydronium ion.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,460
It's an ion because it has
an extra hydrogen.

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,110
So I'll put a plus
charge there.

11
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,230
And obviously, everything
you hear is

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,340
in an aqueous solution.

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,440
I could write aqueous
everywhere.

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,025
aq.

15
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:31,320
I could write aq.

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,700
It's kind of obvious.

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,720
Water is obviously an
aqueous solution.

18
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,070
It's obviously dissolved
in water.

19
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,010
And then plus a hydroxide ion.

20
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,300
This is the water molecule that
lost its hydrogen atom,

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,370
or its proton.

22
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,930
Because we know that a hydrogen
atom-- or at least a

23
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,640
hydrogen ion-- if you get rid of
its electron, all you have

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,810
left is a proton.

25
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,490
And that's also in an
aqueous solution.

26
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,030
And we learned that people
really care--

27
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,370
We learned about
the equilibrium

28
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,720
constant of this reaction.

29
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,250
And we also learned that people
really care about the

30
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,569
concentration of this
right here.

31
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,230
Of the hydronium.

32
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,720
Or sometimes -- and let me write this again.

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
And I went over this
in the last video.

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,140
But sometimes the same exact
autoionization reaction will

35
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,710
be written like this.

36
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:22,110
H2O, disassociating in itself,
really, into a hydrogen ion in

37
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,570
an aqueous solution plus a
hydroxide anion in an aqueous

38
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,700
solution or a negative ion.

39
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,540
These are the same thing, and
I write it this way because

40
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,200
this is actually the
state that happens.

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,450
That you don't actually have
these protons just

42
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,760
independently, they actually
do join onto another water

43
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,470
molecule and form
a hydronium ion.

44
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,630
But these are the same
exact concept.

45
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,530
But we learned in the last video
that people really care

46
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,750
about the concentration
of-- you could pick

47
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,420
one of these two.

48
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,250
They normally write this
one, right here.

49
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,550
So people really care about
the concentration of hydrogen

50
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,380
of your hydrogen ions.

51
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,180
And we learned in the last video
that just pure water at

52
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,060
25 degrees Celsius, which
is room temperature.

53
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,750
So let me write that.

54
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,830
At 25 degrees Celsius.

55
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,700
The concentration of your
hydrogen protons-- because

56
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,840
that's really what they are,
or hydrogen ions-- is 10 to

57
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,360
the minus 7 molars.

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,110
And then we even said, hey,
chemists, for whatever reason,

59
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,010
don't like dealing with
negative exponents.

60
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:35,770
So they defined the pH as equal
to the minus log base 10

61
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,020
of your hydrogen
concentration.

62
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,330
of your hydrogen concentration

63
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:47,540
And of course, that's equal to
minus log base 10 of 10 to the

64
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:54,550
minus 7 for pure water, at 25
degrees, which is equal to 7.

65
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,730
Fair enough.

66
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,670
And you can probably imagine, if
people took the trouble of

67
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,350
constructing this pH thing and
saying it's the negative log,

68
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,580
they must really care about
what the hydrogen

69
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,090
concentration of water is.

70
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,670
And it does matter to-- in a
whole bunch of-- especially

71
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,430
actually biological systems--
all the time, people worry

72
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,920
about the pH of this or that.

73
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,540
And obviously I talked
in the last video

74
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,270
about pH-balanced cosmetics.

75
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,920
All sorts of bad things might
happen to your skin if the pH

76
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,660
of the cosmetic is different
than your skin.

77
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,240
I don't know if that's a fact,
but I guess that's the that's

78
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,150
the theory behind it.

79
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,490
So there's obviously things in
the world that change the

80
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,940
hydrogen concentration.

81
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,630
That change this
concentration.

82
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,640
So, when we learned about Le
Chatelier's Principle, we said

83
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,910
hey, maybe if we add more
hydrogen on this side, the

84
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,620
equilibrium will change and this
concentration will go up.

85
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,270
And so we have more hydrogen
concentration.

86
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,160
I guess on the other side, you
could add more hydroxide and

87
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,670
then you would have more OH
concentration, and maybe a

88
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,220
little less hydrogen
concentration.

89
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,700
So if you if you care about
things that are going to do

90
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,260
that to this reaction,
you probably want to

91
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,790
have a name for them.

92
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,350
And the name for them
is acids and bases.

93
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,260
And I'm sure you've heard both
of these words before.

94
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,850
So, acids -- let me write
them both down.

95
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,920
Acid and base.

96
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,224
Now.

97
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:23,155
Just to over-complicate your
life a little bit more, there

98
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:26,010
are actually multiple
definitions of an acid and

99
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,450
multiple definitions
of a base.

100
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,940
And they kind of become
more and more broad

101
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,720
in what they imply.

102
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,870
The definition that you're
probably going to use the

103
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,750
most-- the definition that I
always use in my head whenever

104
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,760
someone says an acid-- is
it increases hydrogen

105
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,900
concentration when you
place it in water.

106
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,710
in water.

107
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:56,940
And a base is something that
increases your hydroxide

108
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,950
concentration in water.

109
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,010
This is the definition that
you're probably going to see

110
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,680
in 90%-- especially in a first
year chemistry class.

111
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,410
And this is called the Arrhenius
acid or base.

112
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,050
I hope I get his
spelling right.

113
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,200
You should never take any
of the my spelling

114
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,860
words at face value.

115
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,210
You should look them up because
I'm clearly not a

116
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,500
master speller.

117
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,130
Arrhenius.

118
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,230
Arrhenius, with an H.

119
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,150
These are Arrhenius acid,
Arrhenius base.

120
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,940
So for example -- if I were to take --

121
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,190
Let me give you an example.

122
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,340
If I were to take some...

123
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,280
If I were to take some
hydrochloric acid-- that's

124
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,150
actually what it's called, but
you could say hydrogen

125
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,840
chloride-- in an aqueous
solution.

126
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,140
It actually disassociates
completely.

127
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,830
This is not an equilibrium
reaction.

128
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,130
So let me put it in
this nice-- let me

129
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,610
use a bolder color.

130
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,000
This nice one-way arrow, which
says, hey, this isn't one of

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,780
these wishy-washy reactions that
go in both directions.

132
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,965
This is a strong acid.

133
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:05,740
It completely disassociates in
water into-- let me put the

134
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,010
hydrogen in a different color.

135
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,210
It completely disassociates in
water into a hydrogen ion.

136
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:20,440
An aqueous solution
plus chloride.

137
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,000
So it's just a chloride
negative ion

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,050
in an aqueous solution.

139
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,070
And they just float in there.

140
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,410
So you could imagine if you
place hydrogen chloride in

141
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,470
water, you're going to increase
its overall hydrogen

142
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,450
concentration.

143
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,560
And the same exact reaction
could have been

144
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,760
written like this.

145
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,570
Just to hit the point home.

146
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:45,510
Hydrogen chloride in an
aqueous solution.

147
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,504
And then you can say plus
h-- let me do it

148
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:50,420
in a different color.

149
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,085
Plus H2O.

150
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:55,690
It's a one-way reaction.

151
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,750
It's a one-way reaction.

152
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,106
And then you end up with, and
I think you understand.

153
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:05,940
You have H--

154
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,460
Obviously not all 3 of them
are-- H3O, that's too dark.

155
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,220
H3O plus-- it donated
its hydrogen proton

156
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,390
to this water molecule.

157
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,610
And then you have plus
the chloride anion

158
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,690
in an aqueous solution.

159
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,560
And these acids that completely
disassociate-- in

160
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,140
future videos, we're going to
look at ones that are a little

161
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,150
bit more wishy-washy.

162
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,220
That don't completely
diaassociate.

163
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,930
But these acids that completely
disassociate are

164
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,300
called strong acids.

165
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,170
And strong isn't just
a nice word

166
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,100
that they use in chemistry.

167
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,770
It literally means-- when
someone says a strong acid,

168
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,000
something that completely
disassociates into water.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,310
It's a one-way reaction.

170
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,340
And all of a strong acids-- you
could probably even guess

171
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,020
based on their chemical
make-up.

172
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,830
But hydrochloric acid
is one of them.

173
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,190
You also have hydrogen
bromide.

174
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,330
Another strong acid.

175
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,680
Hydrogen iodide.

176
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,260
Hydrogen Iodide.

177
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,380
You have nitric acid.

178
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,300
I think I showed you that
in a previous--

179
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,090
All of these, when you when you
put them into water, this

180
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,910
little h is going to pop off.

181
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,490
They join another water molecule,
form hydronium.

182
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,070
And then this molecule right
here, in these cases-- well,

183
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,160
in the case of chloride--
these are halogens.

184
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,260
But they're going to go and
form negative ions.

185
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,250
Whatever's left over.

186
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,320
Nitric acid.

187
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,049
Then you have sulfuric acid.

188
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,230
You've probably heard of that.

189
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,870
Very strong acid.

190
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,820
Sulfuric acid and then
perchloric acid.

191
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,370
These are the strong acids.

192
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,330
O4.

193
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,660
And these are good to know,
because if you see them on a

194
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,590
chemistry exam, you know that
these are going to completely

195
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,480
disassociate.

196
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,710
And remember, we keep using
this word acid.

197
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,830
What does acid mean?

198
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,650
It means that these
are strong acids.

199
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,530
These completely disassociate.

200
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,990
If you like Arrhenius's
definition of what an acid is,

201
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,860
they increase your hydrogen
concentration.

202
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,730
Because obviously when you throw
this in some water, all

203
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,320
of these new hydronium ions are
going to be formed, and

204
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
they're going to overall
increase your

205
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,580
concentration of them.

206
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,650
And that's why they're
called an acid.

207
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,720
And now if you went on the
strong base side, by

208
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,350
Arrhenius's definition, the base
is something that creates

209
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,760
hydroxide ions, or
anions in water.

210
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,130
So pretty much anything - If you look at the periodic
table, any of your group 1

211
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,230
elements, and group 1 elements
are your alkali earth metals.

212
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,880
Your alkali earth metals are
bonded with hydroxide.

213
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,990
If you put them in water,
the hydroxide pops off.

214
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,130
So let me just-- I'll show it
with lithium or sodium.

215
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,030
So for example, these
are strong bases.

216
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:06,750
So if I take some lithium
hydroxide

217
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,060
in an aqueous solution.

218
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,080
aqueous solution.

219
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,290
This completely disassociates.

220
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,490
No equilibrium here.

221
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,100
This is a strong base.

222
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,790
So what's it going to
disassociate to?

223
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,990
Well the little hydroxide
ion is going to pop off.

224
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,010
That's going to be a minus.

225
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,850
It's in water still.

226
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:36,170
Plus a lithium ion.

227
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,300
Right there.

228
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,320
So this will always disassociate
in water.

229
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,085
The same thing is if
you have sodium.

230
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:47,270
If you have sodium...

231
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,910
Sodium's going to do
the same thing.

232
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,830
Sodium hydroxide in an
aqueous solution.

233
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,860
One-way reaction.

234
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:00,950
You produce hydroxide and
some sodium cations.

235
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,040
And so you imagine, when you
put these in water, this

236
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,400
concentration is
going to go up.

237
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,960
It's just like what we did in
Le Chetalier's Principal.

238
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,720
Where we said, oh, what if you
add some of this or some of

239
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
that to an equilibrium
reaction.

240
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,980
Well, how do you add it?

241
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,290
Well, in this case, you
can add a strong

242
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,200
acid or a strong base.

243
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Now, everything I've done so
far-- this is the Arrhenius

244
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,760
definition-- where an acid
increases your hydrogen

245
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,130
concentration, a base increases
your hydroxide

246
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,480
concentration.

247
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,680
Now that is what you're going
to see 90% of the time.

248
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,410
But there is a slightly broader
definition out there.

249
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,930
And I don't know the correct--
I always say

250
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,640
just Bronsted, but.

251
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,840
If you don't have fancy fonts,
it's spelled like this.

252
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:50,720
Bronsted-Lowry acid or base.

253
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
If you if you have good fonts,
there's usually this little

254
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,480
cross at the o.

255
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,130
So I don't know.

256
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,060
Well, Bronsted-Lowry acid.

257
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,480
And all of these would also
be Bronsted-Lowry acid.

258
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,810
But the broadening of the
definition is an acid is a

259
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,060
proton donor.

260
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,450
Proton donor.

261
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:22,630
And a base is a proton
acceptor.

262
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,290
So let's look at this definition
in the context of

263
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,720
everything we've just
done so far.

264
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,370
So if you live by the
Bronsted-Lowry definition,

265
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,310
what is a proton donor here?

266
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,070
Well, this hydrochloric acid
is-- let me look at this

267
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,390
reaction right here.

268
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,600
This hydrochloric acid is
donating a proton to this

269
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,980
water molecule, right?

270
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,510
A hydrogen atom is
just a proton.

271
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,300
That's an important thing to
remember, because it had-- a

272
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,250
hydrogen ion.

273
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,700
Because if you get rid of its
electron, it has no neutron.

274
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,300
It's just a proton
sitting in space.

275
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,650
So this hydrochloric acid is
donating a proton to this

276
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,560
water molecule to make a
hydronium molecule, and it

277
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,490
gave it away.

278
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,050
So this is a Bronsted-Lowry
acid as well.

279
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,190
Just as it was an
Arrhenius acid.

280
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,120
Let's see the Bronsted-Lowry
version of a base.

281
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,500
OK.

282
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,870
A base is someone who--
proton acceptor.

283
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,820
So this guy, he had this nice
little relationship with this

284
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,050
hydroxide ion.

285
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,380
The hydroxide ion got
disassociated, and it becomes

286
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,750
a little bit fungible
right here.

287
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,450
You can kind of say hey,
this guy accepted

288
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,250
this positive charge.

289
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,110
And, you know, it's a little
bit wishy-washy here.

290
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:44,340
Because it's not like someone
gave it a proton.

291
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,690
You can kind of think
of it as he

292
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,160
actually gave away electrons.

293
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,080
But if you just look at
the final product.

294
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,990
OK, he's got a positive charge
when everything was done.

295
00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:00,010
So you say OK, maybe that's
a Bronsted-Lowry base.

296
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,940
Now you're saying, OK well, why
did people even make the

297
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,880
trouble of defining a
Bronsted-Lowry base when all

298
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,540
of the Arrhenius acids and
bases could also be

299
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,020
Bronsted-Lowry.

300
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,690
Well that's because Arrhenius
is always--

301
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,850
You're always dealing
with water.

302
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,380
Everything's in an
aqueous solution.

303
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,290
But I drew an example here
of a Bronsted-Lowry base.

304
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,270
It doesn't have to be
an aqueous solution.

305
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,870
So if you have acetic
acid right here--

306
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,180
that's what's in vinegar.

307
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,020
Plus ammonia-- it doesn't have
to be in an aqueous solution--

308
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,160
what happens?

309
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,410
This hydrogen gets
donated to the

310
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,470
ammonia ion to make ammonium.

311
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,290
So this becomes positive,
this because negative.

312
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:42,360
It donated this proton.

313
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,400
And Arrhenius has nothing
to say for this.

314
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,320
Because everything he deals with
is hydronium and water.

315
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,710
But the Bronsted-Lowry
definition

316
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,310
works in this situation.

317
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,940
Now the broadest definition--
although they're all these

318
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,370
definitions, but you're going to
be 90% of the time good if

319
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,380
you just know the Arrhenius
definition and just know the

320
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,280
Bronsted-Lowry and what
I'm about to say

321
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,430
right now also exists.

322
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,000
And that's Lewis acids
and bases.

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,820
Lewis acids and bases.

324
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,780
Now Lewis cares about
electrons.

325
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,340
Bronsted-Lowry cared
about protons.

326
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:25,090
So Lewis, instead of saying an
acid is a proton donor, Lewis

327
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,320
acid says it's an electron
acceptor.

328
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,480
Electron acceptor.

329
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,712
And a base is an
electron donor.

330
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:40,090
Now, let's us look at in the
context of everything we've

331
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,340
done so far.

332
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,770
If this is really an
acid, it should

333
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,320
be an electron acceptor.

334
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,190
And the way you can kind of
think of it is you had

335
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:56,840
hydrochloric acid before, when
this guy gave away this atom

336
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,370
or this proton right there.

337
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,200
He kind of kept his electron.

338
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,850
So he was kind of an
electron acceptor.

339
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,580
It's a little bit of
a grey area there.

340
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,250
It's not like he took an
electron from somebody else.

341
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,740
But this would be considered
still a Lewis acid.

342
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,380
And if you think about a Lewis
base, a Lewis base is what?

343
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,495
It's an electron donor, right?

344
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:25,630
A Lewis base is an electron donor.

345
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,890
So if you have it right
here, Lewis base

346
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,235
is an electron donor.

347
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:33,870
This lithium hydroxide, when it
goes into water-- There's a

348
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,840
couple of ways to think of it.

349
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,800
You can say hey, it's donating
this OH, which has these 2

350
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,520
extra-- this negative charge,
so it's an electron donor.

351
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,150
I don't like it.

352
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,050
It's kind of squishy that way,
so I'm not a big fan of that

353
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,230
definition.

354
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,270
In my mind, Arrhenius makes
the most sense.

355
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,770
It's kind of the purest thing.

356
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,980
Are you creating hydronium
or not?

357
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,990
Or are you creating
hydroxide or not?

358
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,870
But just to show that the Lewis
acid base definition is

359
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,070
the broadest definition.

360
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,930
Here's a case of a Lewis
acid base reaction.

361
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:12,170
That would not be considered
either a Bronsted-Lowry or an

362
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,150
Arrhenius base.

363
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,720
Because this doesn't have
to happen in water.

364
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,349
And what you have here is boron
trifluoride, with a

365
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,960
fluoride anion.

366
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,920
It has a negative charge.

367
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,140
It has this little extra
electron here.

368
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,150
In this situation, this fluoride
right here, or this

369
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,940
fluorine anion can donate
these 2 electrons.

370
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,810
So let's say that this
one right here is

371
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,780
this one right here.

372
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:43,370
And what it does is, it donates
these 2 electrons to

373
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,280
this boron complex right here.

374
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,770
And so if it's the electron
donor, what is it?

375
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,550
The fluoride is the base.

376
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,510
So this is a Lewis base.

377
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,970
And then the electron acceptor
is a Lewis acid.

378
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,860
So this right here is
a Lewis Acid.

379
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,210
It's good to know that these
definitions exist, and

380
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,040
especially so you don't get
confused in the future.

381
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,730
But for a first-year chemistry
class, if you know the

382
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,560
Arrhenius definition
really well, that's the one ---you'll

383
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,690
do very, very well.

384
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,840
And frankly in my mind, that's
the easiest one to

385
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,570
contemplate.

386
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,750
And that's the one that's going
to matter in most of the

387
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,590
reactions where you deal with
the changes in pH to water.

388
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,680
Because that's what all the
acids and bases do, especially

389
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,020
in the Arrhenius case.

390
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,040
Anyway, see you in the next
video and watch as we do some

391
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,970
math, figuring out the changes
in pH due to some acid.
