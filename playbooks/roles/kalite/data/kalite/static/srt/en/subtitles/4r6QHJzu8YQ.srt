1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,530
Problem 143.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:15,600
3.003 divided by 2.002 is equal to--

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,220
well, this already looks suspicious.

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,450
It looks like 3/2, but just to confirm that,

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,570
this is the same thing as 3 times 1.001.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,560
And this is the same thing as 2 times 1.001.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,380
So you cancel those out, and you get 3/2,

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,470
which is the same thing is 1.5. And that's choice E.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,860
Problem 144.

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:55,940
If 4 minus x over 2 plus x is equal to x,

11
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:03,870
what is the value of x squared plus 3x minus 4?

12
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,860
Let's see if we could simplify this little bit.

13
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,790
Let's multiply both sides of this equation times 2 plus x,

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,010
so you get 4 minus x is equal to 2 plus x times x is

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,940
2x plus x squared.

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,060
Let's subtract x from both--no, add x to both sides,

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,160
so you get 4 is equal to 3x plus x squared.

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,250
Subtract 4 from both sides,

19
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,450
and you get 0 is equal to minus 4 plus 3x plus x squared,

20
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,910
which is just rearranging that,

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,110
which was the same thing as x squared plus 3x minus 4,

22
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,950
so that is equal to 0, which is C.

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,940
Next problem, 145.

24
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,070
They've drawn us a trapezoid.

25
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,690
Let me see if I can draw the trapezoid as well.

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,270
So they have the base, one side,

27
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,010
and then they have another side

28
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,700
that looks something like that,

29
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,280
and they connect the two lines like that.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,580
And then they labeled this side as 2 feet,

31
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,630
this side as 5 feet, and they say this is A,

32
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,210
and this is b. All right.

33
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,600
The trapezoid shown in the figure above

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,140
represents a cross-section of the rudder of a ship.

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,250
If the distance from a to b is 13 feet,

36
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,740
what is the area of the cross-section of the rudder in feet?

37
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,480
So let's think about this a little bit.

38
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,510
Let's see if we can figure out this area.

39
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,370
So this area right here is easy to figure out.

40
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,620
If this is 13, this is 5,

41
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,380
what is this side going to be equal to?

42
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,520
We can use the Pythagorean theorem.

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,570
If we call this x,

44
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,240
we could say x squared plus this side squared,

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,200
plus 25, is equal to 13 squared. 13 squared is what? 169?

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,060
I want to say that,but let me check.

47
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,930
I haven't memorized my 13 times tables.

48
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,130
3 times 13 is 39.

49
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,220
130. Yeah, 169.

50
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,570
Subtract 25 from both sides,

51
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,060
you get x squared is equal to 144.

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,860
That's tells us we're on the right track.

53
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,430
We got a perfect square. So x is equal to 12.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,450
So it's very easy to figure out

55
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,690
the area of this part of the trapezoid, right?

56
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,140
It's just the base times the height times 1/2.

57
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,000
So it'd be 12 times 5, which is 60, times 1/2,

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,740
so this would be 30, this area here.

59
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,600
But this is a little bit trickier.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,160
Well, let's think about it this way.

61
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,620
Let's extend this trapezoid into a rectangle.

62
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,160
So if you did that, then you can view the area of the rudder,

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,220
so the original problem that I have in magenta there as

64
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,450
the area of this entire rectangle

65
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,990
minus this green area right here.

66
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,080
So let's do that.

67
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,230
First of all, what's the area of this green area?

68
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,930
So this side is what?

69
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,870
If this is 2, this side is 3.

70
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,670
And we already figured out this width is 12.

71
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,280
So the green area is 3 times 12 times 1/2,

72
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,560
that's the area of a triangle.

73
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,910
So 3 times 12 is 36 times 1/2 is 18.

74
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,420
Do it in a different color.

75
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,680
So the area of this green area is 18.

76
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,660
So the area of our rudder,

77
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,120
this whole magenta area that I'm shading n,

78
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,510
is equal to the area of the rectangle minus 18.

79
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,920
So the area of the rectangle is 12 times 5, which is 60.

80
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,280
And then let's subtract out the green area minus 18

81
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,170
is equal to 60 minus 18, that's 42.

82
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,070
And that's choice C. Problem 146.

83
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,260
If 0 is less than or equal to x,

84
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:38,710
which is less than or equal to 4, and y is less than 12,

85
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,280
which of the following cannot be the value of xy?

86
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,700
Let me going to write down all the choices. A, minus 2.

87
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,910
and y is less than 12, I don't see why not.

88
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,810
x could be 2 and y could be minus 1.

89
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,630
y could be arbitrarily small.

90
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,020
So that's not true, it's not A. B, 0.

91
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,400
Well, x and y actually can both be zero,

92
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,280
so if you multiple them,

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,310
no reason why you can't get zero. C, 6.

94
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,660
Well, if x is 2, and y is 3, I can easily get 6.

95
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,400
And they don't even tell us that x and y have to be different

96
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,150
They don't even tell us they have to be integers.

97
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:39,860
24, Well, the largest number that x can be equal to is 4,

98
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:45,870
and x can't be a negative, so if x is 4, times y is 6,

99
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,040
you get 24, so I'm already guessing the answer is E

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,000
without having looked at it. E, 48.

101
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,290
Because the largest value of x is 4,

102
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,340
and so you'd have to multiply 4 times 12 to get to 48,

103
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,600
but you can't get there. So the answer is E.

104
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,510
Problem 147. Turn the page.

105
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,470
I'll do it in blue since it seems to be dealing with water.

106
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,330
147: In the figure above-- let me draw the figure above.

107
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,750
So I have a V-axis, then I have this other axis,

108
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,080
and then they've drawn what looks like water,

109
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,820
at least before reading the problem.

110
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,550
I've drawn that. They say this is V.

111
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,390
They say that this distance is 5 feet.

112
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,210
They say that this distance is 10 feet,

113
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,670
and they label us a couple of points.

114
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,090
It's R and that's S.

115
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,100
In the figure above,

116
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,640
V represents an observation point at one end of a pool.

117
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,390
From V, an object that is actually located

118
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,980
on the bottom of the pool at point R,

119
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,380
so an object that is actually here, appears to be at point S.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,340
The light goes from here, but then refracts,

121
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,110
and goes like that, so if you just follow the path,

122
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,910
it would go straight to point S.

123
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:23,030
If VR is equal to 10 feet-- what?

124
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,880
Oh, VR is equal to 10 feet,so let me draw VR.

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,040
VR is equal to 10 feet.

126
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,200
What is the distance RS, in feet,

127
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,940
between the actual position

128
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,440
and the perceived position of the object?

129
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,190
So they want to know this distance right here.

130
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,990
Well let's think about it a little bit.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,910
If we can figure out this distance, then we subtract

132
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,310
that distance from 10, we'll have this distance.

133
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,580
So what's this? Let's call this x.

134
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,360
This is a right triangle,

135
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,880
so you have x squared plus 5 squared, plus 25,

136
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,250
is equal to this hypotenuse squared,

137
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,660
is equal to 100, which is the Pythagorean theorem.

138
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:23,170
x squared is equal to 75, so then x is going to be equal to--

139
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,330
let's see, square root of 75.

140
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,520
That's someplace between 8 and 9, right?

141
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:36,930
8 is 64, 9 is 81, so x is greater than 8 and less than 9.

142
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,370
Oh, actually, they write it in terms of square root of--

143
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,230
let me simplify this a little bit more.

144
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,330
So I can write that as-- the square root of 75,

145
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,510
I can write as 3 times 25.

146
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,410
Square root of 25 is 5,so that becomes 5 square roots of 3.

147
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,480
So this distance right here is 5 square roots of 3.

148
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,600
So if I want to figure out this distance,

149
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,420
I just subtract that from 10.

150
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,330
So 10 minus 5 square roots of 3, and that is choice A.

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,230
See you in the next video.
