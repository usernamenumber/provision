1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
In the last video we were able
to show that any lambda that

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:09,910
satisfies this equation for some
non-zero vectors, V, then

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,510
the determinant of lambda times
the identity matrix

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,560
minus A, must be equal to 0.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:24,620
Or if we could rewrite this as
saying lambda is an eigenvalue

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:31,780
of A if and only if-- I'll
write it as if-- the

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,250
determinant of lambda times the
identity matrix minus A is

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,860
equal to 0.

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,230
Now, let's see if we can
actually use this in any kind

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,690
of concrete way to figure
out eigenvalues.

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,880
So let's do a simple 2
by 2, let's do an R2.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's say that A is equal to
the matrix 1, 2, and 4, 3.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,790
And I want to find the
eigenvalues of A.

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:11,610
So if lambda is an eigenvalue
of A, then this right here

16
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,330
tells us that the determinant
of lambda times the identity

17
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,140
matrix, so it's going to be
the identity matrix in R2.

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:29,230
So lambda times 1, 0, 0, 1,
minus A, 1, 2, 4, 3, is going

19
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,320
to be equal to 0.

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,510
Well what does this equal to?

21
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,170
This right here is
the determinant.

22
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,740
Lambda times this is just lambda
times all of these

23
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,790
terms. So it's lambda times 1
is lambda, lambda times 0 is

24
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,260
0, lambda times 0 is 0, lambda
times 1 is lambda.

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,910
And from that we'll
subtract A.

26
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:56,130
So you get 1, 2, 4, 3, and
this has got to equal 0.

27
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,820
And then this matrix, or this
difference of matrices, this

28
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,580
is just to keep the
determinant.

29
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,360
This is the determinant of.

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,670
This first term's going
to be lambda minus 1.

31
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,540
The second term is 0 minus
2, so it's just minus 2.

32
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,570
The third term is 0 minus
4, so it's just minus 4.

33
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,310
And then the fourth term
is lambda minus

34
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,310
3, just like that.

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,620
So kind of a shortcut to
see what happened.

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,560
The terms along the diagonal,
well everything became a

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,550
negative, right?

38
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,700
We negated everything.

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,350
And then the terms around
the diagonal, we've got

40
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,260
a lambda out front.

41
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,930
That was essentially the
byproduct of this expression

42
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,900
right there.

43
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,990
So what's the determinant
of this 2 by 2 matrix?

44
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,950
Well the determinant of this is
just this times that, minus

45
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,940
this times that.

46
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:58,260
So it's lambda minus 1, times
lambda minus 3, minus these

47
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,170
two guys multiplied
by each other.

48
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,480
So minus 2 times minus 4
is plus eight, minus 8.

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,470
This is the determinant of this
matrix right here or this

50
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,920
matrix right here, which
simplified to that matrix.

51
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,510
And this has got to
be equal to 0.

52
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,180
And the whole reason why that's
got to be equal to 0 is

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,810
because we saw earlier,
this matrix has a

54
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,615
non-trivial null space.

55
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:27,860
And because it has a non-trivial
null space, it

56
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,790
can't be invertible and
its determinant has

57
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,530
to be equal to 0.

58
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,160
So now we have an interesting
polynomial

59
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,880
equation right here.

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,030
We can multiply it out.

61
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,030
We get what?

62
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,960
Let's multiply it out.

63
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:46,280
We get lambda squared, right,
minus 3 lambda, minus lambda,

64
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,880
plus 3, minus 8,
is equal to 0.

65
00:03:50,880 --> 00:04:00,330
Or lambda squared, minus
4 lambda, minus

66
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,710
5, is equal to 0.

67
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,600
And just in case you want to
know some terminology, this

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,520
expression right here is known
as the characteristic

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,770
polynomial.

70
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:19,100
   

71
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,860
Just a little terminology,
polynomial.

72
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,430
But if we want to find the
eigenvalues for A, we just

73
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,775
have to solve this right here.

74
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:28,310
This is just a basic
quadratic problem.

75
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,600
And this is actually
factorable.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,180
Let's see, two numbers and you
take the product is minus 5,

77
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,250
when you add them
you get minus 4.

78
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,760
It's minus 5 and plus 1, so you
get lambda minus 5, times

79
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,580
lambda plus 1, is equal
to 0, right?

80
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,190
Minus 5 times 1 is minus 5, and
then minus 5 lambda plus 1

81
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,260
lambda is equal to
minus 4 lambda.

82
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,970
So the two solutions of our
characteristic equation being

83
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,740
set to 0, our characteristic
polynomial, are lambda is

84
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,090
equal to 5 or lambda is
equal to minus 1.

85
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,240
So just like that, using the
information that we proved to

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,970
ourselves in the last video,
we're able to figure out that

87
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:15,610
the two eigenvalues of A are
lambda equals 5 and lambda

88
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,320
equals negative 1.

89
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,500
Now that only just solves part
of the problem, right?

90
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,570
We know we're looking
for eigenvalues and

91
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,800
eigenvectors, right?

92
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,660
We know that this equation can
be satisfied with the lambdas

93
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,700
equaling 5 or minus 1.

94
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,630
So we know the eigenvalues, but
we've yet to determine the

95
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,610
actual eigenvectors.

96
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,660
So that's what we're going
to do in the next video.

97
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,910
