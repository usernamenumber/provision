What I want to do in this video is find out if there is any fast way

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to figure out the sum of the roots of any polynomial

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And there actually is and that's why I'm doing this video

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets start with a second degree polynomial

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets say it's x squared plus a one x plus a two is equal to zero

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is just a standard quadratic equation right here, second degree equation

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you might be saying hey but you put the coefficent

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the x term equal to one

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in general you can always convert any polynomial

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'll do it with a second degree but if you have

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A x squared plus B x plus C is equal to 0

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then you can just divide both sides of this equation by A

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you're going to have something that's in this form

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where the coefficent on the x squared term

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be equal to one.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can do that with any polynomial that's set equal to 0

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so with that out of the way let's think about what the

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sum of the roots of this are going to be

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is a second degree polynomial

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's a quadratic equation, so it'll have two roots

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they can be real or complex

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's call the roots R one and R two

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that tells us that these are roots that

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
X minus R 1 times X minus R 2

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be equal to 0

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if we multiply this out we get

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
X times X is X squared

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
X times negative R2 is negative R2X

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we have negative R1 times X and negative R1X

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we have negative R1 times negative R2

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is plus R1R2 is equal to 0

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we can simplify this middle term a little bit

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it becomes x squared minus R1 plus R2
