1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,880
Let's say there's an election
coming up and I want to figure

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,000
out if there's a meaningful
difference between the

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,430
proportion of men and the
proportion of women that are

5
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,990
going to vote for a candidate.

6
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,160
So let's look at the population
distributions here.

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,820
So we have the men, some
proportion are going to vote

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,240
for the candidate.

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,025
We'll call that P1.

10
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:22,460
So this is the proportion that
will vote for the candidate.

11
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,630
And the rest of the men will
not vote for the candidate.

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,030
So 1 minus P1 will not vote
for the candidate.

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,760
And then for the women,
you're going to

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,360
see something similar.

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,920
So this is the women
right over here.

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,670
And some proportion will
vote for the candidate.

17
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,040
We don't know if it's the same
as P1, we don't know if it's

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,300
same as the men, so
we'll call it P2.

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,850
And then the rest of
the women will not

20
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,120
vote for the candidate.

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,440
1 minus P2.

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,370
So the not voting are zeroes,
the ones that

23
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,250
are voting are ones.

24
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,660
And these are both Bernoulli
distributions and we know,

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,060
just because this'll be useful
later on, that the means of

26
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,360
this distribution are the same
as the proportion that will

27
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,069
vote for it.

28
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,320
So the mean of the men, or the
proportion of the men that

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,860
will vote, so we'll call that
mean one, is equal to P1.

30
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,220
   

31
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,470
I should do everything
in yellow.

32
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,990
   

33
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,740
So the mean of this distribution
is P1.

34
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,410
The variance of this
distribution, we'll call that

35
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,590
variance one, is just these two
proportions multiplied by

36
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,030
each other.

37
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,110
So it's P1 times 1 minus P1.

38
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,220
And we saw this many many videos
ago when we learned

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,180
about Bernoulli distributions.

40
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,430
And we're going to see
the exact same

41
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,130
thing with the women.

42
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,890
The mean of this Bernoulli
distribution

43
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,460
is going to be P2.

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,040
And then the variance of this
Bernoulli distribution is

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,750
going to be these two
proportions multiplied.

46
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,530
So P2 times 1 minus P2.

47
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,370
Now, what I want to do, and
I think I said this at the

48
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,190
beginning of the video, is I
want to figure out if there's

49
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,820
a meaningful difference between
the way that the men

50
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,470
will vote and the
women will vote.

51
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:19,750
I want to figure out, let
me write this, is this

52
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,500
meaningful?

53
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,640
So is there a meaningful
difference here?

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,760
And what we're going to do in
this video is try to come up

55
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,660
with a 95% confidence interval
for this parameter.

56
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,840
This difference of parameters
is still a parameter.

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,590
We don't know what the true
difference of these two

58
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,830
population parameters are.

59
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,750
Or these two population
proportions.

60
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:48,890
But we're going to try to come
up with a 95% confidence

61
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,930
interval for that difference.

62
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,070
And the way we do that, we go
out and we find 1,000 men

63
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,720
likely to vote.

64
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,790
And 1,000 women likely
to vote.

65
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,980
So let's write this down.

66
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,880
So we get 1,000 men.

67
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,340
When we survey the 1,000 men,
let's say 642 say that they

68
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,990
will vote for the candidate.

69
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,060
So they are ones.

70
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,840
And then the remainder, 358,
I'll just say the remainder.

71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,540
So the rest are zeros.

72
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,610
That we do the same
thing with women.

73
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,160
We survey 1,000 women who
are likely to vote.

74
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,320
But we survey them randomly.

75
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,500
And let's say 591 say
that they will

76
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,740
vote for the candidate.

77
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,120
And the rest say that
they will not

78
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,140
vote for the candidate.

79
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,130
So just here based on our sample
proportions, or our

80
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,650
sample means, it looks like
there is a difference.

81
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,915
But we still have to come up
with our confidence interval.

82
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:51,730
And let's just make sure we
understand what we just did.

83
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,280
So we could figure out a sample
proportion over here

84
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,530
for the men.

85
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,180
   

86
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,290
Which is really just the sample
mean of this sample

87
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,200
right over here.

88
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,600
We have 642 ones, the
rest are zero.

89
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,620
So we have 642 in
the numerator.

90
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,970
We have 1,000 samples.

91
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,840
642 divided by 1,000 is 0.642.

92
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,340
So you could view this is a
sample mean or as a sample

93
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,380
proportion.

94
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,370
If you do the same thing for
the women, the sample

95
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,570
proportion is going
to be 0.591.

96
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,070
Or you could even just view this
as the sample mean of the

97
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,550
sample of 1,000 women.

98
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,210
Where the ones voting for it
are one, the rest are zero.

99
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,720
And just to visualize it
properly, let me draw the

100
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,975
sampling distribution for
the sample proportions.

101
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:40,120
   

102
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,910
We have a large sample size.

103
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,630
   

104
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,950
And especially because the
proportions that we're dealing

105
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,610
with aren't close to one or
zero, and we have a large

106
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,990
sample size, the sampling
distribution will be

107
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,240
approximately normal.

108
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,990
   

109
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,240
Let me write this.

110
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,560
   

111
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,930
So it's going to have
some mean over here.

112
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,710
So the mean of the sampling
distribution of the sample

113
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,360
proportion.

114
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,730
And we've seen in
multiple times.

115
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,800
It's going to be the same
thing as the mean of the

116
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,870
population.

117
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,440
And the mean of the population
is actually the true

118
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,950
population proportion.

119
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,960
So this is going to
be equal to P1.

120
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,710
This is something that we
don't to know about.

121
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,460
And then the variance of this,
and we've seen this several

122
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,360
times already, the variance of
this distribution, I have to

123
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,660
put a one here, we're dealing
with the men.

124
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,480
The variance of this
distribution by the central

125
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,930
limit theorem is going to
be the variance of this

126
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,870
distribution up here, which is
P1 times 1 minus P1 over our

127
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,800
sample size, over 1,000.

128
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,906
And we can do the exact same
thing for the women.

129
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:02,040
   

130
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,570
So this is the sampling
distribution.

131
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:09,230
   

132
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:15,750
This is for P2 bar, or this
sample mean over here.

133
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,130
Let me put a one over here.

134
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,540
Remember, this is
all for the men.

135
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,870
And then this over here
is all for the women.

136
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,510
Can't forget those
twos over there.

137
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,190
And so this distribution is
going to have some mean.

138
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,790
   

139
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,720
Let me draw it right
over here.

140
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,130
So mu sub P2 with
a bar over it.

141
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,910
So the mean of the sampling
distribution for this sample

142
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,590
proportion, for the women, which
is going to be the same

143
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,680
thing as the mean of the
population, which we already

144
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,930
saw is going to be
equal to P2.

145
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,770
And then the variance for this
distribution, for this

146
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,920
sampling and distribution over
here, is going to be this

147
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,450
variance over here divided
by our sample size.

148
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,410
So P2 times 1 minus P2.

149
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,330
All of that over n.

150
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,970
Now, our whole goal is to
get a 95% confidence

151
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,140
interval for that.

152
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,310
And so what we're going to do is
we're going to think about

153
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,260
the sampling distribution, not
for this, and not the sampling

154
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,190
distribution for this.

155
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,980
But we're going to think about
the sampling distribution for

156
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,460
the difference of this sample
proportion and this sample

157
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:25,950
proportion.

158
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,860
We've seen it already.

159
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,620
We're talking about proportions,
but it's really

160
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,460
the same exact ideas that we
did when we just compared

161
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,660
sample means generally.

162
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,910
So let's look at that.

163
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,160
   

164
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,190
Let's look at this
distribution.

165
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,260
And just to be clear, when we
got this sample mean here,

166
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,590
this sample proportion,
we just sampled it.

167
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,060
You could view it as taking
a sample from this

168
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,030
distribution over here.

169
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,610
When we got this sample
proportion, it was like taking

170
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,340
a sample from this over here.

171
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,390
We took 1,000 samples from this,
when we took their mean.

172
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,780
Where it's equivalent to taking
a sample from the

173
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,300
sampling distribution.

174
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,270
Now, this distribution over
here is going to be the

175
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,270
distribution of all of the
differences of the sampling

176
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,730
proportions, or of the
sample proportions.

177
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,350
So it will look like this.

178
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,790
It will have some mean value.

179
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,470
I should do this in
a different color.

180
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,210
I'll do it in green.

181
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,460
Yellow and blue make green.

182
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,280
   

183
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:36,039
So I'll call this the sampling
distribution of this

184
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:41,120
statistic, of P1 minus P2.

185
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,990
And so it has some
mean over here.

186
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,740
   

187
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,000
The sample of P1 minus the
sample mean, or the sample

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,790
proportion, of P2.

189
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,200
And we know, from things that
we've done in the last several

190
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,290
videos, that this is going to
be the exact same thing as

191
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,890
this mean minus this mean.

192
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,100
Which is the exact same
thing as P1 minus P2.

193
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,400
So this is going to be
equal to P1 minus P2.

194
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,450
   

195
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:26,430
And the variance of this
distribution, P1 minus P2,

196
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,520
just like this, is going to be
the sum of the variances of

197
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,060
these two distributions.

198
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,210
So it's going to be this thing
over here, I'll just copy and

199
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:40,940
paste it, plus this variance
over here.

200
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,520
There's no radical sign, because
we're not taking the

201
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,390
standard deviation.

202
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,190
We're focused on the
variance right now.

203
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,110
So plus this thing
right over here.

204
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,165
So let me copy and
let me paste it.

205
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:55,680
   

206
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,925
So that's going to
be the variance.

207
00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:00,800
   

208
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,100
And if you want the standard
deviation, you can literally

209
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,060
just get rid of this.

210
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,530
You're taking the square
root of both sides.

211
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,040
So you take the square root of
the variance, you get the

212
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,180
standard deviation, that's why
I got rid of that to the

213
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,875
second power.

214
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,440
And you want to take a square
root of the right-hand side

215
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,720
just like that.

216
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,900
Now, all I did right now was
just to kind of conceptually

217
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,000
set things up in our brain.

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,350
What we now need to do
is actually tackle

219
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,380
the confidence interval.

220
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,860
We actually need to come up with
a 95% confidence interval

221
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,750
for P1 minus P2.

222
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,360
Or a 95% confidence interval for
this mean right over here.

223
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,830
And because I'm trying to make
my best effort not to make

224
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,370
videos too long, I'll do part
two in the next video, where

225
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,250
we actually solve the
confidence interval.

226
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:46,734
