1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,430
In this video I'm going to do
a bunch of example slope

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,450
problems. Just as a bit of
review, slope is just a way of

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,920
measuring the inclination
of a line.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,870
And the definition-- we're going
to hopefully get a good

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,800
working knowledge of it in this
video-- the definition of

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,720
it is a change in y divided
by change in x.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,960
This may or may not make some
sense to you right now, but as

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,830
we do more and more examples,
I think it'll make a good

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:28,730
amount of sense.

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,900
Let's do this first
line right here.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,660
Line a.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,460
Let's figure out its slope.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,490
They've actually drawn two
points here that we can use as

14
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,130
the reference points.

15
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,140
So first of all, let's
look at the

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,770
coordinates of those points.

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,140
So you have this point
right here.

18
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,040
What's its coordinates?

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,480
Its x-coordinate is 3.

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,070
Its y-coordinate is 6.

21
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,940
And then down here, this
point's x-coordinate is

22
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,780
negative 1 and its y-coordinate
is negative 6.

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,920
So there's a couple of ways
we can think about slope.

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,330
One is, we could look at it
straight up using the formula.

25
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,030
We could say change in y-- so
slope is change in y over

26
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,370
change in x.

27
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,850
We can figure it out
numerically.

28
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,200
I'll in a second draw
it graphically.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,040
So what's our change in y?

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,330
Our change in y is literally
how much did our y values

31
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,760
change going from this
point to that point?

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,400
So how much did our
y values change?

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,570
Our y went from here, y is at
negative 6 and it went all the

34
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,060
way up to positive 6.

35
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,150
So what's this distance
right here?

36
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,930
It's going to be your
end point y value.

37
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:44,040
It's going to be 6 minus your
starting point y value.

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,140
Minus negative 6 or 6 plus
6, which is equal to 12.

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,960
You could just count this.

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,000
You say one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
ten, eleven, twelve.

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,680
So when we changed our y value
by 12, we had to change our x

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,460
value by-- what was our
change it x over the

44
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,800
same change in y?

45
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,570
Well we went from x is equal
to negative 1 to

46
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,190
x is equal to 3.

47
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,930
Right? x went from
negative 1 to 3.

48
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,110
So we do the end point, which is
3 minus the starting point,

49
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,540
which is negative 1, which
is equal to 4.

50
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,270
So our change in y over change
in x is equal to 12/4 or if we

51
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,660
want to write this in simplest
form, this is the

52
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,030
same thing as 3.

53
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,690
Now the interpretation of this
means that for every 1 we move

54
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,520
over-- we could view this,
let me write it this way.

55
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,190
Change in y over change in x
is equal to-- we could say

56
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,960
it's 3 or we could
say it's 3/1.

57
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,590
Which tells us that for every
1 we move in the positive

58
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,650
x-direction, we're going to move
up 3 because this is a

59
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,540
positive 3 in the y-direction.

60
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,480
You can see that.

61
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,320
When we moved 1 in the x,
we moved up 3 in the y.

62
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,880
When we moved 1 in the x,
we moved up 3 in the y.

63
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,500
If you move 2 in the
x-direction, you're going to

64
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,250
move 6 in the y.

65
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,210
6/2 is the same thing as 3.

66
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:17,280
So this 3 tells us how quickly
do we go up as we increase x.

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,780
Let's do the same thing for the
second line on this graph.

68
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,470
Graph b.

69
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,060
Same idea.

70
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,300
I'm going to use the points
that they gave us.

71
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,730
But really you could use any
points on that line.

72
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,020
So let's see, we have one
point here, which is

73
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,550
the point 0, 1.

74
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,540
You have 0, 1.

75
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,780
And then the starting point-- we
could call this the finish

76
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,460
point-- the starting point right
here, we could view it

77
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,830
as x is negative 6 and
y is negative 2.

78
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,990
So same idea.

79
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,230
What is the change in y given
some change in x?

80
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,440
So let's do the change in
x first. So what is

81
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,060
our change in x?

82
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,930
So in this situation, what is
our change in x? delta x.

83
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,850
We could even count it.

84
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,910
It's one, two, three,
four, five, six.

85
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,110
It's going to be 6.

86
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,760
But if you didn't have a graph
to count from, you could

87
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,370
literally take your finishing
x-position, so it's 0, and

88
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,029
subtract from that your
starting x-position.

89
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,390
0 minus negative 6.

90
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,360
So when your change in x is
equal to-- so this will be 6--

91
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,180
what is our change in y?

92
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,890
Remember we're taking this as
our finishing position.

93
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,520
This is our starting position.

94
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,670
So we took 0 minus negative 6.

95
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,635
So then on the y, we have to
do 1 minus negative 2.

96
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:45,658
1 minus negative 2

97
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,180
What's 1 minus negative 2?

98
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,260
That's the same thing
as 1 plus 2.

99
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,410
That is equal to 3.

100
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,450
So it is 3/6 or 1/2.

101
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:02,080
So notice, when we moved in the
x-direction by 6, we moved

102
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,340
in the y-direction
by positive 3.

103
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,170
So our change in y was 3 when
our change in x was 6.

104
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,430
Now, one of the things that
confuses a lot of people is

105
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,110
how do I know what order to--
how did I know to do the 0

106
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,930
first and the negative 6 second
and then the 1 first

107
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,920
and then the negative
2 second.

108
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,210
And the answer is you could've
done it in either order as

109
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,540
long as you keep
them straight.

110
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,300
So you could have also
have done change in y

111
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,830
over change in x.

112
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:34,280
We could have said, it's equal
to negative 2 minus 1.

113
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,690
So we're using this coordinate
first. Negative 2 minus 1 for

114
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,490
the y over negative 6 minus 0.

115
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,960
Notice this is a negative
of that.

116
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,650
That is the negative of that.

117
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,545
But since we have a negative
over negative, they're going

118
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:50,260
to cancel out.

119
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,810
So this is going to be equal to
negative 3 over negative 6.

120
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,020
The negatives cancel out.

121
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,250
This is also equal to 1/2.

122
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:05,250
So the important thing is if
you use this y-coordinate

123
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,280
first, then you have
to use this

124
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,350
x-coordinate first as well.

125
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,640
If you use this y-coordinate
first, as we did here, then

126
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,160
you have to use this
x-coordinate

127
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,130
first, as you did there.

128
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,850
You just have to make sure
that your change in x and

129
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,750
change in y are-- you're
using the same final

130
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,950
and starting points.

131
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:30,190
Just to interpret this, this is
saying that for every minus

132
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,820
6 we go in x.

133
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,480
So if we go minus 6 in x, so
that's going backwards, we're

134
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,210
going to go minus 3 in y.

135
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,960
But they're essentially
saying the same thing.

136
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,170
The slope of this line is 1/2.

137
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:50,150
Which tells us for every 2 we
travel in x, we go up 1 in y.

138
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,990
Or if we go back 2 in x,
we go down 1 in y.

139
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,070
That's what 1/2 slope
tells us.

140
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,560
Notice, the line with the 1/2
slope, it is less steep than

141
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
the line with a slope of 3.

142
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,490
Let's do a couple
more of these.

143
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,200
Let's do line c right here.

144
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,670
I'll do it in pink.

145
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,250
Let's say that the starting
point-- I'm just picking this

146
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,120
arbitrarily.

147
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,840
Well, I'm using these points
that they've drawn here.

148
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,010
The starting point is at the
coordinate negative 1, 6 and

149
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:29,050
that my finishing point is at
the point 5, negative 6.

150
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,980
Our slope is going to be-- let
me write this-- slope is going

151
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,480
to be equal to change in
x-- sorry, change in y.

152
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,460
I'll never forget that.

153
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,500
Change in y over change in x.

154
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,170
Sometimes it's said
rise over run.

155
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,610
Run is how much you're moving
in the horizontal direction.

156
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,360
Rise is how much you're moving
in the vertical direction.

157
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,840
Then we could say our change in
y is our finishing y-point

158
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,560
minus our starting y-point.

159
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,990
This is our finishing y-point.

160
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,990
That's our starting y-point,
over our finishing x-point

161
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,800
minus our starting x-point.

162
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,440
If that confuses you, all I'm
saying is, it's going to be

163
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,570
equal to our finishing y-point
is negative 6 minus our

164
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:21,990
starting y-point, which is 6,
over our finishing x-point,

165
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,380
which is 5, minus our starting
x-point, which is negative 1.

166
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,780
So this is equal to negative
6 minus 6 is negative 12.

167
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,280
5 minus negative 1.

168
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,080
That is 6.

169
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,840
So negative 12/6.

170
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,240
That's the same thing
as negative 2.

171
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,230
Notice we have a negative
slope here.

172
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,670
That's because every time we
increase x by 1, we go down in

173
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,740
the y-direction.

174
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,730
So this is a downward
sloping line.

175
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,170
It's going from the top left
to the bottom right.

176
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,610
As x increases, the
y decreases.

177
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,130
And that's why we got
a negative slope.

178
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,010
This line over here should
have a positive slope.

179
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,860
Let's verify it.

180
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,360
So I'll use the same
points that they

181
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,400
use right over there.

182
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,760
So this is line d.

183
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Slope is equal to
rise over run.

184
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,140
How much do we rise when we go
from that point to that point?

185
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,570
Let's see.

186
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,270
We could do it this way.

187
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,500
We are rising-- I could
just count it out.

188
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,110
We are rising one, two, three,
four, five, six.

189
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,460
We are rising 6.

190
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,780
How much are we running?

191
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,150
We are running-- I'll do it
in a different color.

192
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,580
We're running one, two, three,
four, five, six.

193
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,640
We're running 6.

194
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,300
So our slope is 6/6,
which is 1.

195
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,510
Which tells us that every time
we move 1 in the x-direction--

196
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,390
positive 1 in the x-direction--
we go positive 1

197
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,390
in the y-direction.

198
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,340
For every x, if we go negative
2 in the x-direction, we're

199
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,340
going to go negative 2
in the y-direction.

200
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,820
So whatever we do in x, we're
going to do the same thing in

201
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,710
y in this slope.

202
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,740
Notice, that was pretty easy.

203
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,200
If we wanted to do it
mathematically, we could

204
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,260
figure out this coordinate
right there.

205
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,570
That we could view as our
starting position.

206
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,630
Our starting position is
negative 2, negative 4.

207
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,210
Our finishing position
is 4, 2.

208
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,965
4,2

209
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,850
So our slope, change in
y over change in x.

210
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll take this point 2 minus
negative 4 over 4 minus

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,250
negative 2.

212
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,970
2 minus negative 4 is 6.

213
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,000
Remember that was just this
distance right there.

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,140
Then 4 minus negative
2, that's also 6.

215
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,300
That's that distance
right there.

216
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,600
We get a slope of 1.

217
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,380
Let's do another one.

218
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,210
Let's do another couple.

219
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,940
These are interesting.

220
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,200
Let's do the line
e right here.

221
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,800
Change in y over change in x.

222
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,420
So our change in y, when we
go from this point to this

223
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,160
point-- I'll just
count it out.

224
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,210
It's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

225
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,530
It's 8.

226
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,510
Or you could even take this
y-coordinate 2 minus negative

227
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,460
6 will give you that
distance, 8.

228
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,020
What's the change in y?

229
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,640
Well the y-value here is-- oh
sorry what's the change in x?

230
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,260
The x-value here is 4.

231
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,390
The x-value there is 4.

232
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,630
X does not change.

233
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,280
So it's 8/0.

234
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,660
Well, we don't know.

235
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,320
8/0 is undefined.

236
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,630
So in this situation the
slope is undefined.

237
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,830
When you have a vertical
line, you say

238
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,235
your slope is undefined.

239
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,190
Because you're dividing by 0.

240
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,530
But that tells you that you're
dealing probably with a

241
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,320
vertical line.

242
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,720
Now finally let's just
do this one.

243
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,670
This seems like a pretty
straight up vanilla slope

244
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,320
problem right there.

245
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,050
You have that point right
there, which is

246
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,090
the point 3, 1.

247
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,090
So this is line f.

248
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,210
You have the point 3, 1.

249
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:19,750
Then over here you have the
point negative 6, negative 2.

250
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,440
So our slope would be equal
to change in y.

251
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,960
I'll take this as our ending
point, just so you can go in

252
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,130
different directions.

253
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,770
So our change in y-- now
we're going to go

254
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,820
down in that direction.

255
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,540
So it's negative 2 minus 1.

256
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,810
That's what this distance
is right here.

257
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,240
Negative 2 minus 1, which
is equal to negative 3.

258
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,340
Notice we went down 3.

259
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,340
And then what is going to
be our change in x?

260
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,480
Well, we're going to go
back that amount.

261
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,880
What is that amount?

262
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,200
Well, that is going to be
negative 6, that's our end

263
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,920
point, minus 3.

264
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,700
That gives us that distance,
which is negative 9.

265
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,140
For every time we go back 9,
we're going to go down 3.

266
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,680
If we go back 9, we're going to go down 3.

267
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,065
Which is the same thing as if
we go forward 9, we're going

268
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:17,370
to go up 3.

269
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,390
All equivalent.

270
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,830
And we see these cancel out and
you get a slope of 1/3.

271
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,810
Positive 1/3.

272
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,970
It's an upward sloping line.

273
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:33,110
Every time we run
3, we rise 1.

274
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,740
Every time we run 3, we rise 1.

275
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,810
Anyway, hopefully that was a
good review of slope for you.
