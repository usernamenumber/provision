1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,620
We're on problem number four,
and they give us a theorem.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,240
It says a triangle has, at
most, one obtuse angle.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,240
Fair enough.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,850
Eduardo is proving the theorem
above by contradiction.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,630
   

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,750
So the way you prove by a
contradiction, you're like,

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,330
well what if this
weren't true.

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,230
Let me prove that that
can't happen.

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,930
Well let's see what
he did anyway.

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,480
He began by assuming, that in
triangle ABC, angle A and B

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,030
are both obtuse.

13
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,520
Which theorem will Eduardo use
to reach a contradiction?

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,680
OK, let me draw this, what
Eduardo is trying to do.

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,780
The way I'm drawing it is
actually very hard.

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,610
So this is actually not
drawn at all to scale.

17
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,010
So he's saying that angle A and
angle B are both obtuse.

18
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,570
So this means that this angle
is greater than 90.

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,050
Let's say that's angle A.

20
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,290
And this is angle B.

21
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,460
And it's also greater than 90.

22
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,070
That's what obtuse means.

23
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,510
Which theorem will Eduardo use
to reach a contradiction?

24
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,420
Well, before even reading the
choices, think about it.

25
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,970
What do we know about
triangles?

26
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,580
That all of the angles add
up to 180 degrees, right?

27
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,000
So if this is angle A, this is
angle B, and then let's call

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,460
this angle C.

29
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:18,480
We know A plus B plus C
have to be equal to

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,910
180 degrees, right?

31
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:29,240
Or another way to view it
is, C is equal to 180

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,100
minus A minus B.

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,750
Or another way you can think of
it, I'm just writing it a

34
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,470
bunch of different ways.

35
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,300
C is equal to 180 minus
A plus B, right?

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,110
Now, let me ask you
a question.

37
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,400
If we assume from the get-go,
as Eduardo did, if we assume

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,920
that both A and B are greater
than 90 degrees, what's A plus

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,600
B going to be at least
greater than?

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,160
If this is greater than 90 and
that's greater than 90, then A

41
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,010
plus B is going to be greater
than 90 plus 90.

42
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,660
So this has to be greater
than 180.

43
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,240
So if this is greater than 180,
and we're subtracting it

44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,690
from 180, so this essentially
says if angle A is greater

45
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,340
than 90, and angle B is greater
than 90, than what we

46
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,770
can deduce is, from this
statement right here.

47
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,310
From this equation right here.

48
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,370
If this and this is greater than
90 then this whole term

49
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,560
is greater than 180.

50
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,760
So then the deduction would be
that C has to be less than

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,480
zero, and we can't have
negative angles.

52
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,910
So right there, that is
the contradiction.

53
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,850
And then you would say, OK,
therefore you cannot have two

54
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,490
angles that are more than
90 degrees or two

55
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,490
angles that are obtuse.

56
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,090
And that would be your proof
by contradiction.

57
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,400
Let's see if what we did
can be phrased in

58
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,170
one of these choices.

59
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,010
If two angles of a triangle are
equal, the sides opposite

60
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,820
the angles are equal.

61
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,380
No.

62
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:01,410
If two supplementary angles
are equal, the angles each

63
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,410
measure 90.

64
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,290
Well, we didn't use that.

65
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,020
The largest angle of a triangle
is opposite the

66
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,580
longest side.

67
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:07,860
No.

68
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,710
The sum of the measures of the
angles of a triangle is 180.

69
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,370
That's the first thing we
wrote down right there.

70
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,720
So it's choice D.

71
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,160
That's the theorem Eduardo used
to reach a contradiction.

72
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Next question.

73
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,410
Problem five.

74
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,320
   

75
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,570
OK, this one.

76
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,860
   

77
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,210
OK, it's a big question.

78
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,830
Let me see if I can copy and
paste the whole thing.

79
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,080
I've copied it.

80
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,270
   

81
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,520
All right.

82
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,110
   

83
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,040
I think it all fits
in the window.

84
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,960
Let's see, it says use
the proof to answer

85
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,110
the question below.

86
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:02,860
So given that side AB is
congruent to side BC.

87
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,810
So we could say that side
is equal to that side.

88
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,820
That's given.

89
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,440
D is the midpoint of AC.

90
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,220
So that means D is equidistant
between AC.

91
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,470
So that means that AD and
DC are equal length.

92
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,720
Let me write that.

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,910
   

94
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:27,225
Prove that triangle ABD is
congruent to to triangle CBD.

95
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,440
   

96
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,980
All right, and just so you know,
congruent triangles are

97
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,920
triangles that are the same in
every way, except they might

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,770
have been rotated.

99
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,040
They could have been rotated
in some way.

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,480
If you had similar triangles,
then you could also have

101
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,520
different side measures.

102
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,250
They're just kind of the same
shape, but they could be

103
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,120
expanded or contracted
in some way.

104
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,390
If you're congruent, you have
similar triangles but they

105
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,980
also have the same
side lengths.

106
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,060
But even though they have the
same side lengths, they could

107
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,900
be flipped over.

108
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,440
Like, you can just
look at this one.

109
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,420
ABD looks like it's a
mirror image of DBC.

110
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,610
So, just eyeballing it, it
already feels like they're

111
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,230
congruent triangles.

112
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,920
Let's see how they go
about proving it.

113
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,720
So statement one, AB
is congruent to BC,

114
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,240
they give us that.

115
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,740
D is the midpoint of AC.

116
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,070
That was given, fair enough.

117
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,870
AD is congruent to CD.

118
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,750
   

119
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,640
That's because D is the
midpoint of AC.

120
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,060
We did that part right there,
definition of midpoint.

121
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,420
Fair enough.

122
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,790
BD is congruent to
BD, of course.

123
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,300
Anything is congruent
to itself.

124
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,990
So that just says the BD for
that triangle is the same

125
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,450
length as the BD for
this triangle.

126
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,270
Fair enough, reflexive
property.

127
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,300
Fancy word for a very
simple idea.

128
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,870
And then finally, they
say triangle ABD is

129
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,270
congruent to CBD.

130
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,180
OK, well from the get-go, using
these statments, we've

131
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,640
already shown that they
have the same

132
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,050
exact three side measures.

133
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,470
Both triangles have a
side of length BD.

134
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,960
Both triangles have a side
of length AD or DC.

135
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,930
And both triangles have
a side of length BA.

136
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,570
So all of their sides
are the same length.

137
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:21,100
That's what we know after
the first three steps.

138
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,670
So what reason can be used
to prove that the

139
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,420
triangles are congruent?

140
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,230
Well we just said, these three
steps showed that all the

141
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,650
sides are the same.

142
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,060
So this SSS that you see.

143
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,660
What reason?

144
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,463
That means side, side, side.

145
00:06:34,463 --> 00:06:37,440
   

146
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,020
And that's just the argument
that you use in your geometry

147
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,500
class to say that all
three sides of both

148
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,910
triangles are congruent.

149
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,340
This means that you have an
angle, an angle, and a side.

150
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,570
This means that you have an
angle, and then the side

151
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,010
between the two angles.

152
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,360
And then the next angle that
all of those are congruent.

153
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,130
And this says that one of the
sides and the angle, and the

154
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,340
other side, that those
are congruent.

155
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,530
We'll probably run
into those in the

156
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,330
next couple of questions.

157
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,520
But anyway, this shows that
all three sides of both

158
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,690
triangles are equal.

159
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:12,630
And then so, we could say
by the side, side, side

160
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,730
reasoning, I'm not that
good with terminology.

161
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,230
By the side, side, side
reasoning, these are both

162
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,500
congruent triangles.

163
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,820
And I said, that's one of the
ways of thinking about a

164
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,540
congruent triangle, is that all
the sides are going to be

165
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,150
the same length.

166
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,400
Next question.

167
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,260
   

168
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,510
All right.

169
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:42,420
   

170
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,590
In the figure below, AB
is greater than BC.

171
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,740
OK, so this side is greater
than that side.

172
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,830
Although the way they drew it,
they all look the same.

173
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,760
So let's see what we can do.

174
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,250
If we assume that measure of
angle A is equal to measure of

175
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:19,030
angle C, it follows that
AB is equal to BC.

176
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,510
AB is equal to BC.

177
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,150
And I don't know if you've run
into this already, but you

178
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,910
learned that if you have two
angles that are congruent, or

179
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,030
if the measures are the same.

180
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,480
This is essentially saying
that angle A is

181
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,950
congruent to angle C.

182
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,230
They instead just wrote it as
that the measures of the

183
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,690
angles are equal.

184
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,570
That's what the definition of
congruence is, is that the

185
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,539
measures of the angles
are equal.

186
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,940
You could have written angle
A is congruent to angle C.

187
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,440
But anyway, if you have two
angles that are equal, then

188
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,670
the sides that are opposite
those angles are

189
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,960
also going to be equal.

190
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,750
So this side right here
is going to be

191
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,010
equal to that side.

192
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,980
And that's what they
wrote here.

193
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,830
It follows that AB
is equal to BC.

194
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,160
Fair enough.

195
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,180
Then they say this contradicts
the given statement that AB is

196
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,760
greater than BC.

197
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,880
Right, it says, it follows that
AB is equal to BC and it

198
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,680
contradicts this statement.

199
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,140
Where are they going
with this?

200
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,705
What conclusion can be drawn
from this contradiction?

201
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:23,190
   

202
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,100
Let's see, measure of
angle A is equal to

203
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,350
measure of angle B.

204
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,970
   

205
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,830
No, that's not the case.

206
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,900
I can think of an example.

207
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,450
These can both be 30
degree angles.

208
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,430
If these are both 30 degree
angles, add up to 60, then

209
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,840
this would have to be 120 for
them to all add up to 180.

210
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,550
And it would completely
gel with

211
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,490
everything else we've learned.

212
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,280
So, A is definitely not right.

213
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,560
That A does not have
to be equal to B.

214
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,680
Measure of A does not equal
the measure of angle B.

215
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,800
   

216
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,670
Well, they could, right?

217
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,770
All of these angles could
be 60 degrees.

218
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,380
We haven't said that B
definitely does not equal A.

219
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,970
This could be 60, that
could be 60, and so

220
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,790
could this be 60.

221
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,530
And we'd be dealing with an
equilateral triangle.

222
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,100
So I don't think that's
right either.

223
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,070
Measure of angle A is equal
to measure of angle C.

224
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:24,780
   

225
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,560
I see what they're
saying here.

226
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,330
Sorry, and this is my bad.

227
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,350
They're saying, AB is definitely
greater than BC.

228
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,920
   

229
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,800
Now, they said if we assume
that measure of angle A is

230
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,630
equal to measure of angle
C, it follows that

231
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,260
AB is equal to BC.

232
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,550
They didn't say that this
is definitely true.

233
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,520
They just said that if we assume
that this is true.

234
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,990
But they didn't say this
is a definite case.

235
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,710
And that's where the
contradiction came.

236
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,690
Because if we assumed it,
then AB could not be

237
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,540
greater than BC.

238
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,700
Because then AB would
equal BC.

239
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,590
So now I see what
they're asking.

240
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,040
So this is an assumption.

241
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,070
This isn't actually
proven to be true.

242
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,920
So this contradicts the given
statement that AB is

243
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,130
greater than BC.

244
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,410
Right, that's true.

245
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,640
What conclusion can be drawn
from this contradiction?

246
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,000
So we made the assumption that
the measure of angle A is

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,290
equal to the measure
of angle C.

248
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,740
That follows that these two
sides are equal, which

249
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,840
contradicted the given
statement.

250
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,790
Therefore, we know that the
measures of these two angles

251
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,710
cannot be equal to each other.

252
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,220
Because if they were, then we
would contradict the given

253
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,310
assumption.

254
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,440
So, we know from the
contradiction that the measure

255
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,580
of angle A cannot equal the
measure of angle C.

256
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,490
And we can't make that
assumption because it leads to

257
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,390
a contradiction.

258
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,620
So the correct answer is D.

259
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,900
All right, I'll see you
in the next video.
