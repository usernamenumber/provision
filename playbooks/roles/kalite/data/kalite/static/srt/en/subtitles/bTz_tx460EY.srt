00:00:01,091 --> 00:00:05,224
We have learned that a moderate level of inflation is normally associated with a good economy

2
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:11,122
but what we saw in particular in the early 70's in 1973 when the oil embargo hit

3
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:18,181
is that we started to experience something called stagflation something that was labelled stagflation

4
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:25,379
it is a bizarre circumstance where you have inflation at the same time as stagnation in the economy.

5
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,116
That's where they get this combination of words of stagflation.

6
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,602
Lets think about how that would happen.

7
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:34,807
In particular, lets think about how that would happpen due to a supply shock.

8
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:36,757
There's other ways that you can get stagflation.

9
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:41,912
If you have strange regulation, over regulation, if the government does weird things

10
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:48,190
But the classic example is a supply shock. When we say supply shock is something like an oil embargo

11
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:56,076
where all of the sudden the supply of oil or something goes down dramatically

12
00:00:56,076 --> 00:01:01,417
it could be because of some kind of emergency or it could be because of an embargo

13
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:05,596
Just think about how that would affect the rest of this chain

14
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:08,661
so if the supply of something dramatically goes down

15
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:11,866
we know that supply has an inverse relationship with price

16
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:17,671
so supply goes down then price immediately goes up

17
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:23,336
and we think about something like oil you might say oil is only part of my pocket book when I drive around

18
00:01:23,336 --> 00:01:24,265
but it's not

19
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:26,819
because even when you buy a fruit you are really paying for the transportation cost

20
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,206
so the price of oil affects fruit, affects food, affects any goods and services

21
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:34,621
it's one of those things that is pervasive through the economy

22
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:38,662
so prices of a bunch of things could generally go up

23
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:44,931
well, if the price of a bunch of things generally go up what's going to happen to demand

24
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:48,252
demand is going to plummet

25
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:52,993
if demand plummets, utilization plummets

26
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:55,601
if utilization plummets, investment plummets and profits are going to plummet

27
00:01:55,632 --> 00:02:00,651
profits are going to plummet now because

28
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:05,481
utilization is going down and prices have gone up, but it's not the price that they can sell things at

29
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:09,149
Now price is fundamentally a big cost

30
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,865
specially if you think about it from a US centered point of view

31
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,372
if oil is an import in the case in the early 70's

32
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:24,196
then price going up is going to have an inverse relationship

33
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:26,982
so the price goes up is really going to be on the cost side

34
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:28,886
so once again hitting profits hard

35
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:36,595
and if all of these things go down that's just going to kill employment, kill wages and then further make demand even worse

36
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:41,518
so stagflation is that situation where you have some type of shock to the system

37
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:48,716
where, in the classic scenario, it hits supply so hard it causes a massive inflation in one part of the economy

38
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:52,013
and in the case of oil, it affects other parts of the economy

39
00:02:52,013 --> 99:59:59,999
and then all of that kind of throws a monkey wrench in everything else.
