1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,200
SAL: Two videos ago we learned
about half-lives.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,750
And we saw that they're good if
we are trying to figure out

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,020
how much of a compound we have
left after one half-life, or

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,830
two half-lives, or
three half-lives.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,250
We can just take 1/2 of the
compound at every period.

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,940
But it's not as useful if we're
trying to figure out how

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,960
much of a compound we have after
1/2 of a half-life, or

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,610
after one day, or 10 seconds,
or 10 billion years.

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,030
And to address that issue in the
last video, I proved that

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,720
it involved a little bit
of sophisticated math.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,490
And if you haven't taken
calculus, you can really just

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,220
skip that video.

14
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,990
You don't have to watch it
for an intro math class.

15
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,180
But if you're curious, that's
where we proved

16
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:38,950
the following formula.

17
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,050
That at any given point of
time, if you have some

18
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,220
decaying atom, some element,
it can be described as the

19
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,220
amount of element you have at
any period of time is equal to

20
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,080
the amount you started off
with, times e to some

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,280
constant-- in the last
video I use lambda.

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,450
I could use k this time--
minus k times t.

23
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,670
And then for a particular
element with a particular

24
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,980
half-life you can just solve for
the k, and then apply it

25
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,660
to your problem.

26
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,030
So let's do that in this video,
just so that all of

27
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,110
these variables can become a
little bit more concrete.

28
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,790
So let's figure out the general
formula for carbon.

29
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,660
Carbon-14, that's the one that
we addressed in the half-life.

30
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:24,530
We saw that carbon-14 has a
half-life of 5,730 years.

31
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,200
So let's see if we can somehow
take this information and

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,390
apply it to this equation.

33
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,500
So this tells us that after
one half-life-- so

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,360
t is equal to 5,730.

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,930
N of 5,730 is equal to the
amount we start off with.

36
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,320
So we're starting off with,
well, we're starting off with

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,590
N sub 0 times e to the minus--
wherever you see the t you put

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:02:01,180
the minus 5,730-- so minus
k, times 5,730.

39
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,860
That's how many years
have gone by.

40
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,660
And half-life tells us that
after 5,730 years we'll have

41
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,690
1/2 of our initial
sample left.

42
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,050
So we'll have 1/2 of our
initial sample left.

43
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,580
So if we try to solve
this equation for

44
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,000
k, what do we get?

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,180
Divide both sides by N naught.

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,110
Get rid of that variable, and
then we're left with e to the

47
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,620
minus 5,730k-- I'm just
switching these two around--

48
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,075
is equal to 1/2.

49
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:32,060
If we take the natural log of
both sides, what do we get?

50
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,702
   

51
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:38,220
The natural log of e to
anything, the natural log of e

52
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,540
to the a is just a.

53
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:47,170
So the natural log of this is
minus 5,730k is equal to the

54
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,030
natural log of 1/2.

55
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,950
I just took the natural
log of both sides.

56
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,940
The natural log and natural
log of both sides of that.

57
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,400
And so to solve for k, we could
just say, k is equal to

58
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:08,170
the natural log of 1/2 over
minus 5,730, which we did in

59
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,030
the previous video.

60
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,860
But let's see if we can do that
again here, to avoid--

61
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,560
for those who might
have skipped it.

62
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,590
So if you have 1/2, 0.5, take
the natural log, and then you

63
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:29,580
divide it by 5,730, it's a
negative 5,730, you get 1.2

64
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,380
times 10 to the negative 4.

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,830
So it equals 1.2 times
10 to the minus 4.

66
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,250
So now we have the general
formula for carbon-14, given

67
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,480
its half-life.

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,990
At any given point in time,
after our starting point-- so

69
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:52,940
this is for, let's call this for
carbon-14, for c-14-- the

70
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,560
amount of carbon-14 we're going
to have left is going to

71
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,690
be the amount that we started
with times e to the minus k. k

72
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,070
we just solved for.

73
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,930
1.2 times 10 to the minus 4,
times the amount of time that

74
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,360
has passed by.

75
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,700
This is our formula for
carbon, for carbon-14.

76
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,650
If we were doing this for some
other element, we would use

77
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,610
that element's half-life to
figure out how much we're

78
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,660
going to have at any given
period of time to figure out

79
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,170
the k value.

80
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,880
So let's use this to
solve a problem.

81
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,680
Let's say that I start off
with, I don't know, say I

82
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:34,530
start off with 300 grams
of carbon, carbon-14.

83
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,150
And I want to know, how much do
I have after, I don't know,

84
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,250
after 2000 years?

85
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,510
How much do I have?

86
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,940
Well I just plug into
the formula.

87
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:53,900
N of 2000 is equal to the amount
that I started off

88
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:02,670
with, 300 grams, times e to the
minus 1.2 times 10 to the

89
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,990
minus 4, times t, is times
2000, times 2000.

90
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,330
So what is that?

91
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,230
So I already have that 1.2 times
10 the minus 4 there.

92
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,920
So let me say, times 2000
equals-- and of course, this

93
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,790
throws a negative out there,
so let me put the negative

94
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,730
number out there.

95
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,060
So there's a negative.

96
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,130
And I have to raise
e to this power.

97
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,430
So it's 0.241.

98
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,790
So this is equal to N of 2000.

99
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,110
The amount of the substance I
can expect after 2000 years is

100
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:42,630
equal to 300 times e to
the minus 0.2419.

101
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,370
And let's see, my calculator
doesn't have an e to the

102
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,660
power, so Let me just take e.

103
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,900
I need to get a better
calculator.

104
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,840
I should get my scientific
calculator back.

105
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,830
But e is, let's say 2.71-- I
can keep adding digits but

106
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:05,130
I'll just do 2.71-- to the 0.24
negative, which is equal

107
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:13,830
to 0.78 times the amount that I
started off with, times 300,

108
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:21,550
which is equal to 236 grams. So
this is equal to 236 grams.

109
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,480
So just like that, using this
exponential decay formula, I

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,140
was able to figure out how
much of the carbon I have

111
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,890
after kind of an unusual
period of time, a

112
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,540
non-half-life period of time.

113
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,080
Let's do another
one like this.

114
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,170
Let's go the other way around.

115
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,430
Let's say, I'm trying
to figure out.

116
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:48,980
Let's say I start off with
400 grams of c-14.

117
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,440
And I want to know how long--
so I want to know a certain

118
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,790
amount of time-- does it
take for me to get to

119
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,380
350 grams of c-14?

120
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,040
So, you just say that 350
grams is how much

121
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,870
I'm ending up with.

122
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,570
It's equal to the amount that I
started off with, 400 grams,

123
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,430
times e to the minus k.

124
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,160
That's minus 1.2 times 10 to
the minus 4, times time.

125
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,190
And now we solve for time.

126
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,620
How do we do that?

127
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,840
Well we could divide
both sides by 400.

128
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,960
What's 350 divided by 400?

129
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,180
350 by 400.

130
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,340
It's 7/8.

131
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,230
So 0.875.

132
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:37,780
So you get 0.875 is equal to e
to the minus 1.2 times 10 to

133
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,100
the minus 4t.

134
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,890
You take the natural
log of both sides.

135
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,460
You get the natural log of
0.875 is equal to-- the

136
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,100
natural log of e to anything is
just the anything-- so it's

137
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,990
equal to minus 1.2 times
10 to the minus 4t.

138
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,280
And so t is equal to this
divided by 1.2 times 10

139
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,130
to the minus 4.

140
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:07,560
So the natural log, 0.875
divided by minus 1.2 times 10

141
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,650
to the minus 4, is equal to the
amount of time it would

142
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,620
take us to get from
400 grams to 350.

143
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,535
[PHONE RINGS]

144
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,930
My cell phone is ringing,
let me turn that off.

145
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,350
To 350.

146
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,120
So let me do the math.

147
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,030
So if you have 0.875, and we
want to take the natural log

148
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:37,120
of it, and divide it by minus
1.-- So divided by 1.2e 4

149
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,480
negative, 10 to the
negative 4.

150
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,169
This is all a negative number.

151
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,250
Oh, I'll just divide it by this,
and then just take the

152
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,290
negative of that.

153
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,170
Equals that and then I have
to take a negative.

154
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:55,410
So this is equal to 1,112 years
to get from 400 to 350

155
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,440
grams of my substance.

156
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,970
This might seem a little
complicated, but if there's

157
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,890
one thing you just have to do,
is you just have to remember

158
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,570
this formula.

159
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,160
And if you want to know where
it came from, watch the

160
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,230
previous video.

161
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,370
For any particular element you
solve for this k value.

162
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,000
And then you just substitute
what you know, and then solve

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,230
for what you don't know.

164
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,030
I'll do a couple more of these
in the next video.
