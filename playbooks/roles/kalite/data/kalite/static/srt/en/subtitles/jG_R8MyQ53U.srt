1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,920
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,990
I'm now on page 460 and we'll start with the number five.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,000
And they have a little drawing for us.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,270
Let's see, if I had a little box like that,

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,300
I'll do it in yellow.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,760
So the box looks something like this.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,130
And then it has a bunch of lines.

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,860
It has a line like that.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,550
It has a line like that.

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,300
It has a line like that.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,960
It has a line like that.

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,320
And then they have a couple of points here.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,480
They have-- let me switch to the pen.That's too dark.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:56,750
So you have point A, B, C, and D.

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,520
And the question is, in the figure above,

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,590
a path from point A to point D

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,640
is determined by moving upwards

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,280
or to the right along the gridlines--

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,350
so you have to move along the yellow lines--

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,360
how many different paths can be drawn from A to D

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,200
that do not include either B or C?

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,200
So we can't have either B or C in our path

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,450
that goes from A to D.

24
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,370
So the way I think about it is,which of the--

25
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,050
you know if we call these yellow lines roads,

26
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,950
I guess-- which of these roads would be unusable

27
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,300
if I can't go to B or to C?

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,970
Well, let me mark the unusable roads.

29
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,440
Well,the unusable roads would be the roads that

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,000
their only purpose is to get to B or go away from B,

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,380
or get to C or go away from C.

32
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,550
So, for example, this road right here,

33
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,940
all it does is go towards B or go away from B,

34
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,190
so we can't use that

35
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,550
because we're not going to go through B.

36
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,530
Similarly, we can't use that road, can't use this road,

37
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,760
and we can't use this road, right?

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,590
Because those are all the roads that come to and from B.

39
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,740
So we're not going to use those.

40
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,150
The only reason why you would use those roads

41
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,650
is if you went through B, so you can't use those.

42
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,270
And similarly for C, same thing,you can't use that one,

43
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,970
can't use that one, can't use that one,

44
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,560
and can't use that one.

45
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,390
So what are we left with?

46
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,250
We might as well just erase those roads, right?

47
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,300
Because they're kind of just messing up the picture, right?

48
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,010
So let me just erase them.

49
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,200
So let me erase all the roads that I can't use.

50
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,360
I can't use any of these because I can't go through B or C.

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,890
And then it's going to start looking a lot clearer.

52
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,510
Then the problem gets really easy.

53
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,540
So these are all the roads I can use to go from A to D.

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,370
So how many paths are there?

55
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:57,230
Well, that's one path, one.

56
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,590
I can do this.

57
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,620
Two paths. Three paths. Four paths.

58
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,830
And that's choice B. I hope I'm right.

59
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,710
At least my choice exists.

60
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:22,530
Problem number six, if 3/7 of n is 42--

61
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,950
so if I write that algebraically,

62
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,020
that's just saying 3/7 times n is equal to 42.

63
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,080
And they want to know what 5/7 of n is,

64
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,220
so they want to know 5/7n.

65
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,050
Well, to solve for n here,

66
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,830
I just multiply both sides times the reciprocal.

67
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,580
So let me do that. So 7 over 3--

68
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm just multiplying both sides of the equation by 7 over 3.

69
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,820
So this cancels out, right?

70
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,930
So we could say n is equal to 7 over 3 times 42.

71
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,670
And now we want to know 5/7 times n,

72
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,750
so we just take this n, place it here.

73
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,100
So it'd be 5/7 times this thing-- right?

74
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,570
This is n-- times 7 over 3, times 42.

75
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,080
And notice, I just kept it that way

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,750
because the 7's ended up cancelling out,

77
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,470
so I have to do less arithmetic.

78
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,690
So scratch those out.

79
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,450
And then let's see, five times 42 over 3--

80
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,180
let's see, what's 42 divided by 3?

81
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,160
It's what? 14, right?

82
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,290
Because 30 and 12. Right, it's 14.

83
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,910
So this goes to 1, this goes to 14, and 5 times 14 is 70.

84
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,570
And that is choice A.

85
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,840
So all you do is you can just solve for n and then

86
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,630
multiply by 5/7.

87
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,140
It's not too fancy.

88
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,980
This is probably one just to see how fast

89
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,650
can you do this type of problem.

90
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,590
OK, clear image, invert.

91
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,080
All right,I'm on problem number seven and I'm getting sleepy

92
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,190
I'm just going to go to bed after this video.

93
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,970
All right, the figure above-- well,

94
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,250
let me draw the figure above.

95
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,560
We have that,

96
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:14,700
and then we don't know what this figure is for,just yet.

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:28,450
And then they say A,B, C, D, E, and F.

98
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,160
And now let's read the problem.

99
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,150
The figure above shows the top view of an open square box

100
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,200
that is divided into six compartments

101
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,150
with walls of equal height.

102
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,570
Each of the rectangles D, E,and F

103
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,380
have twice the area of each of the equal squares A,B,and C.

104
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,310
So they're saying D is twice the area of A, I guess, right?

105
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,350
The way I drew it, it looks like a little more,

106
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,740
but we know this is twice the area of this, OK.

107
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,250
When a marble is dropped into the box at random--

108
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,620
so it's kind of being dropped from above into this box--

109
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,720
it falls into one of the compartments.

110
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,950
What is the probability that it will fall into compartment F?

111
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,970
So the way you really just have to think about it,

112
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,280
the marble has an equal chance of falling anywhere

113
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,360
on this square.

114
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,310
And so,

115
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,930
if you want to know the probability that it falls into F,

116
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,960
you just have to figure out

117
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,700
the fraction of the area that F is of the entire square.

118
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,050
So if we said that A has an area of x,

119
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,580
then B also has an area of x, and C also has an area of x,

120
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,450
and they told us that these are twice these,

121
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,060
so this would be 2x, this would be 2x,

122
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,530
and this would be 2x, so the total area would be what?

123
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,360
It would be x plus x, plus x.

124
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,600
So 3x plus 2x, plus 2x, plus 2x.

125
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,660
So these three are 6x, so the total area is 9x,right?

126
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,820
9x is the total area of the box.

127
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,370
I mean, we don't know how big x is,

128
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,950
but 9x is its total area of the box.

129
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,830
And F is 2x, right? F is 2x.

130
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:15,390
So the area of F over total area--

131
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,370
I don't like this toothpaste blue color,but we'll deal.

132
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,050
So the area of F,

133
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,360
I wrote here before I scratched it out, is 2x.

134
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,270
Over the total area is 9x,and the x's cancel out.

135
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,150
So F is 2/9 of this total box's area,

136
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,080
so there's a 2/9 probability that a marble dropped randomly

137
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,480
on top of this box,

138
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,690
with kind of a uniform distribution anywhere in the box,

139
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:46,150
there's a 2/9 chance that it will fall into cubby E.

140
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,760
Sorry, cubby F, that's what they asked us in the question.

141
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,790
And actually,it would also be 2/9 that it would fall into

142
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,950
cubby hole E, because it's the same area.

143
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,070
Problem number eight.

144
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,580
So if a and b are odd integers,

145
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,000
which of the following must also be an odd integer?

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,990
Oh, these are fun.

147
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:17,590
All right, so choice one they give is a plus 1 times b.

148
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,970
Well, can this be odd?

149
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,470
Let's just try it with some numbers.

150
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,840
Let's say a and b are 3 and 5, right?

151
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,220
These are two odd integers.

152
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:35,350
If a is 3, then a plus 1 is 4,times 5, this equals 20.

153
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,040
So we immediately, we ended up getting an even answer.

154
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,340
And that makes sense, because if you take an odd number,

155
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,150
add 1, you get an even number.

156
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,030
And anything times an even is even,

157
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,440
so it's not going to be choice one.

158
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,540
Choice one is going to give us an even number,

159
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,130
actually, no matter what. Choice two.

160
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,440
a plus 1 plus b.

161
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,500
So we figured out that a plus 1, this is going to be even,

162
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,250
and we know that b is odd.

163
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,330
And you could try this out,but if you take an even number

164
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,000
and you were to add an odd number to it,

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,650
you're going to get an odd number.

166
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,540
And that makes sense, I mean,

167
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,030
you could try it out with a bunch of different numbers,

168
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,410
but that's always going to happen.

169
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,080
Because if you add an even number to an even number

170
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,180
you get another even number.

171
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,410
And then if you add one more,an odd number--

172
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,850
I think you get the point.

173
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,170
And you could try it out with our 3 and 5 examples.

174
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,650
That wouldn't prove it for sure,

175
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,190
but it does work for that example.

176
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,820
And then similarly,a plus 1 minus b.

177
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,010
It's the same notion.

178
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,990
I mean, you could try it out with some numbers.

179
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,310
But if you have an even number here--

180
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,060
because an odd plus 1 is even--

181
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,040
and then if you were to subtract another odd number,

182
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,470
you'd also get an odd number.

183
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,410
So the choice is E.

184
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,850
See you soon.
