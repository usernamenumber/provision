1
00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:07,657
In this video and in the next few videos we'll actually be doing a bunch of calculations about this data set right over here.

2
00:00:07,657 --> 00:00:12,608
And hopefully just going through those calculations will give you an intuitive sense of what the analysis

3
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:18,941
of variance is all about. Now the first thing I wanna do in this video is calculate the total sum of

4
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:27,455
squares. So I call that 'SST'. Sum of squares total. And you could view it as really the numerator when

5
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:31,576
you calculate the variance. So we're just gonna take the distance between of each of these data points

6
00:00:31,576 --> 00:00:36,078
and the mean of all of these data points, square them and just take that sum, we'll not really divide

7
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:40,732
by the degree of freedom, which you normally do if you're calculating sample variance.

8
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:45,279
Now what is this going to be? Well the first thing we got to do is we have to figure out the mean of

9
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:49,692
all of this stuff over here. And I'm actually gonna call that the grand mean.

10
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:53,359
I'm gonna call that the grand mean. And let me show you in a second that it's the same thing as the mean

11
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:59,013
of the means of each of these data sets. So let's calculate the grand means.

12
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:16,152
So that's gonna be 3 plus 2 plus 1. 3 plus 2 plus 1 plus 5 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7 ... plus 5 plus 6 plus 7.

13
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:22,102
And then we have nine data points here. We have nine data points so we're gonna divide by nine and then

14
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:30,354
this is gonna be equal to '...'. 3 plus 2 plus 1 is 6. 6 plus, let me just.. er so these are 6. 5 plus

15
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:43,944
3 plus 4 is, that's 12. And then 5 plus 6 plus seven is 18. And then 6 plus 12 is 18, plus another 18 is 36

16
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:50,241
divided by nine is equal to 4. Let me show you that that's the exact same thing as the mean of the means.

17
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:57,056
So this, the mean of this group one over here, that's seen in green, the mean of group one over here

18
00:01:57,056 --> 00:02:03,856
is 3 plus 2 plus 1, that's 6 right over here, divided by 3 data points, so that would be equal to 2.

19
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:12,677
The mean of group 2, the sum here is 12, we saw that right over here: 5 plus 3 plus 4 is 12, divided

20
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:21,846
by 3 is 4, cause we have three data points. And then the mean of group 3, 5 plus 6 plus 7

21
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:27,256
is 18 divided by 3 is 6. So if you're gonna take the mean of the means

22
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:31,015
which is in another way this grand mean, you have 2 plus 4 plus 6

23
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:35,892
which is 12 divided by 3 means here and once again you'd get 4.

24
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:38,933
So you can view this the mean of all of the data and all of the groups

25
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:43,600
or the mean of the means of each of these groups. But either way now that we've calculated it

26
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,836
we can actually figure out the total sum of squares. So let's do that.

27
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:57,887
So it's going to be equal to: 3 minus 4, the 4 is this 4 right over here, squared plus

28
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:05,667
2 minus 4 squared plus 1 minus 4 squared, now I'll do these guys over here in purple,

29
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:16,031
plus 5 minus 4 squared plus 3 minus 4 squared plus 4 minus 4 squared

30
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:20,667
I'll just scroll over here a little bit, plus 4 minus 4 squared. Now we only have three left.

31
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:32,887
Plus 5 minus 4 squared plus 6 minus 4 squared plus 7 minus 4 squared. Now what does this give us?

32
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:38,436
So up here this first is gonna be equal to, 3 minus 4 the difference is 1, you square it,

33
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:42,200
you're gonna get, er, it's actually a negative 1, you square it you get one.

34
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:51,000
Plus, you get negative 2 squared is 4 plus negative 3 squared. Negative 3 squared is 9.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,698
And then we have here in the magenta: 5 minus 4 is 1, squared is still 1. 3 minus 4 squared is 1 you

36
00:03:57,698 --> 00:04:03,210
square it again you still get 1 and 4 minus 4 is just a 0. So we can ... let me just write a 0 here

37
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,985
just to show you that we actually calculated that. And then we have these last 3 data points.

38
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:16,667
5 minus 4 squared, that's one. 6 minus 4 squared, that is 4, it's 2 squared. And then plus 7 minus 4 is 3

39
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:24,952
squared is 9. So what's this going to be equal to. So I have 1 plus 4 plus 9.

40
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:33,436
1 plus 4 plus 9 right over here, that's 5 plus 9. This right over here is 14, right?

41
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:39,638
5 plus ..., yep, 14. And we also have another 14 right over here cause we have a 1 plus 4 plus 9

42
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:43,632
so that right over there is also 14. And then we have 2 over here. So it's gonna be

43
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:55,056
28, 14 times 2, 14 plus 14 is 28, plus 2 is 30. Is equal to 30. So our total sum of squares

44
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:59,561
And actually if we wanted the variance here we would divide this by the degrees of freedom.

45
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:05,551
And these are multiple times the degrees of freedom here. So let's say, let's say that we have

46
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:11,031
so we know we have m groups over here, so let me just write this m. And, I'm not gonna

47
00:05:11,031 --> 00:05:14,236
prove things rigorously here but I want you to show, I wanna show you

48
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:18,740
where some of these strange formulas that show up in statistics would actually come from

49
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:25,667
without proving it rigorously, more to give you the intuition. So we have m groups here

50
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:34,344
and each group here has n members. So how many total members do we have here?

51
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:41,498
Well we have m times n or 9, right? 3 times 3 total members. So degrees of freedom, we remember, you

52
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:47,800
have this many, however many data points you have minus 1 degrees of freedom. Because if you know

53
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,800
if you knew the mean of means, if you know the mean of means, if you assume you knew that

54
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,323
then you only would, would only n, only, er, hehe. 9 minus 1, only 8 of these were going to give you

55
00:05:59,323 --> 00:06:04,471
new information because if you know that you could calculate the last, or it really wouldn't have to be the

56
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:09,824
last one if you have the other 8 you can calculate this one. If you have 8 of them you could always calculate

57
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:16,600
the 9th one using the mean of means. So one way to think about it is that theres only 8 independent

58
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,883
measurements here. Or if you want to talk in terms of general, you want to talk in general, there are

59
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:30,397
m times n, so that is total number of samples, minus 1 degrees of freedom.

60
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:41,810
And if you're actually calculating the variance here we would just divide 30 by m times n minus 1.

61
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,077
Or this is another way of saying 8 degrees of freedom for this exact example. You take 30

62
00:06:47,077 --> 00:06:53,000
divided by 8 and you actually have the variance for this entire group, the group of 9 [...].

63
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,533
I'll leave you here in this video. In the next video we're gonna try to figure out how much of this total

64
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:08,333
variance, how much of this total squared sum, total variation, comes from the variation

65
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:14,313
within each of these groups versus the variation between the groups. And I think you'll

66
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:19,667
get a sense of where this whole analysis of variance is coming from. Look there is the variance

67
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:24,800
of this entire sample of nine but some of that variance, if these groups are different in some way,

68
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,267
might come from the variation from being in different groups versus the variation from being within a

69
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:34,564
group. We're gonna calculate those two things and we're going to see that they're going to add up

70
00:07:34,579 --> 99:59:59,999
to the total square sum variation.
