99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want to introduce you to in this video,

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the idea of a Keynesian Cross.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is one of the tools of analysis of Keynesian thinking.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which is really the idea that

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe every now and then the GDP, when it's at

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equilibrium, isn't at an optimal state

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's operating well below potential.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the way that we might be able to get,

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you are a follower of Keynesian thinking,

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the way we can get it closer to potential;

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
closer to full employment is by somehow affecting

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
aggregate demand in some way.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What we will see is;

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're going to build up our Keynesian cross

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
analysis based on what we understand from

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the consumption function.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So were going to first start thinking about

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
planned expenditures. Think about what happens

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when planned expenditures deviates from

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
actual output, from actual expenditures.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So right over here. So this is very similiar

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to what we have done before, but we're actually

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thinking about it in terms of planning.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets say we have planned expenditures, expenditures planned.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we could just write the components of

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
aggregate expenditures here.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well you're going to have consumer spending

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you're going to have investment,

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and i'm going to be careful here, I'm going

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to call it planned investment. This is exactly

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what firms are looking to produce.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The reason why I differentiate this here is because,

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if for whatever reason aggregate expenditure

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is less than they expect, then they might

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
build up inventory, and those inventories

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
get counted as investments.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So those would be excess inventories above and beyond

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
planned inventories. If actual demand is higher

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
than expected, then it might eat into inventories

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and when inventories are eaten into

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it actually takes away from planned investment.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you would actually be eating into total investment in that situation.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's why I'm going to differentiate

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
between planned investment, and actual investment.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then of course you have government spending,

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then finally you have net exports.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And for the sake of analysis of the Keynesian Cross,

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and once again this is a super over simplification,

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were going to assume that at any given level

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of GDP or aggregate output that these are all constant.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That these are not really dependent

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on aggregate output or GDP.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which is of course a huge over-simplification.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we were to plot any of these, verses

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
aggregate income we'd say that they are really a flat line.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So maybe planned investment might look something like that.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe government spending would look something like that.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
At some level it's pre-planned,

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's kind of exogenous to our model,

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's not dependent in any way,

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's an external factor, assuming it's fixed

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's not dependent on aggregate income.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So government spending would look something like that.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And net exports maybe it looks something like that.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The factor that you can imagine,

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cause I said we were going to build on top of the consumption function,

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we are going to assume is driven by aggregate income,

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is consumption right over here.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so the way that this thing will look is, you have.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me draw another plot right over here.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have aggregate income,

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is going to be our independent variable.

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then over here we can just view this as expenditure.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we were to just plot consumer spending,

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we've seen that before;

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
especially if we assume a linear consumption function.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what we studied in the last few videos

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these are all linear consumption functions,

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and depending on how you write it.

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But they all look something like this;

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they all have a positive vertical axis intercept,

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they all have an upwards slope that is less then one.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So consumption by itself would look something like this.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This would be consumer spending

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as a function of aggregate income.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if you add all of these constants to it,

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then your graph for aggregate planned expenditures,

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
would look something like this.

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you added just net exports it would be a little higher.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because these are constant, at any point you just add this much.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you add government a little higher then that,

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if you add all of them, including planned investments,

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you might get something that looks,

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and i'll do it in this color over here,

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you might get something that looks like this.

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So im just starting off with consumer spending.

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm using a linear consumption function.

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You dont have to but it makes the Keynesian Cross analysis,

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a lot more cross like, and easier to analyse.

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then if you add all of what we assume

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to be constant things, then aggregate expenditures

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be up here.

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this right over here is aggregate planned expenditures,

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I should say.

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now we know, from the circular flow in the economy,

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that when an economy is at equilibrium,

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your aggregate output is equal to your aggregate expenditures,

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or your aggregate expenditures is equal to your aggregate income.

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So really in an equilibrium these two things are going to be equal.

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we can actually plot a line that shows

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
all the points that those are equal.

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That would be a line that has essentially a slope of one.

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Where Y is always equal to expenditures.

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it might look something like this,

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is where the name Keynesian Cross comes from.

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Cause essentially you have planned expenditures,

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then right over here you have the equilibrium line,

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or what I call the equilibrium line.

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because these are all points where income is equal to expenditure.

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So when you look at aggregate planned expenditures.

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or you could even, kind of, view this as aggregate demand,

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as a function of aggregate income.

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the actual point where the economy is at equilibrium.

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Where expenditures are actually equal to output.

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And actually it's a little skewed the way I drew it

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this should acually be a square

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
actually let me see if I can draw it a little clearer then that

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just so it looks like a 45 degree line

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so maybe it looks

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it shoudl really be a 45 degree line, so that seems a little bit better

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so thats the point at which we are at equilibrium

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and actually I dont like that cause it makes it a little more difficult to analyse

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this should be a line where expenditures should be equal to aggregate income

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so ill do it like this,

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that it intersects at a point thats a little easier to analyse

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now this is where the Keynesian cross kind of becomes an interesting tool

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because we can start to think about a situation

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is an equilibrium level of GDP

139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what happens if for whatever reason

140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
aggregate input is higher then that level

141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's think about that scenario

142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets say were over here. let's call that y1

143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so what is going on over here at y1?

144
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over here the aggregate output,

145
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is the same thing as aggregate income

146
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is right over here, well this is the actual planned expenditures

147
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is right over here

148
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so all of this excess above the planned demand

149
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be inventories building up

150
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the economy is producing

151
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
more then it actually needs, inventories are going to build up

152
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
firms are not selling all of their product

153
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that excess build up in inventory is going to be reflected in investment

154
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so in this case this delta is going to be added

155
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to your planned investment to get what your actual investment will be

156
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and when an economy is at that state

157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then firms say "Oh my God were building inventories, were not selling our product,

158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were going to lower our output" so there's

159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sort of a natural feedback mechanism for the

160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
GDP to go back to equilibrium

161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and lets think about what happens if were below that equilibrium point

162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lets say that GDP is right over here

163
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that's Y2, actually i could write it as a subscript

164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I wrote it as a super script there

165
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but we can call this Y2

166
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so over here aggregate demand, at this level of output

167
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is more than what is actually being output

168
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
people want more goods and services

169
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is kind of a deficite of output

170
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so this shows that people will be digging into

171
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
inventories that the existing inventories, or the existing investment

172
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
was not enough. Inventories will be contracting.

173
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if I had a business, say a lemonade stand

174
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I just keep an inventory of 5 cups on hand

175
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if I sell a cup every hour

176
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if people suddenly start buying two cups an hour

177
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
my inventory is going to start getting depleted

178
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is whats reflected

179
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
actual output is below what's demanded

180
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and when firms start seeing that their inventoreis

181
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are getting depleted they say

182
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Oh my God, I dont want to run out of my goods and services,

183
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me start producing more"

184
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and when were talking about inventories were really talking about goods

185
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let me produce more. So output once again again will naturally want to go to

186
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that feedback point

187
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so hopefully that makes a little bit of sense

188
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the next few videos we are going to be using the

189
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Keynesian Cross to think about how the Kenesian line of reasoning
