1
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:10,343
Before the emperor ruled Rome, Rome was ruled by a Republic, by a senate

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:18,002
The kind of counsel of elders. These genrally were older men who had come from the elite families in Rome

3
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:22,583
and so when we think of the people recorded the most privileged the most power in the roman republic

4
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:27,566
these were older men. And their age, their experience is what counted.

5
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:33,489
And so we find during this period of the republic specially the period of the late republic sculptures

6
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:40,818
for the sculpture seems to have taken every pain to record a real sense of age and experience

7
00:00:40,818 --> 00:00:46,357
One example of Veristic orchard is invadigan from the very late republican period,

8
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:55,532
This is just before Julius Ceasar will begin the process of turing the republic into an empire. We refer to these as Veristic potraits.

9
00:00:55,532 --> 00:01:02,369
It comes from the latin word vÄ“rus which means truth and so there is this idea that they are very truthful. But it may be that there is an exaggeration

10
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:09,489
of that sense of experience, wisdom and age. We see a head of a man that probably came from a much larger

11
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:15,654
sculpture ultimately we see his head is covered with a toga which suggests that he was involved with some sort of ritual

12
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:22,043
concern his express through the eyes. Look at the way that the lips which area quote thin that are pressed together.

13
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:29,743
There is a solemnity. there is a seriousness, there is a kind of authority that is born of the qualities of the face that we are

14
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:35,429
seeing. As we look at this shelf with six or eight busts along it. This face stands out,

15
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,305
It is really different from the tradition that was developed during the empire.

16
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:46,975
Augustus becomes the first emperor of Rome and establishes a tradition that looks back to ancient Greece

17
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:54,699
and the tendency that we see there to idiolize the human face and the human body. So this kind of

18
00:01:54,699 --> 00:02:00,452
veristic potrait will come to represent later on noble republican idiols.

19
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:05,645
What's interesting is that we see in the later images of emperors that

20
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:10,381
they choose to some degree more or less to idiolize themselves

21
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:17,841
So that if they have themselves portrayed more realistically they are recalling the virtues of the ancient Romans Republic

22
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:22,301
If they idiolize themselves more they are calling ancient Greek tradition.

23
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:25,776
So in other words this was a very conscious set of attributes that

24
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:28,603
was a very conscious set of symbols that you could draw on more or less.

25
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:30,960
It was a visual language.

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,802
It's so interesting that if you think about the way that we represent ourselves now.

27
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:39,777
If you open up a magazine, you have young models that are ideal, that are perfect.

28
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:45,043
And the older hold not even primary status in our visual culture.

29
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:49,043
But the ancient Romans atleast for a moment felt differently
