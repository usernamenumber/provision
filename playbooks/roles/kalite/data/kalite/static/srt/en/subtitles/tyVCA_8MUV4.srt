1
00:00:00,825 --> 00:00:04,406
Now that we have our parameterization right over here

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:08,588
Let's get down to the business of actually evaluating this surface integral

3
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:11,274
And its a little bit involved, but we'll try and do it step by step

4
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:15,042
So the first thing I'm going to do is figure out what D Sigma is

5
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:19,292
In terms of S and T, in terms of our parameters

6
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:25,974
So we can turn this whole thing into a double integral in the S-T plane

7
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:32,939
And remember D Sigma is just a little chunk of the surface

8
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:39,747
And we saw in previous videos, the ones where we learned what a surface integral is

9
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:48,098
We saw that D Sigma right over here is equivalent to the magnitude of the cross-product

10
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:52,705
of the partial of our paramterization with respect to one parameter

11
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:57,590
crossed with the paramterization with respect to the other parameter

12
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,949
times the differentials of each of the parameters

13
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:02,596
So this is what we are going to use, right here

14
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,140
And it's a pretty simple looking statement, but as we'll see

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,258
Taking cross products tends to get a little bit hairy

16
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:11,825
Especially cross products of three dimensional vectors

17
00:01:11,825 --> 00:01:13,201
But we'll do it step by step

18
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:18,069
But before we even take the cross product we first have to take the partial of this with respect to S

19
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:20,758
and then the partial of this with respect to T

20
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:24,092
So first let's take the partial with respect to S

21
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:26,907
The partial of R with respect to S

22
00:01:26,907 --> 00:01:30,885
So right over here, all this stuff with T in it, you can just view that as a constant

23
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:36,773
So Cosine of T is not going to change, the derivative of Cosine of S with respect to S

24
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:45,168
is negative Sine of S, so this is going to be equal to negative Cosine of T times Sine of S

25
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:48,107
(everything T involved will be purple)

26
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:54,439
(vectors will be orange)

27
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,522
Then I, and plus...

28
00:01:57,522 --> 00:02:02,175
And we're going to take the derivative with respect to S, Cosine of T is just a constant

29
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:05,068
Derivative of Sine of S with respect to S is Cosine of S

30
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:15,718
So this will be plus Cosine of T times Cosine of S

31
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:24,439
then J, and then plus the derivative of this with respect to S

32
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,765
well this is just a constant, the derivative of 5 with respect to S would just be zero

33
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:32,725
This does not change with respect to S

34
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:36,689
So our partial with respect to S is just zero

35
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:42,974
So we will just write here 'zero K'

36
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:47,421
And that's nice to see, because it will make our cross-product a little more straightforward

37
00:02:47,421 --> 00:03:02,125
Now let's take the partial with respect to T

38
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,096
So the derivative of this with respect to T

39
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:10,023
Now, Cosine of S is a constant, derivative of Cosine of T with respect to T is negative Sine of T

40
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:20,480
So this is going to be negative Sine of T times Cosine of S

41
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,886
times I, plus...

42
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:31,637
Now the derivative of this with respect to T, derivative of Cosine of T is negative Sine of T

43
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:42,265
So once again, we have minus Sine of T times Sine of S

44
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:45,772
My hand is already hurting from this, this is a painful problem...

45
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:52,170
Now J, plus the derivative of Sine of T with respect to T is just Cosine of T

46
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,546
So plus Cosine of T

47
00:03:57,546 --> 00:04:00,101
and now times the K unit vector

48
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:05,133
Now we're ready to take the cross product of these two characters right over here

49
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:28,367
To take the cross product we are going to set up this three by three matrix

50
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,296
And I'll write my unit vectors up here

51
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:33,483
I, J, K...

52
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:39,157
(this is how I like to remember how to take cross products of 3-dimensional vectors,

53
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:42,323
Take the determinant of this three by three matrix)

54
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,037
The first row is just our unit vectors

55
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:47,683
The second row is the first vector I'm taking the cross product of

56
00:04:47,683 --> 00:05:07,430
So I'm just going to re-write the top-most vector over here

57
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,136
And the last part is zero, which will hopefully simplify our calculations

58
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:20,556
And then you have the next vector, that's the third row

59
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:22,668
I encourage you to do this on your own if you already know where this is going

60
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:23,601
It's good practice

61
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:27,484
Even if you have to watch this whole thing to see how its done try to then do it again on your own

62
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:41,225
This is one of those things that you really have to do by yourself to have it really sit in

63
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:44,901
So let's take the determinate now

64
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:46,750
First we'll think about our I component

65
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,169
You would essentially ignore this column, the first column and the first row

66
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,463
And then take the determinant of this sub-matrix right over here

67
00:05:55,463 --> 00:06:16,973
I, times something (normally you see the something in front of the I, but you can swap it)

68
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:24,693
I'm going to write a little neater...

69
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:29,725
The last bit would be subtracting zero times that, but it would just be zero so we don't write it

70
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:32,389
Now we are going to do the J component, but you probably remember the "checkerboard"

71
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:35,141
thing when you have to evaluate three by three matrices

72
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:44,048
Positive, negative, positive, so you have a negative J times something

73
00:06:44,048 --> 00:07:00,467
So you ignore J's column, J's row

74
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:18,220
Let me make sure I'm doing this right...

75
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,920
Finally you have the K component, and once again you go back to positive there

76
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,157
Positive, negative, positive on the coefficients

77
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:26,739
That's just for evaluating a three by three matrix

78
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:32,256
So you have plus K, times... and this might get a little bit more involved

79
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:34,038
Since we don't have the zero to help us out

80
00:07:34,038 --> 00:08:13,494
Ignore this row, ignore this column, take the determinant of this sub two by two

81
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:27,895
Let me scroll to the right a little bit...

82
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:32,229
Now this is already looking pretty hairy, but it looks like a simplification is there

83
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,728
That's how the colour is helpful

84
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:38,222
I now have trouble doing math in anything other than kind of multiple pastel colours

85
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:41,530
This makes it much easier to see some patterns

86
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,748
What we can do is we can factor out the Cosine of T times Sine of T

87
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:57,152
So this is equal to Cosine T Sine T times Sine squared S plus Cosine squared S

88
00:08:57,152 --> 00:09:01,816
And this we know, the definition of the unit circle, this is just equal to 1

89
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:04,604
So that was a significant simplification

90
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:08,071
Now we get our cross product, we get it being equal to

91
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:18,690
Our cross product R sub S crossed with R sub T is going to be equal to

92
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:45,336
Cosine squared T Cosine S times our I unit vector, plus Cosine squared T Sine of S times our J unit vector

93
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:57,719
Plus (all we have left, because this is just one) Cosine T Sine T

94
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:02,139
Times our K unit vector

95
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,604
So that was pretty good, but we're still not done

96
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,058
We need to figure out the magnitude of this thing

97
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:11,471
Remember: D Sigma simplified to the magnitude of this thing times dsdt

98
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:13,564
So let's figure out what the magnitude of this is

99
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:18,587
This is the home stretch, I'm crossing my fingers that I don't make any careless mistakes now

100
00:10:18,587 --> 00:10:26,682
So, the magnitude of all of this business is going to be equal to:

101
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:34,565
The square root of the sum of the squares of each of those terms

102
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:45,465
So the first will be Cosine to the fourth T Cosine squared S

103
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:55,216
Plus, Cosine to the fourth T Sine squared S

104
00:10:55,216 --> 00:11:02,453
Plus, Cosine squared T Sine squared T

105
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:13,181
Now, the first pattern I see is this first part, we can factor out a cosine to the fourth T

106
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:23,877
These first two terms are equal to Cosine to the fourth T times Cosine squared S plus Sine squared S

107
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:27,496
Which once again we know is just one

108
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:30,815
So this whole expression has simplified to Cosine to the fourth T

109
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:35,475
plus Cosine squared T Sine squared T

110
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:41,730
Now we can attempt to simplify this again, because these two terms both have a Cosine squared T in them

111
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,492
Let's factor those out

112
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:46,422
(everything I'm doing is under the radical sign)

113
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:55,903
So this is equal to Cosine squared T times Cosine squared T

114
00:11:55,903 --> 00:12:01,075
and when you factor out a Cosine squared T here you just have plus a Sine squared T

115
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:04,146
And that's nice because that once again simplified to one

116
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:10,693
(All of this is under the radical sign, I'll keep drawing it here to keep it clear that this is still under the radical)

117
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:17,743
This is really really useful for us because the square root of Cosine squared of T is just Cosine of T

118
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:22,791
So ALL of that business actually finally simplified to something pretty straightforward

119
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:30,142
So all of this is going to be equal to Cosine of T

120
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:34,863
Going back to what we wanted before, if we want to re-write what D Sigma is

121
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:37,510
It's just cosine T, dsdt

122
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,158
So let me write that down...

123
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:48,389
D sigma is equal to Cosine of T dsdt

124
00:12:48,389 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'll see you in the next part
