PROBLEM: "Omar rode his boat

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:06,149
for a total of 50 miles over the past 5 days.

3
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:09,108
And he rowed the same amount each day.

4
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:10,991
How many miles did Omar

5
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:13,472
row his boat each day?"

6
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,568
So let’s just visualize what's going on.

7
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:17,512
He is able to travel 50 miles.

8
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:18,864
So let's make a –

9
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:20,214
Let’s say this line represents

10
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:22,084
the 50 miles that he travels.

11
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:24,237
So this whole distance right over here

12
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:27,778
is 50 miles.

13
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,620
And he does it –

14
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,947
They tell us that he does it over 5 days,

15
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:35,505
and that each day, he does the same amount.

16
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:38,514
So this 50 miles is if you were to add together

17
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:40,556
all of what he did over the 5 days.

18
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:41,479
And so, if you want to know

19
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,491
how much he did each day,

20
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:44,759
you essentially want to divide

21
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:47,470
this 50 miles into 5 equal sections.

22
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,797
And the length of each of those sections

23
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:50,802
is the amount he did each day.

24
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,204
So if we just visualize it –

25
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:54,874
So that's one section – second section –

26
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:57,641
third section – fourth – and fifth section.

27
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,579
And actually, I didn't do that very well.

28
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,411
It should look a little bit more equal than that.

29
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:02,832
First, second –

30
00:01:02,832 --> 00:01:04,318
(And that's not going to – Let's see.)

31
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:08,505
First, second, third, fourth, and fifth.

32
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:09,985
And you don't have to actually do this.

33
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:11,270
This is just to help visualize.

34
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,385
So essentially, what we want to figure out is what is

35
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:15,817
one of these distances?

36
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:17,279
And as you can see in our visualization,

37
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:19,537
this is really just taking our 50 miles

38
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,522
and dividing it into 5 equal chunks.

39
00:01:22,522 --> 00:01:28,227
So we're essentially just taking 50,

40
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:31,118
and we're going to divide it by 5.

41
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,026
So 50 divided by 5

42
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:37,319
is going to be equal to 10.

43
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,580
So if he goes 50 miles over 5 days,

44
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,346
and you divide by the 5 days,

45
00:01:41,346 --> 00:01:45,223
he goes 10 miles each day.

46
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:47,162
And we're done.
