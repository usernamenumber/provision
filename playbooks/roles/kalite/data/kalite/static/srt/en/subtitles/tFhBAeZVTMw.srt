1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:03,266
hhhhhhhh

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:05,800
We know that quadrilateral ABCD over here is a parallelogram.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,146
And what I want to discuss in this video is a general way of finding the area of a parallelogram.

4
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:16,068
In the last video we talked about a particular way of finding a area of a rhombus.

5
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:18,021
You can take half the product of it's diagonals.

6
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:20,735
And a rhombus is a parallelogram, but you can't just generally take

7
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:24,933
the product of the half the product of the diagonals of any parallelogram

8
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:28,333
It has to be a rhombus. So now were just going to talk about the parallelograms.

9
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,975
So what do we know about parallelograms?

10
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:33,333
Well we know the opposite sides are parallel.

11
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:37,800
That side is parallel to that side and this side is parallel to this side.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,867
And we also know that opposite sides are congruent.

13
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:43,236
So this length is equal to this length.

14
00:00:43,236 --> 00:00:47,647
And this length is equal to this length over here.

15
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,600
Now if we draw a diagonal.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,966
I'll draw a diagonal. A, C

17
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:56,133
We can split our parallelogram into two triangles.

18
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:59,559
We've proven this multiple times that these two triangles are congruent.

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,400
We can do it in a pretty straightforward way.

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,067
We can look, obviously A,D is equal to B,C.

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,667
We have D,C is equal to A,B.

22
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:13,561
And then both of these triangles share this third side right over here.

23
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,800
They both share A,C.

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,133
So we can say triangle, I'll write this in yellow.

25
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:27,400
So we can say triangle ADC is congruent to triangle, so we want to get this right.

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,067
So it's going to be congruent to triangle, I said ADC.

27
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:41,133
So I went along this double magenta slash first, then the pink, and then I went the last one.

28
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:47,133
So I'm going to say CBA because I went the double magenta then pink then the last one.

29
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:50,829
So CBA, triangle CBA.

30
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:55,733
And this is by Side Side Side (SSS) congruency.

31
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,867
All three sides, they have three corresponding sides that are congruent to each other.

32
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:01,000
So the triangles are congruent to each other.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,645
And what that tells us is that the areas of these two triangles are going to be the same.

34
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:11,467
So if I want to find the area, the area of ABCD, the whole parallelogram.

35
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:22,933
It's going to be equal to the area of triangle ADC plus the area of CBA.

36
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:27,467
But the area of CBA is the same thing as the area of ADC.

37
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:30,400
Because they are congruent by Side Side Side (SSS).

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,156
So this is just going to be two times the area of triangle ADC.

39
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:40,200
Which is convenient for us because we know how to find the areas of triangles.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,606
The area of triangles is literally just one half times base times height.

41
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:48,867
So it's one half times base times height of this triangle.

42
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,533
And we are given the base of ADC.

43
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,800
It is this length right over here.

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,200
It is DC. You could view it as the base of the entire parallelogram.

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,908
And if you wanted to figure out the height,

46
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:03,267
we could draw an altitude down like this.

47
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:08,314
So this is perpendicular. We could call that the height right over there.

48
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:14,815
So if you want the total area of parallelogram ABCD,

49
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:18,600
It is equal to two times one half times base times height.

50
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,933
Well two times one half is just 1.

51
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,467
So you're just left with base times height.

52
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:31,000
So it's just b times this height over here. Base times height.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So thats a neat result and you might've guessed that this would be the case.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,533
But if you want to find out the area of any parallelogram

55
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,200
and if you can figure out the height

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:47,667
it is literally, you just take one of the bases because opposite sides are equal times the height.

57
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,400
So thats one way you could of found the area.

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,000
Or you could've multiplied, the other way to think about it

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,554
is if I were to turn the parallelogram over, it would look something like this...

60
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:03,762
So if I were to rotate it like that.

61
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:10,808
Stand it on this side, so this would be point A

62
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,267
This would be point D.

63
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:16,713
This would be point C.

64
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:18,600
And this would be point B.

65
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,290
You could also do it this way, you could say it would be the area of this would be base times height.

66
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,000
So you could say h times DC.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,553
So you could say this is going to be equal to h times the length of DC.

68
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:38,622
That's one way to do it, that's this base times this height.

69
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:48,817
Or you could say it's equal to AD times

70
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:53,350
I'll call this altitude right here h2.

71
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,067
Maybe I'll call this h1.

72
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,723
So you could take this base times this height.

73
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:06,643
Or you could take this base times this height right over here.

74
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:09,067
This is h2. Either way.

75
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,133
So if someone were to give you a parallelogram.

76
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:13,467
Just to make things clear.

77
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:17,000
Obviously you'd have to be able to figure out the height.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,667
So if someone were to give you a parallelogram like this,

79
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,800
they were to tell you this is a parallelogram.

80
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,059
If they were to tell you this length right over here is 5.

81
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:28,333
And if they were to tell you that this distance is 6.

82
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,720
Then the area of this parallelogram would literally be 5 times 6.

83
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,067
I drew the altitude outside the parallelogram.

84
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,200
I could've drawn it right over here as well, that would also be 6.

85
00:05:37,200 --> 99:59:59,999
So the area of this parallelogram would be 30.
