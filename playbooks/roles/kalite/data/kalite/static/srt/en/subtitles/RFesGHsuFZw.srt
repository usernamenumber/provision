1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,610
So we have these 2 parallel lines

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:07,460
Line segment AB and line segment CD they're parallel

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,570
I should say they're parallel line segments

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,510
And then we have these transversals that go across them,

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,750
so you have this transversal BC right over here

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,860
and we have transversal AD

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,200
And what this diagram tells us is that the distance

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,640
between A and E this little hash mark says that this line segment

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,080
is the same distance as distance between between E and D

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,480
And another way to think about it is that

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:34,460
point E is the midpoint of line segment AD

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,990
and what I want to think about in this video is:

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,240
Is point E also the midpoint of line segment BC?

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,020
So, we have this is the question right over here

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:58,530
So, is E the midpoint of line segment BC

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,790
And you can imagine based on a lot of videos

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,150
we've been seeing lately maybe

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,970
it has something to do with congruent triangles

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,070
So, let's see if we can set up some congruency relationship

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,290
between the two obvious triangles in this diagram

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,290
We have this triangle up here on the left

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,840
and we have this diagram down here

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,620
This one kinda looks like it's pointing up,

24
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,810
this one on this looks like its pointing down

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,780
So, there's a bunch of things we know about vertical angles

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,140
and angles of transversals

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,320
the most obvious one is that we have this vertical we have

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,180
we know that angle AEB is going to be congruent

29
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,200
or it's measure is going to be equal to the measure of angle CED

30
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:43,610
So we know, we know that angle AEB is going to be congruent

31
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,740
AEB is going to be congruent to angle DEC

32
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,800
which really just means they have the exact same measure

33
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,690
and we know that because they are vertical angles

34
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:03,130
they are vertical angles

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,590
Now we also know that AB and CD are parallel

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,620
So this line right over here this is transversal

37
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,210
so we know for example

38
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,010
There's actually several ways that we can do this problem

39
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,750
but we know that this is transversal

40
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,500
And there's a couple of ways to think about it right over here

41
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,980
so let me just continue the transversal

42
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,750
so we get to see all the different angles

43
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:30,830
You could say that this angle right here angle AB, angle ABE

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,490
So this is its measure right over here you could say

45
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,350
that this is alternate interior angle to angle ECD

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,250
to this angle right over there

47
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,500
And if you didn't just if that didn't if jump out of you

48
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,020
You would say that the corresponding angle

49
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,120
to this one right over here

50
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,060
is this angle right up here

51
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,680
if you were to continue this line off a little bit

52
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,370
this is the corresponding angle and this one is the vertical

53
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,400
but either way angle AEB let me write this down

54
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,180
angle sorry angle ABE let me be clear careful angle ABE

55
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,950
is going to be congruent to angle so that's ABE

56
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,820
is congruent to angle DCE

57
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,140
is congruent to angle DCE

58
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,370
And we could say because its alternate interior angles,

59
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:27,270
alternate just write a code here so alt interior angles

60
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,350
And then we have an interesting relationship we have

61
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,170
an angle congruent to angle another angle congruent to an angle

62
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,490
and then the next side is congruent to the next side over here

63
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,440
so pink green side, so pink green side

64
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,660
So, we can employ AAS angle angle side

65
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,920
And this is in the right order

66
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,480
So now we know that triangle

67
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,530
we have to make sure that we get the letters right here

68
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,670
that we have the right corresponding vertices

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,640
We can say that triangle AEB triangle AE

70
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,540
Actually let me start with the angle just to make it interesting

71
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,700
Angle BEA so starting with the magenta angle going

72
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,720
to the green angle going to the one that we have unlabelled

73
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,890
So, angle BEA we can say is congruent to angle,

74
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,900
we start with the magenta at vertices C go the center E

75
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,460
and then go to the unlabelled one, D

76
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,820
And we know this because of angle-angle-side

77
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,140
and they correspond to each other magenta, green side,

78
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,320
magenta, green, side they're all congruent

79
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:33,790
So this is from AAS and then if we know that they're congruent

80
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,220
that means corresponding sides are congruent

81
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,210
So then, so then we know that this side

82
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,380
so we know these two triangle congruent

83
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,010
so that means their corresponding sides are congruent

84
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,260
so then we know that length of BE that we know that BE

85
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,920
The length of that segment BE is going to be equal

86
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,460
and that's the segment between the magenta and the green angles

87
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,920
The corresponding side is side CE between the magenta

88
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,280
and the green angles is equal to CE

89
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,590
And this just comes out of the previous statement if we number them

90
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,080
That's one, that's two, and that's three and so that is comes out

91
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,740
of the statement 3 and

92
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,530
so we have proven that E is the midpoint of BC

93
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,990
It comes straight out of the fact that BE is equal to CE

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,530
so I can mark this off with hash

95
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,700
This line segment right over here

96
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,790
is congruent to this line segment right over here

97
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,100
Because we know that those two triangles are congruent

98
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,980
And I've inadvertently write here a total of two column proof

99
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:37,570
This over here on the left hand side is my statement

100
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:44,990
And on then on the right hand side I gave my reason and were done
