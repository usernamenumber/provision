1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,610
We've known for several videos
now that the dot product of

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:11,420
two nonzero vectors, a and b,
is equal to the length of

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,540
vector a times the length of
vector b times the cosine of

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,820
the angle between them.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,620
Let me draw a and b just
to make it clear.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,900
If that's my vector a and
that's my vector b right

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,600
there, the angle between
them is this angle.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,430
And we defined it in this way.

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,390
And actually, if you ever want
to solve-- if you have two

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,260
vectors and you want to solve
for that angle, and I've never

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,470
done this before explicitly.

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,040
And I thought, well, I might
as well do it right now.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,760
You could just solve
for your theta.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:51,460
So it would be a dot b divided
by the lengths of your two

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,300
vectors multiplied by each
other is equal to

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,800
the cosine of theta.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,840
And then to solve for theta
you would have to take the

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,880
inverse cosine of both sides,
or the arc cosine of both

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,840
sides, and you would get theta
is equal to arc cosine of a

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,450
dot b over the magnitudes or
the lengths of the products

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,180
of, or the lengths of each of
those vectors, multiplied by

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,280
each other.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,170
So if I give you two arbitrary
vectors-- and the neat thing

25
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,210
about it is, this might be
pretty straightforward.

26
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,440
If I just drew something in two
dimensions right here, you

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,500
could just take your protractor
out and measure

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,320
this angle.

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,440
But if a and b each have a
hundred components, it becomes

30
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,320
hard to visualize the
idea of an angle

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,890
between the two vectors.

32
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,110
But you don't need to visualize
them anymore because

33
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,840
you just have to calculate
this thing right here.

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,130
You just have to calculate
this value right there.

35
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,760
And then go to your calculator
and then type in arc cosine,

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,140
or the inverse cosine that are
the equivalent functions, and

37
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,440
it'll give you an angle.

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,520
And that, by definition, is the
angle between those two

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,120
vectors, which is a
very neat concept.

40
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,970
And then you can start
addressing issues of

41
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,500
perpendicularity and
whatever else.

42
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,620
This was a bit of a tangent.

43
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,300
But the other outcome that I
painstakingly proved to you in

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,430
the previous video was that
the length of the cross

45
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,270
product of two vectors is equal
to-- it's a very similar

46
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,810
expression.

47
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,680
It's equal to the product of the
two vectors' lengths, so

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,280
the length of a times the length
of b times the sine of

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,930
the angle between them.

50
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,290
Times the sign of the
angle between them.

51
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,120
So it's the same angle.

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,820
So what I want to do is take
these two ideas and this was a

53
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,950
bit of a diversion there just
to kind of show you how to

54
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,900
solve for theta because I
realized I've never done that

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,510
for you before.

56
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,260
But what I want to do is I want
to take this expression

57
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,800
up here and this expression up
here and see if we can develop

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,590
an intuition, at least in R3
because right now we've only

59
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,700
defined our cross product.

60
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,580
Or the cross product of two
vectors is only defined in R3.

61
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,780
Let's take these two ideas in
R3 and see if we can develop

62
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,340
an intuition.

63
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,940
And I've done a very similar
video in the physics playlist

64
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,920
where I compare the dot product
to the cross product.

65
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,400
Now, if I'm talking about--
let me redraw my vectors.

66
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,820
So the length of a--
so let me draw a.

67
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,420
b, I want to do it
bigger than that.

68
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,090
So let me do it like that.

69
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,540
So that is my vector b.

70
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,910
So this is b.

71
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,070
That is a.

72
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,200
What is the length of a times
the length of b times the

73
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,850
cosine of the angle?

74
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,080
So let me do that right there.

75
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
So this is the angle.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,970
So the length of a if I were to
draw these vectors is this

77
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,760
length right here.

78
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,390
This is the length of a.

79
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,230
It's this distance right
here, the way

80
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,330
I've drawn this vector.

81
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,680
So this is, literally, the
length of vector a.

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,920
And I'm doing it in R3 or maybe
a version of it that I

83
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,160
can fit onto my little
blackboard right here.

84
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,150
So it'll just be the length
of this line right there.

85
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,080
And then the length of
b is the length of

86
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,180
that line right there.

87
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,910
So that is the length of b.

88
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,530
   

89
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,650
Let me rewrite this
thing up here.

90
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,790
Let me write it as b, the length
of b times the length--

91
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,570
and I want to be careful.

92
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,710
I don't want to do the dot there
because you'll think

93
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,640
it's a dot product.

94
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,560
Times a cosine of theta.

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,630
All I did is I rearranged
this thing here.

96
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,340
It's the same thing
as a dot b.

97
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,460
Well what is a times the
cosine of theta?

98
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,640
Let's get out our basic
trigonometry

99
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,370
tools-- SOH CAH TOA.

100
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:45,160
   

101
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:52,270
Cosine of theta is equal to
adjacent over hypotenuse.

102
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,680
So if I drop, if I create a
right triangle here, and let

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,620
me introduce some new colors
just to ease the monotony.

104
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,970
If I drop a right triangle
right here and I create a

105
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,490
right triangle right there, and
this is theta, than what

106
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,650
is the cosine of theta?

107
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,230
It's equal to this.

108
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,490
Let me do it another color.

109
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,130
It's equal to this,
the adjacent side.

110
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,820
It's equal to this little
magenta thing.

111
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,770
Not all of b, just this
part that goes

112
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,290
up to my right angle.

113
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,570
That's my adjacent.

114
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,950
I want to do it a little
bit bigger.

115
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:29,020
It's equal to the adjacent
side over the hypotenuse.

116
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,250
So let me write this down.

117
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,850
So cosine of theta is equal to
this little adjacent side.

118
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm just going to write
it like that.

119
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:44,880
Is equal to this adjacent side
over the hypotenuse.

120
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,640
But what is the hypotenuse?

121
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,970
It is the length of vector a.

122
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,620
It's this.

123
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,210
That's my hypotenuse
right there.

124
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,430
So my hypotenuse is the
length of vector a.

125
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,040
And so if I multiply both sides
by the length of vector

126
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:06,660
a I get the length of vector a
times the cosine of theta is

127
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,520
equal to the adjacent side.

128
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,770
I'll do that in magenta.

129
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,300
   

130
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,910
So this expression right here,
which was just a dot b can be

131
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,790
rewritten as-- I just told you
that the length of vector a

132
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,210
times cosine of theta is equal
to this little magenta

133
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:25,970
adjacent side.

134
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,500
So this is equal to
the adjacent side.

135
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:38,420
So you can view a dot b as being
equal to the length of

136
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:44,350
vector b-- that length-- times
that adjacent side.

137
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,910
And you're saying, Sal, what
does that do for me?

138
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,360
Well what it tells you
is you're multiplying

139
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,840
essentially, the length of
vector b times the amount of

140
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,830
vector a that's going in the
same direction as vector b.

141
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,190
You can kind of view this as
the shadow of vector a.

142
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,420
And I'll talk about projections
in the future.

143
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,930
And I'll more formally define
them, but if the word

144
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,140
projection helps you, just
think of that word.

145
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,530
If you have a light that shines
down from above, this

146
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,190
adjacent side is kind of like
the shadow of a onto vector b.

147
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,630
And you can imagine, if these
two vectors-- if our two

148
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:25,180
vectors looked more like this,
if they were really going in

149
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,110
the same direction.

150
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,760
Let's say that's vector a and
that's vector b, then the

151
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,730
adjacent side that I care about
is going to-- they're

152
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,070
going to have a lot
more in common.

153
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,950
The part of a that is going in
the same direction of b will

154
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,840
be a lot larger.

155
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,840
So this will have a larger
dot product.

156
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,920
Because the dot product is
essentially saying, how much

157
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,010
of those vectors are going
in the same direction?

158
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,950
But it's just a number, so it
will just be this adjacent

159
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,310
side times the length of b.

160
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,730
And what if I had vectors that
are pretty perpendicular to

161
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,850
each other?

162
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,930
So what if I had two vectors
that were like this?

163
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,390
What if my vector a looked
like that and my vector b

164
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,370
looked like that?

165
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,940
Well now the adjacent, the way
I define it here, if I had to

166
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,060
make a right triangle
like that, the

167
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,880
adjacent side's very small.

168
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,440
So you're dot product, even
though a is still a reasonably

169
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,740
large vector, is now much
smaller because a and b have

170
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,170
very little commonality
in the same direction.

171
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,880
And you can do it
the other way.

172
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,070
You could draw this down like
that and you could do the

173
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,760
adjacent the other way, but it
doesn't matter because these

174
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,159
a's and b's are arbitrary.

175
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,460
So the take away is the fact
that a dot b is equal to the

176
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,480
lengths of each of those times
the cosine of theta.

177
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,590
To me it says that the dot
product tells me how much are

178
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,100
my vectors moving together?

179
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,040
Or the product of the
part of the vectors

180
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,660
that are moving together.

181
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:10,320
Product of the lengths of the
vectors that are moving

182
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,946
together or in the
same direction.

183
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:15,130
   

184
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:22,210
You could view this adjacent
side here as the part of a

185
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,050
that's going in the
direction of b.

186
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,080
That's the part of a that's
going in the direction of b.

187
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,180
So you're multiplying
that times b itself.

188
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,620
So that's what the
dot product is.

189
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,340
How much are two things going
in the same direction.

190
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,000
And notice, when two things are
orthogonal or when they're

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,990
perpendicular-- when a dot b is
equal to 0, we say they're

192
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,910
perpendicular.

193
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,110
And that makes complete sense
based on this kind of

194
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,930
intuition of what the dot
product is doing.

195
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,210
Because that means that
they're perfectly

196
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,040
perpendicular.

197
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,620
So that's b and that's a.

198
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,700
And so the adjacent part of a,
if I had to draw a right

199
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,390
trianlge, it would come
straight down.

200
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,440
And if I were to say the
projection of a and I

201
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,070
haven't draw that.

202
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,400
Or if I put a light shining down
from above and I'd say

203
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,670
what's the shadow of a onto b?

204
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,440
You'd get nothing.

205
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,120
You'd get 0.

206
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,010
This arrow has no width, even
though I've drawn it to have

207
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,530
some width.

208
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,820
It has no width.

209
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,890
So you would have
a 0 down here.

210
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,930
The part of a that goes in
the same direction as b.

211
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,270
No part of this vector
goes in the same

212
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,550
direction as this vector.

213
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,560
So you're going to have this 0
kind of adjacent side times b,

214
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,030
so you're going to get
something that's 0.

215
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,150
So hopefully that makes
a little sense.

216
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,870
Now let's think about
the cross product.

217
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,520
The cross product tells us well,
the length of a cross b,

218
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,510
I painstakingly showed, you is
equal to the length of a times

219
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,750
the length of b times the sin
of the angle between them.

220
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,500
So let me do the same example.

221
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,370
Let me draw my two vectors.

222
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:59,300
That's my vector a and
this is my vector b.

223
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,480
And now sin-- SOH CAH TOA.

224
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,400
So sin of theta, let
me write that.

225
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:09,340
Sin of theta-- SOH CAH TOA-- is
equal to opposite over the

226
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,020
hypotenuse.

227
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,870
So if I were to draw a little
right triangle here, so if I

228
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,900
were to draw a perpendicular
right there, this is theta.

229
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,300
What is the sin of theta equal
to in this context?

230
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,750
The sin of theta is
equal to what?

231
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,370
It's equal to this
side over here.

232
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,640
Let me call that just
the opposite.

233
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,840
It's equal to the opposite
side over the hypotenuse.

234
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,540
So the hypotenuse is
the length of this

235
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,760
vector a right there.

236
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,760
It's the length of
this vector a.

237
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,440
So the hypotenuse is the length
over my vector a.

238
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,500
So if I multiply both sides of
this by my length of vector a,

239
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,710
I get the length of vector a
times the sin of theta is

240
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,570
equal to the opposite side.

241
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,290
So if we rearrange this a little
bit, I can rewrite this

242
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,300
as equal to-- I'm just
going to swap them.

243
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,800
I have to do the dot
product as well.

244
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,820
This is equal to b, the length
of vector b, times the length

245
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,920
of vector a sin of theta.

246
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,720
Well this thing is just the
opposite side as I've defined

247
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,300
it right here.

248
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,305
So this right here is just
the opposite side,

249
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,680
this side right there.

250
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,460
So when we're taking the cross
product, we're essentially

251
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,540
multiplying the length of vector
b times the part of a

252
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,040
that's going perpendicular
to b.

253
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,680
This opposite side is the
part of a that's going

254
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,110
perpendicular to b.

255
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,930
So they're kind of
opposite ideas.

256
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,640
The dot product, you're
multiplying the part of a

257
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,570
that's going in the same
direction as b with b.

258
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,400
While when you're taking the
cross product, you're

259
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,760
multiplying the part of
a that's going in the

260
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,720
perpendicular direction to
b with the length of b.

261
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,540
It's a measure, especially when
you take the length of

262
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,790
this, it's a measure of
how perpendicular

263
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,000
these two guys are.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,590
And this is, it's a measure of
how much do they move in the

265
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,040
same direction?

266
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,490
And let's just look at
a couple of examples.

267
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,810
So if you take two
right triangles.

268
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,750
   

269
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,020
So if that's a and that's-- or
if you take two vectors that

270
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:22,840
are perpendicular to each other,
the length of a cross b

271
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,570
is going to be equal to-- if we
just use this formula right

272
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,060
there-- the length of a
times the length of b.

273
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,000
And what's the sin
of 90 degrees?

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,250
It's 1.

275
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,910
So in this case you kind of have
maximized the length of

276
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,970
your cross product.

277
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,660
This is as high as it can go.

278
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,690
Because sin of theta, it's
a maximum value.

279
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,940
Sin of theta is always less
than or equal to 1.

280
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,980
So this is as good as you're
ever going to get.

281
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,480
This is the highest possible
value when you have perfectly

282
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,630
perpendicular vectors.

283
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,870
Now, when is-- actually, just to
kind of go back to make the

284
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,780
same point here.

285
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,830
When do you get the maximum
value for your cosine of-- for

286
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,760
your dot product?

287
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,230
Well, it's when your two
vectors are collinear.

288
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,500
If my vector a looks like that
and my vector b is essentially

289
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,250
another vector that's going
in the same direction,

290
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,410
then theta is 0.

291
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,970
There's no angle between them.

292
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:23,080
And then you have a dot b is
equal to the magnitude or the

293
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,440
length of vector a times the
length of vector b times the

294
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,870
cosine of the angle
between them.

295
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,190
The cosine of the angle between
them, the cosine of

296
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,680
that angle is 0.

297
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,180
Or the angle is 0, so the
cosine of that is 1.

298
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,020
So when you have two vectors
that go exactly in the same

299
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,230
direction or they're collinear,
you kind of

300
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,700
maximize your dot product.

301
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,510
You maximize your cross product
when they're perfectly

302
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,080
perpendicular to each other.

303
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,960
And just to make the analogy
clear, when they're

304
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,550
perpendicular to each other
you've minimized-- or at least

305
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,640
the magnitude of your
dot product.

306
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,080
You can get negative dot
products, but the absolute

307
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,360
size of your dot product, the
absolute value of your dot

308
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,270
product is minimized
when they're

309
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,710
perpendicular to each other.

310
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:10,090
Similarly, if you were to take
two vectors that are collinear

311
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,350
and they're moving in the same
direction, so if that's vector

312
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,280
a, and then I have vector b that
just is another vector

313
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,480
that I want to draw them
on top of each other.

314
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,560
But I think you get the idea.

315
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,540
Let's say vector
b is like that.

316
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,860
Then theta is 0.

317
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,110
You can't even see it.

318
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,190
It's been squeezed out.

319
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,170
I've just brought these two
things on top of each other.

320
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,670
And then the cross product in
this situation, a cross b is

321
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,525
equal to-- well, the length of
both of these things times the

322
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:40,070
sin of theta.

323
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,620
Sin of 0 is 0.

324
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,600
So it's just 0.

325
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,300
So two collinear vectors, the
magnitude of their cross

326
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,810
product is 0.

327
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:56,110
But the magnitude of their dot
product, the a dot b, is going

328
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,070
to be maximized.

329
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,330
It's going to be as high
as you can get.

330
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,540
It's going to be the length of
a times the length of b.

331
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,450
Now the opposite scenario
is right here.

332
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,210
When they're perpendicular to
each other, the cross product

333
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,750
is maximized because it's
measuring on how much of the

334
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,930
vectors-- how much of the
perpendicular part of a is--

335
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,430
multiplying that times
the length of b.

336
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,490
And then when you have two
orthogonal vectors, your dot

337
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,330
product is minimized,
or the absolute

338
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,400
value of your dot product.

339
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,840
So a dot b in this case,
is equal to 0.

340
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,420
Anyway, I wanted to make all
of this clear because

341
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,300
sometimes you kind of get into
the formulas and the

342
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,720
definitions and you lose the
intuition about what are all

343
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,940
of these ideas really for?

344
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,130
And actually, before I move on,
let me just make another

345
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,210
kind of idea about what the
cross product can be

346
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,520
interpreted as.

347
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,020
Because a cross product tends
to give people more trouble.

348
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,220
That's my a and that's my b.

349
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,820
What if I wanted to figure
out the area of this

350
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,110
parallelogram?

351
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,410
If I were to shift a and have
that there and if I were to

352
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,420
shift b and draw a line parallel
to b, and if I wanted

353
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,089
to figure out the area of this
parallelogram right there, how

354
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,000
would I do it just using
regular geometry?

355
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,369
Well I would drop a
perpendicular right there.

356
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,670
   

357
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:25,020
This is perpendicular and this
length is h for height.

358
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,020
Then the area of this, the area
of the parallelogram is

359
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,140
just equal to the length of my
base, which is just the length

360
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,650
of vector b times my height.

361
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,640
   

362
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,670
But what is my height?

363
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,330
Let me just draw a little
theta there.

364
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,430
Let me do a green theta,
it's more visible.

365
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,530
So theta.

366
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,150
So we know already that the sin
of this theta is equal to

367
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,460
the opposite over
the hypotenuse.

368
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,740
So it's equal to the height
over the hypotenuse.

369
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,350
The hypotenuse is just the
length of vector a.

370
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,520
So it's just the length
of vector a.

371
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,590
Or we could just solve for
height and we'd get the height

372
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,040
is equal to the length
of vector a

373
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,000
times the sin of theta.

374
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,480
So I can rewrite this here.

375
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,110
I can replace it with that and
I get the area of this

376
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,210
parallelogram is equal to the
length of vector b times the

377
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,110
length of vector a sin theta.

378
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,660
Well this is just the length
of the cross product of the

379
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,670
two vectors, a cross b.

380
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,670
This is the same thing.

381
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,200
I mean you can rearrange
the a and the b.

382
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,780
So we now have another way of
thinking about what the cross

383
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,670
product is.

384
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,130
The cross product of two
vectors, or at least the

385
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,220
magnitude or the length of the
cross product of two vectors--

386
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,320
obviously, the cross product
you're going

387
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,580
to get a third vector.

388
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,190
But the length of that third
vector is equal to the area of

389
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,490
the parallelogram that's defined
or that's kind of--

390
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,220
that you can create from
those two vectors.

391
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,080
Anyway, hopefully you found this
a little bit intuitive

392
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,750
and it'll give you a little bit
more of kind of a sense of

393
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,910
what the dot product and cross
product are all about.
