1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830
   

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,510
Before we move on, I want to
clarify something that I've

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,490
inadvertently done.

4
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,660
I think I was not exact
with some of the

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,550
terminology I used.

6
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,920
So I want to highlight the
difference between two things

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,590
that I've used almost
interchangeably up to this

8
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,100
point, but now that we are about
to embark on learning

9
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,260
what voltage is, I think it's
important that I highlight the

10
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,200
difference, because initially,
this can be very confusing.

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,430
I remember when I first learned
this, I found I often

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,680
mixed up these words and didn't
quite understand why

13
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,540
there was a difference.

14
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,280
So the two words are
electrical-- or sometimes

15
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,580
you'll see electric instead
of electrical.

16
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:49,110
So "electric potential energy"
and "electric potential." I

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,380
think even in the last video,
I used these almost

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,630
interchangeably, and I shouldn't
have. I really

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,500
should have always used
electrical or electric

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,390
potential energy.

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,850
And what's the difference?

22
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:05,379
Electrical potential energy is
associated with a charge.

23
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,830
It's associated with a particle
that has some charge.

24
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,390
Only that particle
can have energy.

25
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,520
Electrical potential, or
electric potential, this is

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,860
associated with a position.

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,170
So, for example, if I have a
charge and I know that it's at

28
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,720
some point with a given electric
potential, I can

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,590
figure out the electric
potential energy at that point

30
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,710
by just multiplying actually
this value by the charge.

31
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,970
Let me give you some examples.

32
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,380
Let's say that I have
an infinite

33
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,740
uniformly charged plate.

34
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,290
So that we don't have to do
calculus, we can have a

35
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,050
uniform electric field.

36
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,640
Let's say that this
is the plate.

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,130
I'll make it vertical just so we
get a little bit of change

38
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:55,760
of pace, and let's say it's
positively charged plate.

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,170
And let's say that the
electric field

40
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,010
is constant, right?

41
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,060
It's constant.

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,580
No matter what point we pick,
these field vectors should all

43
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,156
be the same length because the
electric field does not change

44
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:12,290
in magnitude it's pushing out,
because we assume when we draw

45
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,810
field lines that we're using a
test charge with a positive

46
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,060
charge so it's pushing
outward.

47
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,370
   

48
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,640
Let's say I have a
1-coulomb charge.

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,420
Actually, let me make
it 2 coulombs just

50
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,320
to hit a point home.

51
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,532
Say I have a 2-coulomb charge
right here, and it's positive.

52
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:40,750
A positive 2-coulomb charge, and
it starts off at 3 meters

53
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,430
away, and I want to bring
it in 2 meters.

54
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,560
I want to bring it in 2 meters,
so it's 1 meter away.

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,800
   

56
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,250
So what is the electric-- or
electrical-- potential energy

57
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,600
difference between the particle
at this point and at

58
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,200
this point?

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,270
Well, the electrical potential
energy difference is the

60
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,860
amount of work, as we've learned
in the previous two

61
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,390
videos, we need to apply to this
particle to take it from

62
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,770
here to here.

63
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,200
So how much work do
we have to apply?

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,290
We have to apply a force that
directly-- that exactly-- we

65
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,990
assume that maybe this is
already moving with a constant

66
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,840
velocity, or maybe we have to
start with a slightly higher

67
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,210
force just to get it moving, but
we have to apply a force

68
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:34,000
that's exactly opposite the
force provided by Coulomb's

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,570
Law, the electrostatic force.

70
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,030
And so what is that force we're
going to have to apply?

71
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,620
Well, we actually have to know
what the electric field is,

72
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,650
which I have not told you yet.

73
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,220
I just realized that,
as you can tell.

74
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:54,330
So let's say all of these
electric field lines are 3

75
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,100
newtons per coulomb.

76
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,260
So at any point, what is the
force being exerted from this

77
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,940
field onto this particle?

78
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,630
Well, the electrostatic force
on this particle is equal to

79
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:16,269
the electric field times the
charge, which is equal to-- I

80
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,829
just defined the electric field
as being 3 newtons per

81
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:25,220
coulomb times 2 coulombs.

82
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,000
It equals 6 newtons.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,940
So at any point, the electric
field is pushing this way 6

84
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,416
newtons, so in order to push the
particle this way, I have

85
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,930
to completely offset that, and
actually, I have to get it

86
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,170
moving initially, and I'll
keep saying that.

87
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,570
I just want to hit
that point home.

88
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,690
So I have to apply a force of
6 newtons in the leftward

89
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,560
direction and I have to apply
it for 2 meters to get the

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,660
point here.

91
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:54,370
So the total work is equal to
6 newtons times 2 meters,

92
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,920
which is equal to 12
newton-meters or 12 joules.

93
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,200
So we could say that the
electrical potential energy--

94
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,570
and energy is always joules.

95
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,950
The electrical potential energy
difference between this

96
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,850
point and this point
is 12 joules.

97
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,520
Or another way to say it
is-- and which one

98
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,530
has a higher potential?

99
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,140
Well, this one does, right?

100
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,610
Because at this point, we're
closer to the thing that's

101
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,170
trying to repel it, so if we
were to just let go, it would

102
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,530
start accelerating in this
direction, and a lot of that

103
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,250
energy would be converted to
kinetic energy by the time we

104
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,480
get to this point, right?

105
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,520
So we could also say that the
electric potential energy at

106
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,400
this point right here is 12
joules higher than the

107
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,480
electric potential energy
at this point.

108
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,680
Now that's potential energy.

109
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,300
What is electric potential?

110
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,330
Well, electric potential tells
us essentially how much work

111
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,550
is necessary per unit
of charge, right?

112
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,220
Electric potential energy was
just how much total work is

113
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,650
needed to move it from
here to here.

114
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,890
Electric potential says, per
unit charge, how much work

115
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,340
does it take to move any charge
per unit charge from

116
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,010
here to here?

117
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,070
Well, in our example we just
did, the total work to move it

118
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,780
from here to here
was 12 joules.

119
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,130
But how much work did it take to
move it from there to there

120
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,500
per charge?

121
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:29,640
Well, work per charge is equal
to 12 joules for what?

122
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,280
What was the charge
that we moved?

123
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,040
Well, it was 2 coulombs.

124
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,520
It equals 6 joules
per coulomb.

125
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,930
That is the electric potential
difference between this point

126
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,760
and this point.

127
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,180
So what is the distinction?

128
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,150
Electric potential energy was
associated with a particle.

129
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,980
How much more energy did the
particle have here than here?

130
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,140
When we say electric potential,
because we

131
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,490
essentially divide by the
size of the particle, it

132
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,720
essentially is independent of
the size of the particle.

133
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,960
It actually just depends
on our position.

134
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,130
So electric potential, we're
just saying how much more

135
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,180
potential, irrespective of the
charge we're using, does this

136
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,240
position have relative
to this position?

137
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,960
And this electric potential,
that's just another way of

138
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,980
saying voltage, and the unit
for voltage is volts.

139
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,600
So 6 joules per coulomb,
that's the

140
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,030
same thing as 6 volts.

141
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:42,060
And so if we think of the
analogy to gravitation, we

142
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,170
said gravitational potential
energy was mgh, right?

143
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:46,860
This was force.

144
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,040
This was distance, right?

145
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,970
Electric potential is
essentially the amount of

146
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,820
gravitational-- if we extend
the analogy, the amount of

147
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,890
gravitational potential energy
per mass, right?

148
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:04,500
So if we wanted a quick way of
knowing what the gravitational

149
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,640
potential is at any point
without having to care about

150
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,340
the mass, we divide by the
mass, and it would be the

151
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,130
acceleration of gravity
times height.

152
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,750
Ignore that if it
confused you.

153
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,590
So what is useful
about voltage?

154
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,650
It tells us regardless of how
small or big or actually

155
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,170
positive or negative a charge
is, what the difference in

156
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,980
potential energy would be if
we're at two different points.

157
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,390
So electric potential, we're
comparing points in space.

158
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:37,760
Electric potential energy, we're
comparing charges at

159
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,330
points in space.

160
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,789
Hopefully, I didn't
confuse you.

161
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,059
In the next video, we'll
actually do a couple of

162
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,690
problems where we figure out
the electric potential

163
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,960
difference or the voltage
difference between two points

164
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,050
in space as opposed
to a charge at two

165
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,190
different points in space.

166
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,760
I will see you in
the next video.

167
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:54,900
