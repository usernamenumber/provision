1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,500
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,660
Before I move onto the next problem, sometimes I rush near

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,290
the end of the video just because I want to get under

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,570
the YouTube 10-minute limit.

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,060
But I just want to make sure you understand the conclusions

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,570
I reached in this problem
because it's kind of

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,820
interesting.

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,950
If I have a bunch of numbers and when I multiply them I get

9
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,320
a non-zero number, I know none of these numbers can be 0,

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,350
because as you know, if any one of them was 0 or maybe

11
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,390
more than one, then this
value would be 0.

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,160
So we know none of these
can be 0, rst or v.

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,580
And similarly, between stu and v-- let me re-write that, stu

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,930
and v equals 0-- we know that at least one of these must be

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,770
0 because when you multiply
it out you get 0.

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,990
Maybe all of them are.

17
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,100
Well we know s is not 0 because
it was up here.

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,590
We knew t was not 0 and we knew v were not 0 because they

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,200
were all up on this top one.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,310
And if any of them were
0, this top equation

21
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,110
would have been 0.

22
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,170
And that's how we reached
that conclusion.

23
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,040
So let's move on.

24
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,970
I hope I'm not confusing you.

25
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm doing it with a bit of a sense of urgency just because,

26
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,600
well I guess one should
when taking the SAT.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,100
All right, number 8.

28
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:16,060
During a game the blue team scored 1/6 of its-- so let me

29
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,430
do the blue team in blue.

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,800
The blue team scored
1/6 of its points

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,540
in the first quarter.

32
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,560
So Q1 they scored
1/6 of points.

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,580
1/4 in the second quarter.

34
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,370
So in Q2 scored 1/4
of its points.

35
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,620
1/3 in the third quarter.

36
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,310
So in Q3 they scored
1/3 of its points.

37
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,840
1/3 in the third quarter, and remaining points in the fourth

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,010
quarter, which makes sense.

39
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:11,310
If the total score was 36, how many points did the blue team

40
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,830
score in the fourth quarter?

41
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,440
Well the total points
are 36, right?

42
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,490
So it says they scored 1/6
in the first quarter.

43
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,660
So 1/6 of 36-- you could do that in your head or you could

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,915
just multiply fractions.

45
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:30,070
If you say 1/6 times 36.

46
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,440
That equals 36 over
6, which equals 6.

47
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,010
So they scored 6 points
in the first quarter.

48
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,430
How many did they score
in the second quarter?

49
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,580
Well what's 1/4 of 36.

50
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,900
So you just multiply 1/4
times 36 and you get 9.

51
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,840
1/3 of 36, well that's 12.

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,010
So in the first three quarters
we scored what?

53
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,720
6 plus 9 is 15.

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,750
15 plus 12 is 27.

55
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,880
So we scored 27 in the first
three quarters, right?

56
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,130
And then we scored
the rest in Q4.

57
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,030
So it would be the total points minus what we scored in

58
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,430
the first three quarters,
which is 27.

59
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,030
And 36 minus 27 is 9 points.

60
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,070
And if I look at the choices,
that is choice C.

61
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,675
And if I made a mistake it's because I cannot add, subtract

62
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:23,870
or multiply fractions.

63
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,910
But that's all there
is to this problem.

64
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,160
Let's move on.

65
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,690
Sometimes I feel like I'm going
too fast, so I want to

66
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,170
make sure I'm not
confusing you.

67
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,970
I like these type because
I don't have to

68
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,990
write a lot or draw.

69
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,420
Well I like the drawing,
it just takes time.

70
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,470
I will switch colors to keep
you from sleeping.

71
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,570
2 to the 2x-- this is
problem number 9.

72
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:05,600
2 to the 2x is equal to
8 to the x minus 1.

73
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,070
They just want to
know, what is x?

74
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,720
So at first you might
be confused.

75
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,980
But the trick to doing these kind of exponential-- I guess

76
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,010
we can call them an exponential
equation-- is to

77
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,290
get our bases the same.

78
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,390
And once we get the bases the same then we can set the

79
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,680
exponents equal to each other.

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,430
So how do I do that?

81
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,830
Well can I write 8
as a power of 2?

82
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,840
Well sure, what's 8?

83
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,790
It's 2 to the third power.

84
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,840
So let's rewrite 8 as 2
to the third power.

85
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,430
So let's figure out
the whole thing.

86
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:38,460
2 to the 2x is equal to--
instead of 8, I'm going to

87
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,050
write 2 to the third power.

88
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,690
Because that's all 8 is.

89
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,860
And hopefully you can review the exponent video if you

90
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,920
don't remember that.

91
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,110
And this 8 is this, and then that's going to the x minus 1.

92
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,950
And then if you remember your exponent rules, and you should

93
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,600
remember your exponent rules before taking the SAT, you

94
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,830
know that if you raise something to a power and then

95
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,950
raise that to a power,
you can just

96
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,850
multiply these two exponents.

97
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:12,170
So that gets us to 2 to the 2x is equal to 2 to the 3 times x

98
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,780
minus 1, right, and you
distribute the 3.

99
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,040
So it's 2 to the 3x minus 3.

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,820
3 times x, 3 times minus 1.

101
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,230
3x minus 3.

102
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,700
Now 2 to the 2x is equal to 2 to the 3x minus 3, so we know

103
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,480
that the two exponents must be equal to each other because we

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,900
have the same base.

105
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,560
Now this becomes a level one linear equations problem.

106
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,660
2x is equal to 3x minus 3.

107
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,650
We can subtract 3x from both sides and we get minus x is

108
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:49,530
equal to minus 3, or
x is equal to 3.

109
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,650
And we are done.

110
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,900
And this is choice number B.

111
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:05,780
Turning the page, number 10.

112
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,460
If 4 less-- I like these-- If 4 less than 3 times a certain

113
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,990
number is 2 more than the number, what is the number?

114
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,080
So this is literally turning
English into math.

115
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,010
So I'm going to actually
write the whole thing.

116
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,680
Not that you should do this on the SAT because it'll take you

117
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,660
too much time.

118
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,210
But you can do this kind of with their written word.

119
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:55,400
If 4 less than 3 times a certain number is 2 more than

120
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,870
the number, what
is the number?

121
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,540
So instead of a certain number I like to replace that with x,

122
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,390
just because I'm going to
have to solve for x.

123
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,135
So I'm going to change
this and I'm going

124
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,100
to say this is x.

125
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,700
What is x-- more than
the number x.

126
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,740
So now we have if 4 less than 3 times x is 2 more than x,

127
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,130
what is the number?

128
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,795
So what is 4 less
than 3 times x?

129
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,040
Well 3 times x is what?

130
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,040
It's 3x.

131
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:48,915
3 times x-- so if I took this
part, 3 times x, that's 3x.

132
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:57,330
And then 4 less than that
is going to be minus 4.

133
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,240
And that is, and I view is-- you
could view that as equals.

134
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,180
You could have replaced the
word equals with is and it

135
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,170
wouldn't have changed the meaning of the sentence.

136
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:12,670
So that equals 2 more than the number, or in our case, x.

137
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,890
So what is 2 more than x?

138
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,480
It's x plus 2.

139
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,830
2 more than x, you could just rewrite in math as x plus 2.

140
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,540
And then we solve
the equation.

141
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,590
So let's see, you could add 4 to both sides, you get 3x is

142
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,040
equal to x plus 6.

143
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,620
Subtract x from both sides.

144
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,594
You get 2x is equal to 6.

145
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:41,130
And divide both sides by 2, and
you get x is equal to 3.

146
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,610
And there we go,
it's choice E.

147
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,470
I will stop this video
here because the next

148
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,250
one involves drawing.

149
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,020
I don't want to draw
on your time.

150
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,860
I'll see you soon.
