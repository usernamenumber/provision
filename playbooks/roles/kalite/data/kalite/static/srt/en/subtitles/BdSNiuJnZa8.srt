1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,720
We're on problem 81.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:13,570
They give us this equation,y is equal to 248 minus 398x.

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,470
Which of the following values of x gives the greatest value

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,260
of y in the equation above?

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:28,690
To get as large a possible y,y is 248 minus this thing.

6
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,030
So what we want to do is,since we're subtracting this

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,860
from 248,we want to minimize this. As small as this can be.

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,210
And even if we can make what we're subtracting negative,

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,430
that'd be awesome,because when you subtract a negative,

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,160
then that'll get us above 248.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,450
And actually,if we look at all of the choices,

12
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,840
they have one negative number there.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,450
You might say if we put a 0 here, then y is going to be 248.

14
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,510
But what if we put a negative number in for x,

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,460
they have as choice E,negative 1.

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,920
What happens when we put negative 1 there?

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,920
Then y is equal to 248 minus negative 1 times 398,

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,870
so it's minus minus negative 398,

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,180
which is the same thing as plus 398.

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,450
So that's actually the maximum point,

21
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,820
because we're subtracting a negative.

22
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,520
That's even better than subtracting 0,

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,360
and it's way better than subtracting a positive,

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,250
if we're trying to maximize y. So the choice is E.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:32,340
82. Machine A produces bolts at a uniform rate of 120 bolts

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,230
every 40 seconds. So that's the same as--

27
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,130
120 bolts every 40 seconds

28
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,320
is the same thing as 3 bolts per second.

29
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,290
OK,that's A. Let me write that down,that's A.

30
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,770
Machine B produces bolts at a uniform rate of,so this is B,

31
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,300
of 120 bolts every 20 seconds.

32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,190
Well that's equal to 5 bolts per second.

33
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,640
If the two machines run simultaneously,

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,590
how many seconds will it take for them to produce

35
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,320
a total of 200 bolts? So if you're running simultaneously,

36
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,370
what's your speed per second?

37
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,870
This one's going to do 3 per second,

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,650
this one's going to do 5 per second.

39
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,860
So if they run simultaneously,

40
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,330
you're going to be producing 8 per second,3 plus 5.

41
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,260
So 8 bolts per second is their combined rate.

42
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,380
And we want to know how many seconds

43
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,860
will it take to do 200 bolts.

44
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,010
So we just take 200 bolts divided by 8 seconds.

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,320
Another way with distance,distance is equal to

46
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,230
rate times time,I guess you could view this as production is

47
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,700
equal to rate times time.

48
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,900
Normally rate is how fast you're moving per second,now

49
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,390
it's how much you're producing per second,

50
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,880
so your total production is going to be your rate times time,

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,970
and then your time is going to be the production

52
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,870
divided by the rate.

53
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,300
But sometimes when you think too much in terms of formulas,

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,700
you lose the intuition. But I just wanted to show you that

55
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,110
there is a formula for it,if you need one.

56
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,040
But the easiest way to think it,I have to produce 200 bolts,

57
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,870
if I said I produce 100 every second,it'll take me 2 seconds.

58
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,650
So if I have to produce 8 every second,

59
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,080
I take 200 divided by 8.

60
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,060
And I can even do the units,200 bolts divided by 8 bolts

61
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:29,090
per second. That's equal to 200 over 8 times bolts times--

62
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,820
if this isn't the denominator,you just inverse it when you

63
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,260
go out-- seconds per bolt,the bolts can't [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

64
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,570
So you know you got the units right,so to some degree that

65
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,810
should give you conviction that you got the formula right.

66
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,760
And 200 divided by 8 is 25.So it's 25 seconds. It's choice B.

67
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,270
Problem 83.

68
00:03:51,900 --> 00:04:00,770
What is the decimal equivalent of 1/5 to the fifth power?

69
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:04,960
So let's think about this.

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,460
Let's write 1/5 as a decimal,that's 0.2.

71
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,960
So it's 0.2 to the 5th power. Let's just multiply it out.

72
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,780
0.2 times 0.2 is equal to what?

73
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,890
2 times 2,and we have two digits behind the decimal,

74
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,500
so it's 0.04. And you multiply that times 0.2.

75
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,630
2 times 4 is 8,and now we have three numbers behind

76
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:37,740
the decimal point,that's going to be equal to 0.008

77
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,010
One,two,three. Three numbers behind the decimal.

78
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,100
So this is 2 to the third. And then 0.008 times 0.2,

79
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,740
let me write this is to the third power.

80
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,620
That's equal to 2 times 8 is 16,and then how many numbers

81
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,180
do we have behind the decimal point? One,two,three,four.

82
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,980
So we're going to have point one,two,three,four.

83
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,710
So that's to the 4th power.

84
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:10,480
We have one left,so 0.0016 times 0.2 is equal to,

85
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,080
2 times 16 is 32.

86
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,870
And now we have one,two,three,four,five numbers

87
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,150
behind the decimal point. So one,two,three,four,five.

88
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,810
That's the answer,and that is choice A.

89
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,790
Actually the easiest way to think about it is,

90
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,620
without even having to do this,you could've said,

91
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,510
what's 2 to the fifth power? 2 to the fifth power is 32.

92
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,830
And actually that alone,because there's only one choice

93
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,480
that even has a 32 behind the decimal point.

94
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,020
And you can say,every time I take to a power,

95
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,270
I'm adding one digit behind the decimal point,

96
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,210
so it's going to be 32, but it's going to have five numbers

97
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,080
behind the decimal point,so point one,two,three,four,five.

98
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,370
I did it the slow way. Next question,84.

99
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:08,080
90 minus 8 times 20-- I'll write it the way they did--

100
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,470
20 divided by 4,all of that over 1/2.

101
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,630
This is just a fast simplification problem.

102
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,150
That becomes 90 minus-- what's 20 divided by 4? 20 by 4 is 5.

103
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,880
5 times 8 is 40,all that over 1/2.

104
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,130
That becomes 50 over 1/2,which is the same thing as

105
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,350
50 times 2 over 1,which is equal to 100. That's choice C.

106
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,740
That's just one you just have to do quickly

107
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,090
and not make a careless mistake.

108
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,370
I did it quickly,I don't know if I did a careless mistake.

109
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,380
Let's see,85.

110
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,970
A dealer originally bought 100 identical batteries

111
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:53,550
at a total cost of q dollars. So q is equal to 100 batteries.

112
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,870
If each battery was sold at 50% above the original cost,

113
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,400
so b is the cost each battery was sold at,so b is going to be

114
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,010
50% above the original cost. So it's going to be 1.5

115
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,390
times the original cost. This is 50% above the original cost

116
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,810
per battery. Then in terms of q,

117
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:21,790
for how many dollars was each battery sold?

118
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:33,190
A dealer originally bought 100 identical batteries

119
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,870
at a total cost of q dollars.

120
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,970
If each battery was sold-- oh I'm sorry.

121
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:48,250
So this is the cost. So q is equal to 100 times

122
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,730
what the dealer paid for it.

123
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,500
A dealer originally bought 100 identical batteries

124
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,100
at the total cost of q dollars.

125
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,780
If each battery was sold at 50% above the original cost

126
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,080
per battery,this is the original cost,is equal to 1.5

127
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,520
times the cost. In terms of q,for how many dollars

128
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,440
was each battery sold? So let's write q in terms of the cost.

129
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,960
So cost is equal to q divided by 100.

130
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,200
Just divided both sides of that equation by 100.

131
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,540
And then we could just substitute c,or the cost here,

132
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,560
the selling price is 150% of this.

133
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,160
So selling price is equal to 1.5 times c,

134
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,720
which is q over a 100. And let's see how they did it.

135
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,950
So selling price is equal to 1.5q over 100.

136
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,290
I don't expect to see that as a choice.

137
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,140
But if we multiply the top and the bottom by 2,

138
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:57,230
that equals 3q over 200. That's choice A.

139
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,820
Just need to make sure you get your variables

140
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,830
right on that one. Problem 86.

141
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,380
In an increasing sequence of ten consecutive integers,

142
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,980
the sum of the first five integers is 560.

143
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,610
What is the sum of the last five integers in the sequence?

144
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:25,250
OK,ten consecutive integers. So x plus 1 plus x plus--

145
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,520
let me write it this way-- x plus 1 plus x plus 2,

146
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,910
well actually the first one,let's call it x,x plus 3,x plus 4

147
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,680
This right here is going to be

148
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,720
the first five consecutive integers if we start at x.

149
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,290
When you take the sum of those--

150
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,550
well the sum of those is 1,2,3,4,5x.

151
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,790
Let's see,1 plus 2 is 3,3 plus 3 is 6,6 plus 4 is 10.

152
00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:02,570
5x plus 10 is going to be equal to 560. Fair enough.

153
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,140
Or we could say 5x is equal to 550.

154
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,330
I think we can use that information.

155
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,750
Now what is the next five integers going to be?

156
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:18,460
It's going to be x plus 5,x plus 6,x plus 7,x plus 8,

157
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,040
and x plus 9. These are five,and what do those add up to be.

158
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:31,230
That's 5x plus-- 5 plus 6 is 11 plus 7 is 18 plus 8 is 26

159
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,070
plus 9. 26 plus 9 is 35. So that's 5x plus 35.

160
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,720
And they want to know what this is equal to.

161
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,850
That's the next five. Well we know what 5x is,it's equal 550.

162
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:51,250
From this set up,so it's going to be equal to 550 plus 35,

163
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:59,970
which is equal to 35 plus 550,which is 585. That's choice A.

164
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,430
And the trick here to being able to do it fast is just to

165
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,760
recognize that you didn't have to solve all the way for x.

166
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,970
That you could reuse this 5x

167
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,400
when you took the sum of the next five.

168
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,000
And I'm all out of time,see you in the next video.
