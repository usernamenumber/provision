1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,640
In the last video we saw that
the two chair shapes, or the

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,080
two chair configurations
of just plain vanilla

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,370
cyclohexane, were
equally stable.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,560
There was nothing that would
imply that this is more stable

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,190
than that or vice versa.

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,610
What we want to do in this video
is address what happens

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,090
if, instead of just a pure
cyclohexane, what if we added

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,290
a methyl group to it?

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,290
And so instead of just a
cyclohexane, let's think about

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,740
a methylcyclohexane, so we know
what to do when we're

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,520
naming things.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,720
So methylcyclohexane will
look like that.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,340
We'll have a hexagon here.

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,990
This is the way we've been
drawing it historically.

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,860
We've been drawing it
just like that.

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,180
And then we'll have
a methyl group.

18
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,040
And you could literally just
draw a methyl group like this

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,120
or maybe like this.

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,030
And by implication, you have a
carbon here, essentially a CH3

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,950
group here, and, of course,
you have another hydrogen

22
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,070
bonded here.

23
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,360
Now, if you were to draw this
methyl group in three

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,350
dimensions like this, it would
look just like our different

25
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,980
chair positions before, but
instead of this H being just

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,220
an H, we could make this entire
methyl group, so we

27
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,200
could turn this CH3 right here,
so this-- let me draw it

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,010
out in a different color.

29
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,850
We could make this carbon that
implicitly has three hydrogens

30
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,360
on it, so this is a CH3 group
that is a methyl group that's

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,170
right there.

32
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,670
We could substitute one of these
hydrogens with it, and

33
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,250
then this would be one
of the shapes of this

34
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,250
methylcyclohexane, CH3.

35
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,410
Let me write it down, just
to practice our naming.

36
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,660
So this is methylcyclohexane.

37
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:40,060
   

38
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,660
Now, this is one of their chair
positions, and then if

39
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,880
this were to flip down and the
other side were to flip up,

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,120
the other chair position would
take this methyl group from

41
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,690
being in an axial position,
and it would put it in an

42
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,950
equatorial position.

43
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,700
So this is the same
group right here.

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,740
Let me put a circle around it.

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,230
It's a whole group.

46
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,840
That's the CH3.

47
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,880
Now, the question we want to
answer in this video, is one

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,610
of these two configurations
going to be more stable?

49
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,960
Now, you might just be able to
eyeball it looking at this

50
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,620
diagram, and say, hey, when
we're in the position where

51
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,780
the methyl group is in the axial
position, it's going to

52
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,300
be closer to all of these
other carbons over here,

53
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,920
closer to their electron
clouds.

54
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,710
Maybe it has higher
potential energy.

55
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,080
Maybe it'll want
to spring away.

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,470
And if that was what you're
guessing or what you're kind

57
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,560
of eyeballing, you'd be right,
because in this position, this

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,220
methyl is much further away
from all of the stuff out

59
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,620
here, so there'll be less, I
guess you can consider it,

60
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,680
electron cloud crowding,
if you will.

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,420
Now, to see that a little bit
more clear, I want to do what

62
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,590
we call a double
Newman diagram.

63
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,420
And really, that's the whole
motivation of this video is to

64
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,540
kind of expose you to that.

65
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,260
A Newman diagram isn't just
useful for simple things like

66
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,790
a butane or an ethane.

67
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,810
You can actually do it
with cyclical rings.

68
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,110
And to do the Newman diagram,
let me number these carbons.

69
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,430
So we could number
them like this.

70
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,020
So this is carbon one, two,
three, four, five, six.

71
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,960
And you don't have to call this
one methylcyclohexane,

72
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,370
because whenever you have only
one group attached to the

73
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,760
ring, you implicitly start
numbering at the carbon that

74
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,820
the group is attached.

75
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,570
So that is the one
carbon over here.

76
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:24,030
This is the one carbon, two,
three, four, five, six.

77
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,740
And over here, once again, is
the one carbon, two, three,

78
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,850
four, five, six.

79
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,580
Now, what I want to do is draw
two Newman projections, and

80
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,070
both of them will involve--
well, actually, I'll draw

81
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,240
four, but you'll see what I'm
talking about in a second.

82
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,030
So the first Newman projection,
I'm going to start

83
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,610
at that carbon right
over there.

84
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,220
So let's think about what
that would look like.

85
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,230
So we're at the front.

86
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,100
We're staring straight
on to that carbon.

87
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,280
So this carbon's in the front,
this carbon over here.

88
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,610
This carbon, carbon number
two, is in the back.

89
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,470
So let me label this.

90
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,550
This is carbon number one that
we're looking head on.

91
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,150
Now, right in the axial
position you

92
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,170
have that methyl group.

93
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,800
So let me draw that.

94
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,910
So in the axial position you
have that methyl group right

95
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,810
over there.

96
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,630
And then in the equatorial
position right here, you have

97
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,626
this hydrogen.

98
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:16,190
Let me draw that.

99
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,700
So you have this hydrogen.

100
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,709
And then over here, this bond
right over here, this gets us

101
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,520
to another CH2 group.

102
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,450
Let me draw that like this.

103
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,240
So that gets us to
another CH2.

104
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,800
That's a CH2 right
there, right?

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,280
Or maybe I should circle
it like this.

106
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,580
This whole thing is a CH2.

107
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,660
So it's bonded to the carbon,
but the carbon has two

108
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,700
hydrogens on it.

109
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,540
And this is actually
carbon number six.

110
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,460
So this is the front.

111
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,260
Now, if we're staring straight
and carbon number two is right

112
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,460
behind it-- let me draw
carbon number two.

113
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,050
I'll do it in this blue color.

114
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,040
So carbon number two,
that bigger circle.

115
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,200
Now carbon number two, what's
going on over there?

116
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,990
It has a hydrogen in the axial
position going straight down.

117
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,880
   

118
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,660
This hydrogen right
over there.

119
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,680
And it has another hydrogen
going equatorial.

120
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,440
So this green hydrogen right
here is going equatorial.

121
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,970
It looks like that.

122
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,920
And then it connects to
carbon number three,

123
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,060
which is another CH2.

124
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,060
It has two hydrogens branching
off of it.

125
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,990
   

126
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,340
In front, we have carbon
number one.

127
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,692
In the back, we have
carbon number two.

128
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:30,040
Let me color code it
a little better.

129
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,670
Carbon number two.

130
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,710
And then carbon number two
branches off to-- so if you

131
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,850
think of this branch right here,
that's carbon number two

132
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,440
branching off to carbon number
three, or CH3 right there.

133
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,200
Let me do that in a new color.

134
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,400
So this is actually
a CH2 group.

135
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,130
That's a CH2.

136
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,350
This is a carbon, and it has
two hydrogens, right?

137
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,430
So this is a CH2.

138
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,170
This is carbon number
three right there.

139
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,920
And then that goes-- and
actually, I'll pause there.

140
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,230
What I'll do now is I'll draw
another Newman projection, but

141
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:14,190
for this Newman projection,
we'll be looking straight on

142
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,830
our carbon number five.

143
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,540
We're going to see we're going
to form a ring because the

144
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,130
first Newman projection
we just did

145
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,430
essentially covers this bond.

146
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,010
This bond is sitting straight
into the screen the way I did

147
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,410
it right now.

148
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,870
Carbon number two is directly
behind carbon number one.

149
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,670
So I guess the opposite side of
the ring is five to four.

150
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,070
If you look at, here, one to two
is there, and then five to

151
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,110
four is just like that.

152
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,230
So you can imagine when we're
doing the Newman projections,

153
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,920
we're looking straight on here
on the left Newman projection.

154
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,370
We're going to look straight in
that direction on the right

155
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,370
Newman projection.

156
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,400
So if we have carbon number five
in front, what are its

157
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,880
bonds going to look like?

158
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,650
Well, it's going to bond to
carbon number six over here.

159
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,070
So we can make this right--
let me do that

160
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,450
in a different color.

161
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:06,180
This right here, this bond right
here is this bond right

162
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,190
here to that same CH2 that
our first Newman

163
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,760
projection bonded to.

164
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,070
And then he's going to
have two hydrogens.

165
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,030
I haven't drawn them here.

166
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,760
Let me draw them, just
so you can see them.

167
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,420
It's going to have two
hydrogens, one in an axial

168
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,310
position and one in an
equatorial position.

169
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,425
It's hard to see now, but he's
going to have one hydrogen in

170
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:28,260
an axial and one in an
equatorial position.

171
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,740
And then in the back
we're going to draw

172
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,710
carbon number four.

173
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,570
And carbon number four, I will
do in this green color.

174
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,140
So carbon number four--
actually, , well, yeah I'll do

175
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,580
carbon number four in
that green color.

176
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,720
This is really just an exercise
in visualization.

177
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,990
That's why I wanted
to do it with you.

178
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,480
So carbon number four has an
axial hydrogen, so it has a

179
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,790
hydrogen pointing
straight down.

180
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,470
That hydrogen is
that hydrogen.

181
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,240
It has an equatorial hydrogen
going out like that.

182
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,890
And then it bonds to carbon
number three.

183
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:01,110
So this bond right here is
this bond just like that.

184
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,580
So what do we see immediately
when we

185
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,050
draw this chair position?

186
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,070
When our methyl group
is in the axial

187
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,140
position, what do we see?

188
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,810
Methyl in axial position.

189
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,930
We see that it's gauche,
or gowche.

190
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,490
I don't know the best
way to pronounce it.

191
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,810
It's only 60 degrees away from
carbon number three.

192
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,010
This is only 60 degrees,
or a dihedral angle.

193
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,130
When you use the Newman
projection, this is only a

194
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,580
60-degree angle.

195
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,309
It is gauche to carbon
number three.

196
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,880
So maybe they're crowding
each other a little bit.

197
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,070
Let's compare it to the
situation where our methyl

198
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,010
group is equatorial, where the
carbon that it's attached to

199
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,490
is on the down part
of the chair.

200
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,920
Let's see what that Newman
projection looks like.

201
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,300
So same thing.

202
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,480
Let me scroll over to the
right a little bit.

203
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,570
So this is this configuration
and it's in equilibrium with

204
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,670
this configuration right here.

205
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,200
We'll do the exact
same exercise.

206
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,050
Carbon number one.

207
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,080
But now carbon number one, in
carbon number one right here,

208
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,250
the hydrogen is now axial and
it's pointing straight down.

209
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,570
Let me draw that.

210
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,830
So we have a hydrogen pointing
straight down now.

211
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:27,490
Hydrogen's pointing down and
now the CH3 is in an

212
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,910
equatorial position, which you
can see more clearly on this

213
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,520
than over here.

214
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,010
So you have a CH3.

215
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,140
The methyl group
is right there.

216
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,930
And now this bond to
carbon number six

217
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,180
will look like this.

218
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,590
   

219
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,890
So you have a CH2.

220
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,260
This is number six
right over there.

221
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,510
And now if we were to go to
the back, if we were go to

222
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,490
carbon number two in the back,
which we had done in the blue

223
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,130
color before, so I'll do it
in the blue color again.

224
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,600
Carbon number two in black, it
has a hydrogen in the axial

225
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,460
position going straight up.

226
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,650
That's that hydrogen
right there.

227
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,740
It has a hydrogen going
straight up.

228
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,420
It has another hydrogen over
here, and then it bonds to

229
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:17,390
carbon number three in the
back, so CH2 over here.

230
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,340
So this guy's the same thing
as this guy, but now we've

231
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,940
flipped configurations, so he
bonds to that guy in the back.

232
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,840
And now we do the Newman diagram
looking straight on to

233
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,870
carbon number five, or looking,
actually, straight on

234
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,310
to-- right, carbon
number five.

235
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,180
So we're looking straight in
this direction for this Newman

236
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,650
projection.

237
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,100
Now we're going to look straight
in this direction for

238
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,670
our other Newman projection.

239
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:46,200
So carbon number five, if we
draw it in the front-- I

240
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,890
haven't drawn it here, but it
has a hydrogen at the axial

241
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,785
position, and it has
a hydrogen in

242
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:52,400
the equatorial position.

243
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,430
So carbon number five, if we
look at this, and this is

244
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,800
really-- if you're getting a
little stressed out about this

245
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,490
because it's a little hard
to understand, you

246
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,360
might want to rewatch.

247
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,590
This is really just an example
of visualizations.

248
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,480
I really hope this isn't
confusing you.

249
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,950
If you find this really
daunting, this isn't going to

250
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,130
really trip you up in the rest
of organic chemistry, but if

251
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,200
you can get it, it's
even better.

252
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,030
You'll be that much better
at visualizing

253
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,720
some of these molecules.

254
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,240
So if we look straight on at
carbon number five, we have a

255
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,820
hydrogen in the axial position
coming straight down.

256
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,250
   

257
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,000
It is bonded.

258
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,180
Carbon number five is bonded to
carbon number six, which is

259
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,150
right over there.

260
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,450
So let me make it very clear.

261
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,880
So this bond right here,
I want to do it

262
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,070
in a different color.

263
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,330
This bond it right here is the
same thing as this one.

264
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,990
This is a really good way to--
if you can do this, then your

265
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,490
brain is pretty good at
translating between Newman

266
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,090
projections and these kind
of seat diagrams

267
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,290
that we have up here.

268
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,500
So this is this bond.

269
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,750
This axial hydrogen is
this axial hydrogen.

270
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,130
And then we have another
hydrogen.

271
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,580
We have this hydrogen right
here, which would

272
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,550
be that like that.

273
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,030
And then behind it, you have
carbon number four.

274
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:20,050
Carbon number four is like that,
so carbon number four,

275
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,290
draw a circle.

276
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,050
It has a hydrogen in its axial
position, another hydrogen

277
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,900
like that, and then it bonds
to carbon number three.

278
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,770
So this was number
three right here.

279
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,120
So just like that.

280
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,610
So what do we see about this
methyl group here?

281
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,880
In this situation, this
methyl group is anti-.

282
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,200
There's two ways to
think about it.

283
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,270
It's dihedral angle versus
carbon number

284
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,850
three is now 180 degrees.

285
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,240
Over here it was gauche.

286
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,080
Its dihedral angle to carbon
number three was 60 degrees.

287
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,870
Now, it's 180 degrees.

288
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,260
So it's much further.

289
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,340
And now its dihedral angle
to carbon number

290
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,000
six is also 120 degrees.

291
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,550
So in this situation, where
our methyl group is

292
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,820
equatorial, it's axial here.

293
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,650
It's equatorial here when we
jumped back down because

294
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,700
notice, it's parallel.

295
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,060
The bond is parallel to
parts of the ring.

296
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,730
In this situation, we are
farther away from the other

297
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,570
methyl groups.

298
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,490
There's less crowding,
and so this is

299
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,230
a more stable situation.

300
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:33,230
So you could say it is
anti-configuration relative to

301
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,490
carbon number three, while over
here, it was gauche to

302
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,650
carbon number three.

303
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,390
I don't know if I'm saying it.

304
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,270
Is it gowche, gauche?

305
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,610
I don't know the best
way to pronounce it.

306
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,330
So in this case, there's
less crowding.

307
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:49,610
This is more stable, lower
potential energy.

308
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,860
So hopefully you found
that interesting.

309
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,670
This was really a way, just an
exercise in being able to go

310
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,320
from this visualization
to kind of this

311
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,040
double Newman diagram.

312
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,550
And if it makes it any easier,
the way you could think about

313
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,550
it is we're kind of viewing in
this Newman diagram right

314
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,480
here, where this carbon number
six is this carbon number six.

315
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,450
This CH2 is this
one back there.

316
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,750
So when we're looking at it
from this, we're kind of

317
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,940
looking at this hexane ring
from this direction.

318
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,350
We see this in front.

319
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,830
This is this, and we
see that in back.

320
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,090
That is that.

321
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,670
Over here, same thing.

322
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:29,650
We're looking at it directly
from this direction.

323
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,660
We see this guy on top is over
here, and this guy on the

324
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,910
bottom is over here.

325
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,400
