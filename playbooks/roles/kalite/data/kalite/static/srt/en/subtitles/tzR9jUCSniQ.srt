1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:07,359
the maximum value of the expression one over
sine squared of theta plus three sine theta

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,469
co-sign theta

3
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:13,019
plus five cosine squared of theta is

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,249
let's rewrite this, so this is one over

5
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:19,240
one over, so i have a sine squared of theta

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,990
i have a sine squared of theta and then

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,820
at least my brain whenever i see a sine squared of theta 
i always look for cosine squared of theta because

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,259
i know when i take the sum of them it equals one

9
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:35,530
i don't have just one cosine squared of theta
here at five cosine squared of thetas let me just

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,820
take one of them

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,599
so i have a plus cosine the squared theta

12
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:44,620
because i took one of them i only have four
of these left

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,560
so plus four cosine squared of theta

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,070
and then i have this stuff plus

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,080
three sine

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,510
of theta of co-sine of theta

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,440
so what this

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,750
first first step allowed me to do is just turn

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,240
two characters right over here sine squared
theta plus cosine squared theta

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,630
that is equal to one

21
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,750
so we've simplified it to one over

22
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,750
one over

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,020
one plus

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,290
now lets think about how we can write co-signed squared
of theta

25
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,730
i'll write our identities here

26
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,380
co-signed squared of theta we've proved these
in the

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,460
trigonometry playlist. This is equal to

28
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,740
one-plus cosine

29
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,390
one-plus co-signed of two theta

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,430
all of that

31
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,000
over

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,670
two and my goal here is that i really

33
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,460
just wanna get everything, well i just wanna simplify and maybe

34
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,399
we will do calculus

35
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,909
value of the numerator

36
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,469
solicit cosine squared theta is equal to this

37
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:50,610
so four times this is just going to be

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,060
so four times this before divide by two instances
would be two times this numerator

39
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,210
so it's going to be too

40
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,869
plus too

41
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,600
co-signed

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,930
of to data that's this term right here

43
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,530
and then this term

44
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,679
this term right over here we could use the
tree guided me that

45
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,610
signed of to data

46
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,069
is equal to two sign of state a

47
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,309
co-sign if data

48
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:20,379
or you divide both sides right to you get
a one-half sign of

49
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:21,349
tuesday dot

50
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,609
is equal to sign of feder

51
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:29,209
co-sign of theta so this is this right over
here this part right over here is going to

52
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,230
be one-half signed up to date a bore multiplying
it by three

53
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,079
just going to be plus three halves

54
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,269
sign of two data

55
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:39,639
sighing of

56
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,719
too

57
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,670
glitzy thus

58
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,349
part over here clearly simplifies

59
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,399
this is the recent history right this is one
over

60
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,709
three

61
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:51,129
plus

62
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,549
to co-signed of to data

63
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,989
plus thirty halves

64
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:57,969
sign

65
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,320
of to data

66
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,760
now we really just looking for in the minimum

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,690
we're looking for the

68
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,350
minimum value of the denominator which would
give us the same as the maximum value of the

69
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,860
new murder or just be one over at this minimum
values alexia how how lol we can get assuming

70
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,489
were above zero t how low we can get

71
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,729
for this denominator write your words will
look for its minimum value so one day we can

72
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:21,480
do just to simplify things

73
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,169
the middle value of this

74
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,029
is going to be the same demand

75
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:28,870
the bid of this thing over right there

76
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,729
to kind of confuses the problem

77
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:33,059
the minimum value

78
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:35,479
the replies to cosign

79
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,369
to stayed up plus three have sign

80
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:40,450
of two data

81
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,390
is going to be the same thing is the minimum
value of three plus

82
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,220
on the screen to the substitution the tuesday
it is equal to exodus simplify things a little

83
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,589
bit you don't have to do that

84
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:54,209
so three plus two co-signed of acts

85
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:56,479
plus three halves

86
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,579
sayed

87
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:58,509
of acts

88
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:02,720
so this is a pretty simple expression to see
how we can figure out some minimum value and

89
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,209
my temptation is to take the derivative find
out where the derivative is equal to zero

90
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,759
and then that will either be a maximum or
a minimum point

91
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,779
so let's take the derivatives the derivative
of this expression right over here with respect

92
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:16,900
to acs

93
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:22,709
would really love three with the for texas
zeroed route of two cosine of axis negative

94
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,369
negative to sign of x

95
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:28,320
derivative of three have side of actions will
be plus

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,930
three halves cosine of x

97
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,030
and that is going to be equal to zero we want
to find where the slope is your committee

98
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,269
worry about somewhere minimum point

99
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:39,310
and let's see we can

100
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,690
admit

101
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,629
we had to sign of extra boats side so we get
the rehabs

102
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:46,740
co-signed of acs is equal to two

103
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:53,209
signed of x and then we can divide both the
sides both sides of this equation

104
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,249
by

105
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:57,560
will survive like to first alaska too many
steps of three

106
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,629
forts co-signed of x

107
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,400
is equal to sign

108
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,420
of acs

109
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,959
and to divide both sides by cosine of x

110
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,629
so we get three

111
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:11,149
over for is equal to sign of x over a co-signer
of x

112
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:14,410
which is the same thing as the pentagon that
cs

113
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,169
so uh... annexed by you that gives us three
or attended of annexed by his three-fourths

114
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,619
is going to give us either a maximum or a
minimum point celeste think about this

115
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:28,189
let's think about this a little bit will be
drawn by unit circle

116
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,760
so think about that too

117
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,930
technip to expel use that will give us a tangent
of three-fourths

118
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,219
so that we draw my unit circle

119
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:41,099
that's the unit circle

120
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:44,359
redraw unit

121
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,840
download this is always the hardest part so
redraw this

122
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,679
r ight

123
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:51,029
their inspired units or call

124
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:53,310
so how can i get the triangle

125
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,300
or or

126
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,200
we're listing but that would how can i get
a triangle who where and angle is attended

127
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,060
of three four two river candid is opposite
over adjacent

128
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,149
right tangent is opposite over adjacent so

129
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:08,379
if missus wire triangle right over here

130
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:10,389
if this is acs

131
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:13,330
opposite over adjacent is equal to three fourths

132
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,649
so opposite could be three an adjacent could
be

133
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:19,859
and we hopefully immediately recognize this
this is the

134
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:23,289
this is a three four five triangle too right
triangle

135
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,860
three square plus four square it is twenty
five

136
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,180
which is five squares as of three four

137
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,559
triangle

138
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,699
there's too

139
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,889
headed values so x could be like this and
this obviously isn't

140
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,770
isn't eight unit high partners who over here
but we can divide everything by five it would

141
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,479
be so we could have the situation

142
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,979
we could have been situation over here

143
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:48,360
where this is actually this is the uh... circle
the hypothesis one

144
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,469
this is three over five

145
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:53,159
and this is for over five

146
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,760
this word tended of ax here

147
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,220
canada backs would give us the reports but
it was going to give us a maximum value were

148
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,309
minimal value

149
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:02,459
well over here both close sign

150
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:06,969
both co-signed of acts and sign of x are going
to be positive so both of these are going

151
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,830
to be positive values so screw them

152
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,099
probably maximize

153
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,760
maximize the six pressure over here

154
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,060
by the other

155
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,439
x that gives us the same tangent

156
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,330
remember the standard is really just the slope

157
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,819
the radius of the unit circle would be

158
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:27,180
the angle would be the single this is the
same this has the same kenton value

159
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,030
so dispatched

160
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,419
this x

161
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:31,949
over

162
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:34,819
this actually and this case the tended to
still

163
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,399
the tended to still going to be three-fourths

164
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,530
but over here

165
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,159
the science co-signed our negatives over here

166
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,569
overhear the

167
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,610
xc ward at or the co-sign is going to be negative
four fifths

168
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,080
and the sign value

169
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,639
or or the wide values used to be negative
three-fifths

170
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,649
and this will give us

171
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,779
this will give us

172
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:02,489
minimum boy because here everything is every
ball the sign in the coastline are negative

173
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:03,819
so let's use

174
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,529
let's use this x right over here

175
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:10,170
and notice we don't even have to figure out
what the axis 'cause we know

176
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,770
but if it ended overhears four-fifths

177
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,150
the speed of both the sba science going to
be

178
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,289
the size of the three fifths of the course
i was going to be forecast

179
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,809
or which will give some actual point or the
tenant could be

180
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:25,990
for three-fourths and then the side will be
negative benefits and of course i will be

181
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,039
negative forfeit so let's use these overuse
of the middle of

182
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,120
is going to be equal to three plus

183
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,469
went two times coastline of x_ were using
this one over here so to transpose side of

184
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,300
exco sign of experience

185
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,610
negative four fists

186
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,179
negative

187
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,430
for fests

188
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,449
and then plus three halves

189
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:50,500
plus three has times in the sign of x sinai
lectures negative three fifths

190
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,050
negative

191
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,570
three fits and what is this

192
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,240
going to be equal to this is going to be equal
to

193
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,560
three

194
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,440
plus

195
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,730
this is negative eight fifths

196
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,240
dreamweaver should write three minus eight
fifth

197
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,590
three minus the this

198
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,290
minus nine tenths

199
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,880
minus nine tenths and so this is going to
be equal to

200
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,960
we could put everything over ten

201
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,840
thirty over ten

202
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,340
minus sixteen over ten

203
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,270
right that's eight fists

204
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,410
minus nine or ten and this gives us what

205
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,400
this gives us five or ten

206
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,220
five over ten or or one-half

207
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,680
so the minimum value the minimum value for
denominator everything we've been dealing

208
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,840
with so far has been our denominator

209
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,180
the middle of the idea of all of this business
over here

210
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,140
the minimum value is one-half

211
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,990
so the maximum value

212
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,300
that this whole expression takes is when the
minimum values one out so we get one over

213
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,110
one-half

214
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,970
equal to to we're done
