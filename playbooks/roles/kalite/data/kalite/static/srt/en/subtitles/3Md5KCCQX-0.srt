1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,410
In the last video we set out to
find the eigenvalues values

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,830
of this 3 by 3 matrix, A.

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,280
And we said, look an eigenvalue
is any value,

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,410
lambda, that satisfies
this equation if v

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,280
is a non-zero vector.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,300
And that says, any value,
lambda, that satisfies this

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,390
equation for v is a
non-zero vector.

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,760
Then we just did a little bit
of I guess we could call it

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,370
vector algebra up here
to come up with that.

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,890
You can review that
video if you like.

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,700
And then we determined, look
the only way that this is

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,710
going to have a non-zero
solution is if this matrix has

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,320
a non-trivial null space.

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,790
And only non-invertible matrices
have a non-trivial

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,970
null space.

17
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,020
Or, only matrices that have
a determinant of 0 have

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,770
non-trivial null spaces.

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,510
So you do that, you got your
characteristic polynomial, and

20
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,680
we were able to solve it.

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,000
And we got our eigenvalues where
lambda is equal to 3 and

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,370
lambda is equal to minus 3.

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,050
So now, let's do-- what I
consider the more interesting

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,840
part-- is actually find out
the eigenvectors or the

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,530
eigenspaces.

26
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,800
So we can go back to this
equation, for any eigenvalue

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,570
this must be true.

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,300
This must be true but this
is easier to work with.

29
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,140
And so, this matrix right here
times your eigenvector must be

30
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,100
equal 0 for any given
eigenvalue.

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,720
This matrix right here--
I've just copied

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,740
and pasted from above.

33
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,120
I marked it up with the Rule
of Sarrus so you can ignore

34
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,870
those lines-- is just
this matrix right

35
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,430
here for any lambda.

36
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,810
Lambda times the identity
matrix minus A

37
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,330
ends up being this.

38
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,600
So let's take this matrix for
each of our lambdas and then

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,190
solve for our eigenvectors
or our eigenspaces.

40
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,390
So let me take the case of
lambda is equal to 3 first. So

41
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,290
if lambda is equal to 3, this
matrix becomes lambda plus 1

42
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,900
is 4, lambda minus 2 is 1,
lambda minus 2 is 1.

43
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,590
And then all of the other terms
stay the same, minus 2,

44
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,380
minus 2, minus 2, 1,
minus 2 and 1.

45
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,390
And then this times that vector,
v, or our eigenvector

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,010
v is equal to 0.

47
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,070
Or we could say that the
eigenspace for the eigenvalue

48
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,990
3 is the null space
of this matrix.

49
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,230
Which is not this matrix.

50
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,690
It's lambda times the
identity minus A.

51
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,060
So the null space of this matrix
is the eigenspace.

52
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,510
So all of the values that
satisfy this make up the

53
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,540
eigenvectors of the eigenspace
of lambda is equal to 3.

54
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,400
So let's just solve for this.

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,940
So the null space of this guy--
we could just put in

56
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,750
reduced row echelon form-- the
null space of this guy is the

57
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,580
same thing as the null space
of this guy in reduced row

58
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,560
echelon form.

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,310
So let's put this in reduced
row echelon form.

60
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,650
So the first thing I
want to do-- let me

61
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,070
just do it down here.

62
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,940
So let me-- I'll keep my first
row the same for now.

63
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,200
4 minus 2, minus 2.

64
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,250
And let me replace my second row
with my second row times 2

65
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,150
plus my first row.

66
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,970
So minus 2 times
2 plus 1 is 0.

67
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,270
1 times 2 plus minus 2 is 0.

68
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,190
1 times 2 plus minus 2 is 0.

69
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,900
This row is the same
as this row.

70
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,180
So I'm going to do
the same thing.

71
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,360
Minus 2 times 2 plus 4 is 0.

72
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,860
1 times 2 plus 2 is 0.

73
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,570
And then 1 times 2 plus
minus 2 is 0.

74
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,840
So the solutions to this
equation are the same as the

75
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,270
solutions to this equation.

76
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,250
Let me write it like this.

77
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,470
Instead of just writing
the vector, v,

78
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,700
let me write it out.

79
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,570
So v1, v2, v3 are going to
be equal to the 0 vector.

80
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,300
0, 0.

81
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,180
Just rewriting it slightly
different.

82
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,010
And so these two rows, or these
two equations, give us

83
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,700
no information.

84
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,490
The only one is this row up
here, which tells us that 4

85
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:04,560
times v1 minus 2 times v2--
actually this wasn't complete

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,820
reduced row echelon form
but close enough.

87
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,050
It's easy for us to work with--
4 times v1 minus 2

88
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:17,920
times v2 minus 2 times
v3 is equal to 0.

89
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,050
Let's just divide by 4.

90
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,830
I could've just divided by 4
here, which might have made it

91
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,970
skipped a step.

92
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:30,210
But if you divide by 4 you get
v1 minus 1/2 v2 minus 1/2 v3

93
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,620
is equal to 0.

94
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,490
Or, v1 is equal to 1/2
v2 plus 1/2 v3.

95
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,400
Just added these guys to both
sides of the equation.

96
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,770
Or we could say, let's say that
v2 is equal to-- yeah I

97
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,180
don't know, I'm going to just
put some random number-- a,

98
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,830
and v3 is equal to b, then we
can say-- and then v1 would be

99
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,200
equal to 1/2 a plus 1/2 b.

100
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:07,020
We can say that the eigenspace
for lambda is equal to 3, is

101
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:14,900
the set of all of vectors, v1,
v2, v3, that are equal to a

102
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,350
times times-- v2 is a, right?

103
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,200
So v2 is equal to a times 1.

104
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,810
v3 has no a in it.

105
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,020
So it's a times 0.

106
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,950
Plus b times-- v2 is just a.

107
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,490
v2 has no b in it.

108
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,640
So it's 0.

109
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,290
v3 is 1 times-- so 0 times
a plus 1 times b.

110
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,745
And then v1 is 1/2
a plus 1/2 b.

111
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:48,260
   

112
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,800
For any a and b, such
that a and b are

113
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,600
members of the reals.

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,660
Just to be a little bit
formal about it.

115
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:02,180
So that's our-- any vector
that satisfies this is an

116
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,320
eigenvector.

117
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,260
And they're the eigenvectors
that correspond to eigenvalue

118
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,190
lambda is equal to 3.

119
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,200
So if you apply the matrix
transformation to any of these

120
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,450
vectors, you're just going
to scale them up by 3.

121
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,800
Let me write this way.

122
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,220
The eigenspace for lambda is
equal to 3, is equal to the

123
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,950
span, all of the potential
linear combinations of this

124
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,290
guy and that guy.

125
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,710
So 1/2, 1, 0.

126
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:36,430
And 1/2, 0, 1.

127
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,640
So that's only one of
the eigenspaces.

128
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,750
That's the one that
corresponds to

129
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,640
lambda is equal to 3.

130
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,290
Let's do the one that
corresponds to lambda is equal

131
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,060
to minus 3.

132
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,420
So if lambda is equal to minus
3-- I'll do it up here, I

133
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,410
think I have enough space--
lambda is equal to minus 3.

134
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:57,850
This matrix becomes-- I'll do
the diagonals-- minus 3 plus 1

135
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,300
is minus 2.

136
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,950
Minus 3 minus 2 is minus 5.

137
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,960
Minus 3 minus 2 is minus 5.

138
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,160
And all the other things
don't change.

139
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
Minus 2, minus 2, 1.

140
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,110
Minus 2, minus 2 and 1.

141
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,210
And then that times vectors
in the eigenspace that

142
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,390
corresponds to lambda is equal
to minus 3, is going to be

143
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,050
equal to 0.

144
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,140
I'm just applying this equation
right here which we

145
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,550
just derived from that
one over there.

146
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,116
So, the eigenspace that
corresponds to lambda is equal

147
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:37,315
to minus 3, is the null space,
this matrix right here, are

148
00:07:37,315 --> 00:07:40,040
all the vectors that satisfy
this equation.

149
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,210
So what is-- the null space of
this is the same thing as the

150
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,670
null space of this in reduced
row echelon form So let's put

151
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,190
it in reduced row
echelon form.

152
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,510
So the first thing I want to do,
I'm going to keep my first

153
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,360
row the same.

154
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,620
I'm going to write a little bit
smaller than I normally do

155
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,800
because I think I'm going
to run out of space.

156
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,010
So minus 2, minus 2, minus 2.

157
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,170
Actually let me just
do it this way.

158
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,830
I will skip some steps.

159
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's just divide the first
row by minus 2.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,230
So we get 1, 1, 1.

161
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,190
And then let's replace this
second row with the second row

162
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,470
plus this version of
the first row.

163
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,170
So this guy plus that guy is 0
minus 5 plus minus-- or let me

164
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,960
say this way.

165
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,350
Let me replace it with
the first row

166
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,720
minus the second row.

167
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,179
So minus 2 minus minus 2 is 0.

168
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,450
Minus 2 minus minus
5 is plus 3.

169
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:43,669
And then minus 2 minus
1 is minus 3.

170
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,770
And then let me do
the last row in a

171
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,060
different color for fun.

172
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,330
And I'll do the same thing.

173
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,840
I'll do this row
minus this row.

174
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,110
So minus 2 minus
minus 2 is a 0.

175
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,150
Minus 2 plus 2.

176
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,390
Minus 2 minus 1 is minus 3.

177
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:03,210
And then we have minus
2 minus minus 5.

178
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,330
So it's minus 2 plus 5.

179
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,090
So that is 3.

180
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:13,770
Now let me replace-- and I'll
do it in two steps.

181
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,570
So this is 1, 1, 1.

182
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,770
I'll just keep it like that.

183
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:23,480
And actually, well let me
just keep it like that.

184
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,590
And then let me replace my third
row with my third row

185
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,870
plus my second row.

186
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,660
It'll just zero out.

187
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,270
If you add these terms, these
all just become 0.

188
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,540
That guy got zeroed out.

189
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,410
And let me take my second
row and divide it by 3.

190
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,530
So this becomes 0, 1, minus 1.

191
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,970
And I'm almost there.

192
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,330
I'll do it in orange.

193
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,680
So let me replace my first row
with my first row minus my

194
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,470
second row.

195
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:57,250
So this becomes 1, 0, and then
1 minus minus 1 is 2.

196
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,440
1 minus minus 1 is 2.

197
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,760
And then in the second
row is 0, 1, minus 1.

198
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,770
And then the last
row is 0, 0, 0.

199
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,910
So any v that satisfies this
equation will also

200
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,480
satisfy this guy.

201
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,650
This guy's null space is going
to be the null space of that

202
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,180
guy in reduced row
echelon form.

203
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:26,010
So v1, v2, v3 is equal
to 0, 0, 0.

204
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,930
Let me move this.

205
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,530
Because I've officially
run out of space.

206
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,110
So let me move this lower
down where I have

207
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,620
some free real estate.

208
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,800
Let me move it down here.

209
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,430
This corresponds to lambda
is equal to minus 3.

210
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,830
This was lambda is equal to
minus 3, just to make us--

211
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,200
it's not related to this
stuff right here.

212
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,620
So what are all of the v1s, v2s
and v3s that satisfy this?

213
00:10:51,620 --> 00:11:00,100
So if we say that v3
is equal to t.

214
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,310
If v3 is equal to t, then
what do we have here?

215
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,530
We have-- this tells us that
v2 minus v3 is equal to 0.

216
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:15,700
So that tells us that v2 minus
v3-- 0 times v1 plus v2 minus

217
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,150
v3 is equal to 0.

218
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,660
Or that v2 is equal to v3,
which is equal to t.

219
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,340
That's what that second
equation tells us.

220
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,150
And then the third equation
tells us, or the top equation

221
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:34,060
tells us, v1 times 1-- so v1
plus 0 times v2 plus 2 times

222
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,990
v3 is equal to 0.

223
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:45,240
Or v1 is equal to minus 2v3 is
equal to minus 2 times t.

224
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,110
So the eigenspace that
corresponds to lambda is equal

225
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:56,930
to minus 3 is equal to the set
of all the vectors, v1, v2 and

226
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:07,820
v3, where-- well, it's equal
to t times-- v3 is just t.

227
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,790
v3 was just t.

228
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,400
v2 also just ends up being t.

229
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,320
So 1 times t.

230
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,530
And v1 is minus 2 times t.

231
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,390
For t is any real number.

232
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,030
Or another way to say it is that
the eigenspace for lambda

233
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:31,380
is equal to minus 3 is equal
to the span-- I wrote this

234
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,200
really messy-- where lambda is
equal to minus 3 is equal to

235
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:45,020
the span of the vector
minus 2, 1, and 1.

236
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,540
Just like that.

237
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,620
It looks interesting.

238
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,510
Because if you take this guy
and dot it with either of

239
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,280
these guys, I think you get 0.

240
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,510
Is that definitely the case?

241
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,790
Take minus 2 times 1/2, you
get a minus 1 there.

242
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,750
Then you have a plus 1.

243
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,580
That's 0.

244
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,750
And then minus 2 times 1/2.

245
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,160
Yeah.

246
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,230
You dot it with either of
these guys you get 0.

247
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,200
So this line is orthogonal
to that plane.

248
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,790
Very interesting.

249
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,990
So let's just graph it just so
we have a good visualization

250
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,770
of what we're doing.

251
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,070
So we had that 3
by 3 matrix, A.

252
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,920
It represents some
transformation in R3.

253
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,210
And it has two eigenvalues.

254
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,030
And each of those have a
corresponding eigenspace.

255
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,030
So the eigenspace that
corresponds to the eigenvalue

256
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,930
3 is a plane in R3.

257
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,940
   

258
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,600
So this is the eigenspace for
lambda is equal to 3.

259
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,370
And it's the span of these
two vectors right there.

260
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,040
So if I draw them, maybe
they're like that.

261
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Just like that.

262
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,440
And then the eigenspace
for lambda is equal to

263
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,850
minus 3 is a line.

264
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,260
It's a line that's perpendicular
to this plane.

265
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,460
It's a line like that.

266
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,710
It's the span of this guy.

267
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,870
Maybe if I draw that vector,
that vector might look

268
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,150
something like this.

269
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,440
And it's the span of that guy.

270
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,920
So what this tells us, this is
the eigenspace for lambda is

271
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,600
equal to minus 3.

272
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,830
So what that tells us-- just
to make sure we are

273
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,300
interpreting our eigenvalues and
eigenspaces correctly-- is

274
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,700
look, you give me any
eigenvector, you give me any

275
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,960
vector in this, you give me any
vector right here, let's

276
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,800
say that is vector x.

277
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,320
If I apply the transformation,
if I multiply it it by a, I'm

278
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,980
going to have 3 times that.

279
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,440
Because it's in the eigenspace
where lambda is equal to 3.

280
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,420
So if I were to apply a times
x, a times x would be just 3

281
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,460
times that.

282
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,220
So that would be a times x.

283
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,900
That's what it tells me.

284
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,890
This would be true for
any of these guys.

285
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,390
If this was x, and you took a
times x, it's going to be 3

286
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,740
times as long.

287
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,950
Now these guys over here, if you
have some vector in this

288
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,520
eigenspace that corresponds to
lambda is equal to 3, and you

289
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,640
apply the transformation.

290
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,500
Let's say that this
is x right there.

291
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,710
If you took the transformation
of x, it's going to make it 3

292
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,320
times longer in the opposite
direction.

293
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,230
It's still going to
be on this line.

294
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,720
So it's going to go
down like this.

295
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,340
And that would be a times x.

296
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,510
It would be the same, it'd be
3 times this length, but in

297
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,360
the opposite direction.

298
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,190
Because it corresponds to lambda
is equal to minus 3.

299
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,420
So anyway, we've, I think,
made a great achievement.

300
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,290
We've not only figured out the
eigenvalues for a 3 by 3

301
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,760
matrix, we now have figured out
all of the eigenvectors.

302
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,260
Which are-- there's an infinite
number-- but they

303
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,590
represent 2 eigenspaces that
correspond to those two

304
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:31,170
eigenvalues, or minus 3 and 3.

305
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,270
See you in the next video.

306
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:33,399
