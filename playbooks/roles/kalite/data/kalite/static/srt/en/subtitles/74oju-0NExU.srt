1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,940
We're on problem 39.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,060
And it says which ordered pairs
the vertex of f of x is

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,280
equal to x squared
plus 6x plus 5?

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,660
Now, finding vertexes of
parabolas, there's a formula,

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,830
and negative b over 2a, but you
might forget that when you

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,280
turn 30 years old.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,515
The whole goal of this isn't
just to pass an algebra exam.

9
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:25,400
It's to learn algebra.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,190
Then when you learn calculus,
you'll learn actually a much

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,160
easier way to figure out minimum
and maximum points.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,330
But there's actually an
intuitive way of doing it in

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,440
algebra as well.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,530
What we have to do is just
write this in that form.

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,510
If we could write this function
in the form like

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:46,060
this, f of x is equal to A,
times x plus or minus

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,550
something, I don't know,
b, squared, plus C.

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,440
Then we know the vertex happens
when x is equal to b.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,530
Because if you look at this form
of a parabola-- and you

20
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,490
can write any of these in this
form-- then you say OK, this

21
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,380
term right here is always
going to be positive.

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,320
So the minimum point of this
parabola is when this term is

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,560
equal to 0.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,090
Then the minimum point of this
term happens when x is equal

25
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,030
to b, when this term
is equal to 0.

26
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,720
So the vertex becomes
xb comma C.

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,400
So let's do that with this.

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,530
You could memorize it.

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,200
It ends up being minus
b over 2A.

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,110
But let's just actually solve
it, because I want you to have

31
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,440
the intuition.

32
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,370
f of x is equal to x squared
plus 6x, plus 5.

33
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,800
I wrote a gap there for a
reason, because we're

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,430
essentially going to
complete a square.

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,210
We want to turn this x squared
plus 6x, plus something, into

36
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,890
a perfect square.

37
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,020
Hopefully you have
some practice

38
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,860
completing the square.

39
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,130
What number is 1/2 of 6?

40
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,000
Because when we square it, if
we do x plus a squared, that

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,320
equals what? x squared plus
2ax plus a squared.

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,390
So if we map that to that,
x squared is x squared.

43
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,050
2ax is equal to 6.

44
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,140
So a would be equal to 3.

45
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:12,240
And if a is equal to 3, a
squared would be equal to 9.

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,650
You can't just add a 9 to one
side of the equation.

47
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,770
You either have to do it to both
sides, or you have to do

48
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,940
something to offset that.

49
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,920
So if we added a 9 here, let's
just subtract a 9 as well.

50
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,500
So then we get x squared plus
6x, plus 9, plus 5, minus 9.

51
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,150
So this right here, this part of
it, that's equal to x plus

52
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,530
3, squared.

53
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,150
And then this part, 5
minus 9, minus 4.

54
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,350
There, we got it into our
format that we needed.

55
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,190
So when does this function
achieve a minimum point?

56
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,620
Well, it achieves a minimum
point when this part is equal

57
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,700
to 0, or when x is
equal to minus 3.

58
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,120
When x is equal to minus
3, this is 0.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,690
So f of x is going to
be equal to minus 4.

60
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,820
So that's the vertex,
and that's choice A.

61
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,400
You could have done
minus b over 2A.

62
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,010
You'd get minus 12 over
2-- no minus 6 over 2,

63
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,620
which is minus 3.

64
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,700
That's something you
could memorize.

65
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,670
But it's better, I think,
to have the intuition.

66
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,650
Problem 40.

67
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:36,630
The graph of x over 2, squared,
minus y over 2,

68
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,020
squared equals 1
is a hyperbola.

69
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,670
That makes sense.

70
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,050
This is y over 3. x over 2,
squared, minus y over 3,

71
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,770
squared is equal to 1.

72
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,530
If this is a plus, we would
have an ellipse.

73
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,250
Fair enough.

74
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,590
Which set of equations
represents the asymptotes of

75
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,140
the hyperbola's graph?

76
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,250
Once again, there's some
equations that people memorize

77
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,310
and formulas people memorize,
but you can actually have an

78
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,670
intuition on this.

79
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,570
So let's think about what
happens as x approaches

80
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,990
positive or negative infinity.

81
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,640
Because that's what we care
about as an asymptote, right?

82
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,290
What does the graph approach
when we get to really, really

83
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,720
large values of x, and
it turns out, really

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,430
large values of y?

85
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,640
So let's just rearrange
this a little bit.

86
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,425
Let's put y on the other side.

87
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,610
   

88
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,470
Let's square this.

89
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,160
So this is x squared over 4.

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,590
Let me keep it actually
in that format.

91
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:36,110
Let's keep that as x over 2,
squared is equal to 1, plus y

92
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,360
over 3, squared.

93
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,700
Let's subtract 1 from
both sides.

94
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,550
So you get x over 2, squared,
minus 1 is equal

95
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,800
to y over 3, squared.

96
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,740
And now, let's multiply both
sides by 3 squared.

97
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,230
Let's multiply both
sides by 9.

98
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,450
Let's do that.

99
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,350
Actually, to simplify this,
let me rewrite this.

100
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,440
I wanted to keep in that form.

101
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,790
That's the same thing as x
squared over 4, minus 1, is

102
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,950
equal to y squared over 9.

103
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,370
Multiply both sides by 9.

104
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,140
I'm going to switch the sides
so we get y here.

105
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,700
So you get y squared is
equal to 9 over 4 x

106
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,600
squared, minus 9.

107
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,850
All right, and that's about as
far as we can get just with

108
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,210
straight up algebra.

109
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,330
When we think about asymptotes,
those are points

110
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,590
that the graphs will never reach
but it'll get close to.

111
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,580
So we have to think about what
happens with x gets really

112
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,020
large and correspondingly
y gets really large.

113
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,350
Well, as x gets really large, so
as x approaches infinity--

114
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,120
and you'll learn this is
precalculus and calculus,

115
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
these are limits, but it's
really a very intuitive

116
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,050
concept-- as x gets really
large, this minus 9 doesn't

117
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,000
matter much.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,150
This term starts
to dominate it.

119
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,600
These terms matter a lot
more than this minus 9.

120
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,580
So as x approaches infinity, y
squared is approximately equal

121
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,730
to 9/4 x squared.

122
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,800
Now we could take the square
root of both sides of this.

123
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,850
So you get y is approximately
equal to plus or minus 3/2 x.

124
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,420
Those are the actual asymptotes,
y equals 3/2 x and

125
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,670
y is equal to minus 3/2 x.

126
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,480
That's actually choice A.

127
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,400
I won't go into the actual
instruction of how you would

128
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,160
think about graphing.

129
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,870
Actually, why not?

130
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,730
Why don't we just do that.

131
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,940
We know what the
asymptotes are.

132
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,730
Let's actually think about
how you would graph this.

133
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,000
So if you were to draw the--
it's all about learning, not

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,100
just about assessing-- that's
the x- and y-axis.

135
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,010
And they tell us their
asymptotes, 3/2 x

136
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,550
and minus 3/2 x.

137
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,350
So 3/2 x, the slope
of 3/2 is 1.5.

138
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,265
So it's a slope that will look
something like-- let me get

139
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:58,220
the line tool out-- so x might
look like, so plus 3/2 x would

140
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,760
look something like that.

141
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,800
Minus 3/2 x would be something
like that.

142
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,520
Now we have to figure out does
this hyperbola go from there

143
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,780
and there, or does it go
from here and here?

144
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:21,950
There were just say, OK, when y
is equal to 0 we get x over

145
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,200
2 is equal to plus or minus 1.

146
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:32,950
   

147
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,325
You actually get x
would be there.

148
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:39,470
   

149
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,970
So you know that this thing
has x-intercepts.

150
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,740
You can set y is equal to 0.

151
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,250
You can't set x is equal to 0.

152
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,410
If you get x is equal to 0, then
you get minus y squared

153
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,300
is equal to something.

154
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,530
You get y squared is equal
to negative 1.

155
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,090
You get some imaginary
solution.

156
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,370
So you know that it
has x-intercepts.

157
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,160
You know that these are
the asymptotes.

158
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,750
So if you want to draw the
graph, it would look

159
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,970
something like that.

160
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,350
I know that's not a great
drawing, but hopefully it

161
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,000
serves the purpose.

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,710
Anyway, the choice was A.

163
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,880
And hopefully you learned a
little bit about asymptotes.

164
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,310
Next problem, 41.

165
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,540
Which of the following
represents a hyperbola?

166
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,940
Let me copy those.

167
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,210
No, which of the following
represents a parabola, they

168
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,460
want to know.

169
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,010
   

170
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,990
That's too small.

171
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,250
I don't think you
can see that.

172
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,600
I'll get a bigger
version of it.

173
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,975
All right, that's the
bigger version.

174
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:33,200
   

175
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,260
There you go.

176
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,870
Which of these represents
a parabola?

177
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,710
Well, we could just
go one by one.

178
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,980
This is a circle.

179
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,230
That's a circle.

180
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,330
   

181
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,230
Then you could graph
if you like.

182
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,790
This is an ellipse, where you
just kind of weight the y's

183
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,840
and the x squareds.

184
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,470
This is an ellipse.

185
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,250
If this was a negative, this
would be a hyperbola, ellipse.

186
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,320
This one is a hyperbola
because you have

187
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,570
this negative here.

188
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,170
   

189
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,780
This one might not look like
a traditional parabola,

190
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,950
but it really is.

191
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,660
Because if I were to divide both
sides of this by 4p, I'd

192
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,070
get x is equal to 1 over
4p times y squared.

193
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,690
So it's a sideways parabola.

194
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,860
It looks something like this.

195
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,440
If that's the x- and y-axis,
the graph will look

196
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,680
something like this.

197
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,210
It's going to be a sideways
parabola.

198
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,040
But it's a parabola
nonetheless.

199
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,395
So the choice is C.

200
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:29,150
   

201
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,020
We have time for at least
one more, problem 42.

202
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,202
They give the following
equation.

203
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,560
Let me paste it here.

204
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,530
   

205
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,960
All right, and they say what
is the standard form of the

206
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,040
equation of the conic
section above?

207
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,530
And essentially they want us
to complete the square with

208
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,590
the x's and the y's so we get
that x minus something

209
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:58,300
squared, over some m plus or
minus y, minus something

210
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,050
squared, over some constant.

211
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,260
So let's do that.

212
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,140
So let's group the x and the y
terms. So you get 4x squared,

213
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,670
minus 16x, plus something.

214
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,460
That's how we're going to
complete the square.

215
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,350
Then you get plus minus
5y squared.

216
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,470
Let me just minus, and I'll
do plus 5y squared.

217
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,630
We have a minus here, so
it becomes plus 30y.

218
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:36,680
And then out here you have
a minus 9 is equal to 0.

219
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,380
Just to simplify it, let's
factor a 4 out of this part.

220
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:49,260
So you get 4 times x squared,
minus 4x, plus something,

221
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,340
minus-- let's factor a 5 out--
5, times y squared, plus 6y,

222
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,550
probably plus something-- and
let's add the 9 to both

223
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,030
sides-- is equal to 9.

224
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,670
All right, so let's
think about it.

225
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,920
If we wanted to complete the
square here, what do we put

226
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,300
here to make this a
perfect square?

227
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,740
If this was a plus 4,
then this would

228
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,120
be x minus 2 squared.

229
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,890
So we're adding a 4 here.

230
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,000
But we're really adding
a 4 times a 4.

231
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,140
We're really adding a 16
if you think about it.

232
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,740
If I were to redistribute
this, I just added 16.

233
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,150
So if I add 16 to one side of
the equation, I have to add 16

234
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,260
to the other side
of the equation.

235
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,970
So I'll add 16 there.

236
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,890
To make this a perfect square,
let's see, 1/2 of 6 is 3, so 3

237
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,490
squared is 9.

238
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,290
But I'm really adding
a 5 times a 9.

239
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,420
I could redistribute the 5.

240
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,470
I really added a 45.

241
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, no, no, no.

242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,610
I added a minus 5 times 9.

243
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,610
I caught myself.

244
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,220
I added a minus 5 times 9.

245
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,210
So I'm really subtracting
45 from that side.

246
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,530
So I have to subtract
45 from that side.

247
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:56,900
And so this simplifies to 4
times x minus 2 squared--

248
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,110
right, that's x minus two
squared-- minus 5 times-- this

249
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:08,440
is y plus 3 squared-- is equal
to-- let's see, 9 plus 16 is

250
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,600
25, 25 minus 45.

251
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,670
Let's see, have I made
a mistake someplace?

252
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,890
25 minus 45, no, that's right.

253
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,000
25 minus 45 is minus 20.

254
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,440
And now we can divide both sides
by minus 20, if I did

255
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,750
this correctly.

256
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,930
We'll divide both sides
by minus 20.

257
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,310
So you get x minus 2 squared.

258
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,920
What's 4 divided by minus 20?

259
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,800
It's minus 1/5.

260
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,840
Let me just do that.

261
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:55,000
So 4 over minus 20, minus 5,
times y plus 3 squared, over

262
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,910
minus 20 is equal to 1.

263
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,410
So this is equal to, let's see
this becomes a positive, and

264
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,060
this one becomes a negative.

265
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,140
So let's put this one first. So
5 over 20 is the same thing

266
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,900
as y plus 3 squared, over
4-- right, that's this

267
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,490
one-- plus, no, sorry.

268
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,190
We have a minus.

269
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,430
Minus-- and this becomes 1/5--
x minus 2 squared, over 5.

270
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,830
That is equal to 1.

271
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,240
We haven't made a careless
mistake.

272
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,100
That is choice B.

273
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,040
See you in the the next video.

274
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,500
