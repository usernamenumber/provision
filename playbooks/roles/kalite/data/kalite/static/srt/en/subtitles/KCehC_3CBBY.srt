1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:05,129
Gina had 2/3 cup of laundry detergent.

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:08,286
She used 1/2 of the detergent on 
Friday to wash all of her sheets.

3
00:00:08,286 --> 00:00:10,866
How much detergent
does she have left?

4
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:13,082
So, we're essentially 
going to take half of 2/3,

5
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:15,721
or 1/2 times 2/3.

6
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:18,007
So, let's see which of 
these choices match up.

7
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:20,401
So we should be taking 1/2 times 2/3.

8
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:23,521
Well, here they are taking 
2/3 minus 1/2,

9
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,251
so this isn't going to be right.

10
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:27,658
Here they're going to be taking--

11
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:30,805
Let's see, 1/3 because 2/3 times 1/2--

12
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:32,473
This is exactly what we want to do.

13
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:34,065
We want to take 1/2 of 2/3.

14
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:36,530
And we multiply the 
numerators: 2 times 1 is 2.

15
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,517
We multiply the denominators:
3 times 2 is 6.

16
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:41,286
You have 2/6--

17
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:43,385
You could say that 2/6 
has either been used up,

18
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:45,265
or 2/6 is left.

19
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:47,769
And 2/6 is the exact same thing 1/3,

20
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,397
divide the numerator 
and the denominator by 2.

21
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:52,404
So this looks right.

22
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:56,374
And so here, 1/6 cup. 
Well we know it's not 1/6 cup.

23
00:00:56,374 --> 00:00:57,873
We know it's 1/3 cup.

24
00:00:57,873 --> 00:01:01,616
So here: 1/3 cup, because 
2/3 is equal to 1/3 pluss 1/3.

25
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:02,689
That's right.

26
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,902
So half of 2/3 must be 1/3.

27
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:06,676
This is exactly right aswell.

28
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:08,818
These are both completely 
reasonable ways to ways to getting

29
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,480
the right answer, 
that Gina has 1/3.

30
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,394
She used a third of a 
cup of laundry detergent,

31
00:01:14,394 --> 00:01:16,487
and she has a third left.
