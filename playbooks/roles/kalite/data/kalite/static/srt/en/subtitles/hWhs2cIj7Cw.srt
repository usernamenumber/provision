1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,520
Everything we've been doing in
linear algebra so far, you

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,930
might be thinking, it's kind of
a more painful way of doing

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,470
things that you already
knew how to do.

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,850
You've already dealt
with vectors.

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,970
I'm guessing that some of you
all have already dealt with

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,220
vectors in your calculus or
your pre-calculus or your

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,260
physics classes.

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,880
But in this video I hope to show
you something that you're

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,340
going to do in linear algebra
that you've never done before,

11
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,170
and that it would have been very
hard to do had you not

12
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,840
been exposed to these videos.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,810
Well I'm going to start with,
once again, a different way of

14
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,970
doing something you already
know how to do.

15
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,190
So let me just define some
vector here, instead of making

16
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,550
them bold, I'll just draw it
with the arrow on top.

17
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,620
I'm going to define my vector
to be-- I can do with the

18
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,920
arrow on top or I can just
make it super bold.

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,660
I'm just going to define my
vectors, it's going to be a

20
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,280
vector in R2.

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,230
Let's just say that my vector
is the vector 2, 1.

22
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,200
If I were to draw it in
standard position,

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,100
it looks like this.

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,665
You go two to the right,
up one, like that.

25
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:04,400
That's my, right there,
that is my vector v.

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,850
Now, if I were to ask you, what
are all of the possible

27
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,970
vectors I can create?

28
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,300
So let me define a set.

29
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,960
Let me define a set, s, and
it's equal to-- all of the

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,460
vectors I can create, if I were
to multiply v times some

31
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,280
constant, so I multiply some
constant, some scalar, times

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,880
my vector v, and just to maybe
be a little bit formal, I'll

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,995
say such that c is a member
of the real numbers.

34
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:40,510
   

35
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,800
Now what would be a graphical
representation of this set?

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,370
Well, if we draw them all in
standard position, c could be

37
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,280
any real number.

38
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,270
So if I were to multiply,
c could be 2.

39
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,390
If c is 2, let me
do it this way.

40
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,460
If I do 2 times our vector,
I'm going to get

41
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,080
the vector 4, 2.

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,550
Let me draw that in standard
position, 4, 2.

43
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,390
It's right there.

44
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,240
It's this vector right there.

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,350
It's collinear with
this first vector.

46
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,640
It's along the same line, but
just goes out further 2.

47
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,540
Now I could've done another.

48
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,660
I could have done 1.5
times our vector v.

49
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,660
Let me do that in a
different color.

50
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,890
And maybe that would be,
that would be what?

51
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,240
That'd be 1.5 times 2,
which is 3, 1.5.

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,630
Where would that
vector get me?

53
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,160
I'd go one 1.5 and then I'd
go 3, and then 1.5,

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,380
I'd get right there.

55
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,680
And I can multiply
by anything.

56
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,390
I can multiply 1.4999
times vector v, and

57
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,750
get right over here.

58
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,220
I could do minus 0.0001
times vector v.

59
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,210
Let me write that down.

60
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:51,550
I could do 0.001 times
our vector v.

61
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,810
And where were that put me?

62
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,680
It would put me little super
small vector right there.

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,430
If I did minus 0.01, it would
make a super small vector

64
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,810
right there pointing
in that direction.

65
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,126
If I were to do minus 10, I
would get a vector going in

66
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:07,000
this direction that goes
way like that.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,760
But you can imagine that if
I were to plot all of the

68
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,800
vectors in standard position,
all of them that could be

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,250
represented by any c in real
numbers, I'll essentially

70
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,550
get-- I'll end up drawing a
bunch of vectors where their

71
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,880
arrows are all lined up along
this line right there, and all

72
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,830
lined up in even in negative
direction-- let me make sure I

73
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,440
draw it properly-- along
that line, like that.

74
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,670
I think you get the idea.

75
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,256
So it's a set of collinear
vectors.

76
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,560
So let me write that down.

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:44,220
   

78
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,850
And if we view these vectors as
position vectors, that this

79
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:56,710
vector represents a point in
space in R2-- this R2 is just

80
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,540
our Cartesian coordinate plane
right here in every

81
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,840
direction-- if we view this
vector as a position vector--

82
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,800
let me write that down-- if
we view it as kind of a

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,495
coordinate in R2, then this set,
if we visually represent

84
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:14,280
it as a bunch of position
vectors, it'll be represented

85
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,900
by this whole line over here.

86
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,899
   

87
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,750
And I want to make that point
clear because it's essentially

88
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,600
a line, of slope 2.

89
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,150
Right?

90
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,410
Sorry, slope 1/2.

91
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,080
Your rise is 1.

92
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,620
Your rise is 1 for
going over 2.

93
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,060
But I don't want to go
back to our Algebra 1

94
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,840
notation too much.

95
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,730
But I want to make this point
that this line of slope 2 that

96
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,780
goes through the origin, this
is if we draw all of the

97
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,110
vectors in the set as in their
standard form, or if we draw

98
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,710
them all as position vectors.

99
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,610
If I didn't make that
clarification, or that

100
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,090
qualification, I could have
drawn these vectors anywhere.

101
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:53,370
Right?

102
00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:00,190
Because this 4, 2 vector, I
could have drawn over here.

103
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,720
And then, to say that it's
collinear probably wouldn't

104
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,510
have made as much visual
sense to you.

105
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,330
But I think this collinearity of
it makes more sense to you

106
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,130
if you say, oh, let's draw them
all in standard form.

107
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,030
All of them start at the origin,
and then their tails

108
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,270
are at the origin, and their
heads go essentially to the

109
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,370
coordinate they represent.

110
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,390
That's what I mean by their
position vectors.

111
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,200
They don't necessarily have to
be position vectors, but for

112
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,830
the visualization in this video,
let's stick to that.

113
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,530
Now I was only able to represent
something that goes

114
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,020
through the origin
with this slope.

115
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,580
So you can almost view that
this vector kind of

116
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,570
represented its slope.

117
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,820
You almost want to view it as a
slope vector, if you wanted

118
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,280
to tie it in to what you
learned in Algebra 1.

119
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,480
What if we wanted to represent
other lines

120
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,190
that had that slope?

121
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:53,470
What if we wanted to represent
the the same line, or I guess

122
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,350
a parallel line-- that goes
through that point over there,

123
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:01,120
the point 2 comma 4?

124
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,250
Or if we're thinking in position
vectors, we could say

125
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:19,105
that point is represented
by the vector, and we

126
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:20,900
will call that x.

127
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,130
It's represented by
the vector x.

128
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,330
And the vector x is
equal to 2, 4.

129
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,040
That point right there.

130
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,600
What if I want to represent the
line that's parallel to

131
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,030
this that goes through
that point 2, 4?

132
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,040
So I want to represent
this line right here.

133
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,465
   

134
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:43,470
I'll draw it as parallel
to this as I can.

135
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,080
I think you get the idea, and it
just keeps going like that

136
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,130
in every direction.

137
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,120
These two lines are parallel.

138
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,280
How can I represent the set of
all of these vectors, drawn in

139
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,620
standard form, or all of the
vectors, that if I were to

140
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,400
draw them in standard form,
would show this line?

141
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,490
Well, you can think
about it this way.

142
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,650
If every one of the vectors that
represented this line, if

143
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,480
I start with any vector that was
on this line, and I add my

144
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:20,070
x vector to it, I'll show up
at a corresponding point on

145
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,250
this line that I
want to be at.

146
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,500
Right?

147
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,130
   

148
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,960
Let's say I do negative 2 times
my original, so minus 2

149
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,160
times my vector v, that
equaled what?

150
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,870
Minus 4, minus 2, so that's
that vector there.

151
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:47,160
But if I were to add x to it, if
I were to add my x vector.

152
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,040
So if I were to do minus 2 times
my vector v, but I were

153
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,670
to add x to it, so plus x.

154
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,360
I'm adding this vector 2 comma
4 to it, so from here I'd go

155
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,860
right 2 and up 4,
so I'd go here.

156
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,130
Or visually you could just
say, heads to tails, so I

157
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,550
would go right there.

158
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,610
So I would end up at a

159
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,990
corresponding point over there.

160
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:13,020
   

161
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,020
So when I define my set, s, as
the set of all points where I

162
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,220
just multiply v times the
scalar, I got this thing that

163
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,650
went through the origin.

164
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,120
But now let me define
another set.

165
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,580
Let me define a set l, maybe l
for line, that's equal to the

166
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:34,669
set of all of vectors where the
vector x, I could do it

167
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,510
bold or I'll just draw an
arrow on it, plus some

168
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,230
scalar-- I could use c, but
let me use t, because I'm

169
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,540
going to call this a
parametrization of the line--

170
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:59,070
so plus some scalar, t times my
vector v such that t could

171
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,380
be any member of the
real numbers.

172
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,310
So what is this going to be?

173
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,120
This is going to be
this blue line.

174
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,820
If I were to draw all of these
vectors in standard position,

175
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,460
I'm going to get my blue line.

176
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,670
For example, if I do minus 2,
this is minus 2, times my

177
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,160
vector v, I get here.

178
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,730
Then if I add x, I go there.

179
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:25,770
So this vector right here that
has its endpoint right there--

180
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,680
its endpoint sits
on that line.

181
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,330
I can do that with anything.

182
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,980
If I take this vector, this is
some scalar times my vector v,

183
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,990
and I add x to it, I end up
with this vector, whose

184
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,700
endpoint, if I view it as a
position vector, it's endpoint

185
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,950
dictates some coordinate
in the xy plane.

186
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,740
So it will [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

187
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,560
that point.

188
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,330
So I can get to any
of these vectors.

189
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,720
This is a set of vectors right
here, and all of these vectors

190
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,430
are going to point-- they're
essentially going to point to

191
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,446
something-- when I draw them
in standard form, if I draw

192
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:59,650
them in standard form-- they're
going to point to a

193
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,110
point on that blue line.

194
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,630
Now you might say, hey Sal, this
was a really obtuse way

195
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,210
of defining a line.

196
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,320
I mean we do it in Algebra 1,
where we just say, hey you

197
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,540
know, y is equal to mx plus b.

198
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,200
And we figure out the slope by
figuring out the difference of

199
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,360
two points, and then we do
a little substitution.

200
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,670
And this is stuff you learned
in seventh or eighth grade.

201
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,270
This was really straightforward.

202
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:27,170
Why am I defining this obtuse
set here and making you think

203
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,170
in terms of sets and vectors
and adding vectors?

204
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,495
And the reason is, is because
this is very general.

205
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:35,570
   

206
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,440
This worked well in R2.

207
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,380
So in R2, this was great.

208
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,860
I mean, we just have to worry
about x's and y's.

209
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,620
But what about the situation, I
mean notice, in your algebra

210
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,470
class, your teacher never really
told you much, at least

211
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,430
in the ones I took, about how do
you present lines in three

212
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,050
dimensions?

213
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,310
Maybe some classes go there,
but they definitely didn't

214
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,635
tell you how do you represent
lines in four dimensions, or a

215
00:10:58,635 --> 00:10:59,720
hundred dimensions.

216
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,690
And that's what this is
going to do for us.

217
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,750
Right here, I defined x and
v as vectors in R2.

218
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,320
They're two-dimensional vectors,
but we can extend it

219
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,950
to an arbitrary number
of dimensions.

220
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,610
So just to kind of hit the point
home, let's do one more

221
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,670
example in R2, where, it's kind
of the classic algebra

222
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,650
problem where you need to find
the equation for the line.

223
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,170
But here, we're going
to call it the set

224
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,090
definition for the line.

225
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,060
Let's say we have two vectors.

226
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:39,410
Let's say we have the vector a,
which I'll define as-- let

227
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,630
me just says it's 2, 1.

228
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,550
So if I were draw it in standard
form, it's 2, 1.

229
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,620
That's my vector
a, right there.

230
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,530
And let's say I have vector
b, let me define vector b.

231
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,890
I'm going to define it as,
I don't know, let me

232
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:05,110
define it as 0, 3.

233
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,563
So my vector b, 0-- I don't
move to the right at

234
00:12:07,563 --> 00:12:08,300
all and I go up.

235
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,575
So my vector b will
look like that.

236
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:14,760
Now I'm going to say that these
are position vectors,

237
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,930
that we draw them in
standard form.

238
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,670
When you draw them in standard
form, their endpoints

239
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,030
represent some position.

240
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,150
So you can almost view these
as coordinate points in R2.

241
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,880
This is R2.

242
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,950
All of these coordinate axes
I draw are going be R2.

243
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,270
Now what if I asked you, give
me a parametrization of the

244
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,710
line that goes through
these two points.

245
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,380
So essentially, I want the
equation-- if you're thinking

246
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,180
in Algebra 1 terms-- I want the
equation for the line that

247
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,565
goes through these two points.

248
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:48,660
   

249
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,910
So the classic way, you would
have figured out the slope and

250
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,830
all of that, and then
you would have

251
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,360
substituted back in.

252
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,300
But instead, what we can do is,
we can say, hey look, this

253
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,760
line that goes through both of
those points-- you could

254
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,080
almost say that both of those
vectors lie on-- I guess

255
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,320
that's a better-- Both of these

256
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,220
vectors lie on this line.

257
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,430
Now, what vector can be
represented by that line?

258
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,630
Or even better, what vector,
if I take any arbitrary

259
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:24,040
scalar-- can represent any other
vector on that line?

260
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,950
Now let me do it this way.

261
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,280
What if I were to take-- so this
is vector b here-- what

262
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,520
if I were to take b minus a?

263
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,880
We learned in, I think it was
the previous video, that b

264
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,800
minus a, you'll get this
vector right here.

265
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,620
You'll get the difference
in the two vectors.

266
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,340
This is the vector b
minus the vector a.

267
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,400
And you just think about it.

268
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,500
What do I have to add
to a to get to b?

269
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,860
I have to add b minus a.

270
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,460
So if I can get the vector b
minus a-- right, we know how

271
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:52,940
to do that.

272
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,210
We just subtract the vectors,
and then multiply it by any

273
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:01,380
scalar, then we're going to get
any point along that line.

274
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,490
We have to be careful.

275
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:07,220
So what happens if we take t,
so some scalar, times our

276
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,570
vector, times the vectors
b minus a?

277
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,430
   

278
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,740
What will we get then?

279
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,120
So b minus a looks like that.

280
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,610
But if we were to draw it in
standard form-- remember, in

281
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,240
standard form b minus a would
look something like this.

282
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,330
   

283
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:26,500
Right?

284
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,340
It would start at 0, it would be
parallel to this, and then

285
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,060
from 0 we would draw
its endpoint.

286
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,830
So if we just multiplied some
scalar times b minus a, we

287
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,600
would actually just get
points or vectors

288
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,320
that lie on this line.

289
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,520
Vectors that lie on that
line right there.

290
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,250
Now, that's not what
we set out to do.

291
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,300
We wanted to figure out an
equation, or parametrization,

292
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,360
if you will, of this
line, or this set.

293
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,810
Let's call this set l.

294
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,780
So we want to know what
that set is equal to.

295
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:03,020
So in order to get there, we
have to start with this, which

296
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,630
is this line here, and
we have to shift it.

297
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,370
And we could shift it either by
shifting it straight up, we

298
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,960
could add vector b to it.

299
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,550
So we could take this
line right here, and

300
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,150
add vector b to it.

301
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,520
And so any point on here
would have its

302
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,640
corresponding point there.

303
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,950
So when you add vector b, it
essentially shifts it up.

304
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,660
That would work.

305
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,720
So we could, say, we could
add vector b to it.

306
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,100
And now all of these points
for any arbitrary-- t is a

307
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,050
member of the real numbers, will
lie on this green line.

308
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,430
Or the other option we could
have done is we could have

309
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,250
added vector a.

310
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,230
Vector a would have taken any
arbitrary point here and

311
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,380
shifted it that way.

312
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:43,600
Right?

313
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,160
You would be adding
vector a to it.

314
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,360
But either way, you're going to
get to the green line that

315
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,100
we cared about, so you could
have also defined it as the

316
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,390
set of vector a plus this line,
essentially, t times

317
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:01,860
vector b minus a, where t is
a member of the reals.

318
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,290
So my definition of
my line could be

319
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,130
either of these things.

320
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:11,510
The definition of my line could
be this set, or it could

321
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,850
be this set.

322
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,240
And all of this seems all very
abstract, but when you

323
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,940
actually deal with the numbers,
it actually becomes

324
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,670
very simple.

325
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:22,230
It becomes arguably simpler than
what we did in Algebra 1.

326
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,210
So this l, for these particular
case of a and b,

327
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,480
let's figure it out.

328
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,680
My line is equal to-- let me
just use the first example.

329
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:37,740
It's vector b, so it's the
vector 0, 3 plus t, times the

330
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,940
vector b minus a.

331
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,260
Well what's b minus a?

332
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:51,670
0 minus 2 is minus 2, 3, minus
1 is 2, for t is a

333
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,090
member of the reals.

334
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,110
Now, if this still seems kind
of like a convoluted set

335
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,530
definition for you, I could
write it in terms that you

336
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,190
might recognize better.

337
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,290
If we want to plot points, if
we call this the y-axis, and

338
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,949
we call this the x-axis,
and if we call this the

339
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,339
x-coordinate, or maybe more
properly that the x-coordinate

340
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:17,109
and call this the y-coordinate,
then we can set

341
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:17,940
up an equation here.

342
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,199
This actually is the x-slope.

343
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,960
   

344
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,369
This is the x-coordinate,
that's the y-coordinate.

345
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:27,510
Or actually, even better,
whatever-- actually, let me be

346
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,620
very careful there.

347
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:36,090
This is always going to end up
becoming some vector, l1, l2.

348
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,490
Right?

349
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,790
This is a set of vectors, and
any member of this set is

350
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,950
going to look something
like this.

351
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,900
So this could be li.

352
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,910
So, this is the x-coordinate,
and this is the y-coordinate.

353
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,710
   

354
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,900
And just to get this in a form
that you recognize, so we're

355
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,330
saying that l is the set of
this vector x plus t times

356
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,110
this vector b minus a here.

357
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,200
If we wanted to write it in kind
of a parametric form, we

358
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,070
can say, since this is what
determines our x-coordinate,

359
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:18,420
we would say that x is equal to
0 plus t times minus 2, or

360
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,120
minus 2 times t.

361
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,090
And then we can say that y,
since this is what determines

362
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:34,800
our y-coordinate, y is equal to
3 plus t times 2 plus 2t.

363
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,630
So we could have rewritten that
first equation as just x

364
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:43,790
is equal to minus 2t, and
y is equal to 2t plus 3.

365
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,570
So if you watch the videos on
parametric equations, this is

366
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,390
just a traditional parametric
definition of

367
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,020
this line right there.

368
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,860
Now, you might have still viewed
this as, Sal, this was

369
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,580
a waste of time, this
was convoluted.

370
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,100
You have to define these
sets and all that.

371
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,020
But now I'm going to show you
something that you probably--

372
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,490
well, unless you have done
this before, but I guess

373
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,320
that's true of anything.

374
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,680
But you probably haven't
seen in your

375
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,260
traditional algebra class.

376
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,420
Let's say I have two points, and
now I'm going to deal in

377
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,910
three dimensions.

378
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,520
So let's say I have
one vector.

379
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,025
I'll just call it point
1, because these

380
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,080
are position vectors.

381
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,530
We'll just call it position 1.

382
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,350
This is in three dimensions.

383
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,090
Just make up some numbers,
negative 1, 2, 7.

384
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,850
Let's say I have Point 2.

385
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,540
Once again, this is in three
dimensions, so you have to

386
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,050
specify three coordinates.

387
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,530
This could be the x, the y,
and the z coordinate.

388
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,420
Point 2, I don't know.

389
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,580
Let's make it 0, 3, and 4.

390
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,120
Now, what if I wanted to find
the equation of the line that

391
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,670
passes through these
two points in R3?

392
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,920
So this is in R3.

393
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,410
   

394
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,020
Well, I just said that the
equation of this line-- so

395
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,540
I'll just call that, or the set
of this line, let me just

396
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,510
call this l.

397
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,660
It's going to be equal to-- we
could just pick one of these

398
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,720
guys, it could be P1, the
vector P1, these are all

399
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,370
vectors, be careful here.

400
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,310
The vector P1 plus some random
parameter, t, this t could be

401
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,870
time, like you learn when you
first learn parametric

402
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,750
equations, times the difference
of the two vectors,

403
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,860
times P1, and it doesn't matter
what order you take it.

404
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,870
So that's a nice thing too.

405
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,860
P1 minus P2.

406
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,450
It could be P2 minus P1--
because this can take on any

407
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,580
positive or negative value--
where t is a member of the

408
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,120
real numbers.

409
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,690
So let's apply it to
these numbers.

410
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,780
Let's apply it right here.

411
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,530
What is P1 minus P2?

412
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:54,860
P1 minus P2 is equal to-- let
me get some space here.

413
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,650
P1 minus P2 is equal, minus
1 minus 0 is minus 1.

414
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,740
2 minus 3 is minus 1.

415
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,540
7 minus 4 is 3.

416
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,140
So that thing is that vector.

417
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,450
And so, our line can be
described as a set of vectors,

418
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,280
that if you were to plot it in
standard position, it would be

419
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,440
this set of position vectors.

420
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,700
It would be P1, it would be--
let me do that in green-- it

421
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,520
would be minus 1, 2, 7.

422
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:39,010
I could've put P2 there, just as
easily-- plus t times minus

423
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:45,360
1, minus 1, 3, where, or such
that, t is a member of the

424
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,690
real numbers.

425
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,770
Now, this also might not
be satisfying for you.

426
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,650
You're like, gee, how do I plot
this in three dimensions?

427
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,860
Where's my x, y's, and z's?

428
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,850
And if you want to care about
x, y's, and z's, let's say

429
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:05,860
that this is the z-axis.

430
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,360
This is the x-axis, and
let's say the y-axis.

431
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,050
It kind of goes into our board
like this, so the y-axis comes

432
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,300
out like that.

433
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,530
   

434
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,750
So what you can do, and actually
I probably won't

435
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,540
graph, so the determinate for
the x-coordinate, just our

436
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,030
convention, is going to be
this term right here.

437
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,520
So we can write that x--
let me write that down.

438
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,190
So that term is going to
determine our x-coordinate.

439
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:36,420
So we can write that x is equal
to minus 1-- be careful

440
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,840
with the colors-- minus 1,
plus minus 1 times t.

441
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,000
   

442
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,600
That's our x-coordinate.

443
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,800
Now, our y-coordinate is going
to be determined by this part

444
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,280
of our vector addition because
these are the y-coordinates.

445
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,000
So we can say the y-coordinate
is equal to-- I'll just write

446
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,800
it like this-- 2 plus
minus 1 times t.

447
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,690
And then finally, our
z-coordinate is determined by

448
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,290
that there, the t shows up
because t times 3-- or I could

449
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,940
just put this t into
all of this.

450
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,115
So that the z-coordinate is
equal to 7 plus t times 3, or

451
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:22,680
I could say plus 3t.

452
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,640
And just like that, we have
three parametric equations.

453
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,110
And when we did it in R2, I did
a parametric equation, but

454
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,550
we learned in Algebra 1,
you can just have a

455
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,870
regular y in terms x.

456
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,830
You don't have to have a
parametric equation.

457
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,420
But when you're dealing in R3,
the only way to define a line

458
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,810
is to have a parametric
equation.

459
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,380
If you have just an equation
with x's, y's, and z's, if I

460
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,580
just have x plus y plus z is
equal to some number, this is

461
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,210
not a line.

462
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,110
And we'll talk more
about this in R3.

463
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,360
This is a plane.

464
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,590
   

465
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,910
The only way to define a line
or a curve in three

466
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:01,020
dimensions, if I wanted to
describe the path of a fly in

467
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,950
three dimensions, it has to
be a parametric equation.

468
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,890
Or if I shoot a bullet in three
dimensions and it goes

469
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,850
in a straight line, it has to
be a parametric equation.

470
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,650
So these-- I guess you could
call it-- these are the

471
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,600
equations of a line in
three dimensions.

472
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,050
So hopefully you found
that interesting.

473
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,340
And I think this will be the
first video where you have an

474
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,450
appreciation that linear algebra
can solve problems or

475
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,480
address issues that you
never saw before.

476
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,930
And there's no reason why we
have to just stop at three,

477
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,410
three coordinates, right here.

478
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,410
We could have done this
with fifty dimensions.

479
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,200
We could have defined a line in
fifty dimensions-- or the

480
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,450
set of vectors that define a
line, that two points sit on,

481
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,060
in fifty dimensions-- which is
very hard to visualize, but we

482
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,340
can actually deal with
it mathematically.

483
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:45,945
