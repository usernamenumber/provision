00:00:00,662 --> 00:00:03,046
In this video I now want to cover

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:06,512
one of the other most misunderstood ideas

3
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:08,879
when people think about taxes.

4
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:12,073
and that's the idea of deductions.

5
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:15,245
So one of the most common tax deductions is

6
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:18,406
the deduction you get on interest on your mortgage.

7
00:00:18,406 --> 00:00:20,638
So let's say that this year on my mortgage,

8
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:24,028
of the part of my mortgage that is interest.

9
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:36,113
Let's say it's $10,000 interest on my mortgage.

10
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:38,990
And you'll either already know,

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,056
or someone might tell you,

12
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:42,439
that this is tax deductable!

13
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,652
And the misconception

14
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:46,514
that I've seen many, many times is that

15
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:49,715
people think that since this is a tax deduction

16
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:54,299
that this $10,000 should be deducted from their taxes.

17
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,048
So in the previous example we showed this scenario

18
00:00:57,048 --> 00:00:59,032
where this person making $100,000

19
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:02,449
would have to pay $21,720 in taxes.

20
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:04,395
And based on that misconception they would say

21
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:07,821
"Ok I get a $10,000 tax deduction now

22
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:10,534
I would pay $11,720."

23
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:12,661
And that is wrong!

24
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:16,029
The deduction doesn't happen from the taxes you pay.

25
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:20,267
The deduction happens from your stated income.

26
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:24,396
So if this person right here had a $10,000 tax deduction,

27
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:28,664
instead of saying they made $100,000 that year

28
00:01:28,664 --> 00:01:35,682
they would say that they made $90,000.

29
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:36,813
So once again,

30
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,683
the deduction does not come directly from the taxes.

31
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,017
That would be a tax credit.

32
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:46,715
The deduction comes from the reported income.

33
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:49,267
So what would be the actual effect on the taxes?

34
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:52,430
Well we just have to look at this $90,000

35
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,241
that still kind of shows up in the top bracket.

36
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,921
So the real difference

37
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:59,726
is just going to be this $10,000 difference

38
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:04,400
before he was paying 28% on this $10,000.

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,234
Now he won't have to pay 28%

40
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:08,294
on that incremental $10,000,

41
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,513
on this incremental $10,000.

42
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:12,281
Another way to think about it,

43
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:17,270
instead of this being $17,750 times 28%,

44
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,854
it would now be $7,750,

45
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:24,933
because the reported income is now only $90,000.

46
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:26,418
So the actual number,

47
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:29,235
we can get our calulator out and just calculate it.

48
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:30,468
There's two ways you could do it.

49
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:36,133
You could just say if my income is deducted by $10,000

50
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,273
and I'm going to save 28% on that $10,000.

51
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,870
You can just subtract $2,800 from this.

52
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,611
But just to show you how it'll all work,

53
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:44,027
that it all works out to the same thing.

54
00:02:44,027 --> 00:02:46,200
Let's just go through the same calculation again.

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,579
We have $7,750 times 0.28

56
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:57,298
plus $48,300 times 0.25

57
00:02:57,298 --> 00:03:05,088
plus $25,600 times 0.15 plus $835

58
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,438
and that's $18,920.

59
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:13,651
So now the taxes will be $18,920.

60
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,984
And as you can see

61
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:18,667
the difference between the old and the new is exactly $2,800

62
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,621
because that's essentially what the amount

63
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:23,772
that we would be taxed on the $10,000

64
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:26,992
if we had made that much money.

65
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:30,000
Anyway hopefully that doesn't confuse you too much.
