1
00:00:00,505 --> 00:00:05,072
We are asked to graph y is equal to log base 5 of x

2
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:07,237
and just to remind us what this is saying,

3
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:13,171
this is saying that y is equal to the power that I have to raise 5 to, to get to x.

4
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:17,036
Or if i would write this logarithmic equation as an exponential equation

5
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:18,772
5 is my base

6
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:23,323
y is the exponent that i have to raise my base to,

7
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:27,990
and then x is what i get when I raise 5 to the yth power.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,769
So anther way of writing this equation would be

9
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:40,437
5 to the yth power is going to be equal to x.

10
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:42,571
These are the same thing.

11
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:48,323
Here we have y as a function of x, here we have x as a function of y.

12
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:50,838
But they're really saying the exact same thing:

13
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:53,504
"Raise 5 to the yth power to get x".

14
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,490
But when you put this as a logarithm, you are saying:

15
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,771
"To what power do I have to raise 5 to, to get x?

16
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:58,970
Well, I have to raise it to y."

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,437
Here, what do I get when I raise 5 to the yth power? 
I get x.

18
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:04,704
Now that that is out of the way,

19
00:01:04,704 --> 00:01:07,105
let's make ourselves a little table

20
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:08,705
that we can use to plot some points,

21
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:11,171
and we can connect the dots to see what this curve looks like.

22
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,571
So let me pick some Xs and some Ys.

23
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:20,238
And in general we want to pick some numbers

24
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:22,657
that give us some nice, round answers.

25
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:25,571
Some nice, fairly simple numbers for us to deal with

26
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:27,172
so we don't have to get a calculator.

27
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:30,103
And so in general, you want to pick x values,

28
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:35,105
you want to pick x values where the power that you have to raise 5 to to get that x value

29
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:37,906
is a pretty straightforward power.

30
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:41,038
Or another way to think about it is, you could just think about the different y values

31
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:44,323
that you want to raise 5 to the power of

32
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:45,989
and then you can get you x values.

33
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:51,838
So we could actually think about this one to come up with our actual x values.

34
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:55,738
But we want to be clear that when we express it like this,

35
00:01:55,738 --> 00:02:00,072
the independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y.

36
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:09,102
We might just look at this one to pick some nice x's that give us nice, clean answers for y.

37
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:12,504
So what happens, here I'm actually going to fill out the y first

38
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:14,570
Just so that we get nice, clean x's.

39
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,702
So let's say that we are going to raise 5 to the --I'm going to pick some new colours--

40
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:25,906
to the negative 2 power, -- and let me do some other colours --

41
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:33,102
negative 1, zero, 1, and I'll do one more, and then 2.

42
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:36,638
So once again, this is a little nontraditional

43
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:38,503
where I'm filling in the dependent variable first,

44
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,703
but the way that we have written it over here, ......

45
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:46,407
it's easy to to find out what the independent variable must be for this logarithmic function.

46
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:50,073
So, what x gives me the y of negative 2?

47
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:54,989
What does x have to be for y to be equal to -2?

48
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,040
Well, 5 to the negative 2 power is going to be equal to x,

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:06,657
so 5 to the negative 2, is 1 over 25, so we get 1/25.

50
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:08,740
So another way, if we go back to this earlier one,

51
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,906
if we say log, base 5, of 1/25.

52
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:16,171
What power do I have to raise 5 to to get 1/25?

53
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,991
Well, I have to raise it to the negative 2 power.

54
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:23,408
Or you could say 5 to the negative 2 is equal to 1/25.

55
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:26,990
These are saying the exact same thing.

56
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,570
Now, let's do another one.

57
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,371
What happens when I raise 5 to the negative 1 power?

58
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:36,823
Well, I get one fifth. For this original one over there,

59
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:43,638
we are just saying that log base 5 of 1/5, you want to be careful

60
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:47,906
this is saying: "what power do I have to raise 5 to, in order to get 1/5?"

61
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:50,837
Well, I have to raise it to the negative 1 power.

62
00:03:50,837 --> 00:03:55,504
Here, what happens when I take 5 tot the 0 power? I get 1.

63
00:03:55,504 --> 00:04:02,406
And so this relationship is saying the same thing as log, base 5, of 1,

64
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:05,171
what power do I have to raise 5 to to get 1?

65
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:08,572
Wel, I've just got to raise it to the 0 power.

66
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:13,437
Let's... what happens when I raise 5 tot the first power?

67
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:14,969
Well, I get 5.

68
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:20,104
So if you go over here, that is just saying, what power do I have to raise 5 to to get 5?

69
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:23,171
Well, I have to just raise it to the 1st power.

70
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:27,656
And then finally, if I take 5 squared, I get 25.

71
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:31,837
So if you look at it from the logarithm point of view, you say

72
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:35,489
what power do I have to raise 5 to to get to 25?

73
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:38,239
Well, I have to raise it to the second power.

74
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:43,238
So, I kind of took the inverse of the logarithmic function. I wrote it as an exponential function.

75
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:45,771
I switched the dependent and independent variables.

76
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:51,406
So I could pick, or derive, nice clean x's that would give me nice, clean y's.

77
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:53,072
Now, with that out of the way, but I do want you to remind,

78
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:57,573
I could have just picked random numbers over here,

79
00:04:57,573 --> 00:05:01,322
but then I probably would have gotten less clean numbers over here, so I would have had to use a calculator.

80
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:05,572
The only reason why I did it this way, is so I get nice clean results that I can plot by hand

81
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,302
So let's actually graph it.

82
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:13,103
So the y's go between -2 and 2,

83
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:18,038
the x's go from 1/25 all the way to 25

84
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:20,823
So let's graph it.

85
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:29,837
So that is my y-axis, and this is my x-axis.

86
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:35,073
So I'll drw it like that, that is my x-axis and then the y's

87
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:41,656
start at zero and then you get to positive 1, positive 2,

88
00:05:41,656 --> 00:05:49,438
and then you have -1, -2 and then on the x-axis it is all positive

89
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:54,770
and I'll let you think about whether the domain here is, well we can think about it,

90
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:02,504
Is a logarithmic function defined for an x that is not positive?

91
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:07,503
Is there any power that I could raise 5 to so that I would get 0?

92
00:06:07,503 --> 00:06:12,906
No. You could raise 5 to an infinitely negative power to get a very very small number

93
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,073
that approaches 0, but you can never get-

94
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:18,102
there is no power that you can raise 5 to to get 0.

95
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:21,504
So x cannot be 0. There is no power that you can raise 5 to

96
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:25,704
to get a negative number. So x can also not be a negative number.

97
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:27,740
So the domain of the function right over here-

98
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,237
and this is relevant becausewe want to think about what we are graphing -

99
00:06:30,237 --> 00:06:33,238
The domain here is x has to be greater than 0.

100
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:35,771
Let me write that down.

101
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,837
The domain here is that x has to be greater than 0.

102
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:44,989
So we are only going to be able to graph this function in the positive x-axis.

103
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,836
So with that out of the way, x gets as large as 25,

104
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:55,705
so let me put those points here, so that's 5, 10, 15, 20

105
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:57,770
and 25.

106
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,990
And then let's plot these.

107
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,656
... and is blue and x is 1.25 and y is -2.

108
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:06,490
When x is 1/25, is it going to be really close to there, then y is negative 2.

109
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,770
So that's going to be right over there.

110
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:17,437
Not quite at the y-axis, 1/25 .. of the y-axis, but pretty close.

111
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:22,824
So that right over there is 1/25 comma -2 right over there.

112
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:26,906
Then when x is 1/5, which is slihtly further to the right,

113
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,907
1/5 with y = -2. So right over there.

114
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:36,838
This is 1/5, -1. And then when x is 1, y is 0.

115
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:46,236
So 1 might be there, so this is the point (1,0).

116
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:50,504
And then when x is 5, y is 1.

117
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:56,572
I;ve covered it over here, y is 1.

118
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:59,171
So that's the point (5,1).

119
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:01,837
And then finally when xis 25, y is 2.

120
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:12,969
So this is (25,2). And then I can graph the function.

121
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:16,907
And I'll do it in the colour pink.

122
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:24,823
So as x get's super super super small, y goes to negative infinity.

123
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:36,704
So what power hve you have to rais e5 to to get point .0001

124
00:08:36,704 --> 00:08:38,657
That has to be a very negative power.

125
00:08:38,657 --> 00:08:42,906
So we get very negative as we approach 0,

126
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:46,438
and then it kind of moves up like that.

127
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:51,239
And then starts to curve to the right like that.

128
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:58,906
And this thing right over here is going to keep going down at an ever steeper rate

129
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:04,503
and it's never going to quite touch the y-axis.

130
00:09:04,503 --> 99:59:59,999
It is going to get closer and closer to the y-axis but it is never going to quite touch it.
