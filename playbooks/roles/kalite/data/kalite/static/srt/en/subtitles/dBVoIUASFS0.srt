1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:05,191
(Vi) Hey Two. (Two) Uh, uh, hey there Vi! Whats up with you?

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:11,449
(Vi) Oh, nothing. Just wanted to talk, I guess. (Two) Ow!, Ooo!

3
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:15,980
(Vi) Sorry Two, but you know, you look good this way, so,

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,586
symmetric and, fundamental. (Two)Oh, I guess. I just feel a little bit off when

5
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:26,228
I'm like this. (Vi) Oh nonsense. You know Two one of the things I like about you is that your just as twoish

6
00:00:26,228 --> 00:00:31,450
no matter how you look. I mean your dependable; I like that in a person.

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:41,994
No matter what I do,you'll always be my Two. (Two) So, uh, Vi, is something bothering you?

8
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:48,465
(Vi) I don't know Two, life has been pretty crazy. It's just nice to have some constants in my life.

9
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:55,578
(Two) Well, you know, I'm always here for ya. (Vi) I know Two. So um, how have you been lately?

10
00:00:55,578 --> 00:01:01,380
(Two) Well, same as ever really. (Vi) Uh, figures. Good old Two, your always just being yourself

11
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,828
you know, I don't have to worry I'm going to come home some day and your going to have changed

12
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:11,408
your values. Its not like some day I'll slit you into two halves and find your not 1 + 1, your always 1 + 1.

13
00:01:11,408 --> 00:01:15,504
I like that about you. Its like, I don't know, your something that makes sense in this crazy

14
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:20,470
world. (Two) Umm, well. (Vi) You ever feel, kinda different from other numbers?

15
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:26,127
I mean your prime, but your even, your the first really numbery number, I mean, one is barely a number

16
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:32,722
its just like one. (Two) But all numbers are different, well Vi? (Vi) I guess, yeah, but don't you ever feel like

17
00:01:32,722 --> 00:01:37,914
lonely or something? I guess that doesn't make sense, you're a number. (Two) Vi, are your sure

18
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:43,952
there's not something bothering you? (Vi) Uh, I guess I feel a little out of control lately, I've been traveling

19
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:49,929
and working, and I'm almost two years behind on emails. (Two) Two years you say? Is, is that a long

20
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:56,487
time? (Vi) Oh, for an email reply, yeah two years is huge! (Two)Well that makes me feel good doesn't it!

21
00:01:56,487 --> 00:02:02,805
(Vi) Well, I mean two years isn't long in terms of... Uh, never mind. That's another thing I like about you,

22
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:07,817
your so patient, I never to feel rushed with you, its nice to have something solid in my life. Something I

23
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:15,160
feel in control of. (Two) Well, thanks, uh, I guess. (Vi) And I've so busy lately, trying to way too many things

24
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,858
at once, and I'm involved in all these projects... (Two) Now, come on Vi. It can't be that bad... (Vi) And

25
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:26,044
there's all this responsibility, and everyone is trying to use me for their own purposes. (Two) Well, you know I - ouch. I can't say I have a

26
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:32,948
whole lot of sympathy, I mean, I'm pretty busy too you know. I get used quite a bit. (Vi) Yeah, in

27
00:02:32,948 --> 00:02:39,540
preschoolers homework and the titles of bad movie sequels. (Two) Uh, how have you known, I'm in a

28
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:47,476
great many famous books. And, and diagrams... I'm in a lot of really good diagrams and graphs. And I'm

29
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:52,447
quite popular with young adults these days. You know I have a pretty good gig with this whole text

30
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:57,790
messaging thing. Its hard work keeping up with all that. (Vi) Yeah, I know, but, Two, your a number and

31
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:06,676
can only be in one place at a time. (Two) Well, maybe I'm tired of it too. Maybe tomorrow some kid

32
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:10,219
will be, trying to add one plus one and I'll just, refuse to show up! (Vi) But you are one plus one, and you

33
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:15,769
can't just not show up your already there. (Two) Yeah, and maybe you should think of that next time before

34
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:19,747
you start whining. I mean it isn't that hard. You just do what you have to do. Show up where you have to

35
00:03:19,747 --> 00:03:26,708
show up. There's no point in stressing over it. (Vi) You know Two, that actually isn't bad advice. You're

36
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:32,601
right. I should just do stuff and set go without imagining all of it stacked into a precarious pile

37
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:39,127
looming over my near future. Might as well live in the present. After all, I can't not show up, I'm already

38
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:46,625
here. (Two) Well, not really. (Vi) I'm glad we had this chance to just sit and chat like this. You're a good

39
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:50,386
number. (Two) That's very kind of you to say. (Vi) I'm going to seize the present moment and go do some

40
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:54,536
important Vi stuff. I'll see you later Two. (Two) Well, uh, hang on, there's just a few other... Hey, where

41
00:03:54,536 --> 00:04:01,185
are you going? There's a lot of cool stuff you don't know about me yet! Are you listening? Hello?

42
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:05,185
Anybody there? Well, well, I just think go hang out with Pi then.
