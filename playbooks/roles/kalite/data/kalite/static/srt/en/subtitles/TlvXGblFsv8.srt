00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:09,764
We are in Prado in Madrid and we are looking at large canvas by Francisco Goya.

2
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:11,704
It is the Family of Charles IV.

3
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:14,734
Here is a direct reference to Velázquez's Las Meninas.

4
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:16,962
We can see the artist is actually self-portrait

5
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:19,348
a bit more in shadow than Velázquez painted themself

6
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:22,181
behind a large canvas pretty much at the same angel

7
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:24,077
as one founded in Las Meninas

8
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:26,645
and of course the royal family array before us

9
00:00:26,645 --> 00:00:33,913
although in this case the king and queen are here not as a reflection in a mirror but directly before us.

10
00:00:33,913 --> 00:00:38,806
I think what distract us today as an unflattering I think we are much more used to real portraits

11
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:41,081
that have a kind of idealism to it

12
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:43,130
and here we have a range of that

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:47,601
Some of the figures look more ideal and their poses and their faces and others

14
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:54,003
but there is certainly a way that the quene herself looks very much I think the way she really looked

15
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:56,252
and even the king to some extent

16
00:00:56,252 --> 00:00:59,328
as supposed to more idealize, more useful figure.

17
00:00:59,328 --> 00:01:02,629
And I think that Goya is doing something quite extraordinary

18
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,047
by instead pushing those boundaries and the royal family is allowing him to

19
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:14,042
but well, there is a kind of particularity to the faces and a kind of psychological depth to each of the faces

20
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:17,829
and striking beauty in terms of representation the children.

21
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:23,391
The costume cross the free of bodies is spectacular.

22
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:26,989
The sense of ornamental, the sense of military medals

23
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:30,169
of the gold and the silver sort of glittering in the light.

24
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:36,369
You can catch the glistening jewelery if your eye just wonders cross the canvas.

25
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:39,207
And Goya has ranged that just brilliantly.

26
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:42,199
Yeah, very very loosely in very inversely way

27
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,578
that is also very reminiscent to Velázquez.

28
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,289
Now, it is interesting that the royal family is looking in the sense back to Velázquez in this portrait

29
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,786
who is in this time quite different.

30
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:53,786
This is Charles IV not Filip IV.

31
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:57,249
Spain is in a kind of crisis at this moment.

32
00:01:57,249 --> 00:02:00,000
And you know the French revolution has taken place.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,562
The royal family is cross wondering whether or not they are going to able to maintain order, maintain their rule.

34
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:07,982
And in fact this family will not be able to.

35
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:09,157
No, not at all.

36
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:16,627
Fernando who is seen on the left in the blue is actually collude with Nepolian and Nepolian invasion of Spain

37
00:02:16,627 --> 00:02:20,324
and Nepolian opposite brother on the throne of Spain very soon.

38
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:26,050
So this is a royal family that does not have much longer to live in this way

39
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,149
and it is hard not to read the enlightenment in a different way

40
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:33,817
that in the modern world we look upon royal families.

41
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:38,050
We do not see them as the having that kind of divine right

42
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:44,709
and a kind of royal lineage and blood line that makes them different from us

43
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,603
in the way they look very human and many of them do

44
00:02:47,603 --> 00:02:51,170
and it is hard not to see that enlightenment thinking in Goya's mind

45
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,301
We know in fact that he was sympathetic with enlightenment and critical with monarchy.

46
00:02:55,301 --> 00:03:01,368
There is certainly a kind of informality that almost feels a bit like disarray in a composition of the figures

47
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:05,115
different from informality that one finds in Velázquez

48
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:10,165
but again I think it is interesting that Goya and the royal family are both looking back to that period of stability

49
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:13,306
and in the sense we try to capture that and a moment

50
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:18,008
when everybody I think is congruous that Spain is threshold of a moment

51
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:20,553
when there may be a significant change.
