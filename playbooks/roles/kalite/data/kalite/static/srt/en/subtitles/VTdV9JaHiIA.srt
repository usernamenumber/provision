1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,200
As we get into the second half of the 1930s,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,129
we see an increasingly aggressive Nazi Germany.

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:10,694
In 1935, they publicly announce

4
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:14,233
their intent to rearm their military.

5
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:17,350
The reason why this is significant is not that they were

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,130
all of a sudden building their military.

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,740
They, in fact, were doing this as soon as

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,761
they had taken power, in 1933.

9
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:25,170
But now, they felt confident enough

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,901
to publicly state their intention --

11
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,725
which is another way of publicly stating

12
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:32,300
that they [could n't] care less about the Treaty of Versailles,

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,210
which had said that Germany was limited to

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,800
a 100,000-soldier military.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,089
Then, we get into 1936.

16
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:42,829
1936, you might remember --

17
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,640
another term of the Treaty of Versailles was that

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,949
Germany was not allowed to occupy the Rhineland --

19
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:51,230
this area in yellow right over here.

20
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,620
And then that was actually reaffirmed in 1925

21
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,418
by the Treaties of Locarno, where Germany, itself,

22
00:00:57,418 --> 00:01:00,260
agreed to not occupy the Rhineland.

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,720
But by 1936, Hitler decides to ignore all of those,

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,900
and occupies the Rhineland.

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,450
But once again the allies --

26
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,750
The French are not so happy about this.

27
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,030
The UK, in particular, once again,

28
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,019
[was] not super happy about this.

29
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,840
But they decided this is not reason

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,369
to potentially start another war over.

31
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,780
So they really don't push back on Germany.

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,918
Then, we get into 1938,

33
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:33,831
and German aggression really goes into full gear.

34
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:41,300
In March of 1938, you have a coup d'Ã©tat,

35
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,240
orchestrated by the Nazis in Austria,

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,170
that really overthrows the Austrian government

37
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,710
and allows the Germans to unify the two countries.

38
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,170
So, you have the Germans come into Austria --

39
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,950
really a bloodless takeover.

40
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,159
And there was already popular support

41
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,755
for the Nazis in Austria.

42
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:07,101
There was a Nazi party in Austria.

43
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:08,965
There had been popular sentiment

44
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:11,170
for many years, amongst many Austrians,

45
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,934
to possibly be unified with the Germans.

46
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,356
Austria [was and] is, fundamentally,

47
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:17,636
a German-speaking nation.

48
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:20,320
And so in March, this actually happens.

49
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,380
This 'Anschluss' -- or unification.

50
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,238
And, if you remember, that was also another

51
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:30,340
forbidden term of the Treaty of Versailles.

52
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,050
So now, the Germans are pretty much ignoring

53
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,060
the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of St. Germain,

54
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,220
which was the equivalent of the Treaty of Versailles --

55
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,100
but with the Austrians.

56
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,491
So, you have the unification of Germany and Austria.

57
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:47,430
Then, as we get into late 1938 --

58
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,600
in September in particular --

59
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,040
Hitler and the Nazis are interested in bringing

60
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,940
the German-speaking populations

61
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,620
of Czechoslovakia under German control.

62
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,085
And this region, right over here in magenta, this is where

63
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:07,110
you have large populations of German speakers.

64
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,279
These regions are collectively referred to

65
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:15,259
as the 'Sudetenland.'

66
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:18,700
And really, just continuing the policy of not wanting

67
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,260
to rock the boat with Germany,

68
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,970
you have France, Great Britain, and Italy agreeing --

69
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,160
And Italy was an ally of the Germans.

70
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,100
But France and Great Britain, in particular,

71
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,540
are not interested in rocking the boat with the Germans.

72
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,655
And so, in September of 1938,

73
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:38,600
they sign the Munich Agreement,

74
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,558
which did not actually --

75
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:42,640
where they actually did not consult

76
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,400
the Czechoslovakian government --

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,819
where they allowed Germany

78
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,567
to take over this region right over here --

79
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,276
the Sudetenland.

80
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:52,319
And that, frankly, with the Germans taking over

81
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,092
this significant part of the population of Czechoslovakia,

82
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:58,625
a significant part of

83
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,792
the industrial capacity of Czechoslovakia,

84
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:07,426
this eventually leads to early 1939,

85
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,221
where all of what we would now consider

86
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:13,970
the Czech Republic -- this area right over here,

87
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,620
all [of] this -- becomes a protectorate of Germany.

88
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,840
So, they call it the 'Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.'

89
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,958
So, Bohemia and Moravia go to Germany.

90
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:33,660
And, so this is 1939.

91
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,365
So, [by] 1939, [we have seen this pattern repeat itself

92
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:39,089
during the previous] four years --

93
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:42,230
Nazi Germany ignoring the Treaty of Versailles,

94
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,990
by rearming, by occupying the Rhineland,

95
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,400
by unifying with Austria.

96
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,720
Now, they're expanding their territory.

97
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,040
They are actively allowed to take over

98
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,760
the German-speaking areas of Czechoslovakia,

99
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,195
under the Munich agreement.

100
00:04:58,195 --> 00:04:59,621
And eventually, they're able to take over

101
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:01,165
Bohemia and Moravia --

102
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:05,760
all of what we would currently call the 'Czech Republic.'

103
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,240
And this general pattern of German aggression,

104
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,740
[allowed] by the other powers in Europe

105
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,940
essentially allowing it to happen --

106
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,860
and, in particular, Great Britain allowing it to happen --

107
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,163
has been referred to as a 'policy of appeasement.'

108
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:21,680
Obviously, the word 'appeasement' means

109
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,389
there is someone who is angry about something,

110
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,990
and you just don't want to make them any angrier --

111
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,160
you just let them do whatever they want --

112
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,776
this is, essentially, what was happening over here.

113
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,750
And in hindsight, it might be easy to say,

114
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,740
"Hey, look!. They were allowing Germany to take over

115
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,150
more and more -- to become more aggressive,

116
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,780
which made [Germany] more and more confident.

117
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,080
And this would eventually lead to World War II."

118
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,720
But at the time, you do have to remember [that[

119
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,560
everyone still had a very strong memory

120
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
of what had happened in World War I.

121
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,780
And no one was interested

122
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,091
in starting another [pan-European] war.

123
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,300
And so, even [though] in hindsight,

124
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,050
it's easy to say that the British --

125
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,558
in particular Neville Chamberlain,

126
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:03,134
who was the Prime Minister from 1937 on --

127
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:05,790
were weak and allowed German[y] --

128
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,510
Hitler -- to gain confidence, which eventually led to

129
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,298
the Nazi invasion of Poland in the fall of 1939.

130
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:19,400
But it's easy to say that in hindsight.

131
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,419
But what we see, as we get into 1939,

132
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,600
is an aggressive Germany, a Germany

133
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,740
that's not being checked by the other powers of Europe.

134
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,919
And this is what eventually leads to September of 1939,

135
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,190
where, actually, the Germans and the Soviets agree

136
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,960
to partition Poland into their own spheres of influence,

137
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,330
which allows Germany to invade Poland

138
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,210
in early September [of] 1939 --

139
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,590
which is, you could kind of say,

140
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,588
'the straw that broke the camel's back,'

141
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:51,382
and is the beginning of --

142
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:52,770
So, Poland invasion.

143
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,160
The invasion of Poland.

144
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,159
-- which is the beginning of World War II.
