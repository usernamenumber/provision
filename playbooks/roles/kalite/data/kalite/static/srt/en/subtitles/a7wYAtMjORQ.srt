1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,470
In the last video I introduced
you to the idea of the chain

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,520
rule with partial derivatives.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,080
And we said, well, if I have a
function, psi, Greek letter,

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,020
psi, it's a function
of x and y.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,770
And if I wanted to take the
partial of this, with respect

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,360
to-- no, I want to take the
derivative, not the partial--

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,430
the derivative of this, with
respect to x, this is equal to

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,540
the partial of psi, with respect
to x, plus the partial

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:35,400
of psi, with respect
to y, times dy, dx.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,630
And in the last video I didn't
prove it to you, but I

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,260
hopefully gave you a little bit
of intuition that you can

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,740
believe me.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,030
But maybe one day I'll prove
it a little bit more

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,120
rigorously, but you can find
proofs on the web if you are

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,960
interested, for the chain rule
with partial derivatives.

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,760
So let's put that aside and
let's explore another property

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,600
of partial derivatives, and then
we're ready to get the

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,080
intuition behind exact
equations.

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,070
Because you're going to find,
it's fairly straightforward to

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,210
solve exact equations, but the
intuition is a little bit

22
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,140
more-- well, I don't want to say
it's difficult, because if

23
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,890
you have the intuition,
you have it.

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,490
So what if I had, say, this
function, psi, and I were to

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,580
take the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to x, first.

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,510
I'll just write psi.

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,640
I don't have to write
x and y every time.

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,890
And then I were to take the
partial derivative with

29
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,485
respect to y.

30
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,920
   

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,730
So just as a notation, this you
could write as, you could

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,620
kind of view it as you're
multiplying the operators, so

33
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,050
it could be written like this.

34
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:42,400
The partial del squared times
psi, or del squared psi, over

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,540
del y del, or curly d x.

36
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,330
And that can also be written
as-- and this is my preferred

37
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,040
notation, because it doesn't
have all this extra junk

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,800
everywhere.

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,350
You could just say, well, the
partial, we took the partial,

40
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,050
with respect to x, first. So
this just means the partial of

41
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,240
psi, with respect to x.

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,060
And then we took the partial,
with respect to y.

43
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,870
So that's one situation
to consider.

44
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,970
What happens when we take the
partial, with respect to x,

45
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,650
and then y?

46
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:13,100
So with respect to x, you hold
y constant to get just the

47
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,190
partial, with respect to x.

48
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,000
Ignore the y there.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,060
And then you hold the x
constant, and you take the

50
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,670
partial, with respect to y.

51
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,480
So what's the difference between
that and if we were to

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,370
switch the order?

53
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,970
So what happens if we were to--
I'll do it in a different

54
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:30,400
color-- if we had psi, and we
were to take the partial, with

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
respect to y, first, and then
we were to take the partial,

56
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,510
with respect to x?

57
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,640
So just the notation, just so
you're comfortable with it,

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,660
that would be-- so partial
x, partial y.

59
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,360
And this is the operator.

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,750
And it might be a little
confusing that here, between

61
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,060
these two notations, even though
they're the same thing,

62
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,740
the order is mixed.

63
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,250
That's just because it's
just a different way of

64
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,910
thinking about it.

65
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,990
This says, OK, partial first,
with respect to x, then y.

66
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,160
This views it more as the
operator, so we took the

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,000
partial of x first, and then
we took y, like you're

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,950
multiplying the operators.

69
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,840
But anyway, so this can also be
written as the partial of

70
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,070
y, with respect to x-- sorry,
the partial of y, and then we

71
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,910
took the partial of that
with respect to x.

72
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,980
Now, I'm going to tell you right
now, that if each of the

73
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,840
first partials are continuous--
and most of the

74
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,510
functions we've dealt with in
a normal domain, as long as

75
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,780
there aren't any
discontinuities, or holes, or

76
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,070
something strange in the
function definition, they

77
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,290
usually are continuous.

78
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,990
And especially in a first-year
calculus or differential

79
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,810
course, we're probably going to
be dealing with continuous

80
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,620
functions in soon. our domain.

81
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,480
If both of these functions are
continuous, if both of the

82
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,410
first partials are continuous,
then these two are going to be

83
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,170
equal to each other.

84
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:54,950
So psi of xy is going to
be equal to psi of yx.

85
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:01,220
Now, we can use this knowledge,
which is the chain

86
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,870
rule using partial derivatives,
and this

87
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,060
knowledge to now solve a certain
class of differential

88
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,060
equations, first order
differential equations, called

89
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,270
exact equations.

90
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,860
And what does an exact
equation look like?

91
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,990
An exact equation
looks like this.

92
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,710
The color picking's
the hard part.

93
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,290
So let's say this is my
differential equation.

94
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,550
I have some function
of x and y.

95
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,830
So I don't know, it could
be x squared times

96
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,920
cosine of y or something.

97
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,650
I don't know, it could be
any function of x and y.

98
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,350
Plus some function of x and y,
we'll call that n, times dy,

99
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,900
dx is equal to 0.

100
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,520
This is-- well, I don't know if
it's an exact equation yet,

101
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,880
but if you saw something of this
form, your first impulse

102
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,990
should be, oh-- well, actually,
your very first

103
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,500
impulse is, is this separable?

104
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,180
And you should try to play
around with the algebra a

105
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,620
little bit to see if it's
separable, because that's

106
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,210
always the most straightforward
way.

107
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,770
If it's not separable, but you
can still put it in this form,

108
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,460
you say, hey, is it
an exact equation?

109
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,340
And what's an exact equation?

110
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,270
Well, look immediately.

111
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,600
This pattern right here
looks an awful

112
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
lot like this pattern.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,210
What if M was the partial of
psi, with respect to x?

114
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:24,920
What if psi, with respect
to x, is equal to M?

115
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,710
What if this was psi,
with respect to x?

116
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,570
And what if this was psi,
with respect to y?

117
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,500
So psi, with respect to
y, is equal to N.

118
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:32,950
What if?

119
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,670
I'm just saying, we don't
know for sure, right?

120
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,500
If you just see this someplace
randomly, you won't know for

121
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,200
sure that this is the partial
of, with respect to x of some

122
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,060
function, and this is the
partial, with respect to y of

123
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,830
some function.

124
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,810
But we're just saying,
what if?

125
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,650
If this were true, then we
could rewrite this as the

126
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,870
partial of psi, with respect to
x, plus the partial of psi,

127
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,680
with respect to y, times
dy, dx, equal to 0.

128
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,050
And this right here, the left
side right there, that's the

129
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,790
same thing as this, right?

130
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,040
This is just the derivative of
psi, with respect to x, using

131
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,940
the partial derivative
chain rule.

132
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,710
So you could rewrite it.

133
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,130
You could rewrite, this is just
the derivative of psi,

134
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,480
with respect to x, inside
the function of x,

135
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,410
y, is equal to 0.

136
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,730
So if you see a differential
equation, and it has this

137
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,070
form, and you say, boy, I can't
separate it, but maybe

138
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,030
it's an exact equation.

139
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,940
And frankly, if that was what
was recently covered before

140
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,800
the current exam, it probably
is an exact equation.

141
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,940
But if you see this form,
you say, boy, maybe

142
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,070
it's an exact equation.

143
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,580
If it is an exact equation-- and
I'll show you how to test

144
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,350
it in a second using this
information-- then this can be

145
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,550
written as the derivative of
some function, psi, where this

146
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,840
is the partial of psi,
with respect to x.

147
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,720
This is the partial of psi,
with respect to y.

148
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,655
And then if you could write it
like this, and you take the

149
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:01,370
derivative of both sides--
sorry, you take the

150
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,890
antiderivative of both sides--
and you would get psi of x, y

151
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,070
is equal to c as a solution.

152
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,770
So there are two things that we
should be caring you about.

153
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,470
Then you might be saying, OK,
Sal, you've walked through

154
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,550
psi's, and partials,
and all this.

155
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,020
One, how do I know that it's
an exact equation?

156
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,590
And then, if it is an exact
equation, which tells us that

157
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,290
there is some psi, then how
do I solve for the psi?

158
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,380
So the way to figure out is it
an exact equation, is to use

159
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,690
this information right here.

160
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,150
We know that if psi and its
derivatives are continuous

161
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,100
over some domain, that when
you take the partial, with

162
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,760
respect to x and then y, that's
the same thing as doing

163
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,980
it in the other order.

164
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,930
So we said, this is
the partial, with

165
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,180
respect to x, right?

166
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,610
   

167
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,920
And this is the partial,
with respect to y.

168
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,880
So if this is an exact equation,
if this is the exact

169
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,250
equation, if we were take the
partial of this, with respect

170
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,330
to y, right?

171
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,600
If we were to take the partial
of M, with respect to y-- so

172
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,560
the partial of psi, with respect
to x, is equal to M.

173
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,490
If we were to take the partial
of those, with respect to y--

174
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,450
so we could just rewrite that as
that-- then that should be

175
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:28,090
equal to the partial of N,
with respect to x, right?

176
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,976
The partial of psi, with respect
to y, is equal to N.

177
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:34,760
So if we take the partial, with
respect to x, of both of

178
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,964
these, we know from this that
these should be equal, if psi

179
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:44,400
and its partials are continuous
over that domain.

180
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,320
So then this will
also be equal.

181
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,990
So that is actually the
test to test if

182
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,930
this is an exact equation.

183
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,300
So let me rewrite all of that
again and summarize it a

184
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,690
little bit.

185
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:04,870
So if you see something of the
form, M of x, y plus N of x,

186
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,580
y, times dy, dx is equal to 0.

187
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,110
And then you take the partial
derivative of M, with respect

188
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,280
to y, and then you take the
partial derivative of N, with

189
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,030
respect to x, and they are equal
to each other, then--

190
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,410
and it's actually if and only
if, so it goes both ways--

191
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,930
this is an exact equation, an
exact differential equation.

192
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,410
This is an exact equation.

193
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,510
And if it's an exact equation,
that tells us that there

194
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:47,140
exists a psi, such that the
derivative of psi of x, y is

195
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,200
equal to 0, or psi of x, y is
equal to c, is a solution of

196
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,050
this equation.

197
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:58,480
And the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to x, is

198
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,740
equal to M.

199
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,760
And the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to y, is

200
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,340
equal to N.

201
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,550
And I'll show you in the next
video how to actually use this

202
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,810
information to solve for psi.

203
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,640
So here are some things
I want to point out.

204
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,720
This is going to be the partial
derivative of psi,

205
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,620
with respect to x, but when we
take the kind of exact test,

206
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,590
we take it with respect to y,
because we want to get that

207
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,080
mixed derivative.

208
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,410
Similarly, this is going to be
the partial derivative of psi,

209
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,030
with respect to y, but when we
do the test, we take the

210
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,500
partial of it with respect
to x so we get that mixed

211
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,730
derivative.

212
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,570
This is with respect to y,
and then with respect to

213
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,920
x, so you get this.

214
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,300
Anyway, I know that might be a
little bit involved, but if

215
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,360
you understood everything I did,
I think you'll have the

216
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,390
intuition behind why
the methodology of

217
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,470
exact equations works.

218
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,950
I will see you in the next
video, where we will actually

219
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,400
solve some exact equations See

220
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,500
