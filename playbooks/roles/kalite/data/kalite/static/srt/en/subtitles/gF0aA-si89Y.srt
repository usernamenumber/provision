1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:04,033
I'm here with Dr. Laura Bachrack at Stanford Medical School

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:05,384
and what are we going to talk about?

3
00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:07,683
We are going to talk about normal and abnormal growth in children

4
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:10,985
Fascinating...so, this is an important concern...

5
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:13,603
Parents really worry if their child is growing normally

6
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:15,683
and physicians worry about this too because

7
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:19,301
the change in height is an important barometer

8
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:21,812
of how the child is doing overall in terms of health

9
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:25,618
Right...so to begin to assess the child's growth pattern

10
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:28,068
we have to think about what are the determinants

11
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:30,085
of where the child should be on the growth curve

12
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:32,904
Right...the number one most important determinant,

13
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:36,068
of course, is genetics. Short parents are more

14
00:00:36,068 --> 00:00:38,033
likely to have short children and vice versa

15
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:40,985
And that's also true even when the child is young

16
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:43,817
if...like...big, cause sometimes I've seen in the opposite

17
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:46,319
so, you know....people who are petite have large children

18
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:49,433
and all the rest but it is true even if someone is large or

19
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:51,434
someone is large they're more like to have large children

20
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:53,002
even in infants and toddlers...

21
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:55,034
You have hit upon a really important issue that is

22
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:59,267
shown here in the slide.. the size of a baby at birth

23
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,923
isn't necessarily going to reflect the genetics

24
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:04,701
There are babies that are born small because the mother

25
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:07,805
didn't have pre-natal care...mother was a smoker...

26
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:10,885
other factors that compromised the growth of the child

27
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:14,918
and those can be born small for their gestational age.

28
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:18,099
During the first two to three years of life, they have

29
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:21,682
a chance to catch up on the curve and reach what's

30
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,192
called their genetic potential. So let's say...

31
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:27,034
So, I want to make sure...I have seen these curves before...

32
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:29,600
I remember this when I used to visit the Paediatrician

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,937
which I did, may be a little too long, but eh, so

34
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:38,383
so this axis right over here is age, in months

35
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:41,335
In months...so this is right here at birth. So if a baby

36
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:46,584
born at, I don't know, uh, this is the weight right over here

37
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:50,719
So if the baby are born at 5 pounds,

38
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,019
is this in pounds, this is in kilograms. So 5 pounds is

39
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:59,869
right over here. So this would be a baby born at 5 pounds.

40
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,378
And I'm talking more here during this growth lecture about

41
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:07,044
the height or the length of the baby

42
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:12,303
throughout childhood, but let say

43
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:16,105
the baby were born light in weight and short in length

44
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:19,174
So maybe 18 inches here would be a short length.

45
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:25,619
And let's say that that baby were small because

46
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:27,835
his mother had issues during pregnancy.

47
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:30,734
Is it always the case that the baby would be small because of issues or i mean...

48
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:34,818
No...the bottom line is the genetics

49
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:37,934
plays less of a part in the size of the baby at birth

50
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:39,933
and it will later on in childhood.

51
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:44,601
So it comes back to your point. You'll meet parents whose baby seemed

52
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:46,670
a bit larger or smaller than they are.

53
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,335
But by age 3, the child should be...

54
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,669
Hold on 1 second, let me just

55
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:53,502
close this...OK.

56
00:02:53,502 --> 00:02:58,320
By age 3, the child should be in his or her genetic group if you will.

57
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,783
So, there can be movement on the growth curve in the first 2 to 3 years

58
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:07,668
of life. There can be catch up growth where the child who were small

59
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:11,302
let's say moves from below the curve up to the 50%

60
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:20,236
by age 24 months. And you could have the convert.

61
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:24,819
Where you have a very big baby, let's say the mother had uncontrolled diabetes

62
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:27,970
and the baby was born very large, that baby can have catch down growth

63
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,154
to the 50%. By the age of 3, certainly movement across percentile

64
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:40,002
is considered to be abnormal and warrants an investigation.

65
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:45,903
So you really can predict someones even adult height based on where they are at 3?

66
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:50,736
The general rule of thumb is that by the age of 2 and a half to 3 the child is in their genetic

67
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:55,731
growth. Really? Mhmmm... Wow..I didn't realize that that quickly you can kinda..

68
00:03:55,731 --> 00:04:01,371
So if a child in age of 3 or 4 is in the 25% of height, it is unlikely

69
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:03,053
that they are gonna be in the NBA.

70
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:08,802
In general that's true there's a few exception there are late group of bloomers

71
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:10,470
what we call a constitutional delay of growth

72
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,601
but the general rule would be what percentile you are by the age of 2 or 3

73
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:18,019
is pretty much where you're gonna track if all things are going normally.

74
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,436
Wow..I never realize that's ahh...that's ahhh..

75
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:25,134
In genetics, it's an important determinant as they said. we can actually do a calculation

76
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:30,392
of where we think the child should end up the so called mid-parental height

77
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:33,420
I wish we're gonna talk about it later.

78
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,372
So, genetics is a critical factor but whether or not you reach your genetic potential

79
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:41,970
means that the cards have to be lined up appropriately.

80
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,004
So the cards that are important for achieving your genetic potentials

81
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:51,443
first of all, number one, normal amounts of hormones that are important for growing.

82
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:56,268
And those are thyroid and growth hormone to a large extent.

83
00:04:56,268 --> 00:05:04,769
The second factor of course is adequate nutrition and we think worldwide of children

84
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:10,287
who are under nourished who don't look anywhere near their age in terms of height

85
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:12,671
because they're so under nourished.

86
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:19,982
And you see the reverse of that, I mean I was born here and my parents were the 1st or 2nd generation..

87
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:25,170
we see that people in my generation are much taller that their parents because their parents

88
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,904
were probably malnourished in some way.

89
00:05:27,904 --> 00:05:31,186
Certainly there can be a secular trend where the children get taller than their parents

90
00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:37,304
if the children have a different environment. The other thing that we notice about

91
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:40,220
nutrition in our country is the over nutrition of our children and what happens

92
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:48,387
with obesity is that children may grow faster, in terms of weight and height for their age..

93
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:54,971
they don't end up taller in the long run but they move ahead more quickly through the maturation process

94
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:58,107
I see...like they accelerate. Exactly.

95
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,504
I never realized that. That's fascinating.

96
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:10,486
And then we think about psycho social factors, there literally a situation where

97
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,754
infants can be deprived of parental love and support and you can see

98
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:16,321
some dwarfing there. In a teenager we see problems with eating disorder

99
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:19,316
that's a cross between nutrition and a psychological problem.

100
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:20,871
It a psycho social factors.

101
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:26,422
So it's been seen that it's a noticeable changes in physical development based on

102
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:28,881
attention in love and....

103
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:32,269
Yes, there's actually a syndrome called Psycho Social Dwarfism

104
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:38,452
where you actually see them slow down in growing without adequate interpersonal support.

105
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:45,954
So, the issue is when do you need to worry about a child's growth pattern.

106
00:06:45,954 --> 00:06:53,470
In order to interpret that you really have to understand about the variability in growth.

107
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:59,603
In the first 2 to 3 years of life children grow much more quickly than they will later on..

108
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:04,098
By the age of three, until they hit puberty, children should grow 2 inches a year.

109
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:11,303
This is out of the toddler hood until they hit puberty.

110
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:14,154
Wow, so this is like the tree of puberty. Exactly, exactly.

111
00:07:14,154 --> 00:07:17,686
But when kids will hit puberty is going to be very long...

112
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:24,703
and so that's an issue. If the children are growing at a normal rate

113
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:27,454
it's not necessary to memorize the inches per year

114
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:31,622
Children will track along the growth curve and if we could turn to the next

115
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:36,572
slide or graph. This is the graph that we use for older children.

116
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:43,253
After the age of 2 up until they're 18. This is the curve that we use.

117
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:48,988
Now, beyond the age of 2, I told it is not normal for the children to

118
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:52,988
necessarily cross percentiles. So if for example you have a child

119
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:59,703
who is tracking along the 5th percentile every year growing their 2 inches per year...

120
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:03,813
They're moving along steadily, steadily, steadily...

121
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:11,322
that child has a more reassuring growth curve than one for example

122
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:14,721
who as a 5 year old had been on the top of the curve

123
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:22,104
and then the next year is on the 75th moving down the line

124
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:25,055
and the year after is on the 50th percentile.

125
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:29,664
Now that point in time the child has theoretically a normal height

126
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:32,454
because its within the curve, but there's something very abnormal

127
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:38,686
about that rate of growing and that's the child is more worrisome than the shorter child.

128
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,622
I see...fascinating.

129
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:44,269
So bottom line when a child would come in to present to me because of the concern

130
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:49,687
about growing, I first of all try to decide if they're short and if they're growing normally.

131
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:51,772
And those are 2 different questions.

132
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:55,904
The 1st question is are they short? And are they short can be defined by looking

133
00:08:55,904 --> 00:09:00,956
at these curves. These are curves representing the spectrum of normal height

134
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:05,555
for healthy American youth. And they go from the 5th to the 95th percentile.

135
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:09,806
So you can compare a child to the population as a whole

136
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:14,772
but I also like to calculate what we call the mid-parental height.

137
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:19,589
This is where we take into account the heights of the parents.

138
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,541
Because that's the most important determinant.

139
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,056
So how we calculate that is as follows.

140
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:30,173
We take the height of mom and dad and average them.

141
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:32,171
OK, let's do that.

142
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,405
So, I'm 5"9 if I'm wearing decent shoes.

143
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:41,872
And how tall is the mother of your children?

144
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:46,472
She's 5"6.

145
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:50,539
And are we trying to calculate your son or your daughter?

146
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:54,272
Let's do my son since he's little older, so he is plus 66 inches.

147
00:09:54,272 --> 00:10:05,423
So we'd take the mid-point of that and we're gonna add 2 and a half inches.

148
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:10,265
OK, so that gets us exactly 70 inches.

149
00:10:10,265 --> 00:10:13,187
Right, so that's the height prediction for your son.

150
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:14,805
Oh, very good.

151
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,688
Plus or minus...4 inches.

152
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:18,555
Oh, plus or minus 4 inches, that's a big difference.

153
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:22,789
It's a big difference but that's the nature of human variability.

154
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:30,839
OK, if these were your daughter, we would take the 67.5 inches and subtract 2 and a half inches.

155
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,206
Let's do that.

156
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:37,323
OK, so she would get 65...plus or minus 4 inches.

157
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:44,658
So that's something we do. We then calculate, in fact let's plot that

158
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:49,990
right on the curve, this is the boy's curve. So let's plot the 70 inches.

159
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,990
70 inches is right over here, OK.

160
00:10:52,990 --> 00:11:01,290
And then the range of 74 to 66.

161
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:07,249
Pretty broad range. OK, but if we had a child who is growing well below the curve

162
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,889
and we thought that mid-point she'd be about the 50th percentile,

163
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,156
that child would be short for the family.

164
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:18,156
So we always like to take the family's height into account.

165
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:20,355
So, number 1 question is the child short?

166
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:22,623
It will depend on what the height prediction is.

167
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:27,040
I see. So if my son was tracking down here at the 5%...that would be concerning.

168
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,457
Even if he's growing the 2 inches every year, it would still be concerning?

169
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,656
Well, it would raise some questions in our mind.

170
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:38,105
But more important factor is not just where they are on the curve at the moment,

171
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:40,823
but are they growing at the normal rate.

172
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:44,706
And the child who is not growing at the normal rate raise more red flags

173
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:47,472
than the child who is trotting up the curve.

174
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:49,190
Fascinating, it's interesting. Wow!

175
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,757
So that's the issue and that's what we approach every day

176
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:58,806
we want to look into the various causes, potentially for a growth slowdown

177
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:02,174
we want to adjust treatment to the specific ideology

178
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:05,706
And ideology means....?

179
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:10,073
Well for example, if the child has a deficiency of thyroid hormone, we'd want

180
00:12:10,073 --> 00:12:11,924
to give the thyroid hormone back.

181
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:13,664
So ideology is like the cause of the...right, right, right..

182
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:17,688
So if the child isn't growing because he has a nutritional problem like Celiac disease,

183
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:21,175
we want to put him on a special diet to address that issue.

184
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:27,355
Some parents think, well, what we wanna do..my child is healthy and normal and growing normally

185
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:32,390
but I wanna give him growth hormone, that becomes a topic in itself.

186
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, thank you for this. This is super informative.
