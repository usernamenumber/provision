00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
After one of the previous banking videos, I got a comment:

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,208
"If everyone puts gold in the banks,

3
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:08,254
what can they use to transact,

4
00:00:08,254 --> 00:00:11,700
or to buy food, or to pay for services, et cetera?"

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,200
And that is an excellent segue into the notion of a bank note.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,200
bank note...

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,300
You've probably heard the word before,

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,700
maybe in some Charles Dickens' novel or something,

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,792
but we're going to find out in this video

10
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:30,877
it's actually a much more familiar concept than you ever realized

11
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:33,938
and you probably have some of these bank notes

12
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:36,174
in your wallet as we speak.

13
00:00:36,174 --> 00:00:38,059
Let's go back to our example.

14
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,987
I have the Bank of Sal.

15
00:00:39,987 --> 00:00:41,779
I use 100 gold pieces.

16
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:43,372
That's my equity.

17
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:44,656
Let me draw that.

18
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:48,587
My equity... I have 100 gold pieces.

19
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:51,387
And I use that to build a building.

20
00:00:51,387 --> 00:00:53,287
So the 100 gold pieces actually go to the builders

21
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,587
and they're from out of town,

22
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,387
so they're not going to deposit it back with me.

23
00:00:57,387 --> 00:00:58,987
So that's my building.

24
00:00:58,987 --> 00:00:59,687
I don't know if you can see that.

25
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:00,987
It's a little picture of a building.

26
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:02,887
And all of the villagers in my city,

27
00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:04,887
they come and deposit their gold with me,

28
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:09,187
because my building looks very solid and safe.

29
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:10,987
It's safer than their mattresses,

30
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:18,387
so they then deposit 1,000 gold pieces with me.

31
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:21,087
1000 gold pieces

32
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:23,487
For the liability side of my balance sheet

33
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:28,479
I could say owe 1,000 gold pieces

34
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,856
owe 1000 gold

35
00:01:33,856 --> 00:01:36,151
And on my asset side, I actually get the gold pieces.

36
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:39,127
I should have done that in yellow.

37
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:42,487
So on my asset side of the balance sheet

38
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:46,087
it's just strangely tilting to the left

39
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:51,187
On the asset side, I actually have 1000 gold pieces

40
00:01:51,187 --> 00:01:55,187
So they're actually sitting in my vaults.

41
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:56,487
Now the question was

42
00:01:56,487 --> 00:02:00,387
if all of the villagers put all of their gold into my vaults

43
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,587
what can they use to transact every day?

44
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,187
The way I do it right now

45
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:07,487
-- this side is my assets

46
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:09,087
and these are my liabilities, right?

47
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,687
I owe them 1,000 gold pieces

48
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:14,187
that they can come and get at any moment

49
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:16,887
And this could kind of be viewed as a checking deposit.

50
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,787
I'll go into that in a second.

51
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:20,087
I'll probably go into that in the next video.

52
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:24,187
But if all of their 1,000 gold pieces are sitting right here on the asset side,

53
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:25,287
or at least in my vault,

54
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:27,629
what can they use to transact?

55
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:28,587
Well, the solution is, I say, hey, you know

56
00:02:28,587 --> 00:02:34,787
instead of taking some of your gold out and using that as essentially money

57
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:38,387
why don't I give you a note

58
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:42,687
a note that says you put X amount of gold into my vault

59
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:50,110
So, for example, for each one gold piece

60
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,415
I will issue a bank note

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:06,374
So let's say I'll say one gold piece bank note outstanding

62
00:03:06,374 --> 00:03:09,174
And then I hand you a slip of paper

63
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:10,374
and that slip of paper

64
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:13,974
-- and this might start to look a little familiar to you --

65
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:20,474
says it looks about this shape.

66
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:24,274
It has a nice picture of Sal in the middle,

67
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:25,274
because it's the Bank of Sal,

68
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:35,374
and it is denominated as one gold piece.

69
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:37,474
And now you gave me that gold piece

70
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:41,800
and you get this green piece of paper that only I can
print

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,500
and no one else has the sophistication to do something
this fancy.

72
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,600
Maybe I use some colors here and I sign it Sal

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,900
and I do all sorts of stuff that makes it really hard to forge

74
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,800
so that no one else can-- I put some holograms on it.

75
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,700
Who knows what I do to it, but no one else can forge it.

76
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,000
So this is essentially a piece of paper that I hand you

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,600
that says, you know what?

78
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,200
Anyone who holds this piece of paper

79
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,692
can go back to the Bank of Sal and get back a gold piece.

80
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:13,023
Then since everyone in the village,

81
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:15,900
they trust that the Bank of Sal will always be willing to exchange

82
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,600
one of these slips of paper for a gold piece,

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,900
instead of using a gold piece to buy something,

84
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,550
why don't you just this slip of paper?

85
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,600
And even more, for one gold piece,

86
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,500
you don't want to just have a stack of

87
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,850
one gold piece pieces of paper around.

88
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,200
Maybe if you gave me 5 gold pieces

89
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:39,700
-- I'll do that in another color --Maybe if you gave me 5 gold pieces

90
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,185
-- that rectangle is much larger than it should be relative to 1,000,

91
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:44,277
but I think you get the point --

92
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:48,123
then I'll do - I'll have a liability here that says:

93
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:51,981
five gold pieces bank note outstanding.

94
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:54,500
I'll call it b-note outstanding.

95
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,392
And I'll issue a -- I think you have guessed it.

96
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:00,515
Maybe I'll do it in different colors

97
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:04,938
to show you that these bank notes can come in different colors

98
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:08,023
but once again, I'll put a famous person there maybe

99
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:10,046
and I'll make it really hard to forge,

100
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:12,358
and I'll put holograms on it

101
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:16,562
but it'll be denominated as a five gold-piece bank note.

102
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:19,000
And now, if you were one of the villagers,

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
you gave me your gold pieces,

104
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,300
now not only is your gold safe,

105
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,400
you have these pieces of paper that are very hard to forge,

106
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,700
and that's a key issue there,

107
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,000
because if they were easy to forge,

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,300
then someone maybe completely unaffiliated with this trustworthy bank,

109
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,200
completely unaffiliated with Sal, could go out and print these things.

110
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,300
So you don't want that to happen.

111
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,600
So we're assuming that you can't forge this thing.

112
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,500
And now not only is your gold safe,

113
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,400
but you have something that you can transact with

114
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,550
-- that's frankly a lot easier than gold.

115
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,700
I mean, I could even have a denomination

116
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,200
that's -- it could be a 500 gold piece.

117
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,700
So if someone gave me 500 gold pieces,

118
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:02,200
I could give a 500 gold-piece bank note out.

119
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,954
That'd be my liability, right?

120
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:05,400
Because I know that at some point,

121
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,400
someone might give me back that 500-gold-piece bank
note,

122
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,400
and I'll have to give them 500 pieces of gold,

123
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,200
so that's why it's a liability.

124
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,146
And maybe that piece of currency is orange.

125
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:29,692
So it's 500... to kick the idea

126
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,154
And now this is super useful.

127
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:34,100
Now my bank-- we've done all of the other things,

128
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,331
how the bank increases the money supply,

129
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:36,581
and fractional lending,

130
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:39,908
and how the money supply adjusts for the total production

131
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:41,692
and wealth creation in the economy,

132
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,800
but now we've found another useful thing that a bank can do, is that

133
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,400
besides securing your gold,

134
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,115
it's actually providing a unit of exchange

135
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:53,673
that's frankly a lot easier to deal with than gold.

136
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:55,600
I mean, could you imagine lugging around

137
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,800
and counting and verifying 500 gold pieces every time you had to spend it?

138
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,100
Or everyone would have to have scales, et cetera.

139
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,400
Now people can just count there,

140
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,400
and as you see, this is money or this is cash.

141
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,800
You might be experiencing some form of dissonance in your head

142
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,631
because right when I drew that, you were like, wait,

143
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:15,200
Sal, that looks a lot like a dollar bill.

144
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,600
And that's true because a dollar bill is a Federal Reserve bank note.

145
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,300
It is a bank notes from the U.S. that-- there was a time,

146
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,000
and this was a time before central banks

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,123
and especially if you think about colonial times,

148
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:32,215
you had banks all over the colonies,

149
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:34,000
and they would actually issue their own bank note,

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,200
so you didn't have one uniform currency.

151
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,692
So one bank note might look like that

152
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:39,100
and have Bank of Sal.

153
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,754
Another bank note might have Bank of

154
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:44,719
-- I don't know-- Bank of George Bush or something,

155
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:47,700
and people would kind of have to have exchanges between them

156
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,900
to realize which banks are good for what.

157
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,200
Now we're not as familiar with the term bank note

158
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,800
because we only see one type, or at least one type per country.

159
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,300
We only see bank notes from one bank,

160
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,600
or at least one bank has the right to issue them within the United States

161
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,000
and that's the Federal Reserve Bank.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,500
And it's not backed by gold.

163
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
It's actually backed by U.S. Treasuries,

164
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,100
and I'll go into that a little later on.

165
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,400
Actually, that's a whole fascinating realm of thought.

166
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,900
But I just wanted to get this point home,

167
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,300
that all you have-- that this bank actually has this other service of

168
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,500
issuing these bank notes that are different than

169
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,800
the checking deposits, which I will cover in the next video.

170
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,369
And then I will use both of those concepts

171
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:36,000
to redo that lending that we did with the irrigation ditches and the factory

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,800
to show you that the gold actually never even has to leave the bank.

173
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,100
The gold just sits in the bank the whole time

174
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,200
and the bank can just use its bank notes and checks

175
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,800
to actually conduct all of the transactions.

176
00:08:47,800 --> 99:59:59,999
See you in the next video.
