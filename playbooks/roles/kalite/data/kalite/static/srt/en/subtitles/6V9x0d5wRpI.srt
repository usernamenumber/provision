1
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:15,064
just a remarkable portrait itself lifelike

2
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:18,274
i love to have such a collar and the hat and the feather

3
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:21,226
and couldnt she pose the way and she peeks

4
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:25,526
out at something.its so animated and its so really

5
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,878
wonderful. for all of the odephus and all the complexities in the costume

6
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:31,880
not only very natural but she comes with full energy

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,129
and curiosity.you feel as if you'll get a sense of

8
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:37,894
fucials. oh completely. this is commisisioned by her

9
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:42,157
husband here.on the eve of french revolution

10
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:45,274
her name is madame perregaux and supported by

11
00:00:45,274 --> 00:00:48,260
elizabeth vishale the bronx. just look at the way the

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,075
many is constructed. she has taken a very

13
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:56,556
simple composition. very traditional of a woman

14
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,729
and to have ones potrait, with the curtain on

15
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:03,459
one side and space on the other in a balcony. but

16
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:06,279
she has created first of all a sense of immanuation

17
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:09,392
by creaating something barn and also some humor.

18
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:13,777
absolutely. but hse is also forgoing considering that

19
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:18,594
lovely orcorn at the lower right that begins to

20
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:22,811
send off a couple of other arcs of her arms, of her collar

21
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:26,745
of her hat and then of her lovely red ribbon

22
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:28,492
the just trims her waist though. she has taken a formal element

23
00:01:28,492 --> 00:01:32,362
of that broken curtain that we see behind

24
00:01:32,362 --> 00:01:38,155
of figures and portraits that made it something

25
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:46,540
much more playful. yeh really engaging and its jus a piece of

26
00:01:47,317 --> 99:59:59,999
example masterful to how a portrait can be brought to life
