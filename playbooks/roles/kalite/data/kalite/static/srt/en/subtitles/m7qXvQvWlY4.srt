1
00:00:01,091 --> 00:00:07,036
We've aready talked about linear demand functions

2
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:11,285
that actually have changing price elasticity

3
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:15,534
As we go down the curve

4
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:16,741
and we've shown the extremes

5
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:17,345
we've shown things that are perfectly inelastic

6
00:00:17,345 --> 00:00:17,948
and things that are perfectly elastic

7
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:22,000
What I want to do with this video

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,700
and it will be a quick little video

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,050
is think about, can we construct a demand curve

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,400
-or at least understand what it looks like-

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,034
that has a constant elasticity across the curve

12
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:34,667
and just for fun let's make it a constant elasticity of 1

13
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:35,863
so it has constant unit elasticity of demand

14
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:37,059
So let's think about how we can create that

15
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:38,731
and hopefully it will give us a little more intuition

16
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:43,236
on how this elasticity business even works

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,017
so let's draw our axes

18
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:53,029
that is price, and that right there is quantity

19
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:03,042
Now let's put some numbers there, that will just help us

20
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:10,844
draw this demand curve that has unit elasticity at every point, every price, and every quantity

21
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:17,090
I'm just going to put some numbers here, that over there is 10, so that's $10 or whatever we're doing,

22
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,677
and that this is 10 units per time period, 10 units per week, 10 units per month, or whatever else.

23
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:30,511
Now, we want the absolute value of the elasticity of the demand to be equal to 1 at all points.

24
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:35,202
We're going to assume that this curve meeets the law of demand

25
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:39,869
which means that as price goes down, quantity demanded goes up.

26
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,843
So let's think, this is going to be a downward slope, and really, we're going to say

27
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:47,137
so the elasticity of demand is going to be equal to -1

28
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:50,333
If we have a 1% decrease in price,

29
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:55,101
we're going to have a 1% increase in quantity and vice versa

30
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:59,699
so let's think about it. If we're up here,

31
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:02,867
where the price is nearly $10, and where maybe

32
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,970
the quantity is closer to 1,

33
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,313
let's think about what a 10% movement in price would look like,

34
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:10,267
a 10% movement down.

35
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:12,800
It would be about roughly about this size

36
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:15,326
A 10% movement would be roughly there.

37
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:17,183
I'm just trying to get the general shape of this curve,

38
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:19,041
I'm not going into the deeper mathematics behind it

39
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,038
or the calculus of it.

40
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:23,267
So that is a 10% price movement down

41
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:26,518
and we also want a 10% in quantity movement up

42
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:29,333
but remember, our quantity is only 1

43
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:35,133
so 10% quantity movement up, would only be 10% of 1

44
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:38,133
so if we're moving 10% in price downwards,

45
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,704
this is a 10% move upwards in quantity

46
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:45,373
so our curve up here, would look something like this,

47
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,369
which would have to be quite steep.

48
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,413
Now, let's think about what the curve would look like over here.

49
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:52,037
Now, once again, we want 10% for both of them.

50
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:56,170
Because we want the price elasticity of demand

51
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,538
to be 1 throughout the curve.

52
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:01,185
So, if we go over here for a 10% movement in price,

53
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:07,600
so let's say we're down here where price is close to 1.

54
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,029
A 10% movement in price is going to be very small.

55
00:03:12,029 --> 00:03:14,119
A 10% movement in price is going to be like that,

56
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:17,718
It's going to be roughly a tenth of a unit

57
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:19,733
so that's a 10% movement in price,

58
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:24,127
but a 10% movement in quantity demanded is going to be

59
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,240
much larger, it's going to look like that

60
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,665
because the quantity is approaching 10, so 10%

61
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:33,181
of that is about 1 unit, just like that, so at this point in the graph

62
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,365
it would look something like this

63
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:38,430
it would flatten out a good bit, just like that, and when

64
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,031
the price and quantity are the same

65
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:52,564
so let's say that this is 2, and this is 3,

66
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:56,031
right over here, your percent movements are going

67
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,067
to be the same, but since the price and quantity are the same

68
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,861
the absolute movements are also going to be the same

69
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:02,133
so at that point

70
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,088
our curve should look somthing like that,

71
00:04:04,088 --> 00:04:05,574
it should have a slope of one

72
00:04:05,574 --> 00:04:09,777
so if you connect the dots, you would get the general shape of a demand curve

73
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:13,867
that has a price elasticity of demand of -1 throughout

74
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:17,115
the curve, whose absolute value of the price elasticity

75
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:18,867
of demand is 1, so let's just

76
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:26,199
do that, so the curve will look something like that

77
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,700
it will keep getting steeper, as we get the quantity closer to zero

78
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,836
and it would keep flattening out as the quantity

79
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,833
grows and grows and grows.

80
00:04:33,833 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.
