1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
   

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,530
Until about 2006, if you talk
to anyone, especially real

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,150
estate agents, they'd always
tell you that on average,

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,660
nationwide, that housing always
goes up in price.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,930
There could be layoffs.

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,780
And maybe oil drops off and
people have layoffs in Texas,

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,210
so housing prices go
down in Texas.

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,250
Or they have layoffs in
Michigan, so housing prices go

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:20,710
down there.

10
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,040
But nationwide, housing prices
do nothing but go up.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,910
And that, for the most part, has
been true since the Great

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,410
Depression.

13
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,980
Housing prices have been going
up, maybe 1% or so per year.

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,660
Actually a little bit less in
real terms. But something

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,810
fundamentally amazing happened
in the beginning

16
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,890
part of this decade.

17
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,590
I have right here, this is
the Case-Shiller index.

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,300
And this is probably the best
estimate of housing

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,130
prices I can find.

20
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,300
This is better than the
median, because the

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,300
Case-Shiller actually tries to
compare the price you pay for

22
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,200
the same house.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,090
And maybe I'll do another
video later on how they

24
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,210
exactly do that.

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,350
But if we look at the
Case-Shiller index.

26
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,040
Let's see, in 2000 -- that's
where they index it to -- a

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,090
house that cost, you know,
$100,000 in 2000.

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,250
Or, the index was at
$100,000 in 2000.

29
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,310
By 2004 houses nationwide --
this is the national index

30
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,290
right here -- nationwide, prices
had increased by 46%.

31
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,620
And by 2006, where they peak,
they had increased by 88%.

32
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,170
They had almost doubled since
the price in 2000.

33
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,450
And so the obvious question
is, why did this happen?

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,520
What drove prices to
increase so fast?

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,670
When really, for most of the
history of America, housing

36
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,830
prices have never increased
this fast. Especially

37
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,310
considering what was happening
in the broader economy.

38
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,010
What do I mean by that?

39
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,720
Well for the price
of anything to

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,380
increase, what has to happen?

41
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,110
Well the demand has to increase
faster than the

42
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,530
supply, right?

43
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,170
So let's look at possible
theories.

44
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,960
What are demand drivers
that could make

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,100
housing prices go higher?

46
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,290
Let me write that in green.

47
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,950
Demand drivers.

48
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:13,350
Well maybe the population grew
faster than the housing stock?

49
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,190
When I say the housing stock, I
just mean that we're saying

50
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,690
just demand.

51
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,850
So let me just say population.

52
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,200
Housing stock is supply.

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,060
So population goes up.

54
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,920
That's a demand driver.

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,810
What's another demand driver?

56
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,150
Incomes go up.

57
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,400
Right?

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,090
That's another reason.

59
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe if a lot of people just
become a lot richer, they're

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,180
willing to pay for houses.

61
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,160
And what are the
supply drivers?

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,850
Well these are just
new homes built.

63
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,650
   

64
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,640
So if you buy the classical
supply-demand argument, why

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,170
housing prices increased by 40%
from 2000 to 2004, or why

66
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:03,090
they increased by 80% from 2000
to 2006, these dynamics

67
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,330
should have grown faster
than these dynamics.

68
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,380
So the population -- or maybe
the total income, if you took

69
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,130
the population and incomes--
grew faster than

70
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,810
the new homes built.

71
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,430
So let's see if that's true.

72
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,720
So I found this New York
Times article.

73
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,600
And you could do some Google
searches, and I'm sure you can

74
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,670
find probably better data.

75
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,470
This is just me doing a very
fast search on this stuff.

76
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,740
Let me see if I can get it up.

77
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,510
OK, here it is.

78
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,200
So this is from a New
York Times article.

79
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,610
This is a little graph.

80
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,270
And this is showing the average
of incomes reported on

81
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,850
all tax returns.

82
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,850
So notice, from 2000 to 2004
the average reported

83
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,360
actually went down.

84
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,290
It actually went down
from 2000 to 2004.

85
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,140
And this is interesting.

86
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,860
Let me see if I can bring
this in here.

87
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,980
So here they say total reported
income in 2004

88
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,570
dollars -- so they adjusted for
inflation -- fell 1.4%.

89
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,910
But because the population
grew during that period,

90
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,330
average real incomes declined
more than twice as much,

91
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,650
falling by $1,641
a year, or 3%.

92
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,680
So what are they saying?

93
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,230
They're saying the total income
fell by 1.4%, but the

94
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,430
population must have grown by
about 1.5%, and so the average

95
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,900
per capita was 3%.

96
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,100
So let me write that
in summary.

97
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,770
So what do we know?

98
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,080
What happened?

99
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:36,290
We know from 2000 to 2004 -- and
this is nationwide -- we

100
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:44,490
know that the population
increased by roughly 1.5%.

101
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:50,220
   

102
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,290
So not by much.

103
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,750
I mean this is over a
four-year period.

104
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,200
So per year, it was growing
by less than 1%.

105
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,910
And then if you go to the income
per person, or actually

106
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,310
this is probably, well, this
is income for tax filing.

107
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,750
But that's a pretty
good proxy.

108
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,140
Income for tax filing,
that declined by 3%.

109
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,320
So the total money available,
that New York Times article

110
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,840
just showed us, actually
declined.

111
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,610
By, what did they
say, by 1.4%.

112
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,010
So the argument that somehow
there's more money out there,

113
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,010
chasing the same number of
homes, or a slightly larger

114
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,350
number of homes, doesn't really
carry much weight.

115
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,250
But let's just make sure.

116
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,550
Maybe for some reason, maybe
houses were destroyed.

117
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,210
Or the number of homes built
just didn't keep pace with

118
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,450
this population increase.

119
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,260
So let's see what data
we can find on that.

120
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,620
Well actually I found
this thing.

121
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,160
This says that -- this was
in 1999 -- they say the

122
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,550
composition of estimated 115
million housing units in the

123
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,240
United States.

124
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,170
So we can say, roughly, that
in 2000 that there were 115

125
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,433
million housing units.

126
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:15,060
   

127
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,620
So let's see.

128
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,300
Over this time period,
roughly how many

129
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,270
housing units were built?

130
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,230
What percentage did the housing
stock increase by?

131
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,910
And I found this data here.

132
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,840
And this is annualized new
home builds by year.

133
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,700
And I'm not going to go through
all of the math.

134
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,620
But if you see -- let's see,
if I go back to 2000.

135
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,740
I know this might be hard
for you to see.

136
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,570
But if we pick up pretty much
any month from 2000, 2001.

137
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,850
This is in thousands.

138
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,280
So on an annualized basis,
maybe 1.5 million homes.

139
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,310
This was in 2000.

140
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,950
But it started accelerating,
all the way to 2004.

141
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,900
By 2004, we were building
roughly 2

142
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,280
million homes a year.

143
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,280
So over that time period, we can
say, on average -- you can

144
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,150
work the numbers to get an exact
number, but it should

145
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,410
work out -- we were
building about 1.8

146
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,800
million homes a year.

147
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:12,870
   

148
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,550
And we can assume that homes
destroyed were pretty

149
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,700
negligible.

150
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,610
I'm not aware of most
neighborhoods where they were

151
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,500
bulldozing homes.

152
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,080
If anything, they were just
renovating homes.

153
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,650
But these are brand new homes.

154
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,510
So over that four year period --
and I'm just going to focus

155
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,400
there because that's where we
got data from that New York

156
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,330
Times article -- how many
homes were built?

157
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,945
Well, 1.8 times 4,
that's what?

158
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:37,880
   

159
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,850
So roughly 7.2 million homes,
new homes, were built over

160
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,910
that time period.

161
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,140
And we started with
a base of a 115

162
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,710
million, roughly, in 2000.

163
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,460
So over that time period, the
housing stock increased by 6%.

164
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,040
So the supply of homes
went up by 6%.

165
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,470
So what's going on here?

166
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,510
From 2000 to 2004 we built
a ton of houses.

167
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,730
The supply of homes
went up by 6%.

168
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,310
People's incomes actually
went down, because

169
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,220
we were in a recession.

170
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,150
People were getting laid off,
or they were just willing to

171
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,780
work for less.

172
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,600
Income went down.

173
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,320
And the population
barely increased.

174
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,470
And if we look at the total
dollars that were being

175
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,760
earned, that actually
went down.

176
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,590
So the actual money out there
to pay for houses went down.

177
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,110
And at the same time,
the total number

178
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,550
of houses went up.

179
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,850
But at the same time, over this
exact same period, the

180
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,179
prices of houses
went up by 46%.

181
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,460
Or, I forgot the number, but it
was 40-something percent.

182
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,360
And it actually continued to
race up until 2006, where it

183
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,990
went up 80% relative to 2000.

184
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,520
So this is bizarre.

185
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,240
   

186
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,650
Basic economics would tell
us that if the supply is

187
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,610
increasing and the demand is
decreasing, prices, if

188
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,130
anything, should come down.

189
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,520
So what happened?

190
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,800
So I'm going to let you think
about that a little bit.

191
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,910
There you have the supply-demand
thing that would

192
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,840
tell you prices went down.

193
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,590
But not only did they not go
down, but they raced up faster

194
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,240
than they've ever done in
history, in the history of the

195
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,250
United States.

196
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,500
So in the next video I'm going
to tell you, frankly, why I'm

197
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,290
pretty sure housing
prices did go up.

198
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,710
See you soon.

199
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,400
