00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:01,533
Deflation

2
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:09,467
Deflation is literally just a lowering of prices, or a general decrease in the level of the price for goods and services

3
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:14,400
Or another way to think about it, since deflation is an increase in the level of prices, you can just view it as

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:26,333
negative inflation. And so, let's say we're the folks at the bureau of labor statistics and we are trying to compute the CPI Index

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:34,431
And one period, let's call it Period 1 over here. We have our CPI index for Urban consumers that is quoted most often.

6
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:40,021
And we have one basket of goods and it will have housing in it.

7
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:52,067
It will have transportation in it. It will have fuel in it. It might has some proxy for entertainment in it whatever else inside of it

8
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:59,979
and that basket of goods, let's say in period One, and this is a simplification, runs that urban consumer on average

9
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:05,467
100 dollars, and then we go to Period Two, and we look at that same basket of goods,

10
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:10,795
maybe we're adjusting certain things, maybe some products became obsolete and we have to replace

11
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:18,313
or there has to be some adjustments for technology... given that, assuming that everything else is equal

12
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:25,667
that same basket of goods is now running at 98 dollars, and so, the total costs of goods and services

13
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:35,467
for this kind of average consumer has gone down by 2 dollars. or we can say, that we've experienced negative 2 percent inflation

14
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:44,733
which really just in another way of saying we have experienced deflation

15
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:51,800
now, deflation is not the norm, especially for growing economies, the way that our current economic systems run

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:59,667
although it does happen, Japan in particular is probably the most recent, most famous case of deflation

17
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:07,723
and the main reason why economist really don't like deflation, in particular why central bankers really don't like deflation

18
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:14,087
is that it makes it much harder to control the economy, or to fuel the economy which interest rates alone.

19
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:18,600
or actually just with printing money alone, and I'll go into a little bit more depth with that in future videos

20
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,733
One thing I do want to make clear, is although deflation is not what we normally see in the broader economy as a whole

21
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:29,775
it does happen very frequently in specific sectors and the most common one is in the technology sector,

22
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:37,400
specifically in hardware, we've all experienced buying a laptop, at one period..

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:46,487
so right now you buy a laptop for maybe 1000 dollars,and then 6 months later, you see the exact same

24
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:53,400
laptop for 500 dollars, and that's just because the rate of technological innovation is growing so fast,

25
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,200
that they can produce the same amount of memory and processing power for a lot cheaper now, or for the same amount of money,

26
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,800
you can get much more memory and processing power

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,867
laptops with big screen TVs and phones and all the rest.
