99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Given a rectangle with length

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"a-squared plus 6-a minus 27"

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and with "a-squared minus 9",

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
write the ratio of the rectangle to its length

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as a simplified rational expression.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we want the ratio of the width to the length

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the length of the rectangle

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they give us the expressions for each of these

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The expression for the width of the rectangle is

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"a-squared minus 9", so the width is

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"a-squared minus 9"; we want the ratio

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of that to the length; the ratio of the width of the

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
rectangle to it's length. The length is given

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over there; it is "a-squared plus 6-a minus 27"

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they want us to simplify this.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the best way to simplify this, whether we're

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
dealing with expressions in the numerator or denominator

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or just numbers is that we want to factor them

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and see if they have any common factors

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if they do, we might be able to cancel them out

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we factor this top expression over here

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which was the expression of the width

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is of the form "a-squared minus b-squared" where

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"b-squared" is 9, so this is going to be the same thing as

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"a plus the sqrt of 9 times a minus the sqrt of 9"

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is "a plus 3 times a minus 3"

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I just recognized that from just the pattern

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you ever see something "a-squared minus b-squared"

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's "a plus b times a minus b"

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can verify that for yourself

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
multiply this out; you'll get "a-squared minus b-squared"

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the width can be factored into "a plus 3 times a minus 3"

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's see if we can do something for the denominator
