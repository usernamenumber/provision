1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,030
We're on problem 99.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,700
And I like these that don't have a lot of words in them.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,280
m does not equal n. We have to prove that.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,410
Is it true that m does not equal n?

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:20,040
Statement number 1 says that m plus n is less than 0.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,550
Well, let's see, what does this tell us?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,040
This just tells us that m is less than negative n.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,080
It still doesn't tell us anything.

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:39,880
Maybe negative n is-- well,let's say, if m is equal to n,

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,160
which is equal to negative 10, then this would hold true,

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,370
right? Because negative 10 plus negative 10 is minus 20,

12
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,520
which is less than 0. So this still doesn't prove anything.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,200
Or, of course, I could have two different numbers.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,000
I could have m being minus 5, and n being minus 1. And

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,440
when you add them together you get minus 6, both less than 0.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,350
So it still doesn't tell us anything about whether m does

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:11,040
not equal n. Statement two. m times n is less than 0.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,490
Now, this is interesting. m times n is less than 0.

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,520
So that tells us that one is positive and one is negative.

20
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,460
The only way you can multiply two numbers and get something

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:33,160
less than 0 is one positive and one negative.

22
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,670
And it doesn't say equal 0, so they both can't equal 0.

23
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,290
And so, when you multiply two numbers and you get a negative

24
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,140
number, they have to be different numbers,

25
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,460
because one has to be positive and one has to be negative.

26
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,700
Try it out with as many things as you want.

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,900
But you know from your basic negative multiplication rules

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,690
that the only way to get a negative as a product of two

29
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,020
numbers is one positive, one negative.

30
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,000
So this is all we need to know to know that m and n are

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,150
different, because one's positive and one's negative.

32
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,140
I said that about five times. Problem 100.

33
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,400
And you didn't need statement one. Problem 100.

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,000
When a player in a certain game tossed a coin a number of

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,860
times, four more heads than tails resulted.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,480
So heads is equal to tails plus 4.

37
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,400
Heads or tails resulted each time the player tossed the coin.

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Fair enough. How many times did heads result?

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,610
So essentially the problem description just tells us that

40
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,470
heads is equal to tails plus 4.

41
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,510
And that heads plus tails is just all of the tosses.

42
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,630
So statement number one says,

43
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,000
the player tossed the coin 24 times.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,880
So that's what I just said. Heads plus tails is equal to 24.

45
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,510
And so this is enough information by itself to know

46
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,150
how many times did heads result.

47
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,900
Because we could rewrite this top equation as heads minus

48
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,380
tails is equal to 4. And

49
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,660
if you wanted to solve it, you'd get 2 heads is equal to 28.

50
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,360
Heads is equal to 14.

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,040
All of that would have been a waste of time as soon as you

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,060
saw that you had two linear equations and two unknowns.

53
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,410
You could have said, oh, I have enough information to

54
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,180
solve for any of the variables. This is a 4.

55
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,800
So statement one by itself is enough. Statement two.

56
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,030
The players received 3 points each time heads resulted and 1

57
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,070
point each time tails resulted, for a total of 52 points.

58
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,190
So he got 3 points for every head-- that's how many points

59
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,710
he got for all the heads-- plus 1 point for each tail.

60
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,620
So that's how many points he got for all the tails.

61
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,810
And that equals 52. So once again,

62
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,930
this is providing us with another linear equation.

63
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,740
So now we have two linear equations with two unknowns.

64
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm not even looking at what they gave us in statement one.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,100
So just using these two, we have enough information to

66
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,670
solve the problem. You can do it the exact same way.

67
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,040
This is what you learned in algebra 1.

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,510
So, each statement independently is sufficient to

69
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,580
solve the problem.

70
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,750
Problem 101. We've already done 100 problems. 101.

71
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,380
Once you get going, these get kind of fun.

72
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:14,480
If s is the infinite sequence--OK, so it's like s1

73
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,090
is equal to 9.

74
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:24,940
s2 is equal to 99. s3 is equal to three 9's. I get it.

75
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,000
And the kth s is equal to 10 to the k minus 1.

76
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,120
This is the third one. 10 to the third is 1000 minus 1.

77
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,020
10 squared is 100 minus 1. Right. So it all works.

78
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,270
All right, that's what they told us.

79
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,820
Is every term in s divisible by the prime number, p?

80
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,320
Well, it depends what p is. And frankly,

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,280
if just the first term is divisible by p,

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,890
all of them are going to be divisible by p. Why is that?

83
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,010
Because all of the terms are divisible by the first term,or 9

84
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,350
So if p goes into 9, it's going to go into all of these

85
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,010
terms, because 9 goes into all of them.

86
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,690
So we just have to say, does p go into 9?

87
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,080
It's a much simpler way of thinking about the problem.

88
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,640
Statement number one says, p is greater than 2.

89
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,220
So does every prime number greater than 2 go into 9?

90
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,500
Well, no. 5, 7. These don't go into 9. 3 goes into 9.

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,070
So we still don't know whether p goes into 9. Statement two.

92
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,670
At least one term in the sequence, s, is divisible by p.

93
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,880
If we knew that it was this term, if we knew that the

94
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,070
first term was divisible by p, we would be all set.

95
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,250
But we don't know whether it's just the first term.

96
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,000
For example, p could be 11. What if p is 11?

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,100
If p is 11, then it goes into this term. It goes into the 99.

98
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,040
But it won't go into the first term. It won't go into 9.

99
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,820
So 11 is an example where it holds for case two,

100
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,420
but it doesn't hold for the whole question.

101
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,010
It's not divisible into every term.

102
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:35,000
Or we could say that if p was equal to 3-- well,

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,290
of course, that'll go into everyone.

104
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,600
So statement two by itself actually doesn't help us any.

105
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,960
And actually, both of these numbers satisfy both statements.

106
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,850
And so, if you pick 11, it doesn't work.

107
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,660
If you pick 3, it does work. So both statements combined

108
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,040
still do not give us enough information.

109
00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:00,010
Problem 102. I have got to do some drawing.

110
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:06,080
OK, so I have a quadrilateral here. Let's see. That's RU.

111
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,500
And then go up there. And then go flat to there.

112
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,050
And then come down like that.

113
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:19,090
And then they draw an altitude here. All righty.

114
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:28,610
OK, so this an R. This is a W. This is a U. A T. And an S.

115
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,060
They're saying the height of this is 60 meters.

116
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,420
This length is 45 meters.

117
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,040
And they're saying this right here, this length is 15 meters.

118
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,290
Fair enough. Quadrilateral RSTU, shown above,

119
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,020
is a site plan for a parking lot,

120
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,650
in which side RU is parallel to side ST.

121
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,000
OK, so this and this are parallel.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,490
What is the area of the parking lot?

123
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,670
So, immediately I can figure out the area of this triangle,

124
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,480
right? Base times height, times 1/2.

125
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,060
So I can figure out this area immediately.

126
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,000
I can immediately figure out this square region right here.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,020
Because I know it's 60 by 45. And so the question is,

128
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,640
can I figure out this triangular region right here?

129
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,100
Well, I don't know what this distance is.

130
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,940
If I knew what this distance is, then I could say base

131
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,080
times 60, times 1/2, and figure this out.

132
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,970
So this right here is what matters.

133
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,040
That's the crux of the issue right there.

134
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,540
So statement number one tells us that RU is 80 meters.

135
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,430
RU is equal to 80. I think this gets us there, right?

136
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:45,610
Because think about it, if this whole thing is 80 meters,

137
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,360
I can figure out that. How can I figure out that?

138
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,450
Because I have 15 here. I have this length is 45.

139
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,590
So this length is going to be 80 minus 45, minus 15.

140
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,040
And what is that? 60. So 80 minus 60. So this will be 20.

141
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,720
And so just with statement one, I can figure out this

142
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,010
length right here.

143
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,980
And I'm done because this triangle is this base times

144
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,230
this height, times 1/2.

145
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,610
This rectangle is this base times this height.

146
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,000
And then this triangle is 20 times 60, times 1/2.

147
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,040
So I have enough information to figure out the area just

148
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,080
with statement one. Now statement two.

149
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:35,030
TU is equal to 20 square roots of 10 meters.

150
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,630
Well, this is enough information, too. Think about it.

151
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,380
This is a right triangle right here. This height is 60.

152
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,890
And remember, if we can figure out-- let me switch colors--

153
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,430
if we figure out the base, we're going to be set.

154
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,900
So we could do Pythagorean Theorem.

155
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:53,420
So we could say, the based squared plus 60 squared is

156
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,110
equal to this number squared.

157
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:03,000
And that number squared is what? 400 times 10. So it's 4,000.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,130
So you get B squared is equal to 4,000 minus 3,600,

159
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,450
which equals 400. So B is equal to 20 again.

160
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,490
So this actually also gives you the information that this

161
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,660
base right here is equal to 20.

162
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,620
And then, like I showed in the previous statement, that's all

163
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,490
you need to figure out the area of the entire parking lot.

164
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,350
So statement two alone is also sufficient.

165
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,640
So either of these statements alone are sufficient to tell us

166
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,800
the area of the parking lot.

167
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,060
See you in the next video.
