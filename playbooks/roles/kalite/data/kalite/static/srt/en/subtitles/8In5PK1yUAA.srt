1
00:00:01,045 --> 00:00:03,488
Let's say that the economy of Country A is

2
00:00:03,488 --> 00:00:06,571
stagnating, its maybe facing a deflationary crisis,

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,707
so Central Bank tries to print as much money and

4
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:11,076
lower interest rates as much as possible. And an

5
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:14,048
investor can go into Country A and borrow in A's

6
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:18,413
currency at a 1% interest rate. Lets also say that in the

7
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,386
rest of the world, and in particular, in Country B, one

8
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:24,033
can actually make relatively, or what you perceive as

9
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:27,708
safe investments, at a higher interest rate in Country B's currency.

10
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:31,742
And so lets say that you can get a 5% return.

11
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:34,389
So you can imagine that some opportunistic investors

12
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:37,407
might say "Wow I could borrow in Country A's currency"

13
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:40,240
and so lets say they go into Country A, they borrow

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,070
at 1% and in particular they borrow 100, and I won't call

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,344
them Dollar's or Yen, or Euros, I'll call them 100 A's where

16
00:00:50,344 --> 00:00:55,380
the name of A's currency is an A. So they borrow 100 A's

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,340
and lets say the conversion rate, right now at this point in time,

18
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:03,228
1A = 2B's. So they go into currency markets

19
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:06,711
and they exchange it for every 1A they get 2B's. So

20
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:12,702
they exchange it for 200 B's, and then they go and

21
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:16,742
invest it, they are investing in B's. So they are borrowing

22
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:22,733
in A's and they are investing in B's. And so what would happen?

23
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:26,401
Well, they're going to get 5% on their money in B's, so 5%

24
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:29,977
of 200, they're going to get 10 B's (lets say that's per year)

25
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:36,061
So they're going to get 10 B's in interest every year. And then they can convert that. They

26
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:38,708
can convert those 10 B's, if we assume the exchange rate

27
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:43,631
holds constant, and that is a big assumption. They can convert that to 5A's

28
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:49,854
based on the same exchange rate. So that will be 5 A's,

29
00:01:49,854 --> 00:01:59,067
but they only have to pay 1A in interest, and so they're just going to get 4 A's

30
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:05,411
per year, if we assume constant exchange rate, they're going to get 4 A's

31
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:10,241
a year for free, assuming that they could continue to do this

32
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:12,377
and then they could take those 4 A's and convert them to B's or

33
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:14,745
whatever other currency they want. So you could say

34
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:18,414
they're getting 4 A's for free every year, or they're getting

35
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:22,408
8 B's per year every year. And this little process, this

36
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,634
trade, this little perceived arbitrage thats going on right over here, this is

37
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:32,300
called the carry trade. You might think, where would

38
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,711
this break down? Well the main area where this would break down is while

39
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:42,377
you were borrowing in A, then investing in B, if A's currency

40
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:48,043
appreciates, especially relative to B's currency, because

41
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:51,061
then what happens, even though you have this interest rate

42
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:52,733
discrepancy and even though you feel like your getting 10 B's,

43
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:56,634
those 10 B's are going to give you fewer and fewer A's

44
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,235
if A keeps appreciating. Or another way to think about it is,

45
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:03,229
your going to in terms of B's, even though you think you only owe

46
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:05,736
1% interest A is also going to appreciate, so in terms

47
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:08,987
of B's your going to owe more and more B's every year

48
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:11,077
if A appreciates. Now what's worked out in the carry trade

49
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:14,746
or at least the most famous of the carry trades, where

50
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:17,133
starting in the mid-90's, people started borrowing in

51
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:20,467
Japan because they had low interest and then investing other places,

52
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:24,067
like the US, and especially other places like Iceland,

53
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:26,077
is that the more people do this, so you can imagine, if a

54
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:29,746
lot of people keep doing this and it becomes kind

55
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:32,393
of a big herd effect, what happens? You have a bunch

56
00:03:32,393 --> 00:03:36,387
of people borrowing in A and then converting it to B. So they're taking this

57
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:39,916
currency and converting it to the magenta currency. And if that

58
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:43,399
happens, then you actually have the opposite

59
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,907
effect. Then you have a benefit on top of the interest rate

60
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:48,415
discrepecy because that means the demand for B's

61
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:52,409
currency goes up, and demand for A goes down. And

62
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:55,635
this is essentially what happened, relative to Japan and

63
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,049
a lot of the rest of the world when Japan had its lower interest rates, all the way until really about 2008.
