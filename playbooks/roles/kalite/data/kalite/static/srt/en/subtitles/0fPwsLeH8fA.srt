00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:04,671
Hi, I'm Shana Lindsay.

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,692
I'm Beth Harris.

4
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:12,310
OK, we're here to talk about this image- it's called Untitled Film Still #14.

5
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:15,011
It does look like a film still!

6
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:17,132
It does.

7
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:21,637
-And there are certain things that give it that look, which is what she's going for.

8
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:23,360
So it's not really a film still.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,040
Right, exactly- it's the appearance that this is a film still-

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,964
And she did a whole series of film stills- (Right)- photographs that look like film stills.

11
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:39,550
Over a number of years (this is sort of at the beginning of that phase), so this is one of the earlier ones.

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,384
And she wants all of these to look like they might be from some sort of narrative.

13
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:46,535
This is Cindy Sherman herself-

14
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:51,628
Right, that's the thing a lot of people don't recognize- that she's in the photograph herself.

15
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:56,133
She always kind of dresses up, and kind of morphs from one-

16
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:59,006
You know, she can look really different in each one of them.

17
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:02,886
Exactly- she dresses up obviously, makeup helps.

18
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:07,211
In this case, she's probably trying to look like she's in [the] 1960s.

19
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:13,669
And it makes me aware of the conventions of how things look in movies.

20
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:19,216
The sort of rhetoric in that kind of story telling.

21
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:20,507
Exactly, the lighting-

22
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:26,556
The way she moves her head, the look in her eye.

23
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:31,339
Right, and in almost all of these film stills, she looks reactive, she's reacting to something.

24
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:36,508
Which is part of what's giving us this clue, that looking at something that's supposed to be narrative.

25
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:40,830
So she's darting her eyes away, it's hard to say what (people often read it in different ways)

26
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,054
You know, disgust, fear, anxiety.

27
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:50,771
She's never a totally self-possessed person- she's always in relation to something that's somehow outside of our frame of reference.

28
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:54,166
I wonder what that says about being a woman.

29
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:59,915
Exactly, and I think that's sort of the issue she's trying to raise here.

30
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:05,554
That perhaps our sense of self is contingent always on something else.

31
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:09,670
A woman's sense of self [is always contingent on something else]

32
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:14,215
And that being a woman is always in some way a performance.

33
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:22,213
Yes, that's often how these are understood- that she's masquerading, donning these different outfits.

34
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:32,560
And some people see this as kind of liberating, [...] she in some ways dislodges the idea that your identity is fixed.

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,506
And it can be chosen, instead.

36
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:44,472
Exactly, and by masquerading, choosing to act in a certain way, or choosing to make yourself read or understood in a certain way.

37
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:48,721
So some people see her film cells as liberating.

38
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:51,742
For women.

39
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:54,302
Yes, for women in particular.

40
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:58,335
So your identity isn't something that is culturally imposed.

41
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:00,723
But something that's freely chosen.

42
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:07,956
Freely chosen, also what's ironic: in this series, she keeps choosing these ultra feminine roles.

43
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:10,604
And very stereotypical roles.

44
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:14,007
And because they are reacting, they seem slightly fragile.

45
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:22,112
So it plays on both things. But I think she wants to borrow the idiom from film, that was established by people like Alfred Hitchcock-

46
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:25,880
-the blonde, the victim to some degree.

47
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,179
So something about to swoop down on her.

48
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:36,052
But nothing ever does. And also, it's sort of about her practice, about Cindy Sherman's practice,

49
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:39,722
More so certainly than the narrative, which here, does not exist.

50
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:41,678
There is no story.

51
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:45,215
It never developed into a story.

52
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:54,304
The things she's chosen photographically here: the upward focus, you're at a very privileged perspective on this person-

53
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:58,610
-Very close, so you know that this couldn't be a snapshot (or it'd be very hard to get a snapshot like this)

54
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,221
By just angling and positioning the camera, she's edited out anything that looks contemporary.

55
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:10,210
So she's able to put herself in front of these older buildings and have a look (-like it's 20 years earlier)

56
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,846
Right, like all the things a filmmaker was doing.

57
00:04:13,204 --> 99:59:59,999
