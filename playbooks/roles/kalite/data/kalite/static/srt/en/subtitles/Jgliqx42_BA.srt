LEBRON: Some reason Miami can be hot. I'm told the humidity makes it hotter

2
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:06,602
Why is this?

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,999
KHAN: Excellent question LeBron.

4
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:14,105
Let's first think about what people are talking about when they even say "humidity"

5
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:17,833
And there's a couple of ways to think about humidity, but typically when you are the weatherman

6
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,985
or in everyday talk people say "Hey it's really humid out there." or "It's high humidity."

7
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:28,942
They're talking about relative humidity, and it's usually indicated by a percentage

8
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:33,466
Let's just think about what the different percentages of relative humidity mean.

9
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,365
So right over here, we have 0%.

10
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:40,864
So right over here, we have 0% relative humidity.

11
00:00:40,864 --> 00:00:45,821
and over at the extreme other hand, you have 100% relative humidity.

12
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:53,858
at any given point, the air is some place between 0% humidity and 100% relative humidity.

13
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:59,778
at 0% relative humidity is essentially saying that there is no water vapor in the air

14
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:03,942
or non-measurable amount of water vapor in the air.

15
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:10,435
As we go to this molecular view of what it might look like little water droplet maybe on our surface of our skin

16
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:15,869
So just to be clear, these are the skin molecules - not even skin cells, which will be the actual skin molecules.

17
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,015
Let's just simplified them as brown circles.

18
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:25,488
And this right over here - this is the actual water molecules.

19
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:29,461
So these are water molecules

20
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:33,677
And maybe is a drop of sweat, or little water that got dropped on our skin

21
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:37,893
and it is in liquid state

22
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:41,088
you have this hydrogen bond between the molecules that are super strong

23
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:46,513
so allows these molecules to slide pass each other and that's why liquid flows the way it does.

24
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:51,182
And we've already talked about why sweat makes you cooler but warm up you a little bit.

00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:00,751
