2
00:00:05,976 --> 00:00:08,921
Dr. Steven Zucker: We're in Rome--standing near the Tiber

3
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:14,955
looking at an ancient Roman temple--a temple that for a long time was misnamed Fortuna Virilis

4
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:17,274
Dr. Beth Harris: Temple of Manly Fortune

5
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:23,071
--it looks very much like what you expect a classical temple to look like

6
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:31,578
--it is small but it's got fluted columns--ionic capitals

7
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:35,044
Dr. Zucker: Ionic columns derived from the Greek--but this is clearly not a Greek temple

8
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:37,862
Dr. Harris: Right--it's different in important ways

9
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:43,506
Dr. Zucker: So for one thing it's on a raised platform and the platform only has steps in the front

10
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:46,803
--and the Greeks--if you think about the Parthenon for instance

11
00:00:46,803 --> 00:00:49,093
--you would enter from the front or the back

12
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:53,578
--but in terms of actually rising up to the stylobate--you could ascend from any point

13
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:56,388
Dr. Harris: Right and I think about a Greek temple more as something

14
00:00:56,388 --> 00:01:01,993
where the worship took place outside of the temple--there was a statue of the god that would be inside

15
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:06,759
--but it sort of almost like a sculpture in the landscape

16
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:12,761
--and here it is more of a directional emphasis on front--on the porch

17
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:14,778
Dr. Zucker: And it's not just directional--

18
00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:17,885
--but I think the worshiper is actually being directed in a very specific way

19
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:21,504
--so the Romans are in a sense controlling the way you use the building

20
00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:25,367
Dr. Harris: And I think like a Greek temple--only the priest would have gone inside

21
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:29,655
Dr. Zucker: It also Roman in other important ways--not only does it have the single staircase in the front

22
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:33,078
--but the building extends out to the edge almost

23
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:36,893
Dr. Harris: There's larger interior space so that the columns

24
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:41,961
at the sides and back are not freestanding columns--they're attached columns

25
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:46,289
Dr. Harris: Yeah--they're engaged--and that's a sort of particularly Roman thing

26
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:52,637
--the Greeks I don't think would have done that because the Greek used columns actually as structural devices

27
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:57,094
--and here the columns are just purely decorative as you move back

28
00:01:57,094 --> 00:01:59,071
--in order words the wall is doing the supporting

29
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:01,493
--the wall actually doing the work of holding up the roof

30
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:03,690
--so the building is not in great condition

31
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,418
Dr. Harris: It dates from 100 BC--so it's more than 2000 years old

32
00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:10,669
Dr. Zucker: And it's still standing

33
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,790
Dr. Harris: And it's still here surrounded by the modern traffic of the city

34
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:21,526
--and we get a real sense of what an ancient Roman temple looked like from the period of the ancient Roman Republic

35
00:02:21,526 --> 00:02:23,892
Dr. Zucker: It's really beautifully proportioned

36
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:27,422
--there's a wonderful kind of rhythm that's created by the columns as they move back

37
00:02:27,422 --> 00:02:33,124
Dr. Harris: And it's got four columns across the front and two deep for that porch space

38
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:39,172
--and I think a lot of was based on the culture that lived here before

39
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:41,055
Dr. Zucker: The Etruscans?

40
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:44,393
Dr. Harris: Yeah--I think actually that this borrows from ancient Etruscans architecture

41
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:47,672
Dr. Zucker: But I'm seeing lots of Greek influence--I'm seeing dentils

42
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:51,854
--I'm seeing as we mentioned before the ionic columns--the pediment

43
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:57,142
--all of which is really speaking of just how important the Greek president was for the Romans

44
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:59,656
Dr. Harris: It's going back in time--standing here and looking at it

45
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:16,413
