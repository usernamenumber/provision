99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This triangle that we have right over here

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is a right triangle and it's a right triangle because

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it has a 90 degree angle or it has a right angle in it.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we call the longest side of a right triangle

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we call that side, and you can either view it

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as the longest side of a right triangle or the side

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
opposite the 90 degree angle, it is called

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the hypotenuse. It's a very fancy word for a

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
fairly simple idea, just the longest side of a right

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
triangle or the side opposite the 90 degree angle.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's just good to know that because someone might

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
say hypotenuse, and you'll know that they're talking about

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the side opposite the 90 degree angle. Now, what I

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
want to do in this video is prove a relationship, a very famous relationship

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you might see where this is going, a very famous relationship

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. So let's say

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the length of AC, so uppercase A uppercase C, lets call

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that length lowercase a, let's call the length of BC lowercase b
