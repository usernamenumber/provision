1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,370
   

2
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,450
In the first version of the
video of the proof of the

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:10,860
derivative of the natural
log of x, where the first

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,180
time I proved this is
a couple of years ago.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,960
And the very next video I
proved that the derivative

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,640
of e to the x is
equal to e to the x.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,410
I've been charged with some of
making a circular proof, and

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,160
I'm pretty convinced that
my proof wasn't circular.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,660
So what I want to do in this
video, now that I have a little

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,480
bit more space to work with, a
little bit more sophisticated

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,280
tools, I'm going to redo the
proof and I'm going to do these

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,910
in the same video to show you
at no point do I assume this

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,920
before I actually show it.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,330
So let's start with the proof.

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,410
So the first thing I need to do
is prove this thing up here.

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,320
I want to keep track of this.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,730
I don't assume this until
I actually show it.

18
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,370
So let's start with the
proof, the derivative of

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,310
the natural log of x.

20
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,730
So the derivative of the
natural log of x, we can

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,580
just to go to the basic
definition of a derivative.

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,940
It's equal to the limit as
delta x approaches 0 of the

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:15,170
natural log of x plus delta x
minus the natural log of x.

24
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,880
All of that over delta x.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,150
Now we can just use the
property of logarithms.

26
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,100
If I have the log of a minus
the log of b, that's the same

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,900
thing as a log of a over b.

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,800
So let me re-write it that way.

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:36,490
So this is going to be equal
to the limit as delta

30
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,900
x approaches 0.

31
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,900
I could take this 1 over
delta x right here.

32
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:48,370
1 over delta x times the
natural log of x plus delta

33
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,590
x divided by this x.

34
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,810
Just doing the logarithm
properties right there.

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,830
Then I can re-write this --
first of all, when I have this

36
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,160
coefficient in front of a
logarithm I can make

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,480
this the exponent.

38
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,190
And then I can simplify
this in here.

39
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,940
So this is going to be equal to
the limit as delta x approaches

40
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,870
0 of the natural log -- let
me do this in a new color.

41
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,380
Let me do it in a
completely new color.

42
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,660
The natural log of -- the
inside here I'll just

43
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,020
divide everything by x.

44
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,390
So x divided by x is 1.

45
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,600
Then plus delta x over x.

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,310
Then I had this 1 over delta x
sitting out here, and I can

47
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,490
make that the exponent.

48
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,030
That's just an exponent
rule right there, or

49
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,440
a logarithm property.

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,810
1 over delta x.

51
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,100
Now I'm going to make
a substitution.

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,910
Remember, all of this, this was
all just from my definition

53
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,500
of a derivative.

54
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,130
This was all equal to
the derivative of the

55
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,740
natural log of x.

56
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,250
I have still yet to
in any way use this.

57
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,550
And I won't use that until
I actually show it to you.

58
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,600
I've become very defensive
about these claims

59
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,180
of circularity.

60
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,040
They're my fault because that
shows that I wasn't clear

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,950
enough in my earlier versions
of these proofs, so I'll try

62
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,140
to be more clear this time.

63
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,120
So let's see if we can
simplify this into terms

64
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,840
that we recognize.

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,860
Let's make the substitution so
that we can get e in maybe

66
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,790
terms that we recognize.

67
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:26,830
Let's make the substitute delta
x over x is equal to 1 over n.

68
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,490
If we multiply -- this
is the same thing.

69
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,890
This is the equivalent
to substitution.

70
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,910
If we multiply both sides of
this by x, as saying that

71
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,160
delta x is equal to x over n.

72
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,200
These are equivalent
statements.

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,490
I just multiplied both
sides by x here.

74
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:46,480
Now if we take the limit as n
approaches infinity of this

75
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,780
term right here, that's
equivalent -- that's completely

76
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,670
equivalent to taking the limit
as delta x approaches 0.

77
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,680
   

78
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,890
If we're defining delta x to be
this thing, and we take the

79
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,590
limit as its denominator
approaches 0, we're going

80
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,120
to make delta x go to 0.

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,520
So let's make that
substitution.

82
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,810
So all of this is going to be
equal to the limit as -- now

83
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,275
we've gotten rid
of our delta x.

84
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:19,000
We're going to say the limit as
an approaches infinity of the

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,380
natural log -- I'll go back to
that mauve color -- the natural

86
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,900
log of 1 plus -- now, I said
that instead of delta x over x,

87
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,580
I made the substitution that
that is equal to 1 over n.

88
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,010
So that's 1 plus 1 over n.

89
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,860
And then what's 1 over delta x?

90
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,690
Well delta x is equal to x over
n, so 1 over delta x is going

91
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,875
to be the inverse of this.

92
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:47,140
It's going to be n over x.

93
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,700
And then we can re-write this
expression right here --

94
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,670
let me re-write it again.

95
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:58,600
This is equal to the limit as
n approaches infinity of the

96
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,730
natural log of 1 plus 1 over n.

97
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,610
What I can do is I can separate
out this n from the 1 over x.

98
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,130
I could say this is to
the n, and then all of

99
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,200
this to the 1 over x.

100
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,730
Once again, this is just
an exponent property.

101
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,290
If I raise something to the n
and then to the 1 over x, I

102
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,110
could just multiply
the exponent to get

103
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,660
to the n over x.

104
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,660
So these two statements
are equivalent.

105
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,720
But now we can use logarithm
properties to say hey, if this

106
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,730
is the exponent, I can just
stick it out in front of the

107
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,100
coefficient right here.

108
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,300
I could put it out right there.

109
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,830
And just remember, this was all
of the derivative with respect

110
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,710
to x of the natural log of x.

111
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,680
So what is that equal to?

112
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,340
We could put this 1 out
of x in the front here.

113
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,040
In fact, that 1 out of x term,
it has nothing to do with n.

114
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,550
It's kind of a constant
term when you think

115
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,290
of it in terms of n.

116
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,000
So we can actually put it
all the way out here.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,060
We could put it either place.

118
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,490
So we could say 1 over x times
all that stuff in mauve.

119
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:03,400
The limit as n approaches
infinity of the natural log

120
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,680
of 1 plus 1 over n to the n.

121
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,560
The natural log of
all of that stuff.

122
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,670
Or, just to make the point
clear, we can re-write this

123
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,550
part -- let me make a salmon
color -- equal to 1 over x

124
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:27,420
times the natural log of the
limit as n approaches infinity.

125
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,015
I'm just switching places here,
because obviously what we care

126
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,830
is what happens to this term as
it approaches infinity, of

127
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,550
1 plus 1 over n to the n.

128
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,910
Well what is -- this should
look a little familiar to you

129
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,760
on some of the first videos
where we talked about e -- this

130
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,020
is one of the definitions of e.

131
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,030
e is defined.

132
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,880
I'm just being clear here.

133
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,650
I'm still not using
this at all.

134
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,020
I'm just stating that the
definition of e, e is equal

135
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,760
to the limit as n approaches
infinity of 1 plus

136
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,750
1 over n to the n.

137
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,490
This is just the
definition of e.

138
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,330
And natural log is defined
to be the logarithm

139
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,670
of base, this thing.

140
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,890
So this thing is e.

141
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,510
So I'm saying that the
derivative of the natural log

142
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,680
of x is equal to 1 over x
times the natural log.

143
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,860
This thing right here is e.

144
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,050
That's what the
definition of e is.

145
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm not using the definition
of the derivative e, or

146
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,360
the definition of the
derivative of e to the x.

147
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,450
I'm just using the
definition of e.

148
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,120
And the definition of
natural log is log base e.

149
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,370
This says the power that you
have to raise e to to get to e,

150
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,870
well this is just equal to 1.

151
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,620
There we get that the
derivative of the natural log

152
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,400
of x is equal to 1 over x.

153
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,110
So, so far I think you'll be
satisfied that we've proven

154
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,450
this first statement up here,
and in no way did we use

155
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,020
this statement right here.

156
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,540
I just used the definition
of e, but that's fine.

157
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,420
I mean we assumed we know the
definition of e, even when we

158
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,070
just talk about natural log,
we assume that it's base e.

159
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,820
In no way did I assume
this to begin with.

160
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,760
Now, given that we've shown
this and we didn't assume

161
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,750
this at all, let's see
if we can show this.

162
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,270
So the derivative -- let's do a
little bit of an exercise here.

163
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,610
   

164
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,170
Actually, I could probably
do it in the margins.

165
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,220
Let's take the derivative
of this function.

166
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,246
The natural log of e to the x.

167
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:40,250
   

168
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,140
So there's two ways we
can approach this.

169
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,210
The first way we could simplify
this and we could say this is

170
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,520
the exact same thing
as the derivative.

171
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,740
We could put this x out
front of x times the

172
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,820
natural log of e.

173
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,910
And what's the
natural log of e?

174
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,460
The natural log of e we
already know is equal to 1.

175
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,930
So this is just the
derivative of x.

176
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,030
And the derivative
of x is equal to 1.

177
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,190
So that's pretty
straightforward.

178
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,540
The derivative, in no way did
we assume this to begin with.

179
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,140
We just simplified this
expression to just this is the

180
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,260
same thing as the derivative
of x, because this

181
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,660
term cancels out.

182
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,600
And the derivative
of x is just 1.

183
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,210
Or we could do it
the other way.

184
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,380
We could do the chain rule.

185
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,640
We could say that this could be
viewed as the derivative of

186
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,960
this inner function, of this
inner expression, so the

187
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,180
derivative of the inner
expression, I don't

188
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,970
know what that is.

189
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,660
I'm not assuming
anything about it.

190
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,720
I just don't know what it is.

191
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,410
So I'll write it in
yellow right here.

192
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,650
So it's equal to the
derivative with respect

193
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,080
to x of e to the x.

194
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
I don't know what this is.

195
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,350
I have no clue what this
is, and I haven't assumed

196
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,430
anything about what it is.

197
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,150
I'm just using the chain rule.

198
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,070
If the derivative of this
inside function with respect to

199
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,920
x, which is this right here,
times the derivative of this

200
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,410
outside function with respect
to the inside function.

201
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,080
So the derivative of natural
log of x with respect

202
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,730
to x is 1 over x.

203
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,160
So the derivative of natural
log of anything with

204
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,310
respect to anything is
1 over that anything.

205
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,710
So it's going to be equal to --
so the derivative of natural

206
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,850
log of x with respect to e to
the x is equal to 1

207
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,190
over e to the x.

208
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,860
Once again, I in no way
assumed this right here.

209
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,920
So far in anything we've done,
we haven't assumed that.

210
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,580
But clearly, my derivatives,
either way I solve it -- one

211
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,210
way I solve it I got 1.

212
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,650
The other way, I kind
of didn't solve it.

213
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,030
I got this expression
right here.

214
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,226
They must be equal
to each other.

215
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:40,760
So let me write that down.

216
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,330
This must be equal to that.

217
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,260
It's just we just looked at it
two different ways and got

218
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,620
two different results.

219
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,340
But I still don't know
what this thing is.

220
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,400
I just left it kind of open.

221
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,010
I just said whatever
the derivative of e to

222
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,700
the x happens to be.

223
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,480
But we know, since these two
expressions are equal, we know

224
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,150
that the derivative with
respect to x of whatever e to

225
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,635
the x -- so whatever the
derivative with respect to x of

226
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:07,140
e to the x happens to be, we
know that when we multiply that

227
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,340
times 1 over e to the x --
that's when we just did the

228
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,960
chain rule -- that we should
get the same result as when we

229
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,930
approached the problem
the other way.

230
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,840
That should be equal to this
approach because they're both

231
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,070
different ways of looking
at the derivative of the

232
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,530
natural log of e to the x.

233
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,990
So that should be equal to 1.

234
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,090
Well, we're almost there.

235
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,650
We could just simplify this
and solve for our mystery

236
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,250
derivative of e to the x.

237
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,520
Multiply both sides of this
equation by e to the x, and you

238
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,890
get the derivative with respect
to x of e to the x is

239
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,630
equal to e to the x.

240
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,790
And I want to clarify this.

241
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,650
At no point in this entire
proof, at no point

242
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,300
did I assume this.

243
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,090
In fact, this is the
first time that I'm even

244
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,880
making the statement.

245
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,080
I didn't have to assume this
when I showed you that the

246
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,850
derivative of the natural
log of x is 1 over x.

247
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,580
And I didn't have to assume
this to kind of get to it.

248
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,320
So in no way is this
proof circular.

249
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,520
So anyway, I didn't want to
appear defensive, but I

250
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,080
wanted to clarify this up.

251
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Because I don't want to in any
way blame those who think that

252
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,910
my original proof was circular.

253
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,370
It's my fault because I
didn't explain it properly.

254
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,580
So hopefully this should
provide a little bit of

255
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,910
clarity on the issue.

256
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,077
