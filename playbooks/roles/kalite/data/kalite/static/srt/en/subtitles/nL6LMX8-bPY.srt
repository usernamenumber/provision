I've talked a lot about precision and the inclinations I have not told you "why" this is happening...I am not going to go into the physics of it. That is a little bit

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
beyond the discussion over here...but its a byproduct of the earth and sun's interactions with the Earth

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And with the fact that the earth is not a perfect sphere... So this is my little drawing of Earth. And let me put() the pole

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in here...North pole && South pole...It actually turns out that Earth...is fat'r than it is taller. So

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you where to measure Earth's diameter along the equator, it's diameter along the equator -> it is

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
43 kilometers (approximately 27 miles) longer. than if ( you were to measure it's diamter from Pole ->

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to pole. and the fact that Earth has the "equatorial bulge" it's not a perfect sphere...Once again I

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will not go into the math here...;)

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1/8 symmetric (sorry) of the Earth...that interaction between the Earth the pull() of that causes these

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
long term cycles...this this this actual precision...I* guess are less ...and as we will see in the next

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
video, these arent the only types of changes we have...the elipse...Earth's orbit actual rotates over

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
time...two interactions with earth's orbit...and once again...it's one of those things that happens over

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thousands and thousands of years...So all of these changes More fat than it is tall those interactions

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
between the gravity of the Earth of the Moon && Earth's orbit as a whole changes because of interactions
