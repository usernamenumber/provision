1
00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:02,902
Before we talk about the debt ceiling,

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:06,060
it is important to realize the difference between

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,635
the deficit and the debt,

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:12,446
because these words are thrown around

5
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,047
and it‘s clear that they're related,

6
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,528
but sometimes people might confuse one for the other.

7
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:19,856
The deficit is how much you overspend in a given year,

8
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:23,174
while the debt is the total amount, the cumulative

9
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:26,865
amount of the debt you've gotten over many, many years.

10
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:29,130
So, lets take a look at a simplified example.

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,533
Let's say you have some type of a country,

12
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:35,891
and that country spends in a given year $10,

13
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:38,138
that country spends $10.

14
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:41,892
but it’s only bringing in $6 in tax revenue.

15
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,309
So it's only bringing in $6

16
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:49,018
So this country, in this year where it spends $10

17
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:50,965
Even though it only has $6 to spend,

18
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:56,773
it has a $4 deficit.

19
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:59,724
$4, d-e-f is short for deficit

20
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:01,528
Well let me just write it out,

21
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,060
you might think it stands for defense, or something,

22
00:01:03,184 --> 00:01:05,009
it has a $4 deficit

23
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:06,990
and you might say

24
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:09,126
how does it spend more money than it brings in?

25
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:11,308
how can it actually continue to spend this much?

26
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:13,282
where will it actually get the $4 from?

27
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:17,392
the answer is it will borrow that $4.

28
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:20,643
Our little country will borrow it.

29
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:22,129
Maybe coming into this year,

30
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:23,602
the country had some debt,

31
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:26,576
maybe it already had $100 of debt;

32
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:28,352
In this situation,

33
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:31,324
it would have to borrow another $4 of debt

34
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,414
So, exiting this year,

35
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:35,968
it would have $104 in debt.

36
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:38,389
It would have $104 in debt.

37
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,271
If the country runs the same $4 deficit

38
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:42,655
the year after this,

39
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:45,024
then the debt will increase to $108.

40
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:46,463
If it runs another $4,

41
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:50,736
then the deficit will increase to $112.

42
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:51,967
Now that we have that out of the way,

43
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:55,194
lets think about what the "debt ceiling" is.

44
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:56,680
So you can imagine the United States

45
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,583
is continuing to run a deficit-

46
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,947
it‘s continuing to spend more than it brings in-

47
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,587
and actually for the United States

48
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,388
these ratios are appropriate,

49
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:08,592
for every dollar that the United States spends

50
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:13,956
40% is borrowed,

51
00:02:13,956 --> 00:02:16,390
it only has 60% of every dollar it needs

52
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:18,461
to spend right now,

53
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:20,249
so it needs to go out into the debt market

54
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:24,846
and borrow 40% to keep spending at its current rate

55
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,332
so if it’s continuing to borrow,

56
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:27,586
you can imagine that

57
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:32,021
the debt keeps on increasing.

58
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,623
So let me draw a little graph here

59
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:35,597
So that axis is time

60
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:37,803
this axis right over here is

61
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:42,354
the total cumulative amount of debt that we have.

62
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:44,374
We continue to have to borrow every 40%

63
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:45,953
of every dollar that we're spending.

64
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:47,927
So our debt is continuing to increase

65
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:51,642
So our debt is continuing to increase.

66
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:53,383
And Congress has the power,

67
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:55,705
Congress has the authority

68
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:59,165
to essentially limit how much debt we have.

69
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:01,023
So right now, we have a current debt limit

70
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:08,639
of 14.3 trillion

71
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,216
and even though Congress has this authority,

72
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:13,051
the way that it‘s worked in the past

73
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:15,081
is its kind of just a rubber stamp;

74
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:17,015
Congress has just always allowed the debt ceiling

75
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:19,569
to go up and up to fund our borrowing costs;

76
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,685
and if you think about it,

77
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:22,269
that kind of makes sense,

78
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,127
because right now Congress is the one that decides

79
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:25,919
where to spend the money

80
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,051
what are the obligations?

81
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:30,043
So the debt ceiling is like, okay so, we've already agreed

82
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,268
what you spend your money on

83
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:32,813
Congress has to determine

84
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,606
Congress figures out

85
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:38,616
what we spend our money on and what our taxes are

86
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:41,770
we've already determined how much you have to borrow,

87
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,731
it would seem kind of ridiculous for us

88
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:45,310
after we've decided what you need to borrow,

89
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,998
to say that you cannot borrow it

90
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:49,200
you cannot actually do what we've told you to do

91
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,654
and so, historically,

92
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:52,829
Congress has just kind of gone on with the flow

93
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,359
Okay, yeah, we've told you

94
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,566
you need to borrow more money

95
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:58,588
to execute, the executive branch

96
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,930
has to run the government

97
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,463
based on the budget we've told you

98
00:04:02,463 --> 00:04:04,344
so they just keep upping it

99
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,224
so last time the debt ceiling was raised

100
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:07,339
which was actually very recently,

101
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,777
February 12, 2010,

102
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:14,158
it was raised from 12.3 trillion to

103
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,213
actually 12.4 trillion to,

104
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:17,706
to the 14.3 trillion

105
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:18,554
this actually happens pretty regularly

106
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:20,577
it’s happened ten times since 2001

107
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:24,870
seventy-four times since 1962

108
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,471
it‘s just a regular operating thing

109
00:04:27,471 --> 00:04:30,327
Right now, the Obama administration says

110
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:32,056
look we've actually already come up

111
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:33,670
against our debt ceiling

112
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,855
and we want to raise it,

113
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:36,201
and ideally the

114
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:37,525
Obama administration wants to raise it

115
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,072
by about 2.4 trillion

116
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:42,866
so they want to raise it to 16.7 trillion

117
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,398
which will kind of put it off the table a little bit

118
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:45,675
until after the elections,

119
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:48,554
so we don't have to debate this anymore.

120
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,341
The Republicans on the other hand

121
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,246
want to essentially

122
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:55,010
use this, this is a little bit unusual, use this

123
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,259
as leverage to essentially, reduce the deficit

124
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:00,977
and not only to reduce the deficit

125
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:05,667
but reduce the deficit through spending cuts

126
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:06,759
and so thats why it’s become

127
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,500
this big game of chicken and why we're

128
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,706
going up against this limit

129
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:12,796
and one thing you might not have realized

130
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:17,719
we already hit that debt limit

131
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:21,759
on May 16, 2011,

132
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,847
I'm making this video at the end of July 2011

133
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:26,751
and the only reason this country

134
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:28,655
is continuing to operate

135
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:30,304
has been able to continue

136
00:05:30,304 --> 00:05:33,555
to pay interest to its obligations

137
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:36,782
to issue social security checks,

138
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,617
to support Medicare

139
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:40,776
and buy fuel for aircraft carriers,

140
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:42,355
and all the rest is because

141
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,816
Geithner, the security treasurer

142
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:46,906
has been able to find cash in other places

143
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:48,323
cash normally set aside

144
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:50,018
for employee pensions and

145
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:50,877
all the rest and

146
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:53,593
has essentially done a little bookkeeping

147
00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:54,894
taking money from one place to

148
00:05:54,894 --> 00:05:56,867
feed another, but what he's said,

149
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:58,772
what he's publicly said,

150
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:01,813
is that he won't be able to do that anymore

151
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:05,900
as of August 2, 2011;

152
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,312
so this right here is the date that everyone is paying attention to,

153
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:12,703
August 2, 2011, according to Geithner

154
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:15,188
at that point, he won't be able to find

155
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:18,067
random pockets of cash and shuffle around and

156
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,598
what he calls extraordinary measures

157
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:22,293
and at that point the United States

158
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:23,988
will not be able to fulfill

159
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:25,800
all of its obligations

160
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,216
and so if you think about all of the

161
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:29,468
obligations of the United States-

162
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:32,487
This is a huge oversimplification here.

163
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:36,063
So this bar is all of the obligations

164
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,314
Some of those obligations are things like

165
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:40,650
things like

166
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,889
interest on the debt it already owes

167
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,814
a huge amount of debt 14.3 trillion dollars

168
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:47,673
things like Social Security,

169
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:52,108
Medicare,

170
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:55,103
defense,

171
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:56,845
and then all of the other stuff

172
00:06:56,845 --> 00:07:00,537
that the country has to support,

173
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:02,580
all of the obligations

174
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,063
so as of August 2, 2011,

175
00:07:06,063 --> 00:07:07,990
we cannot issue any more debt

176
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,917
and Geithner cannot,

177
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:11,078
doesn't have any more cash around

178
00:07:11,078 --> 00:07:12,982
doing these extraordinary measures.

179
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:18,509
The only option is to somehow

180
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:21,040
reduce some of these things by 40%

181
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,105
because 40% of every dollar we used to spend

182
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:27,658
are borrowed so something

183
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:29,329
over here is going to give

184
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:31,558
we're not going to fulfill our obligations

185
00:07:31,558 --> 00:07:34,159
to one or more of these things.

186
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,342
All of these things which we are legally obligated

187
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:38,505
to fulfill that Congress has said,

188
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:40,037
all these things that Congress

189
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:41,125
has said we should be spending this money on

190
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,399
and so at that point it is perceived

191
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,559
that we would have to default

192
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,723
and a default would be on any of these obligations,

193
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:50,715
but in particular,

194
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:52,480
we could, especially if we have to

195
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,734
cut everything by 40% and we don't

196
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:55,498
want to see retirees, you know

197
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:57,960
not being able to pay interest on their houses

198
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,585
or you know, aircraft carriers being able to have fuel

199
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:00,560
or whatever else

200
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,580
we might defer, or restructure

201
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,554
or do something weird with our debt

202
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:07,549
in which case we would be defaulting

203
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:08,478
and i want to be clear

204
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,847
a default is usually referred to as

205
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:13,099
not fully paying interest on debt that you owe

206
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:16,048
but it would be any of these obligations

207
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:17,952
the United States has this AAA rating

208
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:18,997
If the United States says

209
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:19,949
it‘s going to give you a Social Security check-

210
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:20,808
you trust that.

211
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,224
If the United States says

212
00:08:22,224 --> 00:08:23,827
it’s going to pay that Medicare payment-

213
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:25,057
you trust that.

214
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:26,636
If it says it‘s going to give you an interest payment-

215
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:27,983
you trust that.

216
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,885
If it doesn't fulfill any of these obligations,

217
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,625
then all of the obligations become suspect

218
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,737
and the reason why this is a big deal

219
00:08:36,737 --> 00:08:37,991
is you can imagine

220
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:39,988
if you borrow money,

221
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:41,311
and you've always been good

222
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:43,842
at paying back that money,

223
00:08:43,842 --> 00:08:45,653
you're going to have to

224
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:46,791
pay lower interest

225
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,463
than other people would have to pay

226
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:49,972
but if for whatever reason,

227
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:51,923
one day you default

228
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:53,014
you either delay your payments,

229
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:53,641
or you say you don't

230
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:55,081
have the cash to pay your payments

231
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:55,870
Then, people are like, wow

232
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,677
you're a much riskier person to lend money to

233
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:01,977
so now I'm going to increase

234
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:03,649
the interest rates on you.

235
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:04,996
The perception is that if the United States

236
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:07,132
were to default on its debt,

237
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,850
or any of its obligations,

238
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,751
that interest rates would go up

239
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:13,935
and the reason why

240
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:15,955
(this would really kind of not be great)

241
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,697
is because it would make the debt

242
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:18,997
and the deficit even worse

243
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:21,157
and then this chunk is going to have to grow

244
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:24,802
and as new debt gets issued,

245
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:26,613
we're going to have to pay

246
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:27,751
more and more interest and

247
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:29,214
thats going to make matters worse.

248
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:30,746
It’s going to make the deficit worse,

249
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:31,745
and on top of that,

250
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:33,417
it‘s not just that the government

251
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:34,856
debt will go up,

252
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:37,202
but interest on all debts will

253
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,361
probably go up,

254
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,335
because government debt is perceived to be

255
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:42,147
the safest,

256
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:43,378
it’s the benchmark,

257
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:44,586
a lot of other contracts are

258
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:46,466
actually tied to government debt

259
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:47,581
so you'll have interest rates

260
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:49,299
throughout the economy go up

261
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,180
which is exactly what we do not want

262
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,340
to happen when you are in a recession

263
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,405
or when you are recovering from a recession.
