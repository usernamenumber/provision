1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,670
The volume of a box is
405 cube units, or

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,420
I guess cubic units.

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,860
So they just want to
keep it general.

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,850
It could've been in cubic feet,
or cubic meters, or

6
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,310
cubic centimeters,
or cubic miles.

7
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,790
Who knows?

8
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,640
They just want to keep
it as units, keep it

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,460
as general as possible.

10
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,010
The length is x units, the width
is x plus 4 units, and

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,320
the height is 9 units.

12
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,840
So let me draw this box here.

13
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,440
   

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,340
Let me draw a little box here,
so we have a nice little

15
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,670
visualization.

16
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,570
So they tell us, that
the length is x.

17
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,360
Maybe we could call this
the length right there.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,060
They say the width is x
plus 4, and the height

19
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,420
is 9 of this box.

20
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,580
In units, what are the
dimensions of the box?

21
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,400
Well, they also tell us that
the volume is 405.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,760
So the volume, 405-- let
me do it this way.

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,340
So if we wanted to calculate the
volume, what would it be?

24
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,739
Well it would be the width-- it
would be x plus 4 times the

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,510
length -- times x-- times 9.

26
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,360
   

27
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,010
That's, literally, the
volume of the box.

28
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,880
Now they also tell us that the
volume of the box is 405 cubic

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,300
units, is equal to 405.

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,930
So now we just solve for x.

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,630
So what do we get here?

32
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,610
If we distribute this x
into this x plus 4.

33
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,190
Actually, if we distribute
a 9x.

34
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,300
Let me just rewrite it.

35
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,890
This is the same thing
as 9x times x plus

36
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,320
4 is equal to 405.

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,970
9x times x is equal
to 9x squared.

38
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:47,110
9x times 4 is equal to
36x, is equal to 405.

39
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,420
Now we want our quadratic
expression to be equal to 0.

40
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:58,260
So let's subtract 405 from both
sides of this equation.

41
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,010
So when you do that, your
right-hand side equals 0, and

42
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:11,520
your left-hand side is 9x
squared plus 36x minus 405.

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,860
Now, is there any common
factor to these

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,310
numbers right here?

45
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,860
Well 405, 4 plus 0 plus 5 is 9,
so that is divisible by 9.

46
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,060
So all of these are
divisible by 9.

47
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,990
Let's just figure out what
405 divided by 9 is.

48
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,700
So 9 goes into 405-- 9
goes into 40 4 times.

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,200
4 times 9 is 36.

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,940
Subtract you get 45.

51
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,380
9 goes into 45 5 times.

52
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,880
5 times 9 is 45.

53
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,960
Subtract, you get 0.

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,880
So it goes 45 times.

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,090
So if we factor out a 9 here,
we get 9 times x squared--

56
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,410
actually even better, you
don't even have to

57
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,355
factor out of 9.

58
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:56,990
If you think about it, you can
divide both sides of this

59
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,460
equation by 9.

60
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,640
So if you can divide all of
the terms by 9, it won't

61
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,060
change the equation.

62
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,465
You're doing the same thing to
both sides of equations, which

63
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:10,020
we've learned long ago is a
very valid thing to do.

64
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,150
So here you get x squared-- if
you just had this expression,

65
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,600
here, and someone told you to
factor it, then you'd have to

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,710
factor out the 9.

67
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,120
But because this is an equation,
it equals 0, let's

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,200
just divide everything by 9.

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,610
It'll simplify things.

70
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:30,730
So you get x squared plus 4x
minus 45 is equal to 0.

71
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,560
And now we can try to factor
this right here.

72
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,740
And this fits the pattern, where
we don't have a leading

73
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,540
1 out here.

74
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,500
So we don't even have to
do it by grouping.

75
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,860
You just have to think, what 2
numbers, when I take their

76
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,870
product I get negative 45, and
when I take their sum, I get

77
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,960
positive 4.

78
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,830
They are 4 apart.

79
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,750
1 has to be positive, 1
has to be negative.

80
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,650
Their positive versions
have to be 4 apart.

81
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,430
Because when you take the sum,
you are really taking their

82
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,950
difference because 1 of
them is negative.

83
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,330
So let's think about it.

84
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,800
When you have positive
9 and negative 5, I

85
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,550
think that'll work.

86
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:01,880
Right?

87
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,520
Positive 9 plus negative
5 is 4.

88
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,280
And when you take the product,
you get negative 45.

89
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,240
So you have x plus 9 times
x minus 5 is equal to 0.

90
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,560
Just factored it out.

91
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,630
And we've seen this before.

92
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,000
If you have 2 numbers, when you
take their product that

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
equals 0, that means 1 of these
numbers at least has to

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,960
be equal 0.

95
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,180
So this means that x plus
9 is equal to 0.

96
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,590
Scroll down a little bit.

97
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,900
x plus 9 is equal 0, or
x minus 5 is equal 0.

98
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,105
So if we subtract 9 from this
equation right there, you get

99
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:45,500
x is equal to negative 9, or if
you add 5 to both sides of

100
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,900
this equation, here.

101
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,820
You get x is equal to 5.

102
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,820
So these are both possible
values of x right here.

103
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,950
So the box, if you take x is
equal to negative 9, well, x

104
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,530
equal to negative
9 won't work.

105
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,650
Because if you but negative 9
here, you're going to have a

106
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,160
box that has a width of negative
5, a length of

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,810
negative 9, and a height of 9.

108
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,930
And if we're talking about our
reality, we don't have

109
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,200
negative distances like this.

110
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,850
That can't be the length
or the width.

111
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,190
So x equals negative 9 isn't
appropriate for this problem

112
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,340
Because in this problem we
need to have positive

113
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,340
dimensions.

114
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,525
So let's see what happens
with x equals 5.

115
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:29,460
If x equals 5, x plus 4 is 9,
and this dimension right here

116
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,290
is going to be 5.

117
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,530
And that seems pretty reasonable
for our reality.

118
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,620
And let's verify that
this does end up

119
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,070
with a volume of 405.

120
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,630
9 times 5 is 45 times
9 is indeed 405.

121
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:51,810
We just figured that out over
here, that 45 times 9 is 405.

122
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,350
So we're done.

123
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,866
