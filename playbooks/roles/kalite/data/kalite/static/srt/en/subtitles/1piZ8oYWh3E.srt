1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
add the two equations.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we multiply this bottom
equation by negative 1 we get

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus x minus 2y is
equal to minus 10.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the whole reason why I'm
doing that is I know when I

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
add these two left-hand sides,
the x and the minus x are

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to cancel out.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then I can just
solve for y.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's why you immediately see,
they have an x and an x.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we subtract this from that,
they'll cancel out.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we add these two
equations, the x' cancel out.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
3y minus 2y is equal to y.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And 7 minus 10 is equal
to minus 3.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Fair enough.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And now we can substitute back
in to figure out an x.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's use the
first equation.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x plus 3 times minus 3-- we
figured out what y is-- is

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to 7.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then you get x.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
3 times-- minus 9
is equal to 7.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x is equal to-- add 9 to both
sides of this equation.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x is equal to 16.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the solution is 16 comma
minus 3. x and y.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that is choice D.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All right, problem 37.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Marcy has a total of 100
dimes and quarters.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If the total value of the coins
is $14.05, how many

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
quarters does she have?

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All right, so let's say that d
is a number of dimes and q is

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the number of quarters.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you take the number of
dimes plus the number of

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
quarters she has 100 coins.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's this piece of information
right there.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then the total value
of the coins.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's going to be 0.10 times the
number of dimes plus 0.25

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times the number of quarters.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they tell us that that
is equal to $14.05.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's this piece
of information.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The total value of the
coins is $14.05.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're on problem 33 and it asks, which equation

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they say, well, how many
quarters does she have?

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we just have to
solve for q.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
represents a line that is parallel to y is equal to

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's do that.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus 5/4 x plus 2?

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we want to cancel out the
d's, what we could do is

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can multiply this
top equation by

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So a line that's parallel will have the same slope.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's say, minus 0.1.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'm doing that so
it cancels out with

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we can just look at this, we could inspect this and say,

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this d right here.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me do it in a
different color.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, the slope of this line is the coefficient on the x term.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if I multiply that top
equation times minus 0.1 I get

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So slope on this line is right there.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus 0.1d-- I could write
1-0 if I want-- d.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Minus 0.10q is equal to-- what's
minus 1/10 of 100?

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because the slope is equal to minus 5/4.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well that's minus 10, right?

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
100 times 0.1 is 10 and we're
doing a minus 0.1.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so we just have to look at the other choices and say,

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All right, now we can add
these two equations.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
0.1d minus 0.1d, those
cancel out.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which one has the same slope of minus 5/4?

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
0.25q minus 0.1q, that's equal
to-- let me switch colors.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And choice A actually is, choice A is y is equal to

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's equal to 0.15q
is equal to-- and

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what's 14.05 minus 10?

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus 5/4 x plus 1.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's equal to $4.05.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Just to get rid of the decimals,
we can multiply both

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it has the exact same slope and it's just

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sides of this equation by 100.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
shifted down by 1.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we'll get 15q is
equal to 405.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So q.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So A is our choice.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We divide both sides
of this by 15.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so how many times
does 15 go into 405?

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now problem 34.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
15 goes into 40, what?

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me copy and paste
this one.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Two times.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2 times 15 is 30.

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's see, I can paste it.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Get a 10.

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
105.

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All right, and they ask us,
which graph represents the

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
15 goes into 105 seven
times I think.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
solution to this system
of inequalities?

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
7 times 5 is 35.

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
7 times 1 is 7.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, so we could take each of
these inequalities and then,

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Plus 3 is 10.

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
27.

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what we want to do is we want
the area that satisfies both

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So q is equal to 27.

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So Marcy has 27 quarters.

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of these inequalities.

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's take a look
at the first one.

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I like to always have it
in kind of y is equal to mx

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus b form.

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's do that.

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the first one says 2x
is greater than or

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to y minus 1.

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we add 1 to both sides, we
get 2x plus 1 is greater than

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or equal to y.

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if we just want to write
that in a way that we're used

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to seeing it, y-- I'm just
switching it around.

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
y is less than or equal
to 2x plus 1.

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see which one
this represents.

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have a line, 2x plus 1, so
the y-intercept is 1 and the

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
slope is 2.

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see.

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's this line here.

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
y-intercept 1 and if
we go over to the

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right 2, we go up 4.

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
However much we increase
in x, we increase twice

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as much with y.

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's what the slope
tells us.

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's this line in
this chart like that.

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Fair enough.

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's that line.

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they're saying y
is less than that.

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we want the area
below that graph.

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's not this one.

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This one they're shading in
the area above that line.

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For any x and y that's on the
line, they're shading in y is

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
greater than that point.

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
No, but we what y is less
than that point.

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For any y on the point,
all the y's less

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
than it satisfy it.

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So based on the information now,
this one seems to be a

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pretty good candidate.

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I haven't looked at the
other line yet.

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And frankly, neither of--
I guess, no neither.

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe this one might be a
candidate because this

139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is also less than.

140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe we have to be less than
both of these lines, right?

141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the line that
we just figured out.

142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're definitely less than it.

143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe we have to be less than
that second line as well.

144
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we have to be greater
than that second line, we

145
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
haven't looked at that yet.

146
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's going to be choice C.

147
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we have to be less than the
second line and this first

148
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
line, then we're going
to be in choice D.

149
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's see what the second piece
of information tells us.

150
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, well they actually have a
typo and they don't give us

151
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
enough information
to actually-- let

152
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
me look up the answer.

153
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because they didn't even write
a greater than or equal or

154
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
nothing here.

155
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I have to see what they
probably intended.

156
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, so I just looked up the
answer and they said that the

157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
answer is C.

158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they must want us to be
greater than this second line.

159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's figure out what
this should have been.

160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What should have this-- should
there have been an equals?

161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, definitely not
an equal sign.

162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But should there have been
a greater than or

163
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
less than or whatever?

164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll figure that out.

165
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see.

166
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2x minus 5y circle 10.

167
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We don't know if there's an
equal there or less-- this is

168
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
almost a better exercise than
what they intended.

169
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's see.

170
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we were to add 5y to both
sides, I just want to get y on

171
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the other side.

172
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I don't want to have
to say flip signs and

173
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
divide by minus 5.

174
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me get 5y on
the other side.

175
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I'll add 5y to both sides.

176
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we get 2x.

177
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Whatever inequality sign,
so that could

178
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
be an equal or whatever.

179
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
10 plus 5y.

180
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Subtract 10 from both sides.

181
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you get 2x minus
10 circle 5y.

182
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Remember that circle could
be an equal sign.

183
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, it's not an equal.

184
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's either a greater than
or equal or it's a

185
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
less than or equal.

186
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we can divide both
sides by 5 and you get 2

187
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
divided by 5 x minus 2, some
greater than or equal or less

188
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
than or equal sign, y.

189
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now they told us C was the
answer because I had to look

190
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it up because they didn't give
us any inequality sign there.

191
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If C is the answer that means
we're going to-- we want all

192
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
y's that are below
the first line.

193
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So below this line right here.

194
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's that area.

195
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if we're in this grey area,
all y's that are above

196
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this bottom line.

197
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we're above this bottom
line, this bottom line

198
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is 2/5 x minus 2.

199
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we want all y's that
are greater than that.

200
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sorry, I've done it-- we want
all the y's that are greater

201
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
than that. y is greater
than this thing.

202
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that sign in this
problem should have

203
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
been a less than sign.

204
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm saying y is greater
than this.

205
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But if you read it left to
right, you have 2x minus 2 is

206
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
less than y.

207
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so we figured
out the sign.

208
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you might be saying,
hey, wait.

209
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How come this area over
here doesn't work?

210
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well if you think about
it, this area is

211
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
above our first line.

212
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This area is y is greater
than 2x plus 1.

213
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's above our first line.

214
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it's actually below
our second line.

215
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's actually the
opposite area.

216
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyway, next problem.

217
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The answer was C.

218
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Next problem, 35.

219
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, let's see.

220
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll copy and paste this one.

221
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think the choices
are interesting.

222
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the solution to this
system of equations?

223
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All right, so let's see if we
can get in a form that makes

224
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it easy to look at.

225
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's take that first
equation and let's

226
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
add 3x to both sides.

227
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you add 3x to both sides,
that first equation becomes

228
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
positive 3x plus y is
equal to minus 2.

229
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All I did is I did plus 3--
you can't see that.

230
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I added plus 3x to both sides
of this equation.

231
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And of course, that
cancels with that.

232
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All right, and now let' see.

233
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That second equation is 6x plus
2 is equal to minus 2.

234
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well let me do something else
to this equation and I think

235
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it'll become apparent
that these are

236
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
actually the same line.

237
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you take this first
equation and multiply both

238
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sides of it by 2,
what do you get?

239
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's see.

240
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Multiply 3x plus y by 2, you
get 2 times 3x is 6x.

241
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Plus 2 times y.

242
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You have to distribute the 2.

243
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Plus 2y is equal to.

244
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Minus 2 times to 2 is minus 4.

245
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they're the same line.

246
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So when you're solving a system
of equations, you're

247
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
figuring out, where do those
two equations intersect?

248
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If they're the same lines, they
intersect everywhere.

249
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they have an infinite
number of solutions.

250
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the answer is choice D.

251
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Next problem.

252
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They give us another
one like that.

253
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They want to know the ordered
pair that's a

254
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
solution to this equation.

255
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll just copy and paste
the equation there.

256
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, so the easiest thing to do
is probably to just subtract

257
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the second equation from
the first equation.

258
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And instead, I'll actually
write it out explicitly.

259
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the first question is x
plus 3y is equal to 7.

260
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Instead of subtracting this one
from that one, let's just

261
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
multiply the second question by
negative 1 and then we'll
