1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,664
Now, let's do the exact same addition problem we did in the last video...

2
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:09,402
But I'm going to expand out these numbers so that we really understand what's going on when we're doing all of this carrying.

3
00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:19,556
So this "5" is in the hundreds place, so it's really represents 5 hundreds (or five hundred). "3" represents 3 tens (because it is in the 10s place) so it represents 30...

4
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:23,536
And the "6" represents... well, represents 6 ones (or 6).

5
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:35,337
Likewise, this "3" represents three hundred. This "9" is nine tens (or 90), and this "8" just represents 8 ones (or 8).

6
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:37,806
And now we can add these two up.

7
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:43,069
Now let's start in the right most column... This "one"s column.

8
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:54,295
6 plus 8 we've already figured out is equal to 14... which is the same thing as 10 plus 4.

9
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:58,806
So let's write the part that's not a multiple of 10... in this ones column, so let's put that 4 there...

10
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:03,537
And the part that is a multiple of 10, we can now carry into this tens column.

11
00:01:03,537 --> 00:01:08,389
And that's just to keep track of it, just to make sure we don't lose that 10... we're putting it into the tens column.

12
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:10,069
Now we can add all of the tens.

13
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:14,961
10 plus 30 plus 90, we've already figured out is 130.

14
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:21,670
Well... the part that is not a multiple of 100, we can write in this tens column (so the 30 part).

15
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,222
And the part that is a multiple of 100, we can put in the hundreds column.

16
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:33,140
So we can put the 100 over here. Notice, we just carried a "1", but essentially, we've carried 100, because we put a "1" in the hundreds place.

17
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:42,473
10 plus 30 plus 90 is 100 plus 30. This is equal to 100 plus 30. That's all we've done.

18
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:49,140
Now we can the hundreds. 100 plus 500 plus 300, we've already figured out is 900.

19
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,404
So we can write it as 900... and we're done!

20
00:01:52,404 --> 00:02:02,003
We've figured out that 500 plus 30 plus 6 plus 300 plus 90 plus 8 is equal to 900 plus 30 plus 4.

21
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:05,736
Which is the same thing as 934.

22
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:09,807
So hopefully this gives you a little bit more sense of what we're doing when we "carry the 1" every time.

23
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:17,268
6 plus 8 is 14. We "carry the 1"... that "1" represents 10, it represents this 10 right over here. Just so we don't lose track of it.

24
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:25,365
Then we say that 10 plus 30 plus 90 is equal to 130. So that's 30 plus 100.

25
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:29,365
Then we add the hundreds together and we get 9 hundred.
