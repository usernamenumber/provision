1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:05,042
Now that we're comfortable with the "why" of why we do something to both sides of an equation,

2
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:07,678
let's see if we can apply it to some equations to solve for

3
00:00:07,678 --> 00:00:16,544
an unknown variable. So let's say that you have x plus seven is equal to ten, and I want to solve for x.

4
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:20,329
All its saying is something plus seven is equal to ten, and you might be able to figure that out in your head,

5
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,873
but if you want to do it a little bit more systematically, you're like well just

6
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:26,781
all I want on the left hand side is an x. Well if all I want on the left hand side is an x

7
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:33,023
I'd want to get rid of the seven. I want to subtract seven from the left-hand side, but if I want to maintain an equality

8
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:38,729
here, whatever I do to the left-hand side I also have to do to the right-hand side going back to our scales

9
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:43,677
that's so that we can keep our scale balanced, so that we can say that the left is still equal to the right.

10
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:50,564
And so what we're going to be left with is x and then the sevens cancel out

11
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:56,493
is equal to ten minus seven is equal to three. So that unknown is three,

12
00:00:56,493 --> 00:01:01,562
and you can verify it, three plus seven is indeed equal to ten.

13
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:10,749
Let's try one more. Let's say we have a minus five is equal to negative two.

14
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:15,395
So this is a little bit more interesting since we have all of these negative numbers here, but we can use

15
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:19,727
the exact same logic. We just want an a over here on the left-hand side

16
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:23,023
so we have to get rid of this negative five somehow.

17
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:26,244
Well the best way of getting rid of a negative 5 is to add five to it.

18
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:30,630
So I'll do that. So I will add five to the left-hand side.

19
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,311
But if I want the left-hand side to stay equal to the right-hand side,

20
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:36,348
whatever I do to the left I have to do the right.

21
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:40,193
So I'm going to have to add five on the right-hand side as well,

22
00:01:40,193 --> 00:01:48,755
and so on the left-hand side I'm left with a, and then the negative five and the positive five cancel out

23
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:53,179
and on the right hand side, and they're going to stay equal because I did the same thing to both sides,

24
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:57,424
we have negative two plus five which is equal to three.

25
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:02,362
So a is equal to three. Once again you can verify it.

26
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:06,362
Three minus five is indeed equal to negative two.
