1
00:00:00,482 --> 00:00:05,092
If I were to buy a put option with a fifty dollar excercise price

2
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:09,338
and if I were to buy it for $10.00, then the value of my position

3
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:12,277
the payoff for that put option, at the maturity

4
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:17,713
or at the expiration I should say. At the expiration of the option.

5
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:21,282
Depending on what the stock price is, and expiration would look like this:

6
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:24,600
if the stock price is worth, if the stock price goes to zero

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,408
then the put option is worth fifty

8
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:28,354
because I could buy the stock at zero

9
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:30,164
and excercise my option

10
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:34,667
to sell at fifty. At "putting" the stock to someone else

11
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:38,333
at fifty dollars. All the way to if the stock becomes worth fifty

12
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,364
then my put option, I wouldn't need to excercise it

13
00:00:41,364 --> 00:00:43,800
because why would I?

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,533
It's worthless to have the option to sell something at fifty

15
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:49,129
where you can just sell the actual stock in the open market

16
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:54,344
or buy the stock at fifty. So then the put option becomes worthless

17
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,600
for a stock price above that.

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,146
Now, this is the payoff diagram.

19
00:00:58,146 --> 00:01:00,369
And this is when we just think about the value and expiration.

20
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:03,738
If we think about the actual profit and loss at expiration, it would look like this

21
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:06,400
It would just be shifted down by ten dollars

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,267
because we have to pay $10 to get this value.

23
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:12,929
So if the stock is worth zero, the put option is worth

24
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:17,533
$50, but I spent $10 dollars to get it, so the profit is going to be

25
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:19,333
$40 dollars.

26
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,748
And so then at $50, I wouldn't excercise the put option

27
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,733
so I've lost the $10 dollars I spent on the option

28
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:29,267
so my payoff diagram would look like, I'm gonna draw it,

29
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:33,005
relatively neatly. My payoff diagram would look like this

30
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:36,954
Once again, this payoff diagram just incorporates the price of the option

31
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:40,262
So it's the actual profit. This is just the value at expiration,

32
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:42,975
depending upon what the value of the stock is at expiration.

33
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:46,333
Now this is just a situation if you were to buy an option

34
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,502
but there has to be someone on the other side of the contract

35
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:53,800
someone who's holding, agreeing to buy the option for you

36
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:59,667
So you could actually have the writer, you could actually have the writer, of the put

37
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:03,533
the payoff diagram we just showed is the person who owns the put,

38
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,400
but someone else had to have created the put.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,667
They said, "Oh, you know what, I will give you the right.

40
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:16,324
"I will give you the right to sell, to sell me the stock at $50, up to some expiration date."

41
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:18,800
So what does their payoff diagram look like?

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,667
Well if this guy is going to be able to make $50, this guy over here

43
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:27,267
the writer of the put, the writer of the put

44
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:30,933
is going to lose $50. He's going to have to essentially go out

45
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:36,415
he's actually going to have to buy that $50 put or buy that $50 stock from this person

46
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:39,113
because he has to uphold his side of the transaction

47
00:02:39,113 --> 00:02:41,754
but he's buying something for $50 that's worthless

48
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:46,933
because based over, at this end of the axis, the stock would be worth nothing

49
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:51,862
so he's taking a $50 loss, all the way to him not having to do anything

50
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:55,538
because the put holder won't actually excercise their options

51
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:58,359
if their stock price is $50, so their payoff diagram is going to look like this

52
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:01,498
So you can see it's actually the mirror image

53
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:05,800
of the payoff diagram of this person on the other side of the contract

54
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,733
And if you were to add these two payoff diagrams, you would be neutral,

55
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,667
because all of the money is exchanging hands between the buyer

56
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,677
and the seller of the put.

57
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:16,267
If you look at the actual profit or loss

58
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:19,000
if the put is not excercised

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
then the writer of the put essentially just got a free $10

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,667
He sold the put, he sold the put to this guy for $10

61
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,333
He created the put and sold it to that guy for $10

62
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,733
the put is not excercised, he gets to keep that $10.

63
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:36,267
But then if the stock goes down and he's forced to buy the stock

64
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:38,600
from the owner of the put

65
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,400
he has to buy it because that's his side of the deal

66
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,600
then all of a sudden he loses money

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,000
So he would go, if all the way down if the stock is worth nothing,

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,133
He is forced to buy something for $50 that is worth nothing

69
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:56,067
He would take a $50 loss, but he paid the $10 on the actual price of the option

70
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:59,400
so it would be a negative $40 profit

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,815
So his profit and loss would look like this

72
00:04:01,815 --> 99:59:59,999
But once again, these are the mirror images of each other.
