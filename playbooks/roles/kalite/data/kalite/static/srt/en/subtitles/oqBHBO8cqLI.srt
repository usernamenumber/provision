1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
   

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:01,810
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,860
And if you were covering your
eyes because you didn't want

4
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,250
to see calculus, I think you
can open your eyes again.

5
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,830
There shouldn't be any
significant displays of

6
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,330
calculus in this video.

7
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,550
But just to review what we went
over, we just said, OK if

8
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,760
we have a spring-- and I drew it
vertically this time-- but

9
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,750
pretend like there's no gravity,
or maybe pretend like

10
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,440
we're viewing-- we're looking at
the top of a table, because

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,080
we don't want to look
at the effect of

12
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,990
a spring and gravity.

13
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,450
We just want to look at
a spring by itself.

14
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,760
So this could be in deep space,
or something else.

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,780
But we're not thinking
about gravity.

16
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,670
But I drew it vertically just
so that we can get more

17
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,080
intuition for this curve.

18
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,520
Well, we started off saying is
if I have a spring and 0-- x

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,740
equals 0 is kind of the natural
resting point of the

20
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,430
spring, if I just let this
mass-- if I didn't pull on the

21
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,380
spring at all.

22
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,340
But I have a mass attached to
the spring, and if I were to

23
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,060
stretch the spring to point A,
we said, well what happens?

24
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,990
Well, it starts with very little
velocity, but there's a

25
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,100
restorative force, that's going
to be pulling it back

26
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,430
towards this position.

27
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,170
So that force will accelerate
the mass, accelerate the mass,

28
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,620
accelerate the mass, until
it gets right here.

29
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,040
And then it'll have a lot of
velocity here, but then it'll

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,360
start decelerating.

31
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,680
And then it'll decelerate,
decelerate, decelerate.

32
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,560
Its velocity will stop, and
it'll come back up.

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,625
And if we drew this as
a function of time,

34
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,060
this is what happens.

35
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,010
It starts moving very
slowly, accelerates.

36
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,300
At this point, at x equals 0,
it has its maximum speed.

37
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,010
So the rate of change of
velocity-- or the rate of

38
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,230
change of position is fastest.
And we can see the slope is

39
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,770
very fast right here.

40
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,240
And then, we start slowing
down again, slowing down,

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,990
until we get back to
the spot of A.

42
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,500
And then we keep going up and
down, up and down, like that.

43
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,280
And we showed that actually,
the equation for the mass's

44
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,320
position as a function of time
is x of t-- and we used a

45
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,620
little bit of differential
equations to prove it.

46
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,310
But this equation-- not that I
recommend that you memorize

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,950
anything-- but this is a pretty

48
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,640
useful equation to memorize.

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,390
Because you can use it to
pretty much figure out

50
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:05,210
anything-- about the position,
or of the mass at any given

51
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,490
time, or the frequency of this
oscillatory motion, or

52
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,120
anything else.

53
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,005
Even the velocity, if you know
a little bit of calculus, you

54
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:13,720
can figure out the velocity
at anytime, of the object.

55
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,030
And that's pretty neat.

56
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,740
So what can we do now?

57
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,690
Well, let's try to figure
out the period of

58
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:26,220
this oscillating system.

59
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,450
And just so you know-- I know
I put the label harmonic

60
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,980
motion on all of these-- this
is simple harmonic motion.

61
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,470
Simple harmonic motion is
something that can be

62
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,690
described by a trigonometric
function like this.

63
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,720
And it just oscillates back
and forth, back and forth.

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,850
And so, what we're doing
is harmonic motion.

65
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,100
And now, let's figure out
what this period is.

66
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,670
Remember we said that after T
seconds, it gets back to its

67
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,210
original position, and then
after another T seconds, it

68
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,860
gets back to its original
position.

69
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,540
Let's figure out
with this T is.

70
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,320
And that's essentially
its period, right?

71
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,830
What's the period
of a function?

72
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,650
It's how long it takes to get
back to your starting point.

73
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,560
Or how long it takes for the
whole cycle to happen once.

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,140
So what is this T?

75
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,140
So let me ask you a question.

76
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,320
What are all the points--
that if this is a

77
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,950
cosine function, right?

78
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,290
What are all of the points at
which cosine is equal to 1?

79
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,470
Or this function would
be equal to A, right?

80
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,860
Because whenever cosine is
equal to 1, this whole

81
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,415
function is equal to A.

82
00:03:24,415 --> 00:03:25,930
And it's these points.

83
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,450
Well cosine is equal to 1 when--
so, theta-- let's say,

84
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,430
when is cosine of theta
equal to 1?

85
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,890
So, at what angles
is this true?

86
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,150
Well it's true at theta
is equal to 0, right?

87
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,200
Cosine of 0 is 1.

88
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,430
Cosine of 2 pi is
also 1, right?

89
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,400
We could just keep going around
that unit circle.

90
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,770
You should watch the unit circle
video if this makes no

91
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,260
sense to you.

92
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,600
Or the graphing trig
functions.

93
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,850
It's also true at 4 pi.

94
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,790
Really, any multiple of
2 pi, this is true.

95
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,320
Right?

96
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,310
Cosine of that angle
is equal to 1.

97
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,900
So the same thing is true.

98
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:14,400
This function, x of t, is equal
to A at what points?

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,980
x of t is equal to A whenever
this expression-- within the

100
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,540
cosines-- whenever this
expression is equal to 0, 2

101
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,990
pi, 4 pi, et cetera.

102
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,610
And this first time that it
cycles, right, from 0 to 2

103
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,650
pi-- from 0 to T, that'll
be at 2 pi, right?

104
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,730
So this whole expression will
equal A, when k-- and that's

105
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,970
these points, right?

106
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,760
That's when this function
is equal to A.

107
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,930
It'll happen again over
here someplace.

108
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,260
When this little internal
expression is equal to 2 pi,

109
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,180
or really any multiple
of 2 pi.

110
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,010
So we could say, so x of t is
equal to A when the square

111
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:03,460
root of k over m times
t, is equal to 2 pi.

112
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,330
Or another way of thinking about
it, is let's multiply

113
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,510
both sides of this equation
times the inverse of the

114
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,450
square root of k over m.

115
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:20,410
And you get, t is equal to 2 pi
times the square root-- and

116
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,840
it's going to be the inverse
of this, right?

117
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,550
Of m over k.

118
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,440
And there we have the period
of this function.

119
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,460
This is going to be equal
to 2 pi times the square

120
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,860
root of m over k.

121
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:41,475
So if someone tells you, well I
have a spring that I'm going

122
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,925
to pull from some-- I'm going to
stretch it, or compress it

123
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:46,080
a little bit, then I let go--
what is the period?

124
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,180
How long does it take for the
spring to go back to its

125
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,990
original position?

126
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,480
It'll keep doing that, as we
have no friction, or no

127
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,060
gravity, or any air
resistance, or

128
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,790
anything like that.

129
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,700
Air resistance really is just
a form of friction.

130
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,940
You could immediately-- if you
memorize this formula,

131
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,360
although you should know where
it comes from-- you could

132
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,840
immediately say, well I know
how long the period is.

133
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,390
It's 2 pi times m over k.

134
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,090
That's how long it's going to
take the spring to get back--

135
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,560
to complete one cycle.

136
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,520
And then what about
the frequency?

137
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,320
If you wanted to know cycles per
second, well that's just

138
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,200
the inverse of the
period, right?

139
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,190
So if I wanted to know the
frequency, that equals 1 over

140
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,820
the period, right?

141
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,860
Period is given in seconds
per cycle.

142
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:33,340
So frequency is cycles
per second, and this

143
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,880
is seconds per cycle.

144
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,970
So frequency is just going
to be 1 over this.

145
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:44,500
Which is 1 over 2 pi times the
square root of k over m.

146
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,180
That's the frequency.

147
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,110
But I have always had trouble
memorizing this, and this.

148
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,620
You always [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

149
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,240
k over m, and m over
k, and all of that.

150
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,650
All you have to really
memorize is this.

151
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,840
And even that, you might
even have an intuition

152
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,660
as to why it's true.

153
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,240
You can even go to the
differential equations if you

154
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,680
want to reprove it
to yourself.

155
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,020
Because if you have this, you
really can answer any question

156
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,990
about the position of the
mass, at any time.

157
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,150
The velocity of the mass, at any
time, just by taking the

158
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,980
derivative.

159
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,140
Or the period, or the frequency
of the function.

160
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,810
As long as you know how to take
the period and frequency

161
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,180
of trig functions.

162
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,010
You can watch my videos, and
watch my trig videos, to get a

163
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,340
refresher on that.

164
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,850
One thing that's pretty
interesting about this, is

165
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,930
notice that the frequency
and the period, right?

166
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,900
This is the period of the
function, that's how long it

167
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,470
takes do one cycle.

168
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,090
This is how many cycles it does
in one second-- both of

169
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,010
them are independent of A.

170
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,830
So it doesn't matter, I could
stretch it only a little bit,

171
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,750
like there, and it'll take the
same amount of time to go

172
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,560
back, and come back like
that, as it would if I

173
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,470
stretch it a lot.

174
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,290
It would just do that.

175
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,800
If I stretched it just a little
bit, the function would

176
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,450
look like this.

177
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,340
Make sure I do this right.

178
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,030
I'm not doing that right.

179
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,280
Edit, undo.

180
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,680
   

181
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,800
If I just do it a little bit,
the amplitude is going to be

182
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,180
less, but the function is going
to essentially do the

183
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,890
same thing.

184
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,190
It's just going to do that.

185
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,090
So it's going to take the same
amount of time to complete the

186
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,450
cycle, it'll just have
a lower amplitude.

187
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,890
So that's interesting to me,
that how much I stretch it,

188
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,000
it's not going to make it take
longer or less time to

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,850
complete one cycle.

190
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,500
That's interesting.

191
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,360
And so if I just told you, that
I actually start having

192
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,930
objects compressed, right?

193
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,419
So in that case, let's
say my A is minus 3.

194
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,490
I have a spring constant
of-- let's say k is,

195
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,280
I don't know, 10.

196
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,830
And I have a mass of 2
kilograms. Then I could

197
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,100
immediately tell you what the
equation of the position as a

198
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,630
function of time at
any point is.

199
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,120
It's going to be x of t will
equal-- I'm running out of

200
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,310
space-- so x of t would equal--
this is just basic

201
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:03,450
subsitution-- minus 3 cosine of
10 divided by 2, right? k

202
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,970
over m, is 5.

203
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,600
So square root of 5t.

204
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,370
I know that's hard to read,
but you get the point.

205
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,860
I just substituted that.

206
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,550
But the important thing to
know is this-- this is, I

207
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,360
think, the most important
thing-- and then if given a

208
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,690
trig function, you have trouble
remembering how to

209
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,690
figure out the period or
frequency-- although I always

210
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,120
just think about, when does
this expression equal 1?

211
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,952
And then you can figure out--
when does it equal 1, or when

212
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,416
does it equal 0-- and you can
figure out its period.

213
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,360
If you don't have it,

214
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,170
you can memorize this formula
for period, and this formula

215
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,830
for frequency, but I think that
might be a waste of your

216
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,830
brain space.

217
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,090
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
