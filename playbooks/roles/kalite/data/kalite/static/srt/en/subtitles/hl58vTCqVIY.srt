1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,010
In the last hyperbola video
I didn't get a chance to

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,470
do some concrete examples.

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,390
So I'll do that right now.

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,050
So, let's say I had the
hyperbola y squared over

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:19,770
4 minus x squared over,
I don't know, let me

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,150
think of a good number.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,310
Let's say, x squared
over 9 is equal to 1.

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,040
So the first thing to figure
out about this hyperbola is,

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,880
what are its asymptotes?

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,970
And, once again, I always
forget the formulas.

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,110
And I just try to solve for y
and see what happens when x

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,510
approaches positive or
negative infinity.

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,680
So if you solve for y,
you can add x squared

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,980
over 9 to both sides.

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,500
And you get y squared
over 4 is equal to x

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,140
squared over 9 plus 1.

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,190
Now, I can multiply
4 times both sides.

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,920
And you get y squared is
equal to 4 over 9 times

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,790
x squared plus 4.

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,790
I distribute the 4, take
the positive and negative

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,550
square root both sides.

23
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:17,270
y is equal to the plus or
minus square root of 4

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,140
over 9x squared plus 4.

25
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,880
And you can't really
simplify this anymore.

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,000
But we can think about, what
does this approach as x

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,640
approaches positive or
negative infinity.

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:36,530
So, as x approaches plus
or minus infinity, what

29
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,380
does this roughly equal?

30
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,350
What does this approximate?

31
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,450
What does the graph
get a lot closer to?

32
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,115
Well, then, y is approximately
equal to just the square

33
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:46,810
root of this term.

34
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,256
Because this becomes super huge
and relative to this term, this

35
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:52,690
starts to matter less
and less and less.

36
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,480
And that's why we get closer
and closer to the asymptotes.

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,410
Because when this number
is, like, a trillion, or a

38
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,100
google, then this number
is almost insignificant.

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,000
You take the square root,
you're pretty much taking the

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,720
square root of this, and
you'll just be a little

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,900
bit above the graph.

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,260
Because you have this
extra plus-4 there.

43
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,660
So as you approach positive
or negative infinity, this

44
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,260
equation is approximately equal
to the plus or minus square

45
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,800
root of 4 over 9x squared.

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,170
And so, that is -- so y would
be approximately equal

47
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,950
to the plus or minus.

48
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,010
We can take the
square root of this.

49
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,770
Plus or minus the square
root of 4/9 is 2/3, right?

50
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,880
Square root of 4 over
square root of 9, times x.

51
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,020
So, these are the asymptotes.

52
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,160
There's two lines here.

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,940
There's y is equal to 2/3 x.

54
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,860
And then there's y is
equal to minus 2/3 x.

55
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,660
So let's draw those two lines.

56
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,080
Let me draw my axes.

57
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,870
   

58
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,100
Let's make that my y axis.

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,470
Make that the x axis.

60
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,100
Let me switch some colors, just
to make things interesting.

61
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,620
So let me draw the first one.

62
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,760
See, y is equal to 2/3 x.

63
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,240
So, you rise 2 for
every 3 that you run.

64
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,970
So let me draw that.

65
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:17,640
So if this is 1, 2, 3, 1, 2.

66
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,540
So that would be a
point on the line.

67
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,990
Let me draw the line now.

68
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,380
Actually go to the origin.

69
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,750
No, that's not it.

70
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,170
Let me draw it like this.

71
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,930
This way I can make sure
it goes to the origin.

72
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,940
This is going to go
through like that.

73
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,850
Then I can go from here.

74
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,670
And then go like that.

75
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,280
So that's one asymptote.

76
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,140
And the other asymptote is
y is going to be equal

77
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,690
to minus 2/3 x, right?

78
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,450
Because plus or minus 2/3 x.

79
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:49,110
So, minus 2/3 x, you go down 2
for every 3 that you go out.

80
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,160
So that point will show
up, see if I do, 1, 2.

81
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,320
So you go down 2 for
every 3 that you go out.

82
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,110
So it'll go 3.

83
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,610
So if I draw that asymptote,
it'll look something

84
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,531
like there.

85
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:05,120
Go out there.

86
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,180
And then go from here.

87
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,590
Go out there.

88
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,620
And we've drawn our asymptotes.

89
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,630
Now the question is, is it
going to open up to the left

90
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,030
or the right, or up and down?

91
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,430
There's two ways we
can think about it.

92
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,010
And I'll do it the way that
might be more intuitive for

93
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,910
you is, can x -- what happens
when x is equal to 0?

94
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,520
Well, when x is equal to
0, when x is equal to

95
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,860
0, this disappears.

96
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,880
And we're just left with,
I'll do it here, y squared

97
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,480
over 4 is equal to 1.

98
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,150
Or, y squared is equal to 4.

99
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,290
Or, y is equal to
plus or minus 2.

100
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,720
So, we know that the point
0, the points, 0 plus or

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,710
minus 2, is on this graph.

102
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,060
So x can be equal to 0
so 0 plus or minus 2.

103
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,140
So 0 plus 2 is this
point right here.

104
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,310
And 0 minus 2 is this
point right there.

105
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,600
So that, by itself, actually,
is enough of a clue to know

106
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
that it opens down here.

107
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,160
And up here.

108
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,800
Because it will never,
a hyperbola will never

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,190
cross the asymptotes.

110
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,610
It's not like it can go out
here and across this asymptote.

111
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:09,830
So?

112
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,430
We already know that the graph
of this parabola -- and you can

113
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,340
try other points, if you
want, just to verify.

114
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,550
It's going to look
something like this.

115
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,880
It's going to go and then
-- nope, I want to make

116
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,330
it so it never touches.

117
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,470
It's going to get really
close, but no, I touched it.

118
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,180
It's going to get really
close but never touch.

119
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,970
And then on this side
it's going to get really

120
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,100
close, but never touch.

121
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,310
And I don't want to touch it.

122
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,424
And then on the top side it's
going to do the same thing,

123
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:37,243
it's going to get really close,
and as you approach infinity

124
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:38,510
it's never going to touch it.

125
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,970
And as you get reall close,
it'll get infiniitely

126
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,850
close but never touch it.

127
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,030
So that's what this parabola
-- this hyperbola --

128
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,100
is going to look like.

129
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,930
And I did it by just trying to
see if x could be equal to 0.

130
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,370
And I encourage you to try
what happens when y equals 0.

131
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,540
And you'll get no solution.

132
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,390
And that makes sense because
this hyperbola never

133
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,180
crosses y equals 0, right?

134
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,330
It never crosses the x axis.

135
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,630
And this should also be
intuitive, because if we

136
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,250
saw here when we did ths
approximation, as x approaches

137
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,820
positive or negative infinity,
we saw that we always did have

138
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,270
this plus 4 sitting here.

139
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,160
We said, oh, well, as x gets
super large or super negative,

140
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,470
this starts to matter
less and less.

141
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,190
But we will always be slightly
larger than this number.

142
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,810
Especially in the positive
quadrant, right?

143
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,605
We're always going to be --
so the positive quadrant is

144
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:29,250
always going to be slightly
larger than the asymptote.

145
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,210
And even when we take the
positive square root, I guess,

146
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:33,990
is the best way to say it.

147
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,600
When we take the positive
square root, we'll always

148
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,140
be larger than either
of the asymptotes.

149
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,100
And, likewise, when you take
the negative square root,

150
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,010
you're always going to be
a little bit smaller than

151
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,910
either of the asymptotes.

152
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,690
Because this number is
going to be a little bit

153
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,540
bigger than this number.

154
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,740
Then we take the negative
square root, you're going to

155
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,150
be a little bit smaller,
and that's why we're

156
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,280
a little bit below.

157
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,260
I don't know which one's
more intutive for you.

158
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,590
Maybe just the -- trying it
when x is equal to 0 and when y

159
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,740
equals 0, and see what points
you get and say, oh, then I'm

160
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,990
in kind of a vertical hyperbola
as opposed to a horizontal one.

161
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,960
So let's see if I have time
for -- I'll leave that

162
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,770
video right there.

163
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,090
And then I'll do another
video where I actually

164
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,990
shift the hyperbola.

165
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,350
And shifting it is actually
no different than shifting

166
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,470
an ellipse a circle.

167
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,200
You just have, you know, y
minus something squared, and x

168
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,370
plus something, or x minus
something squared and that just

169
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,890
tells you where you
shift the origin.

170
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,610
This hyperbola, of course, is
just centered at the origin.

171
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,890
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

172
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,123
