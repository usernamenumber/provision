1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,020
   

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,030
A star explodes in a blinding supernova, spraying x-rays

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,040
across the galaxy to tell its tale. X-rays also

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,050
tells a dentist which tooth to drill, and a surgeon which bones to mend.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,060
In 1895 Wilhelm Roentgen

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,070
discovered that firing streams of x-rays through arms and hands created

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,080
eerie, but detailed images of the bones inside.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,090
X-rays are high energy light rays with wavelengths between

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,100
3 and 0.03 nanometers. So small

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,110
that some x-rays are no bigger than many individual atoms.

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,120
In laboratories, scientist fire beams of x-rays at unknown

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,130
substances to learn what elements they contain and to decode their

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,170
atomic structure. This is how scientists unraveled complex molecules

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,200
like penicillin and DNA.

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,239
Scientists can also detect the x-rays emitted from extremely hot and energetic

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,270
objects in the Universe. NASA's robotic rovers

17
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,330
recorded x-rays to identify the spectral signatures of elements,

18
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,370
such as zinc and nickel, in Martian rocks.

19
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,400
X-rays can also reveal an object's temperature since temperature determines

20
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,430
the wavelength of its radiation. The hotter the object,

21
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,450
the shorter that wavelength is. X-rays come from objects

22
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,490
that seethe at millions of degrees-such as pulsars,

23
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,530
black holes, supernovas, or the plasma in

24
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,570
our Sun's corona. Our Sun has a surface temperature of around 6,000

25
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,610
degrees celcius and radiates most of its energy in visible

26
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,650
wavelengths. But it is easier to study the massive energy flows

27
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,690
in the corona's energetic plasma by observing x-rays like this

28
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,730
image from the Hinode satellite, a joint Japanese-NASA mission.

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,760
NASA's SOHO satellite produced these x-ray images

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,790
of the Sun that allow scientists to see and record these energy flows

31
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,840
within the corona. NASA's orbiting Chandra x-ray

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,890
observatory detects x-rays created by objects spread far across

33
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,950
space such as this supernova explosion that occurred 10,000

34
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,980
light years from Earth. The colors in the gas and dust cloud

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,020
correspond to different energy levels of the x-rays created by the blast.

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,050
X-rays at different wavelengths provide information about an

37
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,090
object's composition, temperature, density, or its magnetic field.

38
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,120
Human eyes may not be able to see x-rays

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,160
but, from seething cosmic bodies to individual atomic

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,190
elements, x-rays provide a wealth of information

41
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,190
to exploring scientists.

42
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,980
