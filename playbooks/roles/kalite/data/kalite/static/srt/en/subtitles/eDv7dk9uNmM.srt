1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A function, f(x), is plotted below.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Highlight an interval where f(x) is less than 0.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So f(x), which is really being plotted

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the vertical axis right over here --

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x is the horizontal axis.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
f(x) being less than zero really means that

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the graph is below the x axis.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the function is negative in this interval right over here,

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in this interval over here.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I could put this [slider control]

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
anywhere right over here,

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or I could stick it anywhere right over here.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me stick it right over here.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There we go. Got it right.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let’s do a couple more.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, the function is plotted below.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Highlight an interval where f(x) is greater than zero.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, I could do this area right over here,

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where the function is above the x-axis,

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or I could do this area right over here,

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where the function goes way above the x-axis.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(Well, it even goes off the page.)

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let’s stick it right over here.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let’s do one more.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, highlight an interval where f(x) is greater than 0.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Once again, I can do this region right over here,

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where the function is above the x-axis, or over here,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where the function is above the x-axis.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I’ll do it right here, just for fun.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There we go.
