1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,180
In this video, I'm going to
introduce you to the concept

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,950
of the convolution, one of the
first times a mathematician's

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,810
actually named something
similar to what

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,590
it's actually doing.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,590
You're actually convoluting
the functions.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,970
And in this video, I'm not
going to dive into the

8
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,830
intuition of the convolution,
because there's a lot of

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,770
different ways you
can look at it.

10
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,430
It has a lot of different
applications, and if you

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,320
become an engineer really of any
kind, you're going to see

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,950
the convolution in kind of a
discreet form and a continuous

13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,620
form, and a bunch of
different ways.

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,620
But in this video I just want
to make you comfortable with

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,100
the idea of a convolution,
especially in the context of

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,290
taking Laplace transforms.

17
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,760
So the convolution theorem--
well, actually, before I even

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,970
go to the convolution theorem,
let me define what a

19
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,470
convolution is.

20
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,100
So let's say that I have
some function f of t.

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,983
So if I convolute f with g-- so
this means that I'm going

22
00:00:58,983 --> 00:01:02,250
to take the convolution of f and
g, and this is going to be

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,220
a function of t.

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,610
And so far, nothing I've written
should make any sense

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,790
to you, because I haven't
defined what this means.

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,100
This is like those SAT problems
where they say, like,

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:18,060
you know, a triangle b means a
plus b over 3, while you're

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,840
standing on one leg or
something like that.

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,000
So I need to define this
in some similar way.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,455
So let me undo this silliness
that I just wrote there.

31
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:28,960
And the definition of a
convolution, we're going to do

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,200
it over a-- well, there's
several definitions you'll

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,140
see, but the definition we're
going to use in this, context

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,150
there's actually one other
definition you'll see in the

35
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:45,290
continuous case, is the integral
from 0 to t of f of t

36
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:56,195
minus tau, times g of t-- let me
just write it-- sorry, it's

37
00:01:56,195 --> 00:02:00,400
times g of tau d tau.

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,970
Now, this might seem like a very
bizarro thing to do, and

39
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,560
you're like, Sal, how
do I even compute

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,520
one of these things?

41
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,300
And to kind of give you that
comfort, let's actually

42
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,550
compute a convolution.

43
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,790
   

44
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,090
Actually, it was hard to find
some functions that are very

45
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,345
easy to analytically compute,
and you're going to find that

46
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:23,790
we're going to go into a lot of
trig identities to actually

47
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,860
compute this.

48
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:31,680
But if I say that f of t, if I
define f of t to be equal to

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,980
the sine of t, and I define
cosine of t-- let me do it in

50
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,810
orange-- or I define g of t to
be equal to the cosine of t.

51
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,930
Now let's convolute
the two functions.

52
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:54,310
So the convolution of f with g,
and this is going to be a

53
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,000
function of t, it equals this.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,490
I'm just going to show you how
to apply this integral.

55
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,040
So it equals the integral--
I'll do it in purple-- the

56
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,120
integral from 0 to t of
f of t minus tau.

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,090
This is my f of t.

58
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:17,810
So it's is going to be sine of
t minus tau times g of tau.

59
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,500
Well, this is my g of t, so
g of tau is cosine of tau,

60
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,700
cosine of tau d tau.

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,660
So that's the integral, and
now to evaluate it, we're

62
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,000
going to have to break out
some trigonometry.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,760
So let's do that.

64
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,100
This almost is just a very
good trigonometry and

65
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,510
integration review.

66
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,510
So let's evaluate this.

67
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,470
But I wanted to evaluate this
in this video because I want

68
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,360
to show you that this isn't some
abstract thing, that you

69
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,730
can actually evaluate
these functions.

70
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,835
So the first thing I want to
do-- I mean, I don't know what

71
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:49,150
the antiderivative of this is.

72
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,450
It's tempting, you see a sine
and a cosine, maybe they're

73
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,800
the derivatives of each
other, but this is the

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,830
sine of t minus tau.

75
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,980
So let me rewrite that sine of
t minus tau, and we'll just

76
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:05,210
use the trig identity, that
the sine of t minus tau is

77
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:15,010
just equal to the sine of t
times the cosine of tau minus

78
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,990
the sine of tau times
the cosine of t.

79
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,709
And actually, I just made a
video where I go through all

80
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,000
of these trig identities really
just to review them for

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,560
myself and actually to make a
video in better quality on

82
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,420
them as well.

83
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,560
So if we make this subsitution,
this you'll find

84
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,390
on the inside cover of any
trigonometry or calculus book,

85
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,175
you get the convolution of f and
g is equal to-- I'll just

86
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:42,730
write that f-star g; I'll just
write it with that-- is equal

87
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,660
to the integral from 0 to t of,
instead of sine of t minus

88
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,780
tau, I'm going to write this
thing right there.

89
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,970
So I'm going to write the sine
of t times the cosine of tau

90
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:04,420
minus the sine of tau times the
cosine of t, and then all

91
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,355
of that's times the
cosine of tau.

92
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:09,450
   

93
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,970
I have to be careful with my
taus and t's, and let's see, t

94
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,770
and tau, tau and t.

95
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,490
Everything's working so far.

96
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,810
So let's see, so
then that's dt.

97
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,860
Oh, sorry, d tau.

98
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,950
Let me be very careful here.

99
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,460
Now let's distribute this
cosine of tau out,

100
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,880
and what do we get?

101
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,640
We get this is equal to-- so f
convoluted with g, I guess we

102
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,710
call it f-star g, is equal to
the integral from 0 to t of

103
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,560
sine of t times cosine of
tau times cosine of tau.

104
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,620
I'm just distributing
this cosine of tau.

105
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:51,450
So it's cosine squared of tau,
and then minus-- let's rewrite

106
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,870
the cosine of t first, and I'm
doing that because we're

107
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,680
integrating with
respect to tau.

108
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,910
So I'm just going to write my
cosine of t first. So cosine

109
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:09,950
of t times sine of tau times
the cosine of tau d tau.

110
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,420
And now, since we're taking
the integral of really two

111
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,530
things subtracting from each
other, let's just turn this

112
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,860
into two separate integrals.

113
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,500
So this is equal to the integral
from 0 to t, of sine

114
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:32,010
of t, times the cosine squared
of tau d tau minus the

115
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:40,710
integral from 0 to t of cosine
of t times sine of tau cosine

116
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,910
of tau d tau.

117
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,390
Now, what can we do?

118
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,550
Well, to simplify it more,
remember, we're integrating

119
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,330
with respect to-- let
me be careful here.

120
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,500
We're integrating with
respect to tau.

121
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,700
I wrote a t there.

122
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,320
We're integrating with
respect to tau.

123
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,580
So all of these, this
cosine of t right

124
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,480
here, that's a constant.

125
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,650
The sine of t is a constant.

126
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,320
For all I know, t could
be equal to 5.

127
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,190
It doesn't matter that one
of the boundaries of our

128
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,520
integration is also a t.

129
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,610
That t would be a 5,
in which case these

130
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,730
are all just constants.

131
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,730
We're integrating only with
respect to the tau, so if

132
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,500
cosine of 5, that's a constant,
we can take it out

133
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:17,960
of the integral.

134
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:27,260
So this is equal to sine of t
times the integral from 0 to t

135
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:38,360
of cosine squared of tau d tau
and then minus cosine of t--

136
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,500
that's just a constant; I'm
bringing it out-- times the

137
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:52,870
integral from 0 to t of sine
of tau cosine of tau d tau.

138
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,270
Now, this antiderivative is
pretty straightforward.

139
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,230
You could do u substitution.

140
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,470
Let me do it here, instead
of doing it in our heads.

141
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,960
This is a complicated
problem, so we don't

142
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,260
want to skip steps.

143
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:10,260
If we said u is equal to sine of
tau, then du d tau is equal

144
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,320
to the cosine of tau, just
the derivative of sine.

145
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,180
Or we could write that
du is equal to the

146
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,170
cosine of tau d tau.

147
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:28,440
   

148
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,120
We'll undo the substitution
before we evaluate the

149
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,150
endpoints here.

150
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,520
But this was a little bit
more of a conundrum.

151
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,370
I don't know how to take the
antiderivative of cosine

152
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,360
squared of tau.

153
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,270
It's not obvious what that is.

154
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,740
So to do this, we're going
to break out some more

155
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,600
trigonometric identities.

156
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,250
And in a video I just recorded,
it might not be the

157
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:57,830
last video in the playlist, I
showed that the cosine squared

158
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,960
of tau-- I'm just using tau as
an example-- is equal to 1/2

159
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:12,660
times 1 plus the cosine
of 2 tau.

160
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,690
And once again, this is just a
trig identity that you'll find

161
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,250
really in the inside cover of
probably your calculus book.

162
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,870
So we can make this substitution
here, make this

163
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,350
substitution right there, and
then let's see what our

164
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,930
integrals become.

165
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,280
So the first one over here,
let me just write it here.

166
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:42,520
We get sine of t times the
integral from 0 to t of this

167
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,060
thing here.

168
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,055
Let me just take the 1/2 out,
to keep things simple.

169
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,800
So I'll put the 1/2 out here.

170
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,980
That's this 1/2.

171
00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:00,080
So 1 plus cosine of 2 tau and
all of that is d tau.

172
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,610
   

173
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,530
That's this integral
right there.

174
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:11,560
And then we have this integral
right here, minus cosine of t

175
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,930
times the integral from--
let me be very clear.

176
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:25,600
This is tau is equal to 0
to tau is equal to t.

177
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,960
And then this thing right
here, I did some u

178
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,510
subsitution.

179
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:33,180
If u is equal to sine of
t, then this becomes u.

180
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,710
And we showed that du is equal
to cosine-- sorry, u is equal

181
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,060
to sine of tau.

182
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,930
And then we showed that du is
equal to cosine tau d tau, so

183
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,010
this thing right here
is equal to du.

184
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:53,290
So it's u du, and let's see if
we can do anything useful now.

185
00:10:53,290 --> 00:11:01,210
So this integral right here, the
antiderivative of this is

186
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,305
pretty straightforward, so
what are we going to get?

187
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:05,110
Let me write this
outside part.

188
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,060
So we have 1/2 times
the sine of t.

189
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,220
And now let me take the
antiderivative of this.

190
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,400
This is going to be tau plus
the antiderivative of this.

191
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,465
It's going to be 1/2
sine of 2 tau.

192
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:24,870
   

193
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,550
I mean, we could have done
the u substitution.

194
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,720
we could have said u is equal to
2 tau and all of that, but

195
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,460
I think you could do that from
recognition, and if you don't

196
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,720
believe me, you just have to
take the derivative of this.

197
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,230
1/2 sine of 2 tau is the
derivative of this.

198
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,550
You multiply, you take the
derivative of the inside, so

199
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,840
that's 2, so the 2 and the 1/2
cancel out, and the derivative

200
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,450
of the outside, so
cosine of 2 tau.

201
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,910
And you're going to evaluate
that from 0 to t.

202
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:58,550
And then we have minus
cosine of t.

203
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,550
When we take the antiderivative
of this-- let

204
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,690
me do this on the side.

205
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,540
So the integral of u du,
that's trivially easy.

206
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,320
That's 1/2 u squared.

207
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,940
Now, that's 1/2 u squared, but
what was u to begin with?

208
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,610
It was sine of tau.

209
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,970
So the antiderivative of this
thing right here is 1/2 u

210
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,290
squared, but u is sine of tau.

211
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:33,490
So it's going to be 1/2u, which
is sine of tau squared.

212
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,130
And we're going to evaluate
that from 0 to t.

213
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,120
And we didn't even have to do
all this u substitution.

214
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
The way I often do it in my
head, I see the sine of tau,

215
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,790
cosine of tau.

216
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,370
if I have a function and I have
its derivative, I can

217
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,140
treat that function just like
as if I had an x there, so

218
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,690
it'd be sine squared of tau over
2, which is exactly what

219
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,980
we have there.

220
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,896
So it looks like we're
in the home stretch.

221
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:59,810
   

222
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,790
We're taking the convolution of
sine of t with cosine of t.

223
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,880
And so we get 1/2 sine of t.

224
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,520
Now, if I evaluate this thing
at t, what do I get?

225
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,230
I get t plus 1/2 sine
of 2t, that's when I

226
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,800
evaluated it at t.

227
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,160
And then from that I need to
subtract it evaluated at 0, so

228
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:30,720
minus 0 minus 1/2 sine of
2 times 0, which is

229
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,170
just sine of 0.

230
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,930
So this part right here, this
whole thing right there, what

231
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,460
does that simplify to?

232
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,910
Well this is 0, sine of 0
is 0, so this is all 0.

233
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:47,940
So this first integral right
there simplifies to 1/2 sine

234
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:56,010
of t times t plus
1/2 sine of 2t.

235
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,740
   

236
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,280
All right, now what does this
one simplify to over here?

237
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:12,191
Well, this one over here, you
have minus cosine of t.

238
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:14,900
And we're going to evaluate this
whole thing at t, so you

239
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:23,200
get 1/2 sine squared of t
minus 1/2 the sine of 0

240
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,680
squared, which is just 0,
so that's just minus 0.

241
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,180
So far, everything that we have
written simplifies to--

242
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,550
let me multiply it all out.

243
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:41,810
So I have 1/2-- let me just pick
a good color-- 1/2t sine

244
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:50,580
of t-- I'm just multiplying
those out-- plus 1/4 sine of t

245
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,110
sine of 2t.

246
00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:02,210
And then over here I have minus
1/2 sine squared t times

247
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,640
cosine of t.

248
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,910
I just took the minus cosine t
and multiplied it through here

249
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,420
and I got that.

250
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,200
Now, this is a valid answer,
but I suspect that we can

251
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,000
simplify this more, maybe using
some more trigonometric

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,160
identities.

253
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,720
And this guy right there
looks ripe to simplify.

254
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,530
And we know that the sine of
2t-- another trig identity

255
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,790
you'll find in the inside cover
of any of your books--

256
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:34,890
is 2 times the sine of t
times the cosine of t.

257
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,930
So if you substitute that there,
what does our whole

258
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,480
expression equal?

259
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,705
You get this first term.

260
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:42,890
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

261
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:54,280
You get 1/2t times the sine of
t plus 1/4 sine of t times

262
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:01,640
this thing in here, so times
2 sine of t cosine of t.

263
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,230
Just a trig identity, nothing
more than that.

264
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,870
And then finally I have this
minus 1/2 sine squared t

265
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,520
cosine of t.

266
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,590
No one ever said this was
going to be easy, but

267
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,610
hopefully it's instructive
on some level.

268
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,940
At least it shows you that you
didn't memorize your trig

269
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,230
identities for nothing.

270
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,190
So let me rewrite the whole
thing, or let me just

271
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,420
rewrite this part.

272
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,100
So this is equal to 1/4.

273
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,810
Now, I have-- well let
me see, 1/4 times 2.

274
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,040
1/4 times 2 is 1/2.

275
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,450
And then sine squared
of t, right?

276
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,490
This sine times this sine is
sine squared of t cosine of t.

277
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:45,180
And then this one over here is
minus 1/2 sine squared of t

278
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,930
cosine of t.

279
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,920
And luckily for us, or lucky
for us, these cancel out.

280
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,900
And, of course, we had this
guy out in the front.

281
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:58,640
We had this 1/2t sine
t out in front.

282
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,900
Now, this guy cancels with this
guy, and all we're left

283
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,450
with, through this whole hairy
problem, and this is pretty

284
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:11,180
satisfying, is 1/2t sine of t.

285
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,450
So we just showed you that the
convolution-- if I define--

286
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,869
let me write our result.

287
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:23,260
I feel like writing this
in stone because

288
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,119
this was so much work.

289
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:32,800
But if we write that f of t is
equal to sine of t, and g of t

290
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,870
is equal to cosine of t, I
just showed you that the

291
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:41,040
convolution of f with g, which
is a function of t, which is

292
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:48,950
defined as the integral from 0
to t of f of t minus tau times

293
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:54,180
g of tau d tau, which was equal
to-- and I'll switch

294
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,400
colors here-- which was equal to
the integral from 0 to t of

295
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:08,470
sine of t minus tau times g of
tau d tau, that all of this

296
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,180
mess, all of this convolution,
it all equals-- and this is

297
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:21,230
pretty satisfying-- it all
equals 1/2t sine of t.

298
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,400
And the whole reason why I went
through all of this mess

299
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,680
and kind of bringing out the
neurons that had the trig

300
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,280
identities memorized or having
to reproof them or whatever

301
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,310
else is to just show you that
this convolution, it is

302
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,740
convoluted and it seems a little
bit bizarre, but you

303
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,100
really can take the convolutions
of actual

304
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,390
functions and get an
actual answer.

305
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,250
So the convolution of sine
of t with cosine of t is

306
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,660
1/2t sine of t.

307
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,060
So, hopefully, you have a little
of intuition of-- well,

308
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,370
not intuition, but you at least
have a little bit of

309
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,620
hands-on understanding of how
the convolution can be

310
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,870
calculated.

311
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,240
