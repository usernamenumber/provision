00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:08,057
Some people use the letters FOIL as a strategy for making sure they have multiplied all the terms.

2
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:12,857
Use the FOIL approach to multiply (3x + 2)(5x - 7).

3
00:00:12,857 --> 00:00:17,133
I'm actually not one of those people who like to use the FOIL letters,

4
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:20,380
because it's just a form of memorization as opposed to realizing

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,860
that you're just using the distributive property, twice.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,718
but with that said, let's actually use FOIL,

7
00:00:24,718 --> 00:00:27,144
so that you'll see that it actually is the same thing

8
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:29,575
as using the distributive property twice.

9
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:32,073
So just to remember FOIL,

10
00:00:32,078 --> 00:00:34,144
it literally stands for:

11
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:36,789
so F.O.I.L.

12
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:41,018
The F in FOIL stands for First

13
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:44,747
The O stands for Outside

14
00:00:44,747 --> 00:00:47,937
The I stands for Inside

15
00:00:47,937 --> 00:00:50,175
and the L stands for Last.

16
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,702
So not only do you have to remember FOIL,

17
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:54,514
but you have to remember what each of these

18
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:56,082
letters actually stand for.

19
00:00:56,082 --> 00:00:58,172
But let's see how that applies to this

20
00:00:58,172 --> 00:01:00,004
to multiplying these two binomials.

21
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:11,634
So we have (3x + 2)(5x - 7)

22
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:13,867
So we're starting with the first,

23
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:15,444
we're starting with the F

24
00:01:15,444 --> 00:01:17,219
we have to multiply the first terms

25
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,722
in each of the binomials

26
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:22,933
So that's going to be 3x*5x

27
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,635
Then we do that outside terms,

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,276
so that's going to be the 3x times the -7

29
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:38,917
so this is going to be plus 3x times -7

30
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:44,583
then we want to do the inside terms

31
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,200
we want to do the things in green.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,415
so that's the 2 and the 5x

33
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:52,067
so that's plus 2*5x

34
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:54,939
and then we want to do the last terms

35
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,118
which are 2 and -7

36
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,942
so plus 2 times -7

37
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:03,013
and we end up getting

38
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:06,944
3x * 5x is 15x^2

39
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:09,177
plus, or I should say minus

40
00:02:09,177 --> 00:02:10,970
because there's going to be a negative sign here

41
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,287
so 3x * (-7) is -21x

42
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:23,667
then we have 2 * 5x is

43
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,491
plus 10x

44
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:29,684
and then 2 * (-7) is -14

45
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:31,313
now it's minus 14

46
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:36,667
and we can these two middle terms together

47
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:39,916
if we have -21x and we add 10x to that

48
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:45,878
that gives us -11x

49
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:48,077
and then these other terms over here

50
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:53,370
we have 15x^2-11x-14

51
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,056
so we just used FOIL

52
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:57,050
what I want to do is show you that this

53
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,938
is the same as using the distributive property twice

54
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:03,685
so if we have, I'll rewrite the problem

55
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:12,287
(3x + 2)(5x - 7)

56
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:14,606
what we can do is distribute the (5x - 7)

57
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:17,114
we can multiply that by the 3x

58
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,603
and we can also multiply that -

59
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:20,430
let me make it clear when I say 'that'

60
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,917
I mean this whole (5x - 7) -

61
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:25,938
we can multiply it by the 3x and also by the 2

62
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:51,600
we get 3x (5x - 7) + 2 (5x - 7)

63
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:00,446
and then this gives us 3x * 5x is going to be 15x^2

64
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:07,874
3x * -7 is going to be -21x

65
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:10,520
then, remember this step we're just applying

66
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,930
the distributive property again,

67
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,673
so then we have 2 * 5x is just going to be 10x

68
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:21,718
and then we have 2 * -7 is -14

69
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:23,941
so we actually got exactly the same result

70
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:26,263
that we did when we applied FOIL

71
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:31,511
and when you simplify it, you get this answer again.
