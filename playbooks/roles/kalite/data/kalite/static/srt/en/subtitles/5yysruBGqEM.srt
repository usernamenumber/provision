1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,540
Welcome back. We're doing problem number ten.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,020
And I just drew the figure. They said a right,

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:12,820
circular cylinder with radius 5 and height 4 has volume v.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,550
So what's the volume of this?

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,930
The volume of the cylinder-they give you the formula actually

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,380
but it's just the area of the base,

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,880
or the area of the top of the cylinder times its height.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,970
So it's pi r squared, where the radius is 5,

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,970
so that's pi times 25--5 squared-- times the height, times 4.

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,500
So v is equal to 100 pi. Fair enough.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,870
Then they say, in terms of v, what is the volume of

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,020
a right circular cylinder with radius 5 and height 8?

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,200
Oh, you see I didn't even have to do all this

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,220
because now this new cylinder is just like this cylinder,

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,340
right? But instead of having height 4 it has height 8.

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,560
See I didn't have to know that formula, oh my god.

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,370
I wanted to draw the ellipse.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,940
So this new cylinder looks something like this,

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,840
although I'm not drawing it really to scale,

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,970
but I think you get the point.

21
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,180
The new cylinder you can kind of just--

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,000
then new cylinder has height 8.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,420
So what, the new cylinder is twice the size of

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,920
the previous cylinder, right?

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,520
The previous cylinder had height 4, radius 5.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,940
This new cylinder has radius 5, height 8.

27
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,860
So the new cylinder is going to be twice the volume, right?

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,470
The volume for this is v, so the volume for the new one is--

29
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,460
it's twice as high so it's going to have twice the volume--

30
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,480
so 2v.So it's answer B.You didn't even have to know all this.

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,250
See you can go on the wrong track very quickly.

32
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,920
Although if you did it that way,

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,540
you would get the right answer. Problem number eleven.

34
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:02,890
If k, n and r are integers, let k be defined--

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:13,930
let k diamond, n, r-- be defined to be true only if--

36
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:27,260
so k diamond is true if n is less than k,which is less than r

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:38,810
Then they tell us that minus 2 diamond n, 0 is true.

38
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,190
Which of the following could be a possible value of n?

39
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,150
So let's just translate this into this world, right?

40
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,550
So this is true. Minus 2 diamond n, 0 is true.

41
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,290
So that means that we just pattern match, right?

42
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:03,950
K is minus 2, n is n, and r is 0. So our n is just n.

43
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,740
So that means n is less than k.

44
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:14,000
K is minus 2, which is less than our r. Our r is 0.

45
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,660
So n is less than minus 2, which is less than 0.

46
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,260
I mean obviously minus 2 is less than 0.

47
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,440
So which of the following could be a possible value of n?

48
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,630
So they give us three choices.

49
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:32,730
I is minus 3, II is minus 1 and then III is positive 3.

50
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,270
Well , which of these numbers is less than negative 2?

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,100
Positive 3 isn't. Negative 1 is greater than negative 2,

52
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,610
so all we're left with is choice I.

53
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,100
Not too hard of a problem right? A.It just looks complicated.

54
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,740
Image. Invert colors. Problem twelve.

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,690
If 20% of x is equal to 80% of y--

56
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,000
so immediately my brain converts that to decimals.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,180
So 0.20x is equal to 0.80y.

58
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,080
Which of the following expresses y in terms of x?

59
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,180
So we want y in terms of x, so let's solve for y.

60
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,870
We divide both sides by 0.80.

61
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:27,300
So y is equal to 0.20 divided by 0.80 times x. Right?

62
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,530
I switched them around too, right?

63
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,900
I switched the two sides, but I divided both sides by 0.8,

64
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,770
that's all I did. So y is equal to-- what's 0.2 over 0.8?

65
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,790
Well that's the same thing as 2 over 8, or 0.25x.

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:53,460
Or, y is 25% of x. And that is choice B. Next problem.

67
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,060
It's a very cold day today. My feet are cold.

68
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,510
I should go do a run, run a hill or something.

69
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,110
All right. Problem number thirteen.

70
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,350
If x, y and z-- this seems familiar, anyway- if x, y and z

71
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:21,440
are positive integers such that the value of x plus y is even

72
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:31,920
and the value of x plus y squared plus x plus z is odd,

73
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,450
which is the following is true?

74
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,060
And they give a bunch of choices.

75
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,030
So this is actually quite interesting.

76
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:47,060
So let's see what we can say. Can we say that x is odd?

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,810
That's choice A, x is odd. If x plus y is even,

78
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,870
then x plus y squared will also be even, right?

79
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,890
x plus y squared is also going to be even. So this is even.

80
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,090
But if this is even and then this whole thing is odd,

81
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,570
the only way you can add something to an even number

82
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,330
and get an odd number is if the thing you added was odd.

83
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,250
And you can think about that. So x plus z is odd.

84
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,280
So we essentially know two things. x plus y is even.

85
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,960
And we also know that x plus z is odd, right?

86
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,000
And how did we figure out x plus z is odd?

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,590
Because we know x plus y is even,

88
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,320
x plus y squared must be even,

89
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,910
and the only way to add something to something

90
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,310
that's even and get an odd number is

91
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,590
if that thing you add is odd.So we know that x plus z is odd.

92
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,510
This is interesting. So we know x plus y is even.

93
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,140
x plus z is odd. So do we know for sure that x is odd?

94
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,470
Well no. x could be even. x could be 2, y could be 2.

95
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,930
And x could be 2 and z could be 1.

96
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,340
So we don't know that x is odd.

97
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,940
And then choice B says x is even. Well, not necessarily.

98
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,790
x could be odd. x could be 1, y could be 1, x could be 1 here

99
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,440
and z could be 2. So that all works.

100
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,940
So choice B doesn't work either.

101
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,870
Now choices C and D look interesting.

102
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:36,590
If z is even then x is odd. That is true.

103
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,510
Because if we add these two numbers and we get an odd number

104
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,840
and we know that z is even, if this number is even,

105
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,910
then this number has to be odd.

106
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,550
And you can try it out with numbers

107
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,160
if you don't believe me. So C is true.

108
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,110
And we could go through the other ones

109
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,710
but you only have to pick one so C is definitely true.

110
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,490
If z is even then x is definitely odd.

111
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,880
Because the only way to add something to an even number

112
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,030
and get an odd number is if you add it to an odd number.

113
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,280
Let's do problem number fourteen if I have time.

114
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,110
Problem fourteen. 0 is less than x which is less than 1.

115
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,030
Which of the following statements must be true?

116
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:31,260
Statement I is, x squared is greater than x cubed.

117
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,170
Statement II is x is greater than x/2.

118
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:43,570
Statement III says that x is greater than x to the third.

119
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,810
So x is pretty much a fraction.

120
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,170
It's a positive fraction less than one.

121
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,320
And you know what, let's just try out a number.

122
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,330
Let's just try out x is equal to 1/2

123
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,970
and that'll simplify things.

124
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,030
Because really all the fractions between 0 and 1

125
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,350
have the same properties when you take the exponents.

126
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,510
So let's see, is this true? 1/2 squared is 1/4.

127
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,760
1/4 is greater than 1/8. Well yeah, sure, that's true.

128
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:17,060
Is 1/2 greater than 1/4? Right? 1/2 divided by 2 is 1/4.

129
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,700
Well sure, that's true.

130
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,410
And finally is 1/2 greater than 1/2 to the third?

131
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,010
Sure. 1/2 to the third is 1/8.

132
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,350
So 1/2 is definitely greater than 1/2 to the third, right?

133
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,190
And they're all positive numbers

134
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,430
so all three of them are true. So it's choice E.

135
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,060
And that's all the time I have in this video.

136
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,590
I will do problem number fifteen in the next video. See you
