1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,040
We're on problem 119.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,230
Is 2x minus 3y less than x squared?

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:16,990
2x minus 3y less than x squaredŁżthey ask us.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,530
All right, let's see if we can figure it out.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,010
Statement 1, 2x minus 3y is equal to minus 2.

6
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,920
So they're telling us that the left-hand side of this

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,470
original question is equal to minus 2. So now this question,

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,450
if we take statement 1 into consideration,

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,070
it boils down to is minus 2 less than x squared?

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,930
So first you might be saying, oh, I don't know.

11
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't know what x is. But think about it.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,030
Can x be a negative number? At worst case, x is 0.

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,620
That's the worst case. If x was anything else,

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,080
x squared is going to be a positive number.

15
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,610
So we actually know, just from statement 1, that negative 2

16
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,000
has to be less than x squared, unless x was some type of

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,770
weird, imaginary number or something.

18
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,490
I think that doesn't occur on the GMAT.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,880
So statement 1 alone is sufficient.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,220
x squared is going to be at least 0 or some positive

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,040
number larger than 0. So statement 1 is sufficient.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:34,680
Statement two, x is greater than 2 and y is greater than 0.

23
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,810
So let me just try to come up with two contradictory cases

24
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,960
using these conditions to see. Let's say if x was--

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,030
and they don't tell us that anything is an integer here.

26
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:56,350
So if x was 2.1,x is equal to 2.1 and y is equal to-- I don't

27
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:03,020
know--y is greater than 0.So let's say that y is equal to 0.1

28
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,710
Let's see what happens here. So 2 times 2.1.

29
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,640
You get 4.2 minus 3 times y.

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,980
So minus 0.3 is less than x squared. It's what?

31
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,710
It's like 4 point something. So it's greater than 2.

32
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,020
This is interesting.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,200
Actually this is interesting.

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,080
So actually, you don't have to try examples out.

35
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,270
Let's just write the equation down.

36
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:44,000
2x minus 3y is less than x squared.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,750
So if y is greater than 0, which they tell us in

38
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,900
statement 2, then the quantity on the left-hand side is

39
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,580
always going to be 2x.

40
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,580
It's always going to be less than 2x, right?

41
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,370
Because this'll have some positive value.

42
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,700
It might have an insignificantly small value.

43
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,410
We could make it 0.000001.

44
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,430
But it's still going to have some positive value.

45
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,170
So no matter what y we choose, as long as it's greater than

46
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,080
0, 2x minus 3y will be greater than 2x.

47
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:21,750
So we could say that as long as if 2x is less than x squared for any x

48
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,610
we pick, then 2x minus 3y is definitely going to be less

49
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,200
than x squared. Why is that?

50
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,130
Because minus 3y is going to subtract from the 2x,

51
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,010
because we know that y is greater than 0.

52
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,020
So let me ask you a question.

53
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,860
Is 2x always going to be less than x squared if x is

54
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,870
greater than 2? Sure.

55
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,630
I mean whatever x is, on the left-hand side it's going to

56
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:55,440
be 2 times--pick a random number--2 times xŁŹit could be 2.5.

57
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,690
But on the other side, on the right-hand side,

58
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,650
you're going to have 2.5 squared. So if you think about it,

59
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,110
you're going to have 2 times a number.

60
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,040
That's always going to be less than--ŁŹthat number

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,030
which happens to be larger than 2 squared.

62
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:17,080
The smallest possible is 2 times 2.0001.

63
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,740
You could make a lot of 0's there.

64
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,640
But I think you get the point.

65
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,080
That's still going to be less than 2.0001 squared.

66
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,000
Because you only have a 2 here instead of a 2.0001.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,040
So actually, statement 2 alone is sufficient.

68
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,820
Hopefully that made sense.

69
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,560
You just have to see oh, if y is greater than 0,

70
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,420
then the 3y is definitely going to take away from the 2x.

71
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,580
Then as long as x is greater than 2,

72
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,010
2x is always going to be less than x squared.

73
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,340
If that makes sense to you, then you should realize that

74
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,560
statement 2 alone is sufficient for this.

75
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,000
That was interesting. Oh, no sorry.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Either of them alone were sufficient.

77
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,760
We did that in the first one, right?

78
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,220
Statement 1 or statement 2,

79
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,330
independently are sufficient to answer that question. 120.

80
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,710
A report consisting of 2,600 words is divided into 23

81
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,250
paragraphs.

82
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:19,000
So 2,600 words and it has 23 paragraphs.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,580
A two-paragraph preface is then added to the report.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,810
Is the average number of words per paragraph for all 25

85
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:39,840
paragraphs less than 120? So this is interesting.

86
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,970
So the average number of words per paragraph for all 25

87
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,400
paragraphs less than 120.

88
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,830
So if we knew the total number of words in the

89
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,930
document we'd be set.

90
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,970
We would just take the total words divided by the total

91
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,900
paragraphs they have now.

92
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,750
They have the 23 original plus the 2 from the preface,

93
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,580
you have 25 total paragraphs.

94
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,030
Now it told you the average words per paragrah.

95
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,470
Now, we don't know the total words, because the total is

96
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,530
going to be equal to the 2,600 words in the body of the

97
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,980
document plus the words from the preface-- I'll call that

98
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,490
words sub preface-- all of that divided by 25.

99
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,520
This is the average.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,420
This is what we really have to figure out,

101
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,020
to figure out if it's less than 120.

102
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,010
That's what they want to know. So statement number 1.

103
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:44,480
Each paragraph of the preface has more than 100 words.

104
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,080
So I guess we could say that the preface, the words from

105
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,030
the preface are greater than 200.

106
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,420
That's another way of saying that the total is going to be

107
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,010
greater than 2,800.

108
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,070
Now if the total is greater than 2,800, what does that

109
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,610
tell us about the total divided by-- excuse me.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,530
So then the total divided by 25 is going to be greater than

111
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,420
2,800 divided by 25.

112
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:27,090
What's 2,800 divided by 25? Let's see, 25 goes into 2,800.

113
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:37,070
1, 25, 30, 1, 1 times 25, 25, 50, 12.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,590
So it tells us that the average is going to be

115
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,350
greater than 112. So that doesn't help us.

116
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,410
If it told us that the average was going to be greater than

117
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,200
120, we would be done. We would say oh,

118
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,140
we have enough information to answer the question.

119
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,460
Actually, the answer is no,

120
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,430
that the average is going to be greater than 120.

121
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,080
But here, this tells us the average is greater than 112.

122
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,370
It could be 113 or it could be 121.

123
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,700
So it doesn't answer our question of whether the average

124
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,030
is less than 120. So statement one alone is not that useful.

125
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,370
Statement number 2 tells us each paragraph of the preface

126
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,060
has fewer than 150 words.

127
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:23,010
So the total preface has less than 300 words.

128
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,850
They say each paragraph of the preface,

129
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,540
and there's 2 of them, has fewer than 150 words.

130
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,250
So the total preface has less than 300 words.

131
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,270
So we could do the same logic.

132
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,050
So that means that the total is going to be less than what?

133
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,480
The total is going to be less than the original number of

134
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,000
words plus the preface.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,250
So it's going to be less than 2,600 plus 300.

136
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,040
It's going to be less than 2,900.

137
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Then if you divide both sides by 25 to get the average,

138
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,630
25 goes into 2,900 really four more times.

139
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,040
That's rightŁż

140
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,150
The average is going to be less than-- let me make sure

141
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm getting that right.

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:26,140
So 4, 25 goes into 2,900. 1, 25, 40, 1, 25.

143
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,860
Then we have 150. 25 goes into 150 six times.

144
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,630
So we have the average is less than 1/16.

145
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,810
So statement 2 alone is sufficient.

146
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,120
Statement 2 tells us that the average of the words per

147
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,610
paragraph is less than 116,which is definitely less than 120.

148
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,160
So statement 2 alone is sufficient,

149
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,010
and statement 1 doesn't help us much. I'll run out of time.

150
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,090
See you in the next video.
