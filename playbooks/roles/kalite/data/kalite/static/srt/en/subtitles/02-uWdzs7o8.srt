Day 3 of sprout testosterone. Okay!

00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:25,036
So right now the motors are running and its starting to move in circles but it still

3
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:29,757
might need a little bit of adjustments to move in a straighter path

4
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:35,367
and able to detect to see if there is a wall and turn around and move

5
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:41,600
Working for this past few days have been a little hard as there is a lot of frustrating

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:49,259
parts and now at the end i am really happy of my work to get it to finally start moving.

00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:53,003
