1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,374
Let's say we have the simplest

2
00:00:02,374 --> 00:00:03,769
of arithmetic sequences

3
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:05,436
and probably the simplest of sequences

4
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:06,667
one, two...

5
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:07,773
we're going to start at one

6
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:08,660
and just increment by one

7
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,659
one, two, three

8
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:13,643
and we're going to go all the way to n

9
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:14,905
And what I want to think about is

10
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:17,907
what is the sum of this sequence going to be?

11
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:20,249
And the sum of a sequence, we already know

12
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:21,842
we call a series

13
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:23,433
so what is the sum

14
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:25,075
and I will just call it Sn

15
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:26,436
what is this going to be equal to

16
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:30,905
one plus two plus three plus

17
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:34,909
going all the way to n

18
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,041
well, we're going to do a neat little trick here

19
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,661
where I'm going to rewrite this sum

20
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:42,799
so I will write it again as Sn

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,436
but now I'm just going to write it in reverse order

22
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:47,910
I'm going to write it as n plus n minus one

23
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,107
plus n minus two

24
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:53,904
all the way to one

25
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:56,572
and now I'm going to add these two equations

26
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:58,409
So we know that Sn is equal to this

27
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,506
so we are adding the same thing to both sides of this equation up here

28
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:05,902
So on the left hand side we're going to have Sn plus Sn

29
00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:08,441
is just two times Sn

30
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:10,036
and on the right hand side

31
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,835
and this is where we start to see something kind of cool

32
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:15,916
you have a one plus an n

33
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,769
which is just going to be n plus one

34
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:22,501
you have a two plus n minus one

35
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,332
which is... well two plus n minus one

36
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:27,108
is going to be n plus one again

37
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:29,913
plus n plus one

38
00:01:29,913 --> 00:01:32,976
you have a three plus n minus two

39
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:36,706
well that's going to be n plus one again

40
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:38,437
I think you see what is going on here

41
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:42,990
And we're going to go all the way to this last pair

42
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,664
I guess you could say, or call it these last two terms

43
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:50,970
and we have an n plus one again

44
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,580
plus n plus one

45
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,168
So how many of these n plus one's do we have?

46
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:57,700
well we have n of them

47
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,836
there were n of these terms in each of these equations

48
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:03,077
one two three... all the way to n

49
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:06,909
So, we can rewrite this thing as two times Sn

50
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,577
is equal to, and you have n (n+1) terms

51
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:14,642
so we could write it as n times n plus one

52
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:17,702
n times n plus one

53
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:21,991
and now to solve for Sn to solve for our sum

54
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:26,835
we can just divide both sides by two

55
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:31,640
And so we are going to be left with the sum from one to n

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,582
this arithmetic sequence where we're just incrementing by one

57
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:41,416
starting at one, is going to be equal to n times n plus one over two

58
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:45,993
And this is neat because now you can quickly find the sum

59
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:47,747
let's say from one to a hundred

60
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:51,769
it will be 100 times 101 over 2

61
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,903
So very quickly you can find these sums

62
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:56,835
And what I'm curious about and what we will explore in the next video

63
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:59,768
is can we generalize this for any arithmetic sequence

64
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:01,299
we started with a very simple one

65
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:03,749
we started at one, we just incremented by one

66
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:06,799
And it looks like

67
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:08,170
so if I were to write it this way

68
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,969
this is n times (n + 1) over 2

69
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:17,709
So this right over here, this n

70
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,102
this is the nth term in our sequence

71
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:21,768
and this right over here, this one

72
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,836
was the first term in our sequence

73
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,769
So at least in this case it looks like I took the average

74
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,168
of the first term and the nth term

75
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,769
so this right over here

76
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:33,911
this is the average

77
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:39,502
this right over here is the average

78
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:42,909
of a1 and an

79
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:45,663
and then I'm multiplying that times n

80
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:48,041
and what I'm curious about is whether this is going to be true

81
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,325
for any arithmetic sequence

82
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:51,659
that the sum of it is going to be the average of the first

83
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,659
and the last term times the number of terms
