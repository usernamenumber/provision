1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:02,545
We've talked a lot about demand

2
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:04,820
So now let's talk about supply!

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,711
And we'll use grapes for this example

4
00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:09,479
We'll pretend to be grape farmers of some sort

5
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:11,355
So I'll start by introducing you

6
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:13,723
(and maybe I'll do it in purple in honor of the grapes)

7
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:19,389
to the law of supply which, like the law of demand,

8
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:21,014
makes a lot of intuitive sense

9
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:22,639
If we hold all else equal

10
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:23,790
and in the next few videos

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,827
we'll talk about what happens

12
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:26,418
when we change some of those things

13
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:27,655
that we'll hold equal right now

14
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:29,559
but if you hold all else equal

15
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,333
and the only thing that you're doing

16
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,347
is you're changing price

17
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:35,318
then the law of supply says

18
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:37,172
that if the price goes up

19
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:38,475
I'll just say p for price

20
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:41,000
if the price goes up then the supply

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,469
and let me be careful

22
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:48,646
the quantity supplied goes up

23
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:50,225
And then you can imagine

24
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:52,080
if the price goes down

25
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,819
the quantity supplied goes down

26
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:58,630
And you might already notice that

27
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,816
that I was careful to say quantity supplied

28
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:05,377
And it's just like we saw with demand

29
00:01:05,377 --> 00:01:08,151
When we talk about demand going up or down

30
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:12,731
we're talking about the entire price/quantity relationship shifting

31
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:15,906
When we're talking about a particular quantity demanded

32
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:17,299
we say quantity demanded

33
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:18,333
we don't just say demand

34
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,933
This is the exact same thing for supply

35
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:21,618
When we're talking about a particular quantity

36
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:23,244
we'll be careful to say quantity

37
00:01:23,244 --> 00:01:24,822
If we talk about supply increasing

38
00:01:24,822 --> 00:01:27,562
we're talking about the entire relationship shifting

39
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:29,933
either up or down

40
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:33,308
So let's just make sure this makes intuitive sense for us

41
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:35,434
and I think it probably does.

42
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:37,547
Let's think about ourselves as grape farmers

43
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:40,171
and I'll make a little supply schedule right over here

44
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:41,843
Supply...

45
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:46,556
so grape supply schedule which is really just a table

46
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:49,482
showing the relationship between, all else equal,

47
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:52,222
the price and the quantity supplied

48
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:55,241
So let's label some scenarios over here

49
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,820
just like we did with the demand schedule

50
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,882
Scenarios... and let's put our price over here

51
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:08,197
and this'll be in price/lb the per pound price of grapes

52
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:11,541
and this is the quantity produced over the time period

53
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,191
and whenever we do any of these

54
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:14,926
supply or demand schedules

55
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,905
we're talking over a particular time period

56
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:17,787
It could be per day.

57
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:19,200
It could be per month.

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,312
It could be per year.

59
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:22,547
but that's the only way to make some sense of

60
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:25,539
OK, what is the quantity per day going to be produced,

61
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:26,658
if that's the price?

62
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:27,470
We didn't say per day...

63
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,908
We don't know what we're talking about.

64
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:36,735
Quantity supplied...

65
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:41,982
And so let's just say Scenario A

66
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:47,281
If the price per pound of grapes is 50 cents

67
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:48,856
if it's 50 cents per pound

68
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:52,617
actually let me just do round numbers

69
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:54,243
but you get the idea

70
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:55,566
The price per pound is $1.

71
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,122
Let's just say for us

72
00:02:57,122 --> 00:02:59,815
we consider that to be a relatively low price .

73
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:04,483
And so we'll only kind of do the easiest land

74
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:06,267
our most fertile land where it's easy to produce grapes

75
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:10,241
and maybe the fertile and cheap land

76
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,267
so no-one else wants to use the land for other things

77
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:13,910
it's only good for growing grapes

78
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,370
And so we will provide,

79
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,432
--so this is price per pound--

80
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:26,913
In that situation we can produce 1000 lbs in this year.

81
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:28,533
And I've never been a grape farmer,

82
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,398
so I actually don't know

83
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:31,069
if that's a reasonable amount or not

84
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,229
but I'll just go with it, 1000 lbs.

85
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:35,713
Now, let's take Scenario B

86
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:38,268
Let's say the price goes up to $2

87
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:39,847
Well now not only would we produce

88
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,193
what we were producing before,

89
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:44,235
but we might now wanna buy some more land

90
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:46,464
land that might have had other uses

91
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:49,483
land that's maybe not as productive for grapes

92
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:52,223
but we would because now we can get more for grapes

93
00:03:52,223 --> 00:04:03,113
and so maybe now we're willing to produce 2000 lbs.

94
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:03,995
And we could keep going

95
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,480
the same dynamics keep happening

96
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,238
so let's say if the price were $3 per pound

97
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,910
now we do want to produce more,

98
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,882
maybe now we're even willing to work a little harder,

99
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,251
or plant things closer to each other,

100
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:23,400
or maybe I'll get even more land involved than

101
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,000
I would've otherwise used for other crops

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,582
and so then I'm gonna produce 2500 pounds

103
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:33,252
And I'll do one more scenario.

104
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:34,646
Let's say Scenario D.

105
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:37,084
the price goes to $4 a pound

106
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:40,501
Same dynamic, I'll stop planting other crops.

107
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,326
And use them now for grapes

108
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:44,194
because grape prices are so high

109
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:50,000
and so I will produce 2750 pounds

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,245
And so we can draw a supply curve

111
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:56,217
just as we have drawn demand curves

112
00:04:56,217 --> 00:05:00,257
and it's the same exact convention

113
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:03,098
which I'm not a fan of putting price on the vertical axis

114
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:04,367
because as you see,

115
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:07,154
we tend to talk about price as an independent variable.

116
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:08,895
we don't always talk about it that way

117
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:10,753
and in most of math and science

118
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:12,750
you put the independent variable on the horizontal axis

119
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,677
but the convention in economics is

120
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:16,767
to put it on the vertical axis.

121
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,299
So price on the vertical axis

122
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:22,897
and so this is really price per pound

123
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:28,210
And then on the horizontal axis quantity, produced.

124
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,133
Let me just write quantity produced.

125
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll say in the next year

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,447
we're assuming all of this is for the next year

127
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:40,600
and it's in thousands of pounds

128
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,374
so I'll put it in thousands of pounds.

129
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:48,833
And so let's see we all the way from 1000 to close to 3000

130
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:53,667
so this is 1000

131
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:56,600
that's 1 for 1000 that's 2000 and that is 3000

132
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,911
and the price goes all the way up to 4

133
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,880
so it's 1 2 3 and then 4

134
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,202
So we can just plot these points

135
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:09,429
these are specific points on the supply curve.

136
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:15,606
So at $1 we would supply 1000 pounds

137
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:17,287
That's Scenario A.

138
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:23,965
At $2 we would supply 2000 pounds.

139
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:25,544
That's Scenario B.

140
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:29,333
At $3 we would supply 2500 pounds.

141
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,324
$3....I am sorry....

142
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:35,733
See...notice I get my axes confused

143
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,933
This is price.

144
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:38,965
This isn't what when we talk about it this way

145
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,420
that we're kind of viewing as the thing that's changing

146
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,920
although you don't always have to be that way.

147
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:50,862
So $1-1000 pounds, $2-2000 pounds,

148
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:57,030
$3--not this, this isn't $3--this is $3--$3-2500 pounds.

149
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,306
So I'll write about that.

150
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:01,067
That's about 2500.

151
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,733
I want to do it in that blue color

152
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,867
so we don't get confused

153
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:08,077
So $3-2500 pounds.

154
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:09,708
That's about right.

155
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,380
So this is Scenario C.

156
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,008
And then Scenario D at $4

157
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:16,280
Actually let me be a little bit clearer with that

158
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,905
because we're getting a little close

159
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:22,247
This is 2500 pounds gets us right over here.

160
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:24,067
This is Scenario C.

161
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:29,099
And then Scenario D at $4-2750

162
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,878
So 2750 is like right over there

163
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:33,416
So that is $4.

164
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,333
That is Scenario D.

165
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,644
And if we connect them,

166
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:41,200
they should all be on our supply curve.

167
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,699
So they will all be...

168
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,733
it would look something like that.

169
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,549
And there's some minimum price

170
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:52,667
we would need to supply some grapes at all.

171
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:53,752
We wouldn't give them away for free

172
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:57,055
so maybe that minimum price is like over here.

173
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:59,097
that just to even get started producing grapes

174
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:00,839
So this right over here is

175
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,091
what our supply curve would look like.

176
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:05,297
Now remember the only thing we're varying here

177
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:06,504
is the price.

178
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:09,131
So if the price were to change all else equal

179
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:12,124
we would move along this curve here.

180
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,378
Now in the next few videos

181
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:14,900
I'll talk about all of those other things

182
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,350
we've been holding equal

183
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,720
and what they would do,

184
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,413
at any given price point, to this curve,

185
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:23,459
or in general what they would do to the curve.
