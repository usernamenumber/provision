1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,280
   

2
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,300
I just got sent this
problem, and it's a

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,350
pretty meaty problem.

4
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,910
A lot harder than what
you'd normally find

5
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:05,580
in most textbooks.

6
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,470
So I thought it would help
us all to work it out.

7
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,190
And it's one of those problems
that when you first read it,

8
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,630
your eyes kind of glaze over,
but when you understand what

9
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,340
they're talking about, it's
reasonably interesting.

10
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,580
So they say, the curve in the
figure above is the parabola

11
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,190
y is equal to x squared.

12
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,150
So this curve right there is
y is equal to x squared.

13
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,260
Let us define a normal line as
a line whose first quadrant

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,650
intersection with the parabola
is perpendicular

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,940
to the parabola.

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,920
So this is the first
quadrant, right here.

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,230
And they're saying that a
normal line is something, when

18
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,570
the first quadrant intersection
with the parabola is

19
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,720
normal to the parabola.

20
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,870
So if I were to draw a tangent
line right there, this line is

21
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,450
normal to that tangent line.

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,070
That's all that's saying.

23
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,470
So this is a normal
line, right there.

24
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,250
Normal line.

25
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,090
Fair enough.

26
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,410
5 normal lines are
shown in the figure.

27
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,750
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

28
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,200
Good enough.

29
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,010
And these all look
perpendicular, or normal to

30
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,540
the parabola in the first
quadrant intersection,

31
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,100
so that makes sense.

32
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,420
For a while, the x-coordinate
of the second quadrant

33
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,140
intersection of the normal line
of the parabola gets smaller,

34
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,970
as the x-coordinate of the
first quadrant intersection

35
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:17,570
gets smaller.

36
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,760
So let's see what happens as
the x-quadrant of the first

37
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,570
intersection gets smaller.

38
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,620
So this is where I left
off in that dense text.

39
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,050
So if I start at this point
right here, my x-coordinate

40
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,840
right there would look
something like this.

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,170
Let me go down.

42
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,380
my x-coordinate is
right around there.

43
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,080
And then as I move to a smaller
x-coordinate to, say, this one

44
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,170
right here, what happened
to the normal line?

45
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,380
Or even more important, what
happened to the intersection

46
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,590
of the normal line in
the second quadrant?

47
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,740
This is the second
quadrant, right here.

48
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,520
So when I had a larger
x-value here, my normal

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,110
line intersected here,
in the second quadrant.

50
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,470
Then when I brought my x-value
in, when I lowered my x-value,

51
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,420
my x-value here, because this
is the next point, right here,

52
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,960
my x-value at the intersection
here, went-- actually,

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,910
their wording is bad.

54
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,570
They're saying that
the second quadrant

55
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,510
intersection gets smaller.

56
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,500
But actually, it's not
really getting smaller.

57
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,870
It's getting less negative.

58
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,430
I guess smaller could be just
absolute value or magnitude,

59
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,380
but it's just getting
less negative.

60
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,060
It's moving there, but
it's actually becoming

61
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,040
a larger number, right?

62
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,510
It's becoming less negative,
but a larger number.

63
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,110
But if we think in absolute
value, I guess it's

64
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,920
getting smaller, right?

65
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,550
As we went from that point to
that point, as we moved the x

66
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,660
in for the intersection of the
first quadrant, the second

67
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,430
quadrant intersection also
moved in a bit, from

68
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,640
that line to that line.

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,890
Fair enough.

70
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,300
But eventually, a normal line
second quadrant intersection

71
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,270
gets as small as it can get.

72
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,520
So if we keep lowering our
x-value in the first quadrant,

73
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,210
so we keep on pulling in the
first quadrant, as we

74
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,480
get to this point.

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,060
And then this point intersects
the second quadrant,

76
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,390
right there.

77
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,580
And then, if you go even
smaller x-values in the first

78
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,150
quadrant then your normal line
starts intersecting in the

79
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,240
second quadrant, further and
further negative numbers.

80
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,680
So you can kind of view this
as the highest value, or the

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,020
smallest absolute value, at
which the normal line can

82
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,720
intersect in the
second quadrant

83
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,870
Let me make that clear.

84
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,700
Up here, you were intersecting
when you had a large x in the

85
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,800
first quadrant, you had a large
negative x in the second

86
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,120
quadrant intersection.

87
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,890
And then as you lowered your
x-value, here, you had a

88
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,940
smaller negative value.

89
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,410
Up until you got to this point,
right here, you got this, which

90
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,980
you can view as the smallest
negative value could get, and

91
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,930
then when you pulled in your x
even more, these normal lines

92
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,280
started to push out again,
out in the second quadrant.

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,580
That's, I think, what
they're talking about.

94
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,220
The extreme normal line
is shown as a thick

95
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,230
line in the figure.

96
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:54,480
Right.

97
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,710
This is the extreme normal
line, right there.

98
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,500
So this is the extreme
one, that deep, bold one.

99
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,040
Extreme normal line.

100
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,600
After this point, when you pull
in your x-values even more, the

101
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,680
intersection in your second
quadrant starts to

102
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,900
push out some.

103
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,770
And you can think of the
extreme case, if you draw the

104
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,360
normal line down here, your
intersection with the second

105
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,260
quadrant is going to be way out
here someplace, although it

106
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,430
seems like it's kind of
asymptoting a little bit.

107
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:22,990
But I don't know.

108
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,060
Let's read the rest
of the problem.

109
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,385
Once the normal line passes
the extreme normal line, the

110
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:30,130
x-coordinates of their second
quadrant intersections what the

111
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,300
parabola start to increase.

112
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,520
And they're really, when they
say they start to increase,

113
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,100
they're actually just
becoming more negative.

114
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,550
That wording is bad.

115
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,560
I should change this to
more, more negative.

116
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,420
Or they're becoming
larger negative numbers.

117
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,450
Because once you get below
this, then all of a sudden

118
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,460
the x-intersections start
to push out more in

119
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,390
the second quadrant.

120
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,930
Fair enough.

121
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,640
The figures show 2
pairs of normal lines.

122
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,470
Fair enough.

123
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,740
The 2 normal lines of a pair
have the same second quadrant

124
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,730
intersection with the parabola,
but 1 is above the extreme

125
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,590
normal line, in the first
quadrant, the other

126
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,510
is below it.

127
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,180
Right, fair enough.

128
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,280
For example, this guy right
here, this is when we

129
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,360
had a large x-value.

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,760
He intersects with the
second quadrant there.

131
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,940
Then if you lower and lower the
x-value, if you lower it

132
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,930
enough, you pass the extreme
normal line, and then you get

133
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,890
to this point, and then this
point, he intersects, or

134
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,010
actually, you go to this point.

135
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,160
So if you pull in your x-value
enough, you once again

136
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,650
intersect at that same point
in the second quadrant.

137
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,510
So hopefully I'm making some
sense to you, as I try to make

138
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,410
some sense of this problem.

139
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:34,980
OK.

140
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,210
Now what do they want to know?

141
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,470
And I think I only have time
for the first part of this.

142
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,030
Maybe I'll do the second
part in the another video.

143
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,850
Find the equation of the
extreme normal line.

144
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,790
Well, that seems very daunting
at first, but I think our

145
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,790
toolkit of derivatives, and
what we know about equations

146
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,710
of a line, should be
able to get us there.

147
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,470
So what's the slope of
the tangent line at any

148
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,490
point on this curve?

149
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,540
Well, we just take the
derivative of y equals

150
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,910
x squared, and y prime
is just equal to 2x.

151
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:14,040
This is the slope of the
tangent at any point x.

152
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,290
So if I want to know the slope
of the tangent at x0, at some

153
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,250
particular x, I would just
say, well, let me just say,

154
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,010
slope, it would be 2 x0.

155
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,490
Or let me just say, f of
x0 is equal to 2 x0.

156
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,760
This is the slope at
any particular x0 of

157
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,310
the tangent line.

158
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,550
Now, the normal line slope
is perpendicular to this.

159
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,720
So the perpendicular line, and
I won't review it here, but the

160
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,730
perpendicular line has a
negative inverse slope.

161
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:54,460
So the slope of normal line at
x0 will be the negative inverse

162
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,590
of this, because this is the
slope of the tangent line x0.

163
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:03,090
So it'll be equal to
minus 1 over 2 x0.

164
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,510
Fair enough.

165
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:10,100
Now, what is the equation of
the normal line at x0 let's say

166
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,570
that this is my x0 in question.

167
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,500
What is the equation of
the normal line there?

168
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,960
Well, we can just use
the point-slope form

169
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,330
of our equation.

170
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,570
So this point right here
will be on the normal line.

171
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,230
And that's the
point x0 squared.

172
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,030
Because this the graph of
y equals x0, x squared.

173
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,720
So this normal line will
also have this point.

174
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,970
So we could say that the
equation of the normal line,

175
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:48,300
let me write it down, would
be equal to, this is just a

176
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,480
point-slope definition
of a line.

177
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,480
You say, y minus the y-point,
which is just x0 squared,

178
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,810
that's that right there, is
equal to the slope of the

179
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:08,865
normal line minus 1 over
2 x0 times x minus the

180
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:10,050
x-point that we're at.

181
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,680
Minus x, minus x0.

182
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,780
This is the equation
of the normal line.

183
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,260
So let's see.

184
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,620
And what we care about is when
x0 is greater than 0, right?

185
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,740
We care about the normal line
when we're in the first

186
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,410
quadrant, we're in all of
these values right there.

187
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,710
So that's my equation
of the normal line.

188
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,150
And let's solve it
explicitly in terms of x.

189
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,800
So y is a function of x.

190
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,780
Well, if I add x0 squared
to both sides, I get y is

191
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,760
equal to, actually, let
me multiply this guy out.

192
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:52,340
I get minus 1/2 x0 times x, and
then I have plus, plus, because

193
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,880
I have a minus times
a minus, plus 1/2.

194
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,110
The x0 and the over the
x0, they cancel out.

195
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,340
And then I have to add
this x0 to both sides.

196
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,560
So all I did so far, this is
just this part right there.

197
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,040
That's this right there.

198
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,260
And then I have to add this to
both sides of the equation, so

199
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,130
then I have plus x0 squared.

200
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,300
So this is the equation of the
normal line, in mx plus b form.

201
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,860
This is its slope, this is
the m, and then this is its

202
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,740
y-intercept right here.

203
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,280
That's kind of the b.

204
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,200
Now, what do we care about?

205
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,600
We care about where
this thing intersects.

206
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,990
We care about where it
intersects the parabola.

207
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,130
And the parabola, that's pretty
straightforward, that's just

208
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,590
y is equal to x squared.

209
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,960
So to figure out where they
intersect, we just have

210
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,660
to set the 2 y's to be
equal to each other.

211
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,110
So they intersect, the x-values
where they intersect, x

212
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,660
squared, this y would have
to be equal to that y.

213
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,940
Or we could just substitute
this in for that y.

214
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:02,870
So you get x squared is equal
to minus 1 over 2 x0 times x,

215
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:10,180
plus 1/2 plus x0 squared.

216
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,020
Fair enough.

217
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,350
And let's put this in a
quadratic equation, or try to

218
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,670
solve this, so we can apply
the quadratic equation.

219
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,410
So let's put all of this
stuff on the lefthand side.

220
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:29,420
So you get x squared plus
1 over 2 x0 times x minus

221
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:35,680
all of this, 1/2 plus x0
squared is equal to 0.

222
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,100
All I did is, I took all of
this stuff and I put it on the

223
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,770
lefthand side of the equation.

224
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,340
Now, this is just a standard
quadratic equation, so we can

225
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,680
figure out now where the
x-values that satisfy this

226
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,420
quadratic equation will tell
us where our normal line

227
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,890
and our parabola intersect.

228
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,850
So let's just apply the
quadratic equation here.

229
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,690
So the potential x-values,
where they intersect, x is

230
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,950
equal to minus b, I'm
just applying the

231
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,400
quadratic equation.

232
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:10,950
So minus b is minus 1 over
2 x0, plus or minus the

233
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,060
square root of b squared.

234
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,200
So that's that squared.

235
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,520
So it's one over four
x0 squared minus 4ac.

236
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,570
So minus 4 times 1 times
this minus thing.

237
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,320
So I'm going to have a minus
times a minus is a plus, so

238
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,370
it's just 4 times this,
because there was one there.

239
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,720
So plus 4 times
this, right here.

240
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,940
4 times this is just
2 plus 4 x0 squared.

241
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,840
All I did is, this
is 4ac right here.

242
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,190
Well, minus 4ac.

243
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,295
The minus and the minus
canceled out, so

244
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:50,980
you got a plus.

245
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,820
There's a 1.

246
00:11:51,820 --> 00:12:00,010
So 4 times c is just
2 plus 4x squared.

247
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,410
I just multiply this by two,
and of course all of this

248
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,290
should be over 2 times
a. a is just 2 there.

249
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,000
So let's see if I
can simplify this.

250
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,890
Remember what we're doing.

251
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,740
We're just figuring out where
the normal line and the

252
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,810
parabola intersect.

253
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,540
Now, what do we get here.

254
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,350
This looks like a little
hairy beast here.

255
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,980
Let me see if I can simplify
this a little bit.

256
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:31,310
So let us factor out--
let me rewrite this.

257
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,650
   

258
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:40,290
I can just divide everything by
1/2, so this is minus 1 over 4

259
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:47,110
x0, I just divided this by 2,
plus or minus 1/2, that's just

260
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,720
this 1/2 right there, times the
square root, let me see what

261
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,560
I can simplify out of here.

262
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:03,300
So if I factor out a 4 over
x0 squared, then what does

263
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,630
my expression become?

264
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:12,000
This term right here will
become an x to the fourth, x0

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,140
to the fourth, plus, now,
what does this term become?

266
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:25,240
This term becomes
a 1/2 x0 squared.

267
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,110
And just to verify this,
multiply 4 times 1/2, you

268
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,110
get 2, and then the x0
squares cancel out.

269
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,410
So write this term times that,
will equal 2, and then you have

270
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,280
plus-- now we factored a four
out of this and the x0

271
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,762
squared, so plus 1/16.

272
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:45,060
Let me scroll over
a little bit.

273
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,840
And you can verify
that this works out.

274
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,280
If you were to multiply this
out, you should get this

275
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,340
business right here.

276
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,200
   

277
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,680
I see the home stretch here,
because this should actually

278
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,890
factor out quite neatly.

279
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,090
So what does this equal?

280
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,120
So the intersection of
our normal line and our

281
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,650
parabola is equal to this.

282
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:12,510
Minus 1 over 4 x0 plus or
minus 1/2 times the square

283
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,290
root of this business.

284
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,350
And the square root, this
thing right here is

285
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,160
4 over x0 squared.

286
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,880
Now what's this?

287
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,680
This is actually, lucky
for us, a perfect square.

288
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,850
And I won't go into details,
because then the video will get

289
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,090
too long, but I think you can
recognize that this is

290
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:33,580
x0 squared, plus 1/4.

291
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,410
If you don't believe me,
square this thing right here.

292
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,480
You'll get this
expression right there.

293
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,370
And luckily enough, this is
a perfect square, so we

294
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,650
can actually take the
square root of it.

295
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,110
And so we get, the point
at which they intersect,

296
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,730
our normal line and our
parabola, and this is

297
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,970
quite a hairy problem.

298
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,960
The points where they intersect
is minus 1 over 4 x0, plus

299
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,990
or minus 1/2 times the
square root of this.

300
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,270
The square root of this is the
square root of this, which is

301
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:05,810
just 2 over x0 times the square
root of this, which is

302
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,590
x0 squared plus 1/4.

303
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:17,860
And if I were to rewrite all of
this, I'd get minus 1 over 4 x0

304
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,090
plus, let's see, this 1/2 and
this 2 cancel out, right?

305
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,810
So these cancel out.

306
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,650
So plus or minus, now I
just have a one over

307
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,960
x0 times x0 squared.

308
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:35,360
So I have 1 over x0-- oh sorry,
let me, we have to be very

309
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,475
careful there-- x0 squared
divided by x0 is just x0, let

310
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:42,400
me do that in a yellow color so
you know what I'm dealing with.

311
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,940
This term multiplied by this
term is just x0, and then

312
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,560
you have a plus 1/4 x0.

313
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,630
And this is all a
parentheses here.

314
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,280
So these are the two points at
which the normal curve and

315
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,610
our parabola intersect.

316
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,810
Let me just be very clear.

317
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,230
Those 2 points are, for if
this is my x0 that we're

318
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,380
dealing with, right there.

319
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,405
It's this point and this point.

320
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:10,070
And we have a plus or minus
here, so this is going to be

321
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,920
the plus version, and this is
going to be the minus version.

322
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,680
In fact, the plus version
should simplify into x0.

323
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,670
Let's see if that's the case.

324
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:22,360
Let's see if the plus version
actually simplifies to x0.

325
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,830
So these are our two points.

326
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,600
If I take the plus version,
that should be our first

327
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,770
quadrant intersection.

328
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:35,980
So x is equal to minus 1/4
x0 plus x0 plus 1/4 x0.

329
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,320
And, good enough, it does
actually cancel out.

330
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,530
That cancels out.

331
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,140
So x0 is one of the points
of intersection, which

332
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,260
makes complete sense.

333
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,940
Because that's how we even
defined the problem.

334
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,540
But, so this is the first
quadrant intersection.

335
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,770
So that's the first
quadrant intersection.

336
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,430
The second quadrant
intersection will be

337
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,690
where we take the minus
sign right there.

338
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,890
So x, I'll just call it in the
second quadrant intersection,

339
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:06,240
it'd be equal to minus 1/4 x0
minus this stuff over here,

340
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,020
minus the stuff there.

341
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:19,310
So minus x0 minus
1 over 4 mine x0.

342
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,850
Now what do we have?

343
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:21,270
So let's see.

344
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,150
We have a minus 1 over 4
x0, minus 1 over 4 x0.

345
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:33,020
So this is equal to minus x0,
minus x0, minus 1 over 2 x0.

346
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,760
So if I take minus 1/4 minus
1/4, I get minus 1/2.

347
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,780
And so my second quadrant
intersection, all this work

348
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,900
I did got me this result.

349
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,990
My second quadrant
intersection, I hope I

350
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,090
don't run out of space.

351
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,730
My second quadrant
intersection, of the normal

352
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:59,730
line and the parabola, is
minus x0 minus 1 over 2 x0.

353
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,970
Now this by itself is a pretty
neat result we just got, but

354
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,880
we're unfortunately not
done with the problem.

355
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,550
Because the problem wants us to
find that point, the maximum

356
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,620
point of intersection.

357
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,420
They call this the
extreme normal line.

358
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,930
The extreme normal line is
when our second quadrant

359
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,560
intersection essentially
achieves a maximum point.

360
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,750
I know they call it the
smallest point, but it's the

361
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,870
smallest negative value, so
it's really a maximum point.

362
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,440
So how do we figure out
that maximum point?

363
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,940
Well, we have our second
quadrant intersection as

364
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,460
a function of our
first quadrant x.

365
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,950
I could rewrite this as, my
second quadrant intersection as

366
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:45,210
a function of x0 is equal to
minus x minus 1 over 2 x0.

367
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,270
So this is going to reach a
minimum or a maximum point when

368
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,790
its derivative is equal to 0.

369
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,910
This is a very unconventional
notation, and that's

370
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,530
probably the hardest
thing about this problem.

371
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,390
But let's take this derivative
with respect to x0.

372
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,470
So my second quadrant
intersection, the derivative of

373
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,910
that with respect to x0, is
equal to, this is pretty

374
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,580
straightforward.

375
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:12,860
It's equal to minus 1, and then
I have a minus 1/2 times, this

376
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,800
is the same thing as
x to the minus 1.

377
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,630
So it's minus 1 times x0
to the minus 2, right?

378
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,320
I could have rewritten
this as minus 1/2 times

379
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,850
x0 to the minus 1.

380
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,560
So you just put its
exponent out front and

381
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,090
decrement it by 1.

382
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,870
And so this is the derivative
with respect to my first

383
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,770
quadrant intersection.

384
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,760
So let me simplify this.

385
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,820
So x, my second quadrant
intersection, the derivative of

386
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,670
it with respect to my first
quadrant intersection, is equal

387
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:52,110
to minus 1, the minus 1/2 and
the minus 1 become a positive

388
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:58,190
when you multiply them, and so
plus 1/2 over x0 squared.

389
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,280
Now, this'll reach a maximum
or minimum when it equals 0.

390
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,600
So let's set that equal to
0, and then solve this

391
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,410
problem right there.

392
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,000
Well, we add one to both sides.

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,180
We get 1 over 2 x0 squared is
equal to 1, or you could just

394
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,510
say that that means that 2 x0
squared must be equal to

395
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,750
1, if we just invert both
sides of this equation.

396
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:32,740
Or we could say that x0 squared
is equal to 1/2, or if we take

397
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,780
the square roots of both sides
of that equation, we get x0 is

398
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,030
equal to 1 over the
square root of 2.

399
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,470
So we're really, really,
really close now.

400
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,000
We've just figured out the
x0 value that gives us

401
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,530
our extreme normal line.

402
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,910
This value right here.

403
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,080
Let me do it in a
nice deeper color.

404
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,640
This value right here, that
gives us the extreme normal

405
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,410
line, that over there is
x0 is equal to 1 over

406
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,930
the square root of 2.

407
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,390
Now, they want us to figure
out the equation of the

408
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,910
extreme normal line.

409
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,710
Well, the equation of the
extreme normal line we already

410
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,670
figured out right here.

411
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,910
It's this.

412
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,900
The equation of the normal line
is that thing, right there.

413
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,400
So if we want the equation of
the normal line at this extreme

414
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,120
point, right here, the one that
creates the extreme normal

415
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,140
line, I just substitute 1 over
the square root of 2 in for x0.

416
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,400
So what do I get?

417
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,800
I get, and this is the home
stretch, and this is quite

418
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,440
a beast of a problem.

419
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,670
y minus x0 squared.

420
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,290
x0 squared is 1/2, right?

421
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,430
1 over the square root
of 2 squared is 1/2.

422
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:42,510
Is equal to minus 1 over 2 x0.

423
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,660
So let's be careful here.

424
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,560
So minus 1/2 times 1 over x0.

425
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,670
One over x0 is the square
root of 2, right?

426
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:57,530
All of that times x minus x0.

427
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:02,080
So that's 1 over the square
root of 2. x0 is one

428
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,870
over square root of 2.

429
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,850
So let's simplify
this a little bit.

430
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,570
So the equation of our normal
line, assuming I haven't made

431
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:13,400
any careless mistakes, is
equal to, so y minus 1/2

432
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,060
is equal to, let's see.

433
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:21,410
If we multiply this minus
square root of 2 over 2x, and

434
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,310
then if I multiply these
square root of 2 over

435
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,690
this, it becomes one.

436
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,120
And then I have a minus
and a minus, so that

437
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,290
I have a plus 1/2.

438
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,230
I think that's right.

439
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,590
Yeah, plus 1/2, this
times this times that

440
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,170
is equal to plus 1/2.

441
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,190
And then, we're at
the home stretch.

442
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,650
So we just add 1/2 to both
sides of this equation, and we

443
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:51,150
get our extreme normal line
equation, which is y is

444
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,670
equal to minus square
root of 2 over 2x.

445
00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:00,100
If you add 1/2 to both sides of
this equation, you get plus 1.

446
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,300
And there you go.

447
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,830
That's the equation of that
line there, assuming I haven't

448
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,020
made any careless mistakes.

449
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,320
But even if I have, I think you
get the idea of hopefully how

450
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,710
to do this problem, which
is quite a beastly one.
