1
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:23,665
This is a painting by Claude Monet which is a series of more than half a dozen canvases.

2
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:27,099
Taking the subject of Gare St. Lazare which is a train station in Paris.

3
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:36,525
It dates to the winter of 1876-1877, just a few years after the first impressionist exhibition.

4
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:41,475
Monet was living in Argenteuil which was the suburb of Paris

5
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:48,167
And of course, he would have taken the train there and back as the typical suburban dweller into the city

6
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:58,268
This whole phenomenon of commuter railways into the city, wanting to live in the countryside, but working at the city.

7
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:03,798
Paris just recently renovated during the second empire by Baron Haussmann.

8
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,630
The train stations were new, the boulevards were new.

9
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,932
So this was an epitome of the modern, the new, the industrial. But it is so radical.

10
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:17,899
We think of Monet of painting the waterlilies, the pastoral suburban landscape.

11
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:23,098
But here, what could be more gritty than these coal-burning steam engines.

12
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:29,616
Yeah, when Monet had been in Argenteuil, he had painted landscapes with chimneys in the background

13
00:01:29,678 --> 00:01:32,354
or modern railways, bridges, or elements of modern life.

14
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:38,012
But here he's completely embracing the gritty ickiness of modernism.

15
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:42,265
If you look at the composition of the painting, it is actually not so different from the traditional landscape painting.

16
00:01:42,265 --> 00:01:48,567
If you look back at the canvases of St. Claude whose got trees framing.

17
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:59,070
This visual movement puts him back into space. Also these diagonal lines that recede and carry our eyes back.

18
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,404
But the painting is intensely flat. Because of the emphasis of surface.

19
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:11,166
Especially if you look into this canvas, you have this locomotive moving into the station

20
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:15,178
under this enormous iron gridwork.

21
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:21,217
And what could be more substantial than the iron locomotive

22
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:29,598
and yet because of the way the scene is painted, it began to obliterate, dissolve the solidity of the locomotive

23
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:30,846
of this massive iron

24
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:37,254
and Monet, it is exactly his intent to focus on the play of light, and the play of color.

25
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:42,631
And what could be more wonderful space to do that than this entrapped space with the steam,

26
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:44,903
droplets of water playing against the sunlight

27
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:47,051
that are coming from the windows above.

28
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:52,367
Monet is thinking about the surface, how the surface is flickering

29
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:55,552
and the colors that are changing on the surface

30
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:59,064
and he's not thinking so much in the way academic painter would have thought about

31
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:03,023
creating foreshorten objects in space

32
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:07,338
creating prespective lines, modeling it, and giving it solidity.

33
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:14,796
So really if you look into these details, there are actually no lines, or contours to the object.

34
00:03:15,273 --> 00:03:17,112
There is no sense of traditional modelling at all

35
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:22,168
and the surface is incredibly painter-ly, it is almost abstract.

36
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,025
Sometimes the word "scumbled" is used.

37
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:29,669
What's interesting is you can compare Monet completely removing the lines virtually from his canvas

38
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:32,736
to some other painters worked in this area at the same time.

39
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,134
i'm thinking about a painting by Caillebotte who is a contemporary of Monet's.

40
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:40,630
This is actually a bridge just over the train tracks we saw in Monet's painting

41
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,967
and here everything is so linear, crisp, clean, and clarified

42
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:48,514
and in fact the linear perspective is very intense.

43
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:54,765
Right, it sorts of over dramatizing the perspective, but there is a real illusion of space here

44
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,395
which Monet kind of denies us.

45
00:03:56,472 --> 00:04:01,299
Everything is so, that ironwork, it's so there.

46
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:08,430
Where in Monet everything is disappearing, the steam, everything just became pure light, pure color.

47
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:15,735
We have a sense here of street, of urban street, people passing each other, the pace of modern life.

48
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:23,395
And of course, Manet did that as well in his painting of the railway, passing people on the streets

49
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:28,133
And this is the same location, looking down onto those train tracks. Exactly.

50
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:34,334
We could look for a moment at the real station today. The photograph.

51
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,679
So really, it is not a pretty place. Not at all.

52
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,618
Yet Monet chose to make this luminous, just an extraordinary expression of the beauty

53
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,833
of modern urban life.

54
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:51,657
Here is the map of the train station just below. We are looking at the roof of the train station.

55
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:57,406
Just past that, the railway tracks we were looking at, and past that the bridge that we saw in Caillebotte.

56
00:04:57,406 --> 00:05:02,471
And of course the boulevards that had been recently built by Baron Haussmann.

57
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:06,595
Which really rip through the city, creating this modern bourgeois society.

58
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,806
That is exactly what Monet was painting, and Manet too.

59
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:16,572
So, if we go back to this canvas then, what we are seeing is a beautiful expression of impressionism.
