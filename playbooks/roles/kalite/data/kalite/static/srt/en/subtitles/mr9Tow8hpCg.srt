1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,190
I've got a transformation T.

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,670
When you apply the
transformation T to some x in

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,890
your domain, it is equivalent to
multiplying that x in your

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,220
domain, or that vector.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,380
by the matrix A.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,950
And let's say we know the linear
transformation T can

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,940
be-- that's transformation
matrix when you put it in

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:29,220
reduced row echelon form-- it is
equal to an n by n identity

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,560
matrix, or the n by
n identity matrix.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,230
Well this alone tells
a lot of things.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,800
First of all, if when you put
this in reduced row echelon

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,000
form, you get a square
identity matrix.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,650
That tells us that the
original matrix

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,230
had to be n by n.

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,600
And it also tells us that T is
a mapping from Rn to Rn.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,530
And we saw in the last video,
all of these are conditions,

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:59,010
especially this one right here,
for T to be invertible.

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,790
So If we know that this is
true-- T is a linear

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,390
transformation, it's a reduced
row echelon form of the

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,460
transformation matrix of the
identity matrix right there--

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,620
we know that T is invertible.

23
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,160
   

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,910
Let's remind ourselves what it
even means to be invertible.

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:23,910
To be invertible means that
there exists some-- we used

26
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,720
the word function before, but
now we're talking about

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,580
transformations, they're
really the same thing.

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:35,760
So let's say there exists some
transformation-- let's call it

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:46,050
T-inverse like that, or T to
the minus 1-- such that the

30
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,750
composition of T-inverse with
T is equal to the identity

31
00:01:51,750 --> 00:02:00,350
transformation on your domain,
and the composition of T with

32
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,010
T-inverse is equal to the
identity transformation on

33
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,390
your codomain.

34
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,009
   

35
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:09,620
Just like that.

36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,720
And just to remind you what this
looks like, let's draw

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,700
our domains and codomains.

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,310
Our domain is Rn, and our
codomain is also Rn.

39
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,250
   

40
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,520
So if you take some vector
in your domain, apply the

41
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,420
transformation T-- you're
going to go into your

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,310
codomain, so that is T.

43
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,310
And then if you apply the
T-inverse after that, you're

44
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,670
going to go back to
that original x.

45
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,680
So this says, look,
you apply T and

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,090
then you apply T-inverse.

47
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,810
You're just going to get back
to where you started.

48
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,593
It's equivalent to the identity
transformation.

49
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:48,460
   

50
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,560
Just like that.

51
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,990
This is saying if you start
here in your codomain, you

52
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,080
apply this inverse
transformation first, then you

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,670
apply your transformation,
you're going to go back to the

54
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,280
same point in your codomain.

55
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,350
So it's equivalent to the
identity transformation in

56
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,640
your codomain.

57
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,710
It just happens to be in this
case that the domain and the

58
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:14,470
codomain are the same set, Rn.

59
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,740
Now we know what a
transformation-- what it means

60
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,420
to be invertible. we know what
the conditions are for

61
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,040
invertibility.

62
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
So this begs the
next question.

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,570
We know this guy is a linear
transformation, in fact that's

64
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,760
one of the conditions
to be able to

65
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,910
represent it as a matrix.

66
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,000
Or any transformation that can
be represented as a matrix

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,550
vector product is a linear
transformation.

68
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,950
So this guy's a linear
transformation.

69
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:42,920
But the question is, is
T-inverse a linear

70
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,170
transformation?

71
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,660
   

72
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,750
Let's review what the two
conditions are that we need to

73
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,610
have to be a linear
transformation.

74
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,400
So we know T is a linear
transformation.

75
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,150
So we know that if you apply
the transformation T to two

76
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,530
vectors-- let's say x and y--
if we apply to the sum of

77
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,390
those two vectors, it is equal
to the transformation of the

78
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,650
first vector plus the
transformation

79
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,030
of the second vector.

80
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,650
That's one of the conditions,
or one thing that we know is

81
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,220
true for all linear
transformations.

82
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,709
And the second thing we know
is true for all linear

83
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,560
transformations is, if we take
the transformation of some

84
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,500
scaled version of a vector in
our domain, it is equal to the

85
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,680
scaling factor times
the transformation

86
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,270
of the vector itself.

87
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,906
These are both conditions for
linear transformations.

88
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:38,130
So let's see if we can prove
that both of these conditions

89
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,860
hold for T-inverse, or
this guy right here.

90
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,925
So to do this, let's do this
little exercise right here.

91
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:51,640
   

92
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,890
Let's take the composition of
T with T-inverse of two

93
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,730
vectors, a plus b.

94
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,585
Remember, T-inverse is a mapping
from your codomain to

95
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:05,980
your domain, although they're
both going to

96
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,580
be Rn in this case.

97
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,870
But T-inverse maps from
this set to that set.

98
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,310
Let's write it up here.

99
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,470
T-inverse is a mapping from your
codomain to your domain.

100
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,100
Although it looks identical,
just like that.

101
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,560
OK, so what is this going
to be equal to?

102
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,820
Well we just said, by definition
of your inverse

103
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,040
transformation, this is going
to be equal to the identity

104
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,360
transformation on
your codomain.

105
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,860
So assuming these guys are
members of your codomain, in

106
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:41,180
this case Rn, this is just going
to be equal to a plus b.

107
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,640
This thing, the composition
of T with its inverse, by

108
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,090
definition is just the identity
transformation on

109
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,270
your codomain.

110
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,110
So this is just whatever
I put in here.

111
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,950
If I put in an x here,
this would be an x.

112
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,370
If I put in an apple here,
this would be an apple.

113
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,870
It's going to be the identity
transformation.

114
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,130
Now what is this equal to?

115
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,070
   

116
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,940
Well I could use the same
argument to say that this

117
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,290
right here is equal to the
identity transformation

118
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,630
applied to a.

119
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,750
And I'm not writing the identity
transformation, I'm

120
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,330
writing this.

121
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,580
But we know that this is
equivalent to the identity

122
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,320
transformation.

123
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,100
So we could say that is
equivalent to the composition

124
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,640
of T with the inverse applied
to a, and we could say that

125
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,900
this is the equivalent to the
identity transformation, which

126
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,510
we know is the same thing as T,
the composition of t with

127
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,210
T-inverse applied to b.

128
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:42,360
So we can rewrite this thing
right here as being equal to

129
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,240
the sum of these two things.

130
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,760
In fact we don't even
have to rewrite it.

131
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,040
We can just write it's equal
to-- this transformation is

132
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,770
equal to this.

133
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,520
And maybe an easier way for you
to process it is, we could

134
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:02,340
write this as T of the T-inverse
of a plus b, is

135
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:10,700
equal to T of the T-inverse
of a plus T of the

136
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,860
T-inverse of b.

137
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,990
And this should-- I don't know
which one your brain processes

138
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,500
easier, but either of these,
when you when you take the

139
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,120
composition of T with T-inverse,
you're going to be

140
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,530
left with an a plus b.

141
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,210
You take the composition of
T with T-inverse, you're

142
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,180
left with an a.

143
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,500
You take the composition of T
with T-inverse, you're just

144
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,750
left with a b there.

145
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,550
So in either case you get a
plus b-- when you evaluate

146
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,350
either side of this expression
you'll get the vector a plus

147
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,980
the vector b.

148
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,370
Now what can we do?

149
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,500
We know that T itself is a
linear transformation.

150
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,190
And since T is a linear
transformation, we know that T

151
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:58,490
applied to the sum of two
vectors is equal to T applied

152
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,030
to each of those vectors
and summed up.

153
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,360
Or we can take it
the other way.

154
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,970
T applied to two separate
vectors-- so we call this one

155
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,360
vector right here, and this
vector right here.

156
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,540
So in this case I have a T
applied to one vector, and I'm

157
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,700
summing it to a T applied
to another vector.

158
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,790
So it's this right here, which
we know is equal to T applied

159
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,480
to the sum of those
two vectors.

160
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,294
So this is T applied to the
vector T-inverse of a-- let me

161
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:33,610
write it here-- plus
T-inverse of b.

162
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,409
It might look a little
convoluted, but all I'm saying

163
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,630
is, this looks just like this.

164
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:45,435
If you say that x is equal to
T-inverse of a, and if you say

165
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:47,970
that y is equal to
T-inverse of b.

166
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,660
So this looks just like that.

167
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,730
It's going to be equal to the
transformation T applied to

168
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,340
the sum of those two vectors.

169
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,360
So it's going to equal the
transformation T applied to

170
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,160
the inverse of a plus
T-inverse of b.

171
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,130
I just use the fact that T
is linear to get here.

172
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:04,960
Now what can I do?

173
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,130
Let me let me simplify
everything that I've written

174
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,840
right here.

175
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,660
So I now have-- let
me rewrite this.

176
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,160
This thing up here, which is
the same thing as this.

177
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:23,290
T, the composition of T, with
T-inverse, applied to a plus b

178
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,350
is equal to the composition--
or actually not the

179
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:34,450
composition, just T-- applied to
two vectors, T-inverse of a

180
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,680
plus T-inverse of vector b.

181
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,700
That's what we've
gotten so far.

182
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,220
Now we're very close to proving
that this condition is

183
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,790
true for T-inverse, if we can
just get rid of these T's.

184
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,740
Well the best way to get rid
of those T's is to take the

185
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,080
composition with T-inverse
on both sides.

186
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,180
Or take the T-inverse
transformation of both sides

187
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,095
of this equation.

188
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,910
So let's do that.

189
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,300
So let's take T-inverse of this
side, T-inverse of that

190
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,030
side, should be equal to
T-inverse of this side.

191
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,620
Because these two things
are the same thing.

192
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,950
So if you put the same thing
into a function, you should

193
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,410
get the same value
on both sides.

194
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,470
So what is this thing on
the left-hand side?

195
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:15,970
What is this?

196
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,640
This is the composition-- let me
write it this way-- this is

197
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,650
the composition of T-inverse
with T, that part, applied to

198
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,210
this thing right here.

199
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm just changing the
associativity of this--

200
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,070
applied to T-inverse of the
vector a plus the vector b.

201
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,640
That's what this left
hand side is.

202
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,795
This part right here, T-inverse
of T of this, these

203
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:45,090
first two steps I'm just writing
as a composition of

204
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:50,240
T-inverse with T applied
to this right here.

205
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,590
That right there is the same
thing as that right there.

206
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,580
So that was another
way to write that.

207
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,280
And so that is going to be equal
to the composition of

208
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,730
T-inverse with T-- I'll write
that in the same color-- a

209
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,330
composition of T-inverse
with T.

210
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,470
That's this part right here,
which is very similar to that

211
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:16,900
part right there-- of this stuff
right here, of T-inverse

212
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,150
of a plus T-inverse
of the vector b.

213
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,460
Now by definition of what
T-inverse is, what is this?

214
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,480
This is the identity
transformation on our domain.

215
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,910
This is the identity
transformation on Rn.

216
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,690
This is also the identity
transformation on Rn.

217
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,100
So if you apply the identity
transformation to anything,

218
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,070
you're just going
to get anything.

219
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,480
So this is going to be equal
to-- I'll do it on both sides

220
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,380
of the equation-- this whole
expression on the left-hand

221
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,360
side is going to simplify to the
T-inverse of the vectors a

222
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,250
plus the vector b.

223
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,530
And the right-hand side
is just going to

224
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,190
simplify to this thing.

225
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,050
Is equal to-- because this
is just the identity

226
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,830
transformation-- so it's just
equal this one, T-inverse of

227
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,660
the vector a plus T-inverse
of the vector b.

228
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,460
And just like that, T-inverse
has met its first condition

229
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,860
for being a linear
transformation.

230
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,840
   

231
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,636
Now let's see if we can do
the second condition.

232
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:24,550
   

233
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,010
Let's do the same
type of thing.

234
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:32,850
Let's take the composition of
T with T-inverse, let's take

235
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,740
the composition of that on some
vector, let's call it ca.

236
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,850
Just like that.

237
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,790
Well we know what this is equal
to, this is equal to the

238
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,090
identity transformation on Rn.

239
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,510
So this is just going
to be equal to ca.

240
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,575
Now what is a equal to?

241
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:53,780
   

242
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,070
What is this thing right there--
I'll write it on the

243
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,710
side right here, let me do it
in an appropriate color.

244
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,620
Or we could say that a, the
vector a is equal to the

245
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,450
transformation T with the
composition of T with

246
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,790
T-inverse applied
to the vector a.

247
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,950
Because this is just the
identity transformation.

248
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,840
So we can rewrite this
expression here as being equal

249
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:27,410
to c times the composition of
T with T-inverse applied

250
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,440
to my vector a.

251
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,830
And maybe it might be nice to
rewrite it in this form

252
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,620
instead of this composition
form.

253
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,690
So this left expression we can
just write as T of the

254
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,020
T-inverse of c times the
vector a-- all I did is

255
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,520
rewrite this left-hand side this
way-- is equal to this

256
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,510
green thing right here.

257
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,620
Well I'll rewrite similarly.

258
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,080
This is equal to c times the
transformation T applied to

259
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,690
the transformation T-inverse
applied to a.

260
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,400
This is by definition what
composition means.

261
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,950
Now T is a linear
transformation.

262
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:17,190
Which means that if you take c
time T times some vector, that

263
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,050
is equivalent to T times c times
T applied to c times

264
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,520
that vector.

265
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,130
This is one of the conditions
in your transformation.

266
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,980
So this is always going
to be the case with T.

267
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,860
So if this is some vector
that T is applying to,

268
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,890
this is some scalar.

269
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,180
So this thing, because we
know that T is a linear

270
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,680
transformation, we can rewrite
as being equal to T applied to

271
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,110
the scalar c times T-inverse
applied to a.

272
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,200
   

273
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,790
And now what can we do?

274
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,560
Well let's apply the T-inverse
transformation to

275
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,400
both sides of this.

276
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,190
Let me rewrite it.

277
00:14:53,190 --> 00:15:02,580
On this side we get T of
T-inverse of ca is equal to T

278
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,080
of c times T-inverse times a.

279
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,500
That's what we have so far.

280
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,850
But wouldn't it be nice
if we could get rid

281
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,960
of these outer T's?

282
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,980
And the best way to do that
is to take the T-inverse

283
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,230
transformation of both sides.

284
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,850
So let's do that.

285
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,440
T-inverse-- let's take that of
both sides of this equation,

286
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,850
T-inverse of both sides.

287
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,300
And another way that this
could be written.

288
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,130
This is equal into the
composition of T-inverse with

289
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:38,090
T applied to T-inverse applied
to c times our vector a.

290
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,050
This right here, I just decided
to keep writing it in

291
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,140
this form, and I took these two
guys out and I wrote them

292
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,560
as a composition.

293
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,590
And this on the right-hand side,
you can do something

294
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,610
very similar.

295
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,630
You could say that this is equal
to the composition of

296
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,820
T-inverse with T times--
or not times,

297
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,380
let me be very careful.

298
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,060
Taking this composition, this
transformation, and then

299
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:06,680
taking that transformation
on c times the inverse

300
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,390
transformation applied to a.

301
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,660
Let me be very clear
what I did here.

302
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,710
This thing right here is
this thing right here.

303
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,710
This thing right here is
this thing right here.

304
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:20,440
And I just rewrote this
composition this way.

305
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,000
And the reason why I did this
is because we know this is

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,060
just the identity transformation
on Rn, and this

307
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,540
is just the identity
transformation on Rn.

308
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,880
So the identity transformation
applied to anything is just

309
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,940
that anything.

310
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,360
So this equation simplifies to
the in T-inverse applied to c

311
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,070
times some vector a, is equal
to this thing, c times

312
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,660
T-inverse times some vector a.

313
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,370
And just like that, we've met
our second condition for being

314
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,630
a linear transformation.

315
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,070
The first condition
was met up here.

316
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,870
So now we know.

317
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,130
And in both cases, we use the
fact that T was a linear

318
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,630
transformation to get to the
result for T-inverse.

319
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:13,880
So now we know that if T is a
linear transformation, and T

320
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:25,710
is invertible, then T-inverse
is also a linear

321
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,960
transformation.

322
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,220
   

323
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,480
Which might seem like a little
nice thing to know, but that's

324
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,730
actually a big thing to know.

325
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,250
Because now we know that
T-inverse can be represented

326
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,580
as a matrix vector product.

327
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,270
That means that T-inverse
applied to some vector x could

328
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,330
be represented as the product
of some matrix times x.

329
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,090
And what we're going to do is,
we're going to call that

330
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:56,230
matrix the matrix A-inverse.

331
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,900
And I haven't defined as well
how do you construct this

332
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,890
A-inverse matrix, but we
know that it exists.

333
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,870
We know this exists now,
because T is a linear

334
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,000
transformation.

335
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,060
And we can take it even
a step further.

336
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,090
We know by the definition of
invertibility that the

337
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:19,710
composition of T-inverse with
T is equal to the identity

338
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,320
transformation on Rn.

339
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,710
   

340
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,280
Well what is a composition?

341
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,870
We know that T, if we take--
let me put it this way.

342
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,730
We know that T of x
is equal to Ax.

343
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,710
So if we write T-inverse, the
composition of T-inverse with

344
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:48,350
T applied to some vector x is
going to be equal to first, A

345
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,380
being applied to x is going
to be equal to Ax, this

346
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,960
A right here, Ax.

347
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,300
And then you're going to apply
A-inverse x, you're going to

348
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,140
apply this right here.

349
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,190
And we got that this is the
equivalent to-- when you take

350
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,810
the composition, it's equivalent
to, or your

351
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,160
resulting transformation matrix
of two composition

352
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,700
transformations is equal to this
matrix matrix product.

353
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,840
We got that a long time ago.

354
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,170
In fact that was the motivation
for how a matrix

355
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,770
matrix product was defined.

356
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,680
But what's interesting here is,
this composition is equal

357
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:26,610
to that, but it's also equal to
the identity transformation

358
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,170
on Rn applied to that vector
x, which is equal to the

359
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,600
identity matrix applied to x.

360
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,250
Right?

361
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,380
That is the n by n matrix, so
when you multiply by anything,

362
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,200
you get that anything again.

363
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,740
So we get a very interesting
result.

364
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,460
A-inverse times A has to be
equal to the identity matrix.

365
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,350
A-inverse, or the matrix
transformation for T-inverse,

366
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,410
when you multiply that with the
matrix transformation for

367
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,580
T, you're going to get
the identity matrix.

368
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,660
And the argument actually
holds both ways.

369
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,640
So we know this is true, but
the other definition of an

370
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,650
inverse, or invertibility, told
us that the composition

371
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,390
of T with T-inverse is equal to
the identity transformation

372
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,480
in our codomain, which
is also Rn.

373
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,380
Rn.

374
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,500
So by the exact same argument,
we know that when you go the

375
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,430
other way, if you apply
T-inverse first and then you

376
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,460
apply T-- so that's equivalent
of saying apply T-inverse

377
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,150
first, and then you apply T
to some x vector, that's

378
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:35,280
equivalent to multiplying that
x vector by the identity

379
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,260
matrix, the n by n
identity matrix.

380
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,500
Or you could say, you could
switch the order.

381
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,590
A times A-inverse is also equal
to the identity matrix.

382
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,710
Which is neat, because we
learned that matrix matrix

383
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,140
products, when you switch the
order they don't normally

384
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,260
always equal each other.

385
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,140
But in the case of an invertible
matrix and its

386
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,840
inverse, order doesn't matter.

387
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,920
You can take A-inverse times A
and get the identity matrix,

388
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,140
or you could take A times
A-inverse and get

389
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,490
the identity matrix.

390
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,910
Now we've gotten this far, the
next step is to actually

391
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,220
figure out how do
you construct.

392
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,010
We know that this thing exists,
we know that the

393
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,350
inverse is a linear
transformation, that this

394
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,220
matrix exists.

395
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,360
We see this nice property,
that when you multiply it

396
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,530
times the transformation
matrix you get

397
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,940
the identity matrix.

398
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,820
The next step is to actually
figure out how to

399
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,330
figure this guy out.

400
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,200
