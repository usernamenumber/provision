1
00:00:00,426 --> 00:00:02,625
Let's give ourselves a little more practice

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:04,246
with logarithms.

3
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:05,975
So just a little bit of review...

4
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:11,474
Let's evaluate log, base 2, of 8.

5
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:14,693
What does this evaluate to?

6
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:19,780
Well it's asking us it'll evaluate to the power that I have

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,449
to raise our base to. That I have to raise 2 to,

8
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:25,249
to get to 8.

9
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:27,983
So 2 to the first power is 2, 2 to the second power is 4,

10
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:32,933
2 to the third power is 8. So this right over here is going to

11
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,395
be equal to 3.

12
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:37,383
Fair enough, we did examples like that in the last video.

13
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:39,383
Let's do something a little bit more interesting...

14
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:41,815
What is--

15
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:43,128
and I'll colour code it...

16
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:51,128
what is log, base 8, of 2?

17
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:54,427
Now this is interesting, I'll give you a few seconds to

18
00:00:54,427 --> 00:00:56,378
think about it.

19
00:00:56,378 --> 00:00:59,377
Well we're asking ourselves or this will evaluate to

20
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:04,028
the exponent that I have to raise 8 to, to get to 2.

21
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,078
So let's think about that in another way.

22
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:12,828
So we could say 8, to some power, and that exponent that I'm

23
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:16,112
raising 8 to is essentially what this logarithm would evaluate to.

24
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:24,643
8 to some power, is going to be equal to 2.

25
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:28,472
Well if 2 to the third power is 8, 8 to the one-third power

26
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:30,113
is equal to 2.

27
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:32,964
So 'x' is equal to one-third.

28
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:35,596
8 to the one-third power is equal to 2.

29
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,781
Or you could say that the cube root of 8 is 2.

30
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:40,914
So in this case 'x' is one-third.

31
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:47,313
This logarithm right over here will evaluate to one-third.

32
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:48,652
Fascinating.

33
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:50,911
Let's mix it up a little bit more.

34
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:56,314
Let's say we have the log, base 2, instead of 8

35
00:01:56,314 --> 00:02:01,431
let's put a one-eighth, right over here.

36
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:05,163
So I'll give you a few seconds to think about that.

37
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:08,762
Well it's asking us or this will evaluate to the exponent that I have to

38
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:11,564
raise 2 to, to get to one-eighth.

39
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,495
So if we set this to be equal to 'x', we're essentially saying

40
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:25,335
2 to the 'x' power, is equal to one-eighth.

41
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,082
Well we know that 2 to the third power--

42
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:28,465
Let me write this down...

43
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:31,715
We already know that 2 to the third power is equal to 8.

44
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:35,147
If we want to get to one-eighth, which is a reciprocal of 8.

45
00:02:35,147 --> 00:02:37,614
We just have to raise to the negative 3 power.

46
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:42,798
2 to the negative 3 power is one over 2 to the third power.

47
00:02:42,798 --> 00:02:46,331
Which is the same thing as one over eight.

48
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:49,514
So, if we're asking ourselves "what exponent do we have to raise

49
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:51,765
2 to to get to one-eighth?"

50
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:54,515
Well we have to raise it to the negative 3 power.

51
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:56,915
So 'x' is equal to negative 3.

52
00:02:56,915 --> 00:03:01,865
This logarithm evaluates to negative 3.

53
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:05,736
Now let's really, really mix it up.

54
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:18,266
What would be the log, base 8, of one-half.

55
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:21,015
What does this evaluate to?

56
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:26,282
Let me clean this up so we have some space to work with.

57
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:32,451
So as always, we're saying "what power do I have to raise 8 to, to get to one-half?"

58
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:34,498
So let's think about that a little bit.

59
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:37,433
We already know that 8 to the one-third power is

60
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,015
equal to 2.

61
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:42,701
If we want the reciprocal of 2 right over here, we have to just

62
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:45,634
raise 8 to the negative one-third.

63
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:51,383
So let me write that down, 8, to the negative one-third power,

64
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:56,517
is going to be equal to one over eight, to the one-third power,

65
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:59,400
and we already know the cube root of 8 or 8 to the one-third power is

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,683
equal to 2. This is equal to

67
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:02,265
one-half.

68
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:08,001
So, the log, base 8, of one-half is equal to?

69
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:10,551
Well the power I have to raise 8 to to get to one-half is

70
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:15,421
negative one-third.

71
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,024
I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did.
