1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,150
I'm back, and I just
have to finish up

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,505
problem number eighteen.

4
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,275
I just want to make
sure I did this.

5
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:12,910
10 minus x squared, this will
be x squared minus 20x, plus

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,790
100, plus 225.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,180
This is where I always
mess up.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,930
Let's see, what's
325 minus 289?

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,650
It's 25 plus 11, so it's 36.

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,400
So we're left with 0 is
equal to x squared

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,240
minus 20x plus 36.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,390
And now we just have to factor
this right here.

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,640
I'll do it up here.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,090
   

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,400
So what two numbers, when you
multiply them, is equal to 36,

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,770
and when you add or subtract
them, you get minus 20?

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,020
What do you get, let's see.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,990
   

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,180
18 and 2.

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,775
18 times 2 is 36.

21
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:03,420
And if you make them both
negative when they add, they

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,440
go to negative 20.

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,620
That's x minus 18,
and x minus 2.

24
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,000
I just factored this as x
minus 18 and x minus 2.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,750
And you can review my
presentation on factoring

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,820
quadratics if you forgot
how to do this.

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,970
But I just said, well
18 times 2 is 36.

28
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,860
And they have to be negative,
because when they add together

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,196
you get minus 20.

30
00:01:30,196 --> 00:01:35,930
So x could be equal to 18,
or x could be equal to 2.

31
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,380
And those are the possible
choices.

32
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:39,840
And that's it.

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,930
This was a short video,
just a leftover from

34
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,440
problem number eighteen.

35
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,450
I'll see you in the next
