1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,880
A neurologist is testing the
effect of a drug on response

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,690
time by injecting 100 rats with
a unit dose of the drug,

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,570
subjecting each to neurological
stimulus and

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,450
recording its response time.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,350
The neurologist knows that the
mean response time for rats

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,810
not injected with the
drug is 1.2 seconds.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,030
The mean of the 100 injected
rats response times is 1.05

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,800
seconds with the
sample standard

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,470
deviation of 0.5 seconds.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,650
Do you think that the drug has
an affect on response time?

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,130
So to do this we're going to
set up two hypotheses.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,660
We're going to say, one, the
first hypothesis is we're

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,260
going to call it the null
hypothesis, and that is that

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,400
the drug has no effect
on response time.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,740
And your null hypothesis is
always going to be-- you can

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,820
view it as a status quo.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,570
You assume that whatever your
researching has no effect.

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,975
So drug has no effect.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,390
Or another way to think about
it is that the mean of the

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:19,130
rats taking the drug should be
the mean with the drug-- let

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,930
me write it this way-- with the
mean is still going to be

22
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,385
1.2 seconds even
with the drug.

23
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,090
So that's essentially saying it
has no effect, because we

24
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,410
know that if you don't give
the drug the mean response

25
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,290
time is 1.2 seconds.

26
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,940
Now, what you want is an
alternative hypothesis.

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,010
The hypothesis is no,
I think the drug

28
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,520
actually does do something.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:52,970
So the alternative hypothesis,
right over here, that the drug

30
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,880
has an effect.

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,340
Or another way to think about
it is that the mean does not

32
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:10,280
equal 1.2 seconds when
the drug is given.

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,500
So how do we think about this?

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,660
How do we know whether we should
accept the alternative

35
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,380
hypothesis or whether we should
just default to the

36
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,680
null hypothesis because the
data isn't convincing?

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,700
And the way we're going to do it
in this video, and this is

38
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,875
really the way it's done in
pretty much all of science, is

39
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:32,230
you say OK, let's assume that
the null hypothesis is true.

40
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,110
If the null hypothesis was true,
what is the probability

41
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,840
that we would have gotten these
results with the sample?

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,190
And if that probability is
really, really small, then the

43
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,920
null hypothesis probably
isn't true.

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,710
We could probably reject the
null hypothesis and we'll say

45
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,870
well, we kind of believe in the
alternative hypothesis.

46
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,720
So let's think about that.

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,720
Let's assume that the null
hypothesis is true.

48
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,340
So if we assume the null
hypothesis is true, let's try

49
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,240
to figure out the probability
that we would have actually

50
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,950
gotten this result, that we
would have actually gotten a

51
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,070
sample mean of 1.05 seconds with
a standard deviation of

52
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,180
0.5 seconds.

53
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,320
So I want to see if we assumed
the null hypothesis is true, I

54
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,810
want to figure out the
probability-- and actually

55
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,860
what we're going to do is
not just figure out the

56
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,740
probability of this, the
probability of getting

57
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,370
something like this or even
more extreme than this.

58
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,780
So how likely of an
event is that?

59
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,600
To think about that let's just
think about the sampling

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,290
distribution if we assume
the null hypothesis.

61
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,530
So the sampling distribution
is like this.

62
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,050
It'll be a normal
distribution.

63
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,960
We have a good number
of samples, we

64
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,250
have 100 samples here.

65
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,320
So this is the sampling
distribution.

66
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,050
It will have a mean.

67
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,400
Now if we assume the null
hypothesis, that the drug has

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,830
no effect, the mean of our
sampling distribution will be

69
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,660
the same thing as the mean
of the population

70
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,240
distribution, which would
be equal to 1.2 seconds.

71
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,250
Now, what is the standard
deviation of our sampling

72
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,490
distribution?

73
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,990
The standard deviation of our
sampling distribution should

74
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,240
be equal to the standard
deviation of the population

75
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,060
distribution divided by the
square root of our sample

76
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,820
size, so divided by the
square root of 100.

77
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,450
We do not know what the standard
deviation of the

78
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,020
entire population is.

79
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,920
So what we're going to do is
estimate it with our sample

80
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,070
standard deviation.

81
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,670
And it's a reasonable thing to
do, especially because we have

82
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,700
a nice sample size.

83
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,820
The sample size is
greater than 100.

84
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,200
So this is going to be a pretty
good approximator.

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,370
This is going to be a pretty
good approximator

86
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,120
for this over here.

87
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,290
So we could say that this is
going to be approximately

88
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,100
equal to our sample standard
deviation divided by the

89
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,630
square root of 100, which is
going to be equal to our

90
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:04,610
sample standard deviation is
0.5, 0.5 seconds, and we want

91
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,800
to divide that by square
root of 100 is 10.

92
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,960
So 0.5 divided by 10 is 0.05.

93
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,870
So the standard deviation of our
sampling distribution is

94
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,320
going to be-- and we'll put a
little hat over it to show

95
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,640
that we approximated it with--
we approximated the population

96
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,140
standard deviation with the
sample standard deviation.

97
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,380
So it is going to be equal
to 0.5 divided by 10.

98
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,560
So 0.05.

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,780
So what is the probability--
so let's think

100
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,060
about it this way.

101
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,150
What is the probability of
getting 1.05 seconds?

102
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,610
Or another way to think about
it is how many standard

103
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,240
deviations away from this mean
is 1.05 seconds, and what is

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,480
the probability of getting a
result at least that many

105
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,480
standard deviations away
from the mean.

106
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,940
So let's figure out how many
standard deviations away from

107
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,980
the mean that is.

108
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,120
Now essentially we're just
figuring out a Z-score, a

109
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,070
Z-score for this result
right over there.

110
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,980
So let me pick a nice color--
I haven't used orange yet.

111
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,090
So our Z-score-- you could
even do the Z-statistic.

112
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,260
It's being derived from these
other sample statistics.

113
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,060
So our Z-statistic, how far
are we away from the mean?

114
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,310
Well the mean is 1.2.

115
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,730
And we are at 1.05, so I'll
put that less just so that

116
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,350
it'll be a positive distance.

117
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,930
So that's how far away we are.

118
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,350
And if we wanted it in terms
of standard deviations, we

119
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,950
want to divide it by our best
estimate of the sampling

120
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:52,180
distribution's standard
deviation, which is this 0.05.

121
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,730
So this is 0.05, and what is
this going to be equal to?

122
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,840
This result right here,
1.05 seconds.

123
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,310
1.2 minus 1.05 is 0.15.

124
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:12,535
So this is 0.15 in the numerator
divided by 0.05 in

125
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:15,970
the denominator, and so
this is going to be 3.

126
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,020
So this result right here
is 3 standard deviations

127
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,140
away from the mean.

128
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,820
So let me draw this.

129
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,950
This is the mean.

130
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,280
If I did 1 standard deviation,
2 standard deviations, 3

131
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,680
standard deviations-- that's
in the positive direction.

132
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,360
Actually let me draw
it a little bit

133
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,870
different than that.

134
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,330
This wasn't a nicely drawn
bell curve, but I'll do 1

135
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,780
standard deviation, 2 standard
deviation, and then 3 standard

136
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,070
deviations in the positive
direction.

137
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,620
And then we have 1 standard
deviation, 2 standard

138
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,300
deviations, and 3 standard
deviations in

139
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,770
the negative direction.

140
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,270
So this result right here, 1.05
seconds that we got for

141
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,850
our 100 rat sample is
right over here.

142
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,760
3 standard deviations
below the mean.

143
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,460
Now what is the probability
of getting a result

144
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,470
this extreme by chance?

145
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,220
And when I talk about this
extreme, it could be either a

146
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,380
result less than this or a
result of that extreme in the

147
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,410
positive direction.

148
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,490
More than 3 standard
deviations.

149
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,570
So this is essentially, if we
think about the probability of

150
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,940
getting a result more extreme
than this result right over

151
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,030
here, we're thinking about
this area under the bell

152
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,530
curve, both in the negative
direction or in

153
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,180
the positive direction.

154
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,880
What is the probability
of that?

155
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,100
Well we go from the empirical
rule that 99.7% of the

156
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,760
probability is within 3
standard deviations.

157
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,140
So this thing right here-- you
can look it up on a Z-table as

158
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,340
well, but 3 standard deviation
is a nice clean number that

159
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,840
doesn't hurt to remember.

160
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,270
So we know that this area right
here I'm doing and just

161
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:56,800
reddish-orange, that area
right over is 99.7%.

162
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,610
So what is left for these two
magenta or pink areas?

163
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,250
Well if these are 99.7% and
both of these combined are

164
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,380
going to be 0.3%.

165
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:13,480
So both of these combined are
0.3-- I should write it this

166
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,970
way or exactly-- are 0.3%.

167
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,480
0.3%.

168
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,290
Or is we wrote it as a decimal
it would be 0.003 of the total

169
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,530
area under the curve.

170
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,000
So to answer our question, if we
assume that the drug has no

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,500
effect, the probability of
getting a sample this extreme

172
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,450
or actually more extreme
than this is only 0.3%

173
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,740
Less than 1 in 300.

174
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,080
So if the null hypothesis was
true, there's only a 1 in 300

175
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,880
chance that we would have
gotten a result

176
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,730
this extreme or more.

177
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,700
So at least from my point of
view this results seems to

178
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,040
favor the alternative
hypothesis.

179
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:08,180
I'm going to reject the
null hypothesis.

180
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,050
I don't know 100% sure.

181
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,670
But if the null hypothesis was
true there's only 1 in 300

182
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,350
chance of getting this.

183
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,610
So I'm going to go with the
alternative hypothesis.

184
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,570
And just to give you a little
bit of some of the name or the

185
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,890
labels you might see in some
statistics or in some research

186
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,110
papers, this value, the
probability of getting a

187
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:38,620
result more extreme than this
given the null hypothesis is

188
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,470
called a P-value.

189
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,840
So the P-value here, and that
really just stands for

190
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,400
probability value, the P-value
right over here is 0.003.

191
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,010
So there's a very, very small
probability that we could have

192
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,610
gotten this result if the null
hypothesis was true, so we

193
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,500
will reject it.

194
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,750
And in general, most people
have some type

195
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,640
of a threshold here.

196
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,220
If you have a P-value less than
5%, which means less than

197
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,820
1 in 20 shot, let's say, you
know what, I'm going to reject

198
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,830
the null hypothesis.

199
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,480
There's less than a 1 in 20
chance of getting that result.

200
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,320
Here we got much less
than 1 in 20.

201
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,170
So this is a very strong
indicator that the null

202
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,350
hypothesis is incorrect,
and the drug

203
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,860
definitely has some effect.
