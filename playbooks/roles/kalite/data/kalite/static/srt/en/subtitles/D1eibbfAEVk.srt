1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:04,527
we have talked a lot about the formations of mountains and volcanos

2
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:07,504
when plates are running into each other or one plate is being

3
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:10,929
subducted under another, but that isn't the only place

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:16,208
it is the dominant place or the most likely place to find the mountains or volcanos on the surface of

5
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:21,735
the earth. But that's not the only place that mountains of volcanos can form and probably the biggest example

6
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:27,352
of volcanic activity or the most popular one, this might be a slightly American, Amero-centric point of view.

7
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:35,324
But the most, often cited example of volcanic activity away from a plate boundary is Hawaii.

8
00:00:35,324 --> 00:00:44,412
Hawaii, so this right here, these are the hawaiian islands, this is the big island of hawaii, and it is,

9
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:51,290
it is experiencing active, an active volcano. Lava is or magmas flowing from underneath the ground that

10
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:59,832
once its surfaces we called it lava, and that lava is actively making the island,is actively making the island bigger, so where is

11
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:05,976
that volcanic activity coming from and how can we think about that volcanic activity or that kind of heat

12
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:12,943
rising from below the surface of the earth to explain some of the geological features we see around

13
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:18,441
hawaii. So what we think is happening once again, this is all theory right here, is that hawaii is

14
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:24,955
sitting on top of a hot spot, in particular, the big island of hawaii is sitting on the top of the hot spot

15
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:31,504
right now, and this hot spot,this hot spot there is different ways or different theories on how it that

16
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:37,448
emerge, but we think that at the mantle, at the mantle core boundary. I don't know if this diagram were

17
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:43,317
intended this white area to be the core, but that's just say that this is the outter core down here. Let

18
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:51,907
us just say this is the outter core, outter core for the sake of explaining things.We think it is possible

19
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:58,749
that kind of plumes of very hot material can kind of.uh, just based on kind of flow dynamics of what

20
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:05,357
is happening at that mantle outer core boundary that plumes are a really hot material can kind of rise

21
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:13,239
up,can kind of - let me do this in a darker color - can rise up from outter core. It rises up from the outter core and create

22
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,402
a hot spot underneath the moving lithospheric plate, underneath the plate, now it is not necessary, we don't know

23
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:27,033
for sure, where these hot spots are being created from, by these mental plumes these materials formed, or heated

24
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:31,950
up at the outter core mantle boundary, but we do feel pretty confident about is that there is

25
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,562
this hot spot here and it's independent of any of those convection patterns that we saw.

26
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:41,189
I shouldn't say independent, this is obviously all related, cause we have all these fluid commotion

27
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:47,699
going on in the mantle, but it's, it's seperate on some degree from all those convection patterns that

28
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:53,363
we have talked about, that could actually cause the plates to move,and to a large degree or the way we

29
00:02:53,363 --> 00:03:01,396
think about it right now, this is stationary, this hot spot is stationary, relative to the plates. And the

30
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:07,263
reason why we feel pretty good about thinking that it's stationary relative to the plates, is we see this

31
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:12,968
notion right here,if you look at the volcanic if you look at the volcanic rock in Kawaii, which is

32
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:21,870
one of the older inhabited hawaiian islands. The oldest rock we observed there is 5.5 million years old,

33
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:30,035
and it's all volcanic rock, now the oldest rock we observed on the big island is about 7 hundred thousand

34
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:36,909
years old, we also know, we also know that the pacific plate, you could look at this diagram right over

35
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:43,183
here is moving in this general direction, like we know it from, we know it from GPS measurements, is

36
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:53,921
moving exactly in the direction, that the hawaiian islands are kind of distributed in. So uh,uh, frankly, the

37
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:58,755
only good explanation for why we see this pattern, why we see this newer land here and then as we go further

38
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:04,513
and further up the hawaiian island chain we see older and older land actually if we keep going, if we

39
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:10,595
keep going we have the leeward islands over here as we, as we keep measuring the rock on the leeward island as we get older

40
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:15,468
and older as you go to the northwest and if you even look at what's below the ocean.

41
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:18,345
this is the big island of Hawaii

42
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:20,550
these are the main Hawaiian islands,these are the leeward islands

43
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,583
but you see even beyond that submersed under the Pacific Ocean,

44
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,743
you continue to see a chain of islands. So,

45
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:30,362
The explanation for what’s happening here,

46
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:37,789
is that you have a stationary hot spot that is right now underneath the big island of Hawaii

47
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:39,642
And I just wanna be clear,

48
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:44,136
the big island is called the island of Hawaii, it is one of the islands in the state of Hawaii.

49
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:46,257
So I don’t want cause you confusion.

50
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:49,506
I’ll just call it the big island from here on out.

51
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,434
So the hot spot is right under the big island.

52
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:58,826
But if you were to rewind 5 million years ago, if you were to rewind 5 million years ago, the entire pacific plate

53
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:05,067
the entire pacific plate was probably on the order of, you know, about 150, 200 miles,

54
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,950
however far Kawaii is from the big island.

55
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:15,081
It was probably shifted that much to the southeast, if you go back 5 million years ago. So 5 million years ago

56
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:22,387
when all of this was shifted down and to the right, then Kawaii, Kawaii was on top of the hot spot.

57
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:25,208
And so this is how each of these islands are formed.

58
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:31,008
If you rewind a ton of years, then maybe this area over here in the Pacific plate was over the hot spot.

59
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:35,590
Island- an island formed there then Pacific plate kept moving to the northwest.

60
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,515
It kept moving to the northwest and new islands,new volcanos kept forming.

61
00:05:40,515 --> 00:05:43,657
Those volcanos would release lava that would keep piling up,

62
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:47,511
keep piling up keep piling up, eventually, go above the surface of the water,

63
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:54,338
and form this whole chain of islands, and as whole Pacific plate kept moving to the northwest, it kept forming new islands.

64
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:59,151
Now the one question you might ask, is well, how come the big island is bigger?

65
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,813
Has the plate kind of paused over there, is it spending more time over the hot spot

66
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:08,021
so that more lava can kind of form there to form this,

67
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:12,823
to form this- essentially it’s an underwater mountain that’s now also above the water

68
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:20,381
and actually if you go from the base of the Pacific Ocean to the top of the big island of Hawaii it’s actually 50% higher than Mt. Everest,

69
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,609
so you could really just view it as a big mountain

70
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:27,712
But the question is this looks so much bigger than Kawaii they keep getting smaller as you keep going to northwest

71
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:34,016
is somehow the Pacific plate slowing, is it spending more time here? And the answer is it’s probably not slowing,

72
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:39,709
what’s happening is, at one time Kawaii was also probably a relatively large island.

73
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:42,496
If you rewind 5, maybe 5 million years ago,

74
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:49,773
Kawaii also might been about that big, but over 5 million years it’s just experienced the a ton of erosion.

75
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:52,920
Remember, once it moved over the hot spot, new land wasn’t being created,

76
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,767
it’s in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, its experiencing weather,

77
00:06:55,767 --> 00:07:01,705
5 million years is a long period of time, and so it just got eroded over that time. So the older the island is,

78
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:04,679
the more eroded it’s going to be and the smaller it’s going to be.

79
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:09,632
So if you go these, if you go to these under water mountains up here, that don’t even surface above the ocean

80
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:12,531
at one time they might have surfaced, but over, due to the ocean and weather

81
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:19,756
and whatnot they’ve just been eroded over time to become smaller and smaller, just kind of remnants of volcanos

82
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:20,410
So anyway

83
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:23,830
I thought you would find that entertaining, how the Hawaii islands

84
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,282
actually got formed, and how we can actually have these hot spots,

85
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:33,071
and these, this volcanic activity, and actually even earthquake activity, outside of actually

86
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:35,252
eh, eh, eh plate boundaries.

87
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:37,494
Actually while we’re looking at this diagram we talked about,

88
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:39,556
we talked about the trenches of plate boundaries,

89
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:42,248
you can actually see it here, cuz this shows the depth,

90
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:46,571
and the really dark dark dark dark blue, it’s really dark deep parts of the ocean.

91
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:48,795
So here is the Mariana Trench

92
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:53,500
then you can see here over the Pacific plate just getting abducted-- not abducted-

93
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,347
-- getting subducted into other plates, underneath and forms these trenches here.

94
00:07:58,347 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyway hopefully you found that entertaining.
