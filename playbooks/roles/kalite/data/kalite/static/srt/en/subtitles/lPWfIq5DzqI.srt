1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
   

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,160
Let's see if we can create a
linear transformation that is

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,740
a rotation transformation
through some angle theta.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,500
And what it does is, it takes
any vector in R2 and it maps

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,120
it to a rotated version
of that vector.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:28,420
Or another way of saying it, is
that the rotation of some

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:38,870
vector x is going to be equal
to a counterclockwise data

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,850
degree rotation of x.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,170
So this is what we want to
construct using our new linear

10
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,420
transformation tools.

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,050
And just to make sure that we
can actually even do this, we

12
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,250
need to make sure there's an
actual linear transformation.

13
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,810
I'll just do that visually.

14
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,310
I actually don't even
have a mathematical

15
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,240
definition for this yet.

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,190
This is about as good
as I've given you.

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,250
So let me just draw some really
fast axes right here--

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,530
I have to draw them a little
bit neater than that-- so

19
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,210
that's my vertical axes.

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,310
That's my horizontal axes.

21
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,840
I could call this one
the x1 and I'll

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,260
call this the x2-axis.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,530
In the last video I called
them the x and the y.

24
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,290
This is the first component
of our vectors.

25
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,230
This is our second component
in our vectors, and so if I

26
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:31,080
have some vector x like
that, we know that a

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,160
counterclockwise rotation of
this will look like this.

28
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,560
I'll do the rotations in blue.

29
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,390
It will look like this,
where this angle

30
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,130
right here is theta.

31
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,960
So this right here is
the rotation for an

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,640
angle of theta of x.

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,910
That's what this vector
right here is.

34
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,990
So what do we have to do to
make sure that this is a

35
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,850
linear combination?

36
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,800
We have to show two things.

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,100
We have to show that the
transformation, so the

38
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,060
rotation through theta of the
sum of two vectors-- it's

39
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,380
equivalent to the sum of each of
their individual rotations.

40
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,600
The rotation of the vector
x plus the rotation

41
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,620
of the vector y.

42
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,140
And I'll just show that
to you visually.

43
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,700
This is the vector x.

44
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,420
Let's say that the vector y
looks something like-- let me

45
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,395
draw the original vectors
in yellow.

46
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:25,680
So let's say the vector
y looks like that.

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,180
So that's y.

48
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,650
So what's x plus y?

49
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,890
So let's put heads to tails.

50
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,320
If we just shift y up here,
that's also vector y, not

51
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,600
drawn in standard position, but
x plus y would then look

52
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,850
pretty close to this.

53
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,410
   

54
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,650
Let me draw it a little
bit neater. x plus y

55
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,340
would look like that.

56
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,550
That would be the
vector x plus y.

57
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,220
And what would its rotation
look like

58
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,530
through an angle of theta?

59
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,940
What's rotation if you just
rotate this guy through an

60
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,940
angle of theta?

61
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,100
I'm just approximating--
it would look

62
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,350
something like this.

63
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,960
   

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,790
This right here would be the
rotation of data through an

65
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,580
angle of theta of x plus y.

66
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,900
Now let's see if that's the same
thing as if we rotate x

67
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,110
and rotate y and then
add them together.

68
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,735
So what's y if we rotate it
through an angle of theta?

69
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:22,530
If we rotate y through an angle
of theta, it's going to

70
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,070
look something like-- this
is all approximation.

71
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,970
I should be doing it with a
ruler and a protractor.

72
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:38,350
Maybe it looks something like
this-- the rotation of y

73
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,310
through an angle of
theta right there.

74
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,830
That's the same theta
that I've been

75
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,745
doing the whole time.

76
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:45,560
Let me make it in a color that
you can actually see.

77
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,215
So that's that vector
right there.

78
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:49,120
The rotation of x
was right there.

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,030
So if we add the rotation of x
plus the rotation of y-- I'm

80
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,180
kind of fudging it a little bit,
but I think you get the

81
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,600
idea-- so this is the rotation
of x plus the rotation of y.

82
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,700
   

83
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,870
You actually get the rotation
of x plus y.

84
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,490
So at least visually it

85
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,760
satisfied that first condition.

86
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,560
Now the second condition that we
need for this to be a valid

87
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,980
linear transformation, is that
the rotation through an angle

88
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,150
of theta of a scaled up version
of a vector should be

89
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,085
equal to a scaled up version
of the rotated vector.

90
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:27,950
   

91
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,210
And I'll just do another visual
example here, so that's

92
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,880
just my vertical axis.

93
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,630
That's my horizontal axis,
and let me say that this

94
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,346
is my vector x.

95
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,850
Now let's draw a scaled
up version of it.

96
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,030
So a scaled up version of x
may be just like x, but it

97
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,750
gets scaled up a little
bit, so it goes

98
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,390
all the way out here.

99
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,110
So this is my c times x and now
I'm going to rotate that

100
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,580
through an angle of theta.

101
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,720
So if we rotate that through an
angle of theta, you'll get

102
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,930
a vector that looks something
like this.

103
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,470
Rotating it counterclockwise.

104
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,760
So this vector right here is
the rotation by an angle of

105
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,870
theta counterclockwise
of c, x.

106
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,020
That's what this
is right there.

107
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,620
Now what happens if we take
the rotation of x first?

108
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,840
So if we just rotate x first,
we're going to get this vector

109
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,560
right here.

110
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,310
So this right here is just a
rotation for an angle of theta

111
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,510
of x and then we scale it up.

112
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,460
What we see it's the same thing
of this scaled up to

113
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,920
that when you multiplied by c,
than this thing is going to

114
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,480
scale up to that when you
multiply it by c.

115
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,740
So at least visually,
I've shown you

116
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,150
that this is satisfied.

117
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,260
So rotation definitely is a
linear transformation, at

118
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,990
least the way I've shown you.

119
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,070
Now let's actually construct
a mathematical

120
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,200
definition for it.

121
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,730
Let's actually construct a
matrix that will perform the

122
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,540
transformation.

123
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:06,120
So I'm saying that my rotation
transformation from R2 to R2

124
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,270
of some vector x can be defined
as some 2 by 2 matrix.

125
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,250
And it's 2 by 2 because it's a
mapping from R2 to R2 times

126
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,320
any vector x.

127
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
And I'm saying I can do this
because I've at least shown

128
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,360
you visually that it is indeed
a linear transformation.

129
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,430
And how do I find A?

130
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:31,320
Well, I start with-- since this
where's mapping from R2--

131
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,060
I start with the identity
matrix in R2

132
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,710
which is 1, 0, 0, 1.

133
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,990
Its columns are the basis
vectors for R2, right?

134
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,720
We refer to this one as e1 and
this column vector as e2.

135
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,100
And to figure out A, we
essentially just perform the

136
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,750
transformation on each
of these columns.

137
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,480
So let me write that.

138
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,200
So A-- our matrix A-- is going
to be-- the first column of it

139
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,460
is going to be a rotation
transformation performed on

140
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,410
the vector 1, 0.

141
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,210
And our second column is going
to be the rotation

142
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,020
transformation-- there's a
little data here that I'm

143
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,460
forgetting to write-- times the
second column vector-- or

144
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,730
the transformation of
that one, 0, 1.

145
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,010
This is what our A is
going to look like.

146
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,250
So how do we figure out
what these are?

147
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,200
I'm trying to get to some
numbers and this doesn't get

148
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,860
me there, so let's
try to do that.

149
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,010
Let me draw some
more axes here.

150
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,500
Let me pick a different color,
I'll do it in grey.

151
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,820
So that is my vertical axes.

152
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,940
That is my horizontal axes.

153
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,560
I could call this the x1-axis
and this is the x2-axis.

154
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,250
Now this basis vector e1,
what does it look like?

155
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,190
Well, it's 1 in the horizontal
x1 is 1 and x2 is 0.

156
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,700
So this is 1 out here, e1
will look like that.

157
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,210
Let me do it in a more
vibrant color.

158
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:11,230
e1 will look like that
right there.

159
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,370
Now let me write what e2 looks
like. e2 would look like--

160
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,750
I'll do it in yellow--
e2 would look

161
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,600
like this right here.

162
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,810
e2-- that's that vector, 0, 1.

163
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,980
This is 1 in our x2 direction.

164
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,380
Now if I rotate e1 by an angle
theta, what will it look like?

165
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,130
So if I rotate e1 in angle theta
-- I'll do it in this

166
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,254
color right here-- it will still
have a length of 1, but

167
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:38,669
it'll be rotated like
that and that angle

168
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,470
right there is theta.

169
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:47,000
So this right here is the
rotation of e1 by theta.

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,520
These are all vectors,
of course.

171
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,670
That's what that is.

172
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,280
Now what are the coordinates
for this?

173
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,160
Or how do we specify
this new vector?

174
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,000
Well we can break out a little
bit of our trigonometry.

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,680
Its new x1 coordinate-- we
could call it-- or its x1

176
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,580
entry is going to be this
length right here.

177
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,390
   

178
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,810
So if we draw a right triangle,
it is the side that

179
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,550
is adjacent to theta.

180
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,740
This side is a hypotenuse
which is length 1.

181
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,210
So how do we figure
out this side?

182
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,980
If we call this side
the adjacent side.

183
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,480
The adjacent side over
the hypotenuse.

184
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,940
Adjacent-- let me write
it over here.

185
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,900
Adjacent over the hypotenuse
which is just 1, is equal to

186
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,920
the cosine of theta.

187
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,580
That comes from SOH-CAH-TOA
Let me write that.

188
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,530
Cosine is adjacent over
hypoteneuse, and the adjacent

189
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,480
side is going to be our new
x1 coordinate, right?

190
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,970
Well, we can obviously ignore
that 1, a divided by 1 is

191
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,680
equal to cosine theta, which
means that a is equal to

192
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,340
cosine theta, which means that
this length of our rotated

193
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,540
vector is equal to
cosine theta.

194
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,870
Its horizontal component, or its
horizontal coordinate is

195
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,930
equal to cosine of theta.

196
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:15,540
Now, what's its vertical
component going to be?

197
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,110
Its vertical component is going
to be this height right

198
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,960
here, which is the same thing
as that height right there.

199
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,910
Or we could say sine of theta--
and call this the

200
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,400
opposite-- sine of theta is
equal to the opposite over 1.

201
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,350
So this is going to be equal
to sine of theta, right?

202
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,090
This over 1, which is just
this, is equal to sine of

203
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,340
theta from SOH-KAH-TOA.

204
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,110
   

205
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,070
So this vertical component is
equal to sine of theta.

206
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,030
So the new rotated basis vector
could be written as

207
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,815
cosine of theta for its x
component, or for its

208
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,580
horizontal component.

209
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,510
And sine of theta for its
vertical component.

210
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,150
This is the new rotated
basis vector.

211
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,990
Now what about e2?

212
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,630
We could do something very
similar there. e2 is going to

213
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,220
end up looking like this
when you rotate it

214
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,880
by an angle of theta.

215
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,140
It's going to look like that.

216
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,190
That angle right
there is theta.

217
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:19,040
We can create a little right
triangle right there.

218
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,540
And so if we want to know its
x coordinate-- so now we're

219
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,580
concerned with the rotation
through an angle of theta of

220
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,420
e2, which is that right
there, of e2.

221
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,410
This is e2 right there.

222
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,890
This is going to be
equal to what?

223
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,870
Its new x coordinate or its
first entry in this vector if

224
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,125
we wanted to draw it in
standard position.

225
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,670
Or the point that it is
specifying is going to be

226
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,960
equal to this distance, which
is equal to this distance on

227
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,970
this triangle.

228
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,910
But the coordinate is
going to be the

229
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,990
negative of this, right?

230
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,060
If this is a distance of
2, this coordinate is

231
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,370
going to be minus 2.

232
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,030
So what's this?

233
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,840
We have an angle.

234
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,140
It's a right triangle.

235
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,930
This is opposite to the angle.

236
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,500
Opposite over 1, opposite
over hypotenuse is equal

237
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,480
to cosine of theta.

238
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,130
So this opposite side is equal
to the cosine of theta.

239
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,040
So the x-coordinate
right here.

240
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,270
Oh sorry, my trigonometry
is messing up.

241
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,990
This is the opposite
side-- SOH-CAH-TOA.

242
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,930
Sine is equal to opposite--
let me write it-- sine of

243
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,910
theta is equal to opposite
over hypotenuse.

244
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,360
So the sine of theta-- the sine
of this angle is equal to

245
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,290
the opposite over
the hypotenuse.

246
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,820
The hypotenuse is 1, has length
1 because these are the

247
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,520
standard basis vectors.

248
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,000
So this is equal to
the sine of theta.

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,810
Now, this distance is equal to
the sine of theta that's going

250
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,630
in the negative direction, so
it's going to be equal to the

251
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,210
minus sine of theta.

252
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,690
And then what it's new y
component going to be of this

253
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,710
rotated version of e2?

254
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,030
Well, we just look right here.

255
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,530
We have our angle.

256
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,570
This is adjacent to the angle.

257
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,510
This adjacent side over the
hypotenuse-- adjacent over 1--

258
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,270
which is just this is adjacent
right here is just going to be

259
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,600
equal to cosine of theta.

260
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,700
So its new y-coordinate going
to be cosine of theta.

261
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,780
So when we apply the
transformation to each of our

262
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:21,620
basis vectors, we get A is equal
to the transformation

263
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:27,530
applied to e1 which is cosine
of theta and sine of theta.

264
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,300
And the transformation applied
to e2, which is minus sine of

265
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,820
theta times the cosine
of theta.

266
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,010
So now this is a big result.

267
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,850
We've now been able to
mathematically specify our

268
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,750
rotation transformation
using a matrix.

269
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,040
So we can now say that the
rotation transformation-- and

270
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,560
it's a transformation from R2
to R2-- it's a function.

271
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,610
We can say that the rotation
through an angle of theta of

272
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,860
any vector x in our domain is
equal to the matrix cosine of

273
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,320
theta, sine of theta, minus
sine of theta, cosine of

274
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,960
theta, times your vector in your
domain, times x1 and x2.

275
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,920
And you might be saying, oh Sal,
we did all this work and

276
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,710
that's kind of neat, but
how do I apply this?

277
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,200
I still have all these cosines
of thetas and sines of thetas

278
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,320
there-- how I do it?

279
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,730
Well, what you do is, you pick
an angle you want to rotate

280
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,590
to, and just evaluate these, and
you'll just have a normal

281
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,740
matrix with numbers in it.

282
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,760
So let's say we wanted to rotate
through an angle of 45

283
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,660
degrees some vector.

284
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,290
Well, this is going to
be equal to what?

285
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,510
We just apply, or we evaluate
each of these

286
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,950
ratios at 45 degrees.

287
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,310
A cosine of 45 degrees is the
square root of 2 over 2.

288
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,870
Sine of 45 degrees is square
root of 2 over 2.

289
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,540
Sine of 45 is the square
root of 2 over 2.

290
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,530
We have a minus there--
so minus the square

291
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,010
root of 2 over 2.

292
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:02,960
And then cosine is just square
root of 2 over 2.

293
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,220
So we multiply it times
our vector x.

294
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,830
So this matrix, if we
multiply it times

295
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,700
any vector x, literally.

296
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,330
So if we have some coordinates
right here.

297
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:22,260
And let's say that I were to
have a bunch of vectors that

298
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,800
specify some square here.

299
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,340
Let me see if I can
do it properly.

300
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,300
Well, maybe it has some triangle
here--maybe that will

301
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,620
be a little easier
for me to draw.

302
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,410
I'll do a square.

303
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:40,382
Let's say it has some square
here in my domain.

304
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:43,580
So this is in R2.

305
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,760
If I literally multiply this
times each of the basis

306
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,880
vectors, or actually all of the
vectors that specify this

307
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,790
set here, I will get, when I
transform it, I'll get a

308
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,710
rotated version of this
by 45 degrees.

309
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,380
Just to draw it, I'll actually
draw a little 45 degree angle

310
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,570
right there.

311
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:07,430
And then it will map it to this
image right there, which

312
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,940
is a pretty neat result.

313
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,670
And if you ever attempted to
write any computer game that

314
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,480
involves marbles or pinballs
going around, this is a very

315
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,220
useful thing to know-- how
you rotate things.

316
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,360
In the future, we'll talk
about other types of

317
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,010
transformations.

318
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,780
But this is a super useful one
and this is super hard to do.

319
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
And I remember the first time I
wrote a computer program to

320
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,600
try to do this type of thing,
I just did it by hand.

321
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,670
But when you have this tool at
your disposal, all you have to

322
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,625
do is evaluate this matrix at
the angle you want to rotate

323
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:38,420
it by, and then multiply it
times your position vectors.

324
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,010
And so obviously you
have a bunch of

325
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,930
position vectors here.

326
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,780
But here you can just do it
times the vertices and then

327
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,720
you can say OK.

328
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,990
And everything else is just
connect the dots between them.

329
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,550
And then you have your
rotated image.

330
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,910
And just to be clear, these are
the points specified by a

331
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,150
set of vectors and
I always want to

332
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,060
make this clear, right?

333
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,540
This point right here is
specified by some position

334
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,620
vector that looks like that.

335
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,819
When you apply the rotation on
45 degrees of that vector,

336
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,319
this vector then looks
like this.

337
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,650
And the vector that specified
this corner right here-- we'll

338
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,119
do it in a different color--
that specified this corner

339
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,880
right here, when you're rotated
by 45 degrees, then

340
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,540
becomes this vector.

341
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,140
And the vector that specified
that corner over there, that

342
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,800
now becomes this vector.

343
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,710
That's what actually being
mapped or actually being

344
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,650
transformed.

345
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,430
Anyway, hopefully you found
this pretty neat.

346
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,500
I thought this was, at least for
me, the first really neat

347
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:35,900
transformation.

348
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,490
And you can already start
thinking about how to extend

349
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,860
this into multiple dimensions
especially three dimensionals.

350
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,420
If you ever try to actually do
it by hand, three dimension

351
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,940
rotation becomes
very confusing.

352
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,230
But in the next video we'll
actually figure out a way to

353
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,550
do three dimensional rotations
around certain axes.

354
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,378
