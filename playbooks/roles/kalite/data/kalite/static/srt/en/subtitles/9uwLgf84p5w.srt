00:00:00,677 --> 00:00:04,215
When people use the word "perimeter" in everyday language

2
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:07,410
they're talking about the boundary of some area.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,469
And when we're talking about perimeter in math, we're talking about a related idea

4
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,803
but now we're not only talking about the boundary, we're actually talking about the length of the boudary,

5
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:21,587
how far do you have to go round the boundary to essentially go completely around a figure,

6
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:23,727
completely go round the area.

7
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:26,550
So let's look at this first triangle right over here.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,187
It has three sides -- that's why it's a triangle -- so what's its perimeter?

9
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:32,089
Well, here, all the sides are the same,

10
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:39,823
so the perimeter for this triangle is going to be 4+4+4 in whatever unit this is.

11
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:47,334
And if this is 4 feet, 4 feet and 4 feet, that'll be feet+4 feet+4 feet=12 feet.

12
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:53,390
Now I encourage you to now pause the video and figure out the perimeters of these three figures.

13
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:59,194
Well, that's the exact same idea: we will just add the lengths of the sides

14
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:02,962
So, let's say that that these distances in -- let's say they are in meters.

15
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:06,864
So let's say that this is 3 meters, this is also 3 meters --

16
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:09,911
this is a rectangle here, so this is 5 meters and this is also 5 meters.

17
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:13,752
So what is the perimeter of this rectangle going to be?

18
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:18,074
What is the distance around the rectangle that bounds this area?

19
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:25,520
Well, it's going to be 3+5+3+5,

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,641
which is equal to, let's see, that's 3+3 is 6, plus 5+5 is 10,

21
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:35,163
so that's equal to 16, and if we're saying these are all in meters,

22
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:40,033
these are in meters, that is going to be 16 meters.

23
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:41,448
Now, what about this pentagon?

24
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:47,866
Let's say that each of these sides are 2, and I'll make up -- I'll make up a unit here:

25
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:53,289
Let's say they're 2 gnus - 2 gnus: that's a new unit that I have --

26
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,939
a new unit of distance that I have just -- that I have just invented.

27
00:01:56,941 --> 00:02:01,769
2, 2 gnus, 2 gnus.

28
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:06,011
So what is the perimeter of this pentagon in gnus?

29
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:11,303
Well, it's 2+2+2+2+2 gnus.

30
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:21,230
Or: we're essentially taking 1, 3, 3, 4, 5 gnu -- 5 sides, each have a length of 2 gnus,

31
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,245
So the perimeter here, we could add 2 repeatedly 5 times

32
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:32,735
or you could just say this is 5 x 2 gnus, which is equal to 10 gnus

33
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:36,369
where gnus is a completely made-up unit of length that I just made up.

34
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:41,259
Here we have a more irregular polygon, but same exact idea:

35
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,636
How would you figure out its perimeter?

36
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:45,732
Well, you just add up the lengths of its sides.

37
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,233
And here I'll just do it in units: let us just assume that this is some generic unit.

38
00:02:49,233 --> 00:03:02,810
And here the perimeter will be 1+4+2+2 -- we'll scroll over to the right just a little bit -- +4+6 .

39
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,528
So what is this going to be equal to?

40
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:13,290
1+4 is 5, +2 is 7, +2 is 9, +4 is 13, +6 is 19.

41
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,250
So this figure has a perimeter of 19

42
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,460
in whatever unit these distances are actually given.
