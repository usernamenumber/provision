1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,460
So let's review everything that
we know so far, because it's

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,470
good to keep reviewing.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,360
Because these are things
you should never forget

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,870
the rest of your life.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,330
So if I have a line and if I
draw an angle that goes--

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,530
let's say this is the
pivot point, right?

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,790
If I go all the way around
the line, or in a circle,

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,975
that's 360 degrees.

9
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:23,970
11
00:00:23,97 --> 00:00:27,43
We learned that there are
360 degrees in a circle.

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,750
Right?

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,440
We also learned that if
I have lines like this.

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:41,140
If I have two angles-- let
me draw it like that.

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,710
16
00:00:43,71 --> 00:00:49,49
And this is angle x.

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,625
This is angle y.

15
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:54,122
19
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:57,825
x and y are supplementary.

16
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:04,240
21
00:01:04,24 --> 00:01:07,63
And that just means that
they add up to 180 degrees.

17
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,810
x plus y is equal
to 180 degrees.

18
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,920
And why does that make sense?

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,200
Because look, if we add
up x plus y we have gone

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,450
halfway around the circle.

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,040
So that's 180 degrees, right?

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,380
So hopefully we
have learned that.

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,316
And then let me switch colors
for the sake of variety.

24
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:39,080
Let me use my line tool.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,140
If I have-- let's see,
I'm going to draw

26
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,050
perpendicular lines.

27
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,220
If I have that line, and
then I have that line.

28
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,080
And they are perpendicular.

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,270
And then I have another line.

30
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,870
Let's say it goes like that.

31
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,830
39
00:01:59,83 --> 00:02:03,73
And then I say that
this is angle x.

32
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,030
Woops.

33
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,650
This is angle x.

34
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,240
And this is angle y.

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,290
44
00:02:12,29 --> 00:02:16,04
Well, I said this line and this
line are perpendicular, right?

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,390
So that means that they
intersect at a 90 degree angle.

37
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,710
So we know that this whole
thing is 90 degrees.

38
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,070
48
00:02:24,07 --> 00:02:26,01
And so what do we
know about x plus y?

39
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,435
Well, x plus y is going
to equal 90 degrees.

40
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:34,130
51
00:02:34,13 --> 00:02:41,33
Or we could say that x
and y are complementary.

41
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,920
And I always get confused
between supplementary

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,670
and complementary.

43
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,910
You just got to memorize it.

44
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,470
I don't know if there's
any-- let's see, is

45
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,650
there any easy way?

46
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,950
180, supplementary.

47
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,890
You could say that 180-- 100
starts with an O, which

48
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,950
supplementary does
not start with.

49
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,080
So there.

50
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,500
There's your mnemonic.

51
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,910
Complementary.

52
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,100
And 90 starts with an N,
and complementary does

53
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,920
not start with an N.

54
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,450
That's your other mnemonic.

55
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:07,930
Complementary.

56
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:15,420
68
00:03:15,42 --> 00:03:16,59
I don't know if I'm
spelling it right.

57
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,590
Who cares?

58
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,750
Let's move on.

59
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,190
So let's learn some more
stuff about angles.

60
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,490
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you an arsenal,

61
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,640
and then once you have that
arsenal you can just tackle

62
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,280
these beastly problems that
I'm going to throw at you.

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,960
So just take these for granted
right now, and then in a few

64
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,630
videos, probably, we're
going to tackle some

65
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,505
beastly problems.

66
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:38,220
79
00:03:38,22 --> 00:03:40,48
And you know, I'm
using variables here.

67
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,486
And if you're not familiar
with variables you

68
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:42,135
can put numbers here.

69
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:46,050
If x was 30 degrees, then y
is going to be 60 degrees.

70
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,670
Right?

71
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,050
Or in this case, if x is, I
don't know, 45 degrees, then y

72
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,960
is going to be 135 degrees.

73
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,560
That other way.

74
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,290
Let me draw another property of
angles of intersecting lines.

75
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:05,890
So if I have two angles, two
lines that intersect like this.

76
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,560
90
00:04:08,56 --> 00:04:10,76
So a couple of
interesting things.

77
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,695
So first, I'm going to teach
you about opposite angles.

78
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:17,490
93
00:04:17,49 --> 00:04:19,51
Let me switch colors.

79
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,860
Let me switch to yellow.

80
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:30,710
So if this is x degrees, then
it turns out that the angle

81
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,110
opposite to it is also
equal to x degrees.

82
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,430
98
00:04:40,43 --> 00:04:42,18
And you don't believe me?

83
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,550
Well let me prove it to you.

84
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,900
Let's say we call this,
I don't know, let's

85
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,800
call this y degrees.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,560
Right?

87
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,520
And I'm going to prove
to you that the x and

88
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,020
the y are the same.

89
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,680
Well what do we know already?

90
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,640
Let's call this other angle--
and I'm doing this to

91
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:10,530
confuse you-- angle z.

92
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,940
Well what do we know about
angle x and angle z?

93
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,160
It may not be obvious to you
because I've drawn it slightly

94
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,350
different, but I'll give you
a small hint with

95
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,310
an appropriately
interesting color.

96
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,870
So what angle is this
whole thing right here?

97
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,550
Well I'm just going
along a line, right?

98
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,600
That's halfway around a circle.

99
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,250
So what does x plus z equal?

100
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,820
Well, x plus z is going to
equal that larger angle.

101
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:54,040
x plus purple z is going to
equal-- I think I'll switch to

102
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,030
the blue; maybe it's taking too
much time for me to switch--

103
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,890
is equal to 180 degrees.

104
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,580
Or x and z are supplementary.

105
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,240
124
00:06:09,24 --> 00:06:10,63
I've run out of space.

106
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,900
So what do we know about z?

107
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:20,400
Well z is equal to 180 minus x.

108
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,750
Right?

109
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,070
Because x plus z is 180.

110
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,540
Fine.

111
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,850
Now, what's the relationship
between z and y?

112
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,770
Well, z and y are
also supplementary.

113
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,210
Because look, if I
drew this angle here.

114
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,792
Look at this big angle.

115
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:42,070
135
00:06:42,07 --> 00:06:42,69
What angle is that?

116
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,260
Well once again I'm still going
halfway around the circle.

117
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:45,990
Right?

118
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,390
But now I'm using this
line right here.

119
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,230
So that's 180 degrees.

120
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,440
So we know that angle z
plus angle y is also

121
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,685
equal to 180 degrees.

122
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:05,540
143
00:07:05,54 --> 00:07:06,82
Right?

123
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,930
Or, I don't want to keep
writing it, but z and y

124
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,670
are also supplementary.

125
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,500
But we just figured out
that z is 180 minus x.

126
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,140
Right?

127
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,960
So let's just substitute
that back in here.

128
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:29,420
So we get 180 minus x plus
y is equal to 180 degrees.

129
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,690
Why don't we subtract 180
degrees from both sides

130
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,960
of this equation.

131
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,540
That cancels out, and we get
minus x plus y is equal to 0.

132
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,730
And then add x to both sides
of this equation, and

133
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,030
we get y is equal to x.

134
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,950
So x is equal to y.

135
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,730
And if you've played around
with this, if you just drew a

136
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,160
bunch of straight lines and
they intersected at different

137
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,720
angles, I think when you
eyeball it it would make sense.

138
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,590
And then similarly, if that's z
then the other opposite angle

139
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:15,510
here is also z degrees.

140
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,790
So what do we know now?

141
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,870
The total angles in a
circle, 360 degrees.

142
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,380
When two angles kind of
combine, go halfway around the

143
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,520
circle-- or they combine,
kind of form a line.

144
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,530
There's different ways
you can think about it.

145
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,370
We know they're supplementary.

146
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,350
They add up to 180 degrees.

147
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,920
x plus y is 180 degrees.

148
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,360
If they add up to 90
it's complementary.

149
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,570
x plus y is 90.

150
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,020
And then opposite angles
are equal to each other.

151
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,350
Right?

152
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,130
This angle is equal
to this angle.

153
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,310
And then this angle is going to
be equal to this angle for the

154
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,990
same reason-- because
it's opposite.

155
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,355
In the next video I'm going
to show you about parallel

156
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:55,940
lines and transversals.

157
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,170
More fancy words for what
I think are fairly

158
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,520
straightforward concepts.

159
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,796
I'll see you in the next video.
