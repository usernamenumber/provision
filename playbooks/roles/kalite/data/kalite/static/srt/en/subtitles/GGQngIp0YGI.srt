1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,440
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,410
Now that we hopefully have a
little bit of an intuition of

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,360
what a limit is, or finding
the limit of a function is,

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,150
let's do some problems.

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,150
Some of these you might
actually see on your exams or

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,610
when you're actually trying to
solve a general limit problem.

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,440
So let's say what is the
limit-- once again, my

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,020
pen is not working.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:31,740
What is the limit as
x approaches-- let's

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,960
say negative 1.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,170
And let me see, what's a good--
let's say my expression is--

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,480
I'll put it in parentheses
so it's cleaner.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:53,490
It's 2x plus 2 over x plus 1.

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,070
So the first thing I would
always try to do is just say

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,930
what happens if I just stick x
straight into this expression?

16
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,810
What happens?

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,360
Well, what's 2x plus 2 when
x is equal to negative 1?

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,790
2 times negative 1.

19
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:12,090
2 times negative 1 plus 2
over negative 1 plus 1.

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,030
Well, the numerator is negative
2 plus 2-- that equals 0--

21
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,540
over-- what's the denominator?

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,930
Negative 1 plus 1.

23
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,150
Over 0.

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,510
And do we know
what 0 over 0 is?

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,020
Well, no.

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,250
It's undefined, right?

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,320
So here's a case, just like
what we saw in that first

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,940
video, where the limit actually
can't equal what the expression

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,770
equals when you substitute x
for the number you're trying to

30
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,560
find the limit of because you
get an undefined answer.

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,750
So let's see if, using the
limit, we can come up

32
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,080
with a better answer for
what it's approaching.

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,120
Well, since we're just starting
with these limit problems,

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,580
let me draw a graph.

35
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,700
And I think this is going
to give you the intuition

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,090
for what we're doing.

37
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,560
It'll probably give
you the answer.

38
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,180
But then I'll show you how
to solve this analytically.

39
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:06,120
So if I draw a graph,
these are the axes.

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,710
Actually, I'll do the
graphical and the analytical

41
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,130
at the same time.

42
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,450
So I want to rewrite this
expression in a way that

43
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,020
maybe I can simplify it.

44
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,840
So 2x plus 2.

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,805
Isn't that the same thing
as 2 times x plus 1?

46
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:25,390
   

47
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,960
2 times x plus 1, right?

48
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,250
2x plus 2 is the same thing as
2 times x plus one, and then

49
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:39,190
all of that is over x plus 1.

50
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,440
So as long as this expression
and this expression don't equal

51
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,040
0, it actually turns out that
this function-- let's say

52
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,260
this is f of x, right?

53
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,940
This function.

54
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,660
Well, for every value other
than x is equal to negative

55
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,770
1, you could actually
cancel this and this out.

56
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:06,360
And so really, we see that f of
x is equal to-- I need to find

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:15,750
a better tool-- f of x is equal
to 2 when x does not

58
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,010
equal negative 1.

59
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,510
And we saw when x is equal to
negative 1, it's undefined.

60
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:32,050
So undefined when
equals negative 1.

61
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,470
So how would we graph that?

62
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,090
We showed that f of x is equal
to 2 when x does not equal

63
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,240
negative 1 and f of x
is undefined when x

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,630
equals negative 1.

65
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,240
And once again, all I did is
kind of rewrite this exact

66
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,520
same function, right?

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,380
I showed that I could simplify
and I could divide the

68
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,930
numerator and denominator by x
plus 1 as long as x does not

69
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,200
equal negative 1, and that
otherwise, it's undefined.

70
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,310
So let me graph this.

71
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,200
I'm going to get a
different color.

72
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,890
Maybe I'll go with red.

73
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,280
So this is 2.

74
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,660
So we see that x is-- and let
me say this is negative 1.

75
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,190
   

76
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,080
So for every other value other
than negative 1, the value of

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,910
this, of f of x, is equal to 2.

78
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:22,170
This is 1, this is 2,
this is 3, and so on.

79
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,950
At negative 1, the
graph is undefined.

80
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,160
So there's a hole there.

81
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,940
And then we keep going
to the left-hand side.

82
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,480
So if we're going to do the
limit, we can just visually

83
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,560
say, well, as x-- let me
do another color now.

84
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,400
As x comes from the left-hand
side, what does f of x equal?

85
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,660
Well, f of x is 2, 2, 2, 2,
2. f of x is equal to 2

86
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,230
until we get to exactly
negative 1, right?

87
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,700
And similarly, when we go
from the other hand, it's

88
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,940
the exact same thing.

89
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,040
f of x is 2, 2, 2 until
we get to negative 1.

90
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,310
So you'll see, and I'll make
sure you see it visually here,

91
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:09,180
that the limit as approaches
negative 1 of 2x plus 2 over

92
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,900
x plus 1, it equals 2.

93
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,500
Let me draw a line here
so you don't get messed

94
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,520
up with all of it.

95
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,090
And I'm not formally, I guess,
proving here that the limit is

96
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,460
2, but I'm showing you kind of
an analytical way, and this is

97
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,040
actually how it tends to be
done in algebra class, is that

98
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,730
you tend to simplify the
expression so that you say, oh,

99
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,630
if there wasn't a hole here,
what would the f of

100
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,760
x equal, right?

101
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,910
And then you'd just
evaluate it at that point.

102
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,790
I think this might give you a
little intuition, but this

103
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,050
isn't a formal solution.

104
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,710
But unless you're asked to,
you tend not to be asked

105
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,800
for a formal solution.

106
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
You actually just tend to ask
what the limit is, and this is

107
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,690
the way you could solve it.

108
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,430
And actually another way that
you could-- I mean, I often

109
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,310
used to check my answers when I
used to do it is you could take

110
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,620
a calculator and try in-- what
happens when: what is f

111
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,035
of minus 1.001, right?

112
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:15,730
And you can also try what is
f of negative 0.999, right?

113
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,210
Because what you want to do is
you want to say, well, what

114
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,010
does the function equal when I
get really close to negative 1?

115
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,410
And then you could keep going
closer and closer to negative

116
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,490
1 and see what the function
approaches, and in this

117
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,750
case, you'll see that
it approaches 2.

118
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,740
So let's do another problem.

119
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,240
   

120
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:46,160
Well, let's say, what is
the limit as x approaches

121
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,570
0 of 1 over x?

122
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,360
I think here it might be useful
to draw this graph because

123
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,520
it'll give you a visual reason,
a visual represent-- actually,

124
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,730
let's do it both ways.

125
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,970
Let's say-- let's do it the
picking-numbers method because

126
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,580
I think that'll give you an
intuition and maybe it'll

127
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,500
help us draw the graph.

128
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,410
So let's say that
this is f of x.

129
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,580
f of x-- you can tell my
presentation is very

130
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,690
unplanned-- f of x is
equal to 1 over x.

131
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,520
And we want to find the
limit as x approaches 0.

132
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,870
So what is f of-- actually,
let's make a table.

133
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,760
f of x.

134
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:36,670
   

135
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,000
So clearly when x is equal
to 0, we don't know.

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,310
It's undefined.

137
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,340
1 over 0 is undefined.

138
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:51,960
   

139
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:59,170
But what happens when
x equals minus 0.01?

140
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:04,050
Well, with minus 0.01, 1 over
minus 0.01, that is equal

141
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,750
to negative 100, right?

142
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,070
What happens when x is equal
to minus 0.001, right?

143
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,880
So we're getting closer
and closer to 0 from

144
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,240
the negative direction.

145
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,430
Well, here it equals--
make sure my pen is

146
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,900
working, color right.

147
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,540
Something's wrong with my tool.

148
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,250
Now my computer's
breaking down.

149
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,740
Let's see what's going on.

150
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:38,060
   

151
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,260
I think my computer just froze.

152
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,330
Well, I'm going to try to solve
this, and in the very next

153
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,730
video, I'm going to continue
on with this problem.

154
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,650
So I'll actually see you in the
next presentation while I

155
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,770
figure out why my pen isn't
working, and then we'll

156
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,780
continue with this problem.

157
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,290
See you very soon.
