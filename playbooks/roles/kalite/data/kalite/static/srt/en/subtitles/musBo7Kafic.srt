1
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:06,049
We begin with a problem.

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:07,761
[WIND BLOWING]

3
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,356
Alice and Bob live in tree forts,

4
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:18,135
which are far apart,

5
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:20,931
with no line of sight between them.

6
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:23,273
And they need to communicate.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,054
So they decide to run a wire

8
00:00:25,054 --> 00:00:26,737
between the two houses.

9
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:41,651
They pull the wire tight,

10
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:44,973
and attach a tin can to each end –

11
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:53,899
allowing them to send their voices

12
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,884
faintly along the wire.

13
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:01,515
[BOB - MUFFLED] "Hello?"

14
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:05,573
[ALICE - MUFFLED] Hello? I can't hear you.

15
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:08,688
[BOB - MUFFLED] I can hear you, but just barely.

16
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:14,591
[ALICE - MUFFLED] 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

17
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:18,299
However, there is a problem:

18
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,682
'noise.'

19
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:22,255
Whenever there is a high wind,

20
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:24,170
it becomes impossible to hear

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,927
the signal over the noise.

22
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:30,259
So they need a way to increase

23
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:32,439
the energy level of the signal,

24
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,931
to separate it from the noise.

25
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:37,126
This gives Bob an idea.

26
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:42,859
They can simply pluck the wire,

27
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:46,599
which is much easier to detect over the noise.

28
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,979
But this leads to a new problem.

29
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,165
How do they encode their messages as plucks?

30
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:57,979
Well, since they want to play

31
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:00,140
board games across a distance,

32
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,270
they tackle the most common messages first –

33
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,075
the outcome of two dice rolls.

34
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:08,630
In this case, the messages they are sending

35
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,869
can be thought of as a selection

36
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:13,840
from a finite number of 'symbols' –

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,090
in this case, the eleven possible numbers,

38
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,997
which we call a 'discrete source.'

39
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:27,455
At first, they decide to use the simplest method.

40
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:30,610
They send the result as the number of plucks.

41
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,803
So, to send a '3,' they send three plucks.

42
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:35,626
'9' is nine plucks.

43
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:38,176
And '12' is twelve plucks.

44
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:40,510
However, they soon realize that this takes

45
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,262
much longer than it needs to.

46
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:48,476
From practice, they find that their maximum pluck speed

47
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:50,919
is two plucks per second.

48
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,769
Any faster, and they will get confused.

49
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,340
So two plucks per second can be thought of as the 'rate' –

50
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,736
or 'capacity' – for sending information in this way.

51
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:05,841
[SOUND OF PLUCKING]

52
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:06,945
And it turns out that

53
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:09,745
the most common roll is a 7 –

54
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:14,355
so it takes 3.5 seconds to send the number 7.

55
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:20,173
[THE SOUND OF 7 PLUCKS]

56
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:24,486
Alice then realizes they can do much better

57
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:27,429
if they change their coding strategy.

58
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:29,894
She realizes that the odds of each number being sent

59
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:31,704
[follow] a simple pattern.

60
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:33,853
There is one way to roll a 2.

61
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:35,879
[There are] two ways to roll a 3.

62
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,020
Three ways to roll a 4.

63
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,330
Four ways to roll a 5.

64
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,618
Five ways to roll a 6.

65
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:44,724
And six ways to roll a 7 –

66
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,277
the most common [result].

67
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:48,597
And five ways to roll an 8.

68
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:50,319
Four ways for a 9 –

69
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,728
and so on, back to one way for a 12.

70
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,886
This is a graph showing

71
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:57,927
the number of ways each result can occur.

72
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:00,089
And the pattern is obvious.

73
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:02,141
So now, let's change the graph to

74
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,359
'number of plucks versus each symbol.'

75
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,799
She proceeds by mapping

76
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,110
the most common number –

77
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,009
7 – to the shortest signal – one pluck.

78
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:14,230
[SOUND OF ONE PLUCK]

79
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,125
She then proceeds to the next most probable number.

80
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,076
And if there is a tie, she picks one at random.

81
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:22,959
In this case, she selects 6 to be two plucks,

82
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,427
and then 8 to be three plucks,

83
00:04:25,427 --> 00:04:28,232
and then back to 5 to be four plucks,

84
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:30,344
and 9 is five plucks,

85
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:33,793
and back and forth, until we reach 12,

86
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:36,403
which is assigned to 11 plucks.

87
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:39,444
Now, the most common number, 7,

88
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:41,800
can be sent in less than a second –

89
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,788
a huge improvement.

90
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:46,050
This simple change allows them to send

91
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,964
more information in the same amount of time, on average.

92
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:54,440
In fact, this coding strategy is optimal

93
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,020
for this simple example –

94
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,649
in that it's impossible for you

95
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:00,030
to come up with a shorter method

96
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,671
of sending two dice rolls – using identical plucks.

97
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,715
However, after playing with the wire for some time,

98
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:11,094
Bob hits on a new idea.
