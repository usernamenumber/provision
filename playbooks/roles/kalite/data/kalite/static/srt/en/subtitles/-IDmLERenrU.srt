1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:06,530
You've probably heard the term
short sale, and have at least

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,390
a general-- oh, what
did I do with that?

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,440
Oh there it is, I scrolled
down-- you probably have a

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,800
general idea that it means, to
some degree, making a bet that

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,060
a stock will fall.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,800
And there's been a lot of news
lately that maybe short

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,480
sellers are to blame for a lot
of the stock market crashes,

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,580
or what's happening
with banks.

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,620
So I thought it would be
worthwhile to at least explain

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,040
what a short sale is.

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,210
And then we could talk a little
bit about whether

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,030
they're positive or negative,
or they could be both.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,650
So you are right if you think
that a short sale is some type

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,600
of a bet that a stock
can go down.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,920
But how does it work?

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,280
So let's say that, I don't know,
IBM-- and I don't know

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,200
where IBM is trading right now--
but let's say IBM is

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,760
right now-- the last
trade was at $100.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,680
And I'm convinced.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,790
I've done my research, I've done
my analysis, and I'm just

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,190
convinced that the stock price
of IBM is going to fall.

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,620
I think IBM is going to have a
horrible quarter next quarter.

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,670
That some other competitor
is going to take

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,570
their business, whatever.

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,690
I'm convinced it's going
to fall to $50.

26
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,750
This is what I think.

27
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,390
I think it's going to fall
to $50, based on

28
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,070
my deep stock analysis.

29
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,450
And so, the general idea is that
I should-- well I won't

30
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,270
make any value judgment right
now-- but I want to know if

31
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,650
there's a way that I can make
money off of my deep analysis.

32
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,480
And the way I do that is I go
to my brokerage-- so let me

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:33,510
draw some diagrams. So this is
my brokerage, this is my

34
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:39,320
broker, and this is
me right here.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,530
This is me.

36
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,310
I have a top hat.

37
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,990
Anyway, so I go to the broker
and I say broker, I would like

38
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,840
to short IBM.

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,500
I would like-- let's just say
for simplicity I want to short

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,950
one share of IBM.

41
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,400
So what I do is I go to the
broker, and I say broker, can

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,220
I borrow a share of IBM?

43
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,140
And this is a little unintuitive
the first time

44
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,850
people learn about it.

45
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,100
It was a little unintuitive
for me the first time I

46
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,490
learned about the notion
of borrowing a share.

47
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,480
But you can also view it
as renting a share.

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,539
And you might say well,
where's the

49
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,800
broker getting it from?

50
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,790
Well this broker's got
a ton of clients.

51
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,900
Let me draw some of them.

52
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,270
His eyes were strange.

53
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,120
OK, so this broker has
a ton of clients,

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,450
many of whom own IBM.

55
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,590
And they keep their shares
of IBM with the broker.

56
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,500
So the broker always has-- let's
say each of these is a

57
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,750
share of IBM.

58
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,280
And these guys are all
owners of IBM.

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,960
And if ever, one day, this guy
wanted to sell his share of

60
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,930
IBM, the broker would go out
there, sell it in the market,

61
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,800
or maybe this guy
would sell it,

62
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,030
depending on how it's done.

63
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,360
And then this would be replaced
with the money, and

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,010
this would then become
$100, right?

65
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,890
And then if IBM issues a
dividend, if it says OK, all

66
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,580
of our shareholders will get
$5.00 from a company.

67
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,180
And then each of these
guys would get $5.00.

68
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,650
So they're all just shareholders
in the company.

69
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,980
And also, just so you know, as
opposed to being short the

70
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,080
company, they're long.

71
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,070
When you go long a

72
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,970
security, you're buying
the security.

73
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,320
When you go short, as you'll
see, you're borrowing the

74
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,300
security and selling it.

75
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,340
So let's see how that works.

76
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,890
So once again I go to my broker
and I say broker, I

77
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,040
want to borrow a share of IBM.

78
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,160
And the broker says OK, well
I've got all these share

79
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,000
sitting around here.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,010
And they're really not
doing anything.

81
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll lend you this share
right there.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,050
And stick it in my account.

83
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,170
And I'm going to have to pay
rent to borrow that share.

84
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,580
You can kind of view it as
either interest on borrowing

85
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,690
the share, or you can
view it as rent.

86
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,110
Rent is sometimes
more intuitive.

87
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,050
Because whenever we talk about
when you rent someone's

88
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,390
apartment, you're really kind of
borrowing their apartment.

89
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,130
Then you can kind of view
the rent as the

90
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,600
interest on the apartment.

91
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,840
Or the other way to view it,
when you borrow money, the

92
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,250
interest is kind of
rent on the money.

93
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,690
Anyway, I think you
get the idea.

94
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,660
But I'll borrow this.

95
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,730
And you'll say hey wait, Sal,
that doesn't make sense.

96
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,430
How can you just borrow
this guy's stock?

97
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,710
I mean, this guy might want
to sell it the next day.

98
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,980
And that's a good question.

99
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,470
If this guy wants to-- let's say
I borrow his stock, it's

100
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,220
not sitting there anymore.

101
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,370
If this guy wants to sell his
stock the second after I

102
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,760
borrow it, the broker is just
going to take-- he's just

103
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,360
going to shuffle around the
stocks a little bit.

104
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,019
I mean, you know stocks are--
they call it fungible, you can

105
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,770
replace one stock certificate
with the other.

106
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,860
They're no different.

107
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,540
So then he'll say OK,
I'll just give this

108
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,150
stock to this guy.

109
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,310
Whoops.

110
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,710
I just messed up with my pen.

111
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,600
I'll just give this stock to the
guy who wants to sell it,

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,610
and then you would
have essentially

113
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,870
borrowed from this guy.

114
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,940
And you could keep rearranging
the securities so that none of

115
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,740
these guys ever know that
their stock is borrowed.

116
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,550
Although you have to give
permission, especially if

117
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,300
these guys own the
stock outright.

118
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,870
They have to give permission to
let the stock be borrowed,

119
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,910
and they benefit, because they
get some cut, hopefully, they

120
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,960
get some cut of the rent, or the
interest that I'm paying.

121
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,640
So it's beneficial to them.

122
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,940
And the broker can never, well
it should never, really, lend

123
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,300
out all of the shares here.

124
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,290
Just so that it can keep
shuffling around.

125
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,750
And we'll talk about what
happens if you actually try to

126
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,360
do this with a share that
you've never borrowed.

127
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,620
We'll do that in
a future thing.

128
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,960
But the general idea is, you
borrow one of these shares out

129
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,570
here, and then the broker can
kind of keep shuffling around

130
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,780
these shares, if any of these
guys really want to get rid of

131
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,460
their share.

132
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,410
And let's say I've borrowed
this guy's.

133
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,930
Let's say I originally borrowed
this guy's share.

134
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,360
This guy wanted to
sell his share.

135
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,480
So what the broker does is, he
takes this share, gives it to

136
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,430
him, and now I have officially
borrowed this guy's share.

137
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,170
Right?

138
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,770
This is the share I'm borrowing
now because this

139
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,490
one's been sold.

140
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,070
Now, what happens if IBM
issues a dividend?

141
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,190
It says every one of our
shareholders should get $5.00.

142
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,240
Well this guy's expecting
a $5.00 check.

143
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,130
Or he expects $5.00
to be deposited in

144
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,600
his brokerage account.

145
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,760
For that to happen, I
essentially have to write this

146
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,160
guy the $5.00 check.

147
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,770
So I have to make it look, or
at least the broker is going

148
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,700
to force me to make it
look like this guy

149
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,460
still owns the share.

150
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,320
So anything that this guy gets
by being a shareholder of this

151
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,240
stock, I have to provide
for him.

152
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,740
Anyway, so I've borrowed
the stock.

153
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,530
Now what do I do with it?

154
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,805
My whole thesis here is that IBM
is going to $50, so how do

155
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:17,420
I make money off of that?

156
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:17,980
So I said it is

157
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,570
trading right now at $100.

158
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,810
I've borrowed this share.

159
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,610
So I sell it.

160
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:30,590
So let's see, the first thing is
I borrow one share, as I've

161
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,390
done there.

162
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,790
And now I sell it
on the market.

163
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,760
And we said it's selling
for $100.

164
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,160
I sell it for $100.

165
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,010
So I sell it to the market.

166
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,580
Let's say the market is
out here to the left.

167
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,980
So I sell to the market,
and I get $100.

168
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,700
So let's see what's happening
right now.

169
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,420
What's my current state
of affairs?

170
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,900
Let's say assets-- and I'll talk
about margin requirements

171
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,660
later-- liabilities.

172
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,070
What do I have, what do I owe?

173
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,650
So now I have $100.

174
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,820
And what do I owe?

175
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:12,920
I owe one share of IBM.

176
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,850
Let's say my analysis ends
up being correct,

177
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,100
often times it won't.

178
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,210
And we'll talk a little bit more
about why short selling

179
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,310
can be extremely risky.

180
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,030
But let's say my analysis is
correct, and a couple of days

181
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,270
later IBM starts
trading at $50.

182
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,790
What I can do now is unwind my
trade, or cover my short.

183
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,460
And the way I do this, is
I have $100, right?

184
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,120
What I can do is, I can then
just go out there and buy my

185
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,340
shares of IBM back, right?

186
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,180
So I buy one share of IBM.

187
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,060
And how much do I have to pay?

188
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,330
Do I have to pay $100?

189
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,265
Well no, the share of
IBM stock price

190
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:51,190
has dropped to $50.

191
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,850
So actually, let me do that.

192
00:07:52,850 --> 00:08:00,100
I'm not paying $100 out, I'm
going to pay $50 out.

193
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,760
And I'm going to get back
a share of IBM.

194
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,810
I'm going to get back a share of
IBM, and that's what I owe.

195
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,510
So I'll give it back
to my brokerage.

196
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:18,370
So I will go out, spend $50,
get back a share, and then

197
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,420
give that share back to
the brokerage, give it

198
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,560
back to that guy.

199
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,760
These guys never knew that
anything happened.

200
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,070
And in the process,
what happened?

201
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,660
I sold the shares for
$100, and I bought

202
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,030
them back for $50.

203
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,470
So after unwinding this whole
thing-- I used $50 of this

204
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,450
$100 to buy the shares back.

205
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,450
So how much do I have left?

206
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,390
I have $50 left.

207
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,210
And I returned the shares of
IBM, so I owe no one anything.

208
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,920
So I made $50 off
of this trade.

209
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,160
So traditionally in the stock
market, on the long side you

210
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,085
want to buy low, sell
high, right?

211
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,450
When you're short selling,
you're doing the same thing,

212
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,440
but you're doing
it in reverse.

213
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,050
You want to sell high
and buy low.

214
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,260
Anyway, hopefully that gives
you the general idea of the

215
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,790
mechanics of short selling.

216
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,600
In the next video I'll talk a
little bit more about what--

217
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,780
this was a very good scenario,
where what I wanted to happen

218
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,260
did happen.

219
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,690
But in the next video we'll talk
about the risks of short

220
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,935
selling, and maybe a little bit
of a discussion of whether

221
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:28,240
it really is good or bad
for the markets, or for

222
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,380
society as a whole.

223
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,220
See you in the next video.
