1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,200
Like the concept of the mole,
balancing equations is one of

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,700
those ideas that you learn in
first-year chemistry class.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,250
It tends to give a lot of
students a hard time, even

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,430
though it is a fairly
straightforward concept.

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,970
I think what makes it difficult
is that there's a

7
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,350
bit of an art to it.

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,790
So before we talk about
balancing chemical equations,

9
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,920
what is a chemical equation?

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,660
Well here's some examples right
here, and I have some

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,180
more in the rest
of this video.

12
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,750
But it essentially just
describes a chemical reaction.

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,720
You've got some aluminum.

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,600
You have some oxygen gas or a
diatomic oxygen molecule.

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,860
And then you end up with
aluminum oxide.

16
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,850
And you would say, ok, fine,
that's an equation.

17
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,830
It looks nice.

18
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,700
I have my reactants, or
the things that react.

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,240
These are the reactants.

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,510
And then I have the products
of this reaction.

21
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,090
What's left there to do?

22
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,400
Well you have a problem here.

23
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,770
The way I've written it right
now, I have one atom of

24
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,550
aluminum plus two atoms
of oxygen, right?

25
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,700
They're bonded to each other,
but there's two atoms of

26
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,250
oxygen here.

27
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,270
One molecule of diatomic oxygen,
or one molecule of

28
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,540
oxygen, but they have two
oxygen atoms here.

29
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,030
And when you add them together,
I have two atoms of

30
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,020
aluminum and three
atoms of oxygen.

31
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,550
So I have a different number of
aluminums on both sides of

32
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,510
this equation.

33
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,470
On this side, I have
one aluminum.

34
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,810
On this side, I have two
aluminums. And then I have a

35
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,850
different number of oxygens.

36
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,580
On this side, I have
two oxygens.

37
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,360
And on that side, I have
three oxygens.

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,700
So balancing equations is all
about fixing that problem, so

39
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,990
that I have the same number of
aluminum on both sides of the

40
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,245
equation, and the same number
of oxygens on both sides.

41
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:30,200
So let's try to do that.

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,960
I'll do it in orange.

43
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,100
So I said I have one aluminum
here and I have

44
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,600
two aluminums there.

45
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,130
So maybe a simple thing is just
to put a two out here.

46
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,990
So now I have two aluminums on
this side and I have two

47
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,290
aluminums on this side.

48
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,400
The aluminums look happy.

49
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,060
Now let's look at the oxygen.

50
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,880
Here I have two oxygens on the

51
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,080
left-hand side of the equation.

52
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,900
And on the right-hand
side of the equation

53
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,280
I have three oxygens.

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,560
What can I do here?

55
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,960
Well if I could kind of have
half atoms, I could just

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,840
multiply this by
one and a half.

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,910
1.5.

58
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,190
1.5 times 2 is 3.

59
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,600
So now I have three oxygens on
both sides of this equation

60
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,180
and I have two aluminums on both
sides of the equation.

61
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,210
Am I done?

62
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,940
Well, no, you can't have half
an atom, or one and

63
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,130
a half of an atom.

64
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,270
That's not cool.

65
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,480
So what you do is you just
multiply this so that you end

66
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,145
up with whole numbers.

67
00:02:21,145 --> 00:02:23,230
So let's just multiply
both sides of this

68
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,070
whole equation by two.

69
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:37,700
And we have four aluminums plus
three oxygens yields-- we

70
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,210
multiplied everything
by two-- two

71
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,090
molecules of aluminum oxide.

72
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,780
Now, you might have been tempted
at some point in this

73
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,950
exercise to say, oh, well why
don't I just tweak part of the

74
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,860
aluminum oxide?

75
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,940
Why don't I put a 2/3 in
front of this oxygen.

76
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,640
You cannot do that.

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,380
The equation is as it is.

78
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,720
The molecule aluminum oxide
is aluminum oxide.

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,630
You can't change the relative
ratios of the aluminum and the

80
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,310
oxygen within the aluminum
oxide molecule.

81
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,320
You can just change the number
of aluminum oxide molecules as

82
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,460
a whole that you have,
in this case, two.

83
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,000
So what did we do?

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,800
We looked at the aluminum.

85
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,060
We said, OK, we need two
aluminums to have both sides

86
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,660
of that be two.

87
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,550
And then when we looked at
oxygen, we said, well, if I

88
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,310
multiply this by one and a half,
then that becomes three

89
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,340
oxygens here, because one and
a half times two oxygens.

90
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,880
And three oxygens there.

91
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,400
And then all we said is, oh, I
can't have a one half there,

92
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,540
so let me multiply both
sides by two.

93
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,360
And I ended up with four
aluminums plus three oxygen

94
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,980
molecules, or six oxygen atoms,
yields two molecules of

95
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,660
aluminum oxide.

96
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,070
Let's see if we can do
some more of these.

97
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,270
So here I have methane.

98
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,200
And that g in parentheses,
I just wanted to

99
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,930
expose you to that.

100
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,390
That just means it's a gas.

101
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,340
So I have methane gas plus
oxygen gas yields carbon

102
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,090
dioxide gas plus water.

103
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,410
That's an l there,
so liquid water.

104
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,640
So what can we do here?

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,440
So the general thing is, do
the complicated molecules

106
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,140
first, and then at the end you
can worry about the single

107
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,000
atom molecules.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,180
Because those are very
easy to play with.

109
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,139
And the reason why you do that,
whenever you change a

110
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,680
number here-- let's say we're
trying to engineer how many

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,680
carbons we have on both sides of
this equation-- if I set a

112
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,680
number here, I'm also changing
the number of hydrogens.

113
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,140
Then I'll have to play with
the hydrogens there.

114
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,720
And at the end, I'll have
some number of oxygens.

115
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,630
And then I have to tweak this
number right there.

116
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,770
So let's just start
with the carbons.

117
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,050
It seems complicated, but when
you go step by step and you

118
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,100
kind of play with things a
little bit, it should proceed

119
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,550
fairly smoothly.

120
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,070
So here I have two carbons.

121
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,680
   

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,790
And here I have, on
the right-hand

123
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,810
side, only one carbon.

124
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,790
So ideally I'd want two
carbons on both

125
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,780
sides of this equation.

126
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,930
So let me put a two out here.

127
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,700
So there you go, my
carbons are happy.

128
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,460
I now have two carbons
and two carbons.

129
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,850
Now let me move to
the hydrogens.

130
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,010
Remember, I wanted to do the
oxygens last, because I can

131
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,000
just set this to whatever I want
it to be without messing

132
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,070
up any of the other atoms. So on
this side of the equation I

133
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,370
have four hydrogen atoms. How
many hydrogen atoms do I have

134
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,690
on this side of the equation?

135
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,320
So I have four hydrogen
atoms here.

136
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,150
How many do I have
on this side?

137
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,070
Well, I have two hydrogen
atoms right there.

138
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,100
So I want to have four on both
sides, so let me put a two in

139
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,510
front of the water.

140
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,310
So now I have four hydrogen
atoms. Cool.

141
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,850
Finally, oxygen.

142
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,800
On the left-hand side I have two
oxygen atoms. And on the

143
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,780
right-hand side,
what do I have?

144
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,970
I have two times this one
oxygen, right here, so right

145
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,290
now that's two, right?

146
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:44,980
Two waters.

147
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,450
And in each water I have one
oxygen atom, but I have two

148
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,170
water molecules, so I
have two oxygens.

149
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,270
And then in the carbon dioxide
I have two oxygens in each

150
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,845
carbon dioxide.

151
00:05:56,845 --> 00:05:58,950
And I have two carbon
dioxides, right?

152
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,290
When I put that magenta
two out front.

153
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,560
So how many oxygens do I have?

154
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,420
Two times two.

155
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,330
I have four oxygens.

156
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,820
So on the left-hand side
I have two oxygens.

157
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,020
On the right-hand side I have
six oxygens, two in the two

158
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,430
molecules of water and
four in the two

159
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,770
molecules of carbon dioxide.

160
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,460
So how do I make this
two into six?

161
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,410
I want to have six oxygens
on this side.

162
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,690
I want to them to have
six oxygens on the

163
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,855
left-hand side as well.

164
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:30,110
Well, if I put a three out here,
now I have six oxygens.

165
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,810
And our equation has
been balanced.

166
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,210
I have two carbons on this
side, two carbons on that

167
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,780
side, four hydrogens on this
side, four hydrogens on this

168
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,040
side, six oxygens on this side,
and then-- four plus

169
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,810
two-- six oxygens
on that side.

170
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,840
Next equation to balance.

171
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,270
This actually becomes quite
fun once you get

172
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,320
the knack of it.

173
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,510
So I have ethane plus
oxygen gas yielding

174
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,575
carbon dioxide and water.

175
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:03,230
So this is a combustion
process.

176
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,280
Let's look at the
carbons first. I

177
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,810
have two carbons here.

178
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,010
I have one carbon there.

179
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,050
So let me put a two here.

180
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,240
So now I have two carbons.

181
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,090
Fair enough.

182
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,900
Remember, I'm going to worry
about the oxygen last. This

183
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,910
one's actually not
too different

184
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,420
than the last problem.

185
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,130
I have six hydrogens here.

186
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,400
I only have two hydrogens
in the water.

187
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,090
So then we have three
water molecules.

188
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,470
And now I've balanced
out the hydrogens.

189
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,520
I have six hydrogens on both
sides of the equation.

190
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,060
And now let's deal
with the water.

191
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,330
Here on the right-hand side--
I'll do it in this orange

192
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,590
color-- I have two oxygens in
each carbon dioxide molecule.

193
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,780
And I have two molecules,
so I have four oxygens.

194
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,230
And I have one oxygen in
each water molecule.

195
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,240
And I have three molecules, so
I have three oxygens here.

196
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,580
Is that right?

197
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,190
Three oxygens on the
right-hand side.

198
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,060
Yep, three water molecules.

199
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,200
And then I have four oxygens
in the carbon dioxide.

200
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,860
Right.

201
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,790
So I have seven oxygens.

202
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,590
I have seven oxygens on
this side and I only

203
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,130
have two on this side.

204
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,575
So how can I make this
two into seven.

205
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:19,360
Well I could multiply it
by three and a half.

206
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,690
Right?

207
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,620
Remember, I just want to have
seven on both sides.

208
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,290
If I have three and a half
of these diatomic oxygen

209
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,640
molecules-- three and a half
times two is seven-- so now I

210
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,830
have seven oxygens on both
sides of the equation.

211
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,870
Four plus three and
seven here.

212
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,059
Two carbons.

213
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,820
And then six hydrogens.

214
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,429
And I'm almost done, except for
the fact that you can't

215
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,559
have fractions of molecules.

216
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,409
So what you do is just multiply
both sides of this

217
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,760
equation by two or three, or
whatever you need to multiply

218
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,960
it to get rid of
the fractions.

219
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,800
So if I multiply everything
by two, I end up with two

220
00:08:50,800 --> 00:09:00,580
molecules of ethane plus seven
molecules of diatomic oxygen,

221
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:07,520
seven O2's, yielding two
molecules of carbon dioxide--

222
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,200
oh, sorry, I'm multiplying
everything by two, so four

223
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:18,920
molecules of carbon dioxide,
plus six molecules of water.

224
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,600
And just to make sure that all
still works, if you want to,

225
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,630
you can check.

226
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,830
How much carbon do we have?

227
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,980
I have four carbons here.

228
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,180
I have four carbons here.

229
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,520
How much hydrogen do I have?

230
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,420
I have two times six.

231
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,630
I have 12 hydrogens here.

232
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,100
I have 12 hydrogens here.

233
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,640
How much oxygen do I have?

234
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,150
   

235
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,420
Let me do a different color.

236
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,190
I have 14 oxygens here.

237
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,040
And here I have eight oxygens.

238
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,860
And here I have-- six times
one-- six oxygens.

239
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,010
So six plus eight is 14.

240
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,000
So my equation has
been balanced.

241
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,230
So that one, a lot of people
might find that to be a hard

242
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,260
problem, because you have three
and a half, and just

243
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,130
going straight to this might
seem non-intuitive.

244
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,660
But if you just work from the
more complicated molecules and

245
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,980
you go atom by atom, and if you
end up with any fractions

246
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,775
you just multiply both sides by
some number to get rid of

247
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:13,030
the fraction, of and
then you're done.

248
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,590
All right.

249
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,850
Let's do another one.

250
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,950
So this one looks all hairy.

251
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:24,190
I have this iron oxide plus
sulfuric acid yields all this

252
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,260
hairy stuff.

253
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,000
But the key here to realize is
that this group right here,

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,170
this sulfate group,
stays together.

255
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:35,480
Right?

256
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,580
You have this SO4 there and
you have this SO4 there.

257
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,740
So to really simplify things for
our head, you can kind of

258
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,010
treat that like an atom.

259
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,410
So let's make a substitution.

260
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,230
We'll substitute that for x.

261
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,230
So if we rewrite this as--
I'll do it in a vibrant

262
00:10:52,230 --> 00:11:03,390
color-- iron oxide plus H2--
there's only one sulfate

263
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,690
group here-- x.

264
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:15,070
And then that yields
two irons, this

265
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:15,940
molecule with two irons.

266
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,070
And it has three of these
sulfate groups.

267
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,140
   

268
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,390
And then plus water.

269
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,450
   

270
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,870
All I did is replace the
sulfate with an x.

271
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,040
And now we can treat that x like
an atom, and we can just

272
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,830
balance the equation.

273
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,040
Let's see, on the left-hand
side, how

274
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,300
many irons do we have?

275
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,000
We have two irons here.

276
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,820
We have two irons there.

277
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,190
So the irons look balanced,
at first glance.

278
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,630
Let's deal with the oxygens.

279
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,280
So if we have three oxygens
here-- let me do it in a

280
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:59,660
different color-- and we only
have one oxygen here.

281
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,480
Remember, there were some
oxygens in this x group, but

282
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,590
the sulfate group stayed
together, so we can just treat

283
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,700
those separately.

284
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,820
We want to have three oxygens
on the right-hand side, as

285
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,250
well, so let's stick
a three here.

286
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,500
Oops.

287
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,710
   

288
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,040
So let me put that
three there.

289
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,960
So now we have three
oxygens, as well.

290
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,733
And then finally, let's
look at the hydrogens.

291
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:35,950
   

292
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,160
Let's see, how many hydrogens
do we have here.

293
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,270
We have six hydrogens now,
on the right-hand side.

294
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,840
Six hydrogens here.

295
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,725
Three times two.

296
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:46,770
And we want to have six
hydrogens here, so we have to

297
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,910
have three of these molecules.

298
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,200
And then finally, let's look at
the sulfate group, that x.

299
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,790
We have three x's here.

300
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,090
   

301
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,350
And lucky for us, we have
three x's over there.

302
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,420
So our equation has
been balanced.

303
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,760
And if we want to write it back
in terms of the sulfate

304
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,490
terms, we can just un-substitute
the x, and we're

305
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:16,450
left with one molecule of iron
oxide plus three molecules of

306
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,540
sulfuric acid, H2SO4 -- I just
un-substituted the x with SO4

307
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:28,570
-- yields one of these
molecules, SO4 3.

308
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,270
   

309
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:39,540
I just un-substituted the x plus
three molecules of water.

310
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,670
Let's do one more.

311
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,800
And then I think we'll
be all balanced out.

312
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,750
Carbon dioxide plus hydrogen gas
yields methane plus water.

313
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,700
So let's deal with the carbon
first. I have one carbon here,

314
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,540
one carbon there.

315
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,940
The carbons look happy.

316
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,890
Let's look at the oxygen.

317
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,920
I have two oxygens here.

318
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,990
I have one oxygen there.

319
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,350
So I want two oxygens here so
let me stick a two there.

320
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,300
And then let's deal with the
hydrogens last, because this

321
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,650
is the easiest one to play with
because it doesn't affect

322
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,030
any of the other atoms. So if
I have two here and I have

323
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,060
four, plus four here, right?

324
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,865
I have four hydrogens there.

325
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:18,160
And I have four hydrogens
there.

326
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,790
So I need eight hydrogens
on the left-hand side.

327
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,440
So I just put a four there.

328
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,350
We're all done balancing.

329
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,260
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
