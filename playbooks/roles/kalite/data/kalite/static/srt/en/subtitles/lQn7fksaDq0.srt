1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,100
We covered the idea of vector
length many, many videos ago.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,780
And I realize that I forgot to
cover an important topic.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,580
This topic's going to be useful
when we do some types

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,010
of transformation -- actually,
the projections that I'll do

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,300
in the next video.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,850
The notion that I forgot
to do is the

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,650
notion of a unit vector.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,220
   

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:32,176
And all this is, is a vector
that has a length of 1.

11
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:35,830
Has length and we've
defined length.

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,610
It has a length of 1.

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,020
So if something is a unit
vector, let's say that u here

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,040
is a unit vector, and
it's a member of Rn.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,300
   

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,560
Then that means that if we have
u, u looks like this, has

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,920
n components, u2 all
the way to un.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,160
We know what the length
of this is, right?

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,070
We know that the length of u,
sometimes called the norm of

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,200
u, it's just equal to the square
root of the squared

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,950
sums of all of its components.

22
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,570
And if you think about it, this
is just an extension of

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,830
the Pythagorean theorem,
to some degree.

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,560
So it's u1 squared plus
u2 squared all

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,250
the way to un squared.

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,780
And it's the square
root of that.

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,250
If this is a unit vector, if
this is a unit vector, so this

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:40,780
is a unit vector, that implies
that the length of u will be

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,310
equal to 1.

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,430
And that doesn't matter in what
dimension space we are.

31
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,670
This could be R100
this could be R2.

32
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,710
For it to have a unit vector in
any of those spaces, their

33
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,070
length is 1.

34
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,810
The next obvious question
is, how do you

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,710
construct a unit vector?

36
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,300
Let's say that I have
some vector, v.

37
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,030
And let's say it's not
a unit vector.

38
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,050
It's v1 v2 all the way to vn.

39
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,360
And I want to turn it into some
vector u that is a unit

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,020
vector, that just goes in
the same direction.

41
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:24,520
So u will go in the same
direction, as v, but the

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,130
length of u is going
to be equal to 1.

43
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,710
How do I construct this
vector u here?

44
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,450
What I could do is, I could
take the length of v.

45
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,680
I could find out what the length
of v is, and we know

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,270
how to do that.

47
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,000
We just apply this definition
of vector length.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,130
And what happens if I figure out
the length of v, and then

49
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,610
I multiply the vector
v times that?

50
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,720
What if I make my u, what if I
say u is equal to, 1 over the

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,210
length of v times v itself?

52
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,160
What happens here?

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,350
If I take the length
of this thing right

54
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:10,970
here, what do I get?

55
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:18,580
The length of u is equal to
the length of this scalar.

56
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,740
Remember this is just
some number, right?

57
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,070
It's equal to this scalar,
and I'm assuming v

58
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,210
is a non-zero vector.

59
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:33,130
The length of whatever this
scalar number is times v.

60
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,870
And we know that we can take
this scalar out of the

61
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,860
formula, we can show that --
I think I've shown it in a

62
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,730
previous video -- that the
length of c times v is equal

63
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,300
to c times the length of v.

64
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,630
Let me write that down.

65
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,520
And that's essentially what
I'm assuming right here.

66
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,030
That if I take the length of c
times some vector, v, that is

67
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,990
equal to c times the
length of v.

68
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,970
I think we showed this when we
first were introduced to the

69
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,940
idea of length.

70
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,390
So we know that this is going
to be equal to 1 over the

71
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,360
length of vector v -- that's my
c -- times, so this thing

72
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,270
right here is that thing right
there, times this thing, times

73
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,710
the length of vector v.

74
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,000
Well what's this going
to be equal to?

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
1 over something times
that something.

76
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,360
Well this is just going
to be equal to 1.

77
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,790
So that's all a unit
vector is.

78
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,180
If you want to find a unit
vector -- or sometimes it's

79
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:32,150
called a normalized vector
-- that goes in the same

80
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,600
direction as some vector v, you
just figure out the length

81
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,600
of v using the definition
of vector length in Rn.

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,370
And then multiply 1 over that
length times the vector v --

83
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,220
and this is just a scalar
-- and then you

84
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,800
get your vector u.

85
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,860
Let me to do an example, just to
make sure you get the idea.

86
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:55,860
   

87
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,970
Let's say I have some vector
v and it's in R3.

88
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,380
Let's say it's 1, 2, minus 1.

89
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,900
What is the length of v?

90
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:14,000
The length of v is equal to the
square root of 1 squared

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,490
plus 2 squared plus minus 1
squared, and that is equal to

92
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:27,070
the square root of 1 plus 1 plus
4 -- square root of 6.

93
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,540
So that is the length of v.

94
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,800
If I want to construct a
normalized vector u that goes

95
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,130
in the same direction as v, I
can just define my vector u as

96
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,160
being equal to 1 over the length
of v -- 1 over the

97
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,130
square root of 6 -- times v.

98
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,460
So times 1, 2, minus 1.

99
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,020
Which is equal to 1 over square
root of 6, 2 over

100
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,620
square root of 6, and minus 1
over the square root of 6.

101
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,970
And I'll leave it for you to
verify that the length of u is

102
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,570
going to be equal to 1.

103
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,420
I'll just throw out one
other idea here that

104
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,620
you'll often see.

105
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,270
When something is a unit vector,
instead of using this

106
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,280
little arrow on top of the
vector, they'll often write a

107
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,210
unit vector with a little hat
on top of it, like that.

108
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,010
That signifies that we're
dealing with a unit vector.

109
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,990
And for those of you've taken
your vector calculus, or have

110
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,490
done a little bit of
engineering, you're probably

111
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:28,100
familiar with the vectors
i, j, and k.

112
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,450
And the reason why they have
this little hat here is

113
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,060
because these are all
unit vectors in R3.

114
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,480
They're members of R3 and
they're all unit vectors.

115
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,720
These are actually the
basis vectors in R3.

116
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,410
And for those of you who
have been watching my

117
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,940
transformation videos, these are
equivalent to the vectors

118
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,850
e1 -- which I could write
with a hat on it,

119
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,320
really -- e2, and e3.

120
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,570
Which are the standard
basis vectors in R3.

121
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,930
Now that you've been exposed to
it, now I can start to use

122
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,150
the idea of a unit vector
in future videos.

123
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,282
