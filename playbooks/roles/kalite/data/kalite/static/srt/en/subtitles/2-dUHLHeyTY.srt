1
00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:05,472
We're asked to graph the function f(x)=5x-4

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,973
and we'll do it by really just sampling some points from the domain

3
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:12,287
and seeing what value our function takes

4
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:13,839
and then we'll just graph those points

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,972
and then we'll just connect the dots and see what forms,

6
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:17,189
and there's other ways to do this

7
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:20,538
but this is kind of the most simple, or the most basic way.

8
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:22,889
So if you look at this function over here,

9
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:26,121
it's actually defined for any real number that you stick there for x

10
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:28,239
so, when we talk about sampling the domain,

11
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,639
we can actually pick any real number for x

12
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:35,057
I'm actually going to pick real numbers that are fairly small in magnitude

13
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:36,405
so that they're easy to graph,

14
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:40,136
so you don't have to plot, you know, 8 billion on a number line over here.

15
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:44,072
So let's draw ourselves some simple graph paper,

16
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:46,140
let's call that the x-axis

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,372
let's call that the y-axis

18
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:52,639
or actually I should call it the y=f(x)

19
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:56,695
so whatever my x is, I input it into this function definition,

20
00:00:56,706 --> 00:01:00,190
it'll tell me what the function value is there, it'll tell me f(x),

21
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,156
and we're going to say that y is equal to that.

22
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:06,671
Let's draw a little table here to try out some values.

23
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:10,473
So, let's say that this is x values and this is f(x)

24
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:16,512
and I can even say that these are my y values which are going to be equal to f(x).

25
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:20,057
So let's start with, I'm going to try,

26
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:27,906
-2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.

27
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:30,172
So let's try -2 first.

28
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:34,307
If x is equal to -2, what is f(x)?

29
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:37,724
Well f(x) is going to 5 times -2 minus 4,

30
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:41,755
so it's 5 times -2 minus 4

31
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:47,256
which is equal to -10 minus 4, which is -14

32
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:49,589
So let me plot that over here,

33
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:53,474
I'm going to have a slightly more scrunched up scale

34
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:56,664
on the y-axis, and actually, let me give myself some space

35
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:58,206
so I can go further down

36
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:01,871
let me clear this, give myself a little bit of space

37
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,630
'cause I'm feeling I'll be using a lot of

38
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,360
negative values since I just got all the way down to -14

39
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:11,780
so let me go further down here and then let me mark off some increments over here.

40
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,989
So let's say that this is -5,

41
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,956
this is -10,

42
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:21,322
and this is -15,

43
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:25,058
and then this would be +5,

44
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,672
and this would be +10.

45
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:30,390
So, when x is -2,

46
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:39,233
f(x) is equal to -14

47
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:44,005
which is right about there, so that is -14

48
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:47,356
so that right over there is the point (-2, -14)

49
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:49,956
which we got right from that

50
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:53,748
Now let's try another point. Let's try -1.

51
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,922
When x is -1, f(x) is

52
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:59,322
5 times -1 minus 4

53
00:02:59,322 --> 00:03:01,840
5 times -1 is -5,

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,725
minus 4 is -9.

55
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07,622
So when x is -1,

56
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:10,057
f(x) is -9.

57
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,673
So -9 is right about here.

58
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:18,620
So this is -9, so this is the point (-1, -9).

59
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,690
That is on the graph of f(x).

60
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,854
And now let's try zero. When x is 0, f(x) is going to be

61
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:30,407
5 times 0 minus 4

62
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:34,507
Well that's just 0 minus 4 which is equal to -4,

63
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:38,823
So when x is 0, f(x) is equal to -4.

64
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:40,656
That's -4 right over there

65
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:44,687
and actually, our point is going to be sitting right over there, that is 0, -4,

66
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,407
we're to the left of the point.

67
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:49,918
Let's keep going! Let's see what happens when x is equal to 1.

68
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:56,209
When x is equal to 1, f(x) is equal to 5 times 1 minus 4.

69
00:03:56,257 --> 00:04:00,969
5 times 1 is 5, minus 4 is equal to 1.

70
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,661
So we get to the point (1,1), which is right about there

71
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:08,573
so this is point (1,1).

72
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:14,177
and then let's just try one more. Let's see what happens when x is equal to 2.

73
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:19,129
Then f(x) is 5 times 2 minus 4,

74
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:23,687
which is 10 minus 4, which is equal to 6.

75
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:28,544
So, we have when x is equal to 2, f(x) is equal to 6.

76
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:30,924
So that's right about there.

77
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:35,901
That's 6 right there, so this is the point (2, 6).

78
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:39,408
So once again, these are just sample points from the domain,

79
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:42,635
this isn't the entire domain, but it gives us enough points

80
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:46,066
to see the general structure of the graph.

81
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:50,356
If we connect the dots, we see a line forming.

82
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,920
If we connect the dots, it looks something like this,

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,236
and my shaky hand makes it look a little bit curvy, but

84
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:59,440
it should be an absolute straight line.

85
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,100
If I had this on really good graph paper,

86
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:04,504
and if I had a ruler, you'd see that this is a straight line

87
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,479
and it would keep going on and on and on

88
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,440
And I want to make it clear that we just sampled points from the domain,

89
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,923
but we can take any point

90
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:12,357
in the domain, which we already said

91
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:13,758
is all real numbers,

92
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:16,173
so if we took right over here,

93
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:17,408
we said 1.5,

94
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:17,991
you could see,

95
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:19,357
and if you graph 1.5,

96
00:05:19,357 --> 00:05:20,324
f(1.5) should sit

97
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:21,858
on that line right over there.

98
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:23,791
If you graph f(-.5),

99
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,441
so this is -.5,

100
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:27,357
if you graphed f(-.5),

101
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:30,090
it should sit on the line right over there.

102
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,990
But we're done!

103
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,790
We have graphed the function

104
00:05:32,790 --> 99:59:59,999
f(x)=5x-4.
