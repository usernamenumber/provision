1
00:00:00,815 --> 00:00:05,293
What I want to do in this video is to try to get a better understanding of the structure of the Earth,

2
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:08,206
and we're actually going to think about it in two different ways,

3
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:10,812
so let me just draw half of the Earth over here.

4
00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:14,388
That's my best shot at drawing a half of a circle.

5
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:16,680
We're going to think about it in two ways.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,215
On the left side, we're going to think about it as the compositional layers or the chemical layers.

7
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:31,931
So, over here, we're going to think about the chemical structure or the composition of the layer.

8
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,956
And, on the right hand side, we're going to think

9
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:36,394
about the mechanical properties of the layer.

10
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:38,001
And when I say the mechanical properties,

11
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:41,835
I'm really just saying is that layer a solid, rigid layer,

12
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:50,015
is it kind of a liquid layer, or is it something in between, a kind of putty-like, non-rigid, solid layer.

13
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:53,153
So, let's think about it on the chemical or compositional side first,

14
00:00:53,184 --> 00:00:55,785
because to some degree this is simpler.

15
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:58,386
The outermost layer is the crust.

16
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:01,766
That's the layer we're sitting on right here, right now,

17
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:05,855
I'm assuming - assuming you're on the planet.

18
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,265
It is the outermost and it is obviously solid -

19
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:11,942
we'll think about that when we talk about the mechanical side of things.

20
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:14,386
And it's also the thinnest layer.

21
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:19,158
Now, crust is not uniform - there's both oceanic crust and continental crust.

22
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:24,687
Let me draw the crust on this side as well.

23
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:30,976
And there's both oceanic crust and continental crust.

24
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:33,059
So, oceanic crust is thinner crust.

25
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:36,431
So, let's say that this part right here - let's draw some thicker crust -

26
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:40,851
we'll call the thicker part continental crust,

27
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,622
which is thicker and less dense than oceanic crust.

28
00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:48,024
So, what I'm doing in this light green color, this is continental.

29
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:59,370
And then in this more fluorescent green is oceanic crust.

30
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:08,034
And the oceanic crust is pretty thin, in the order of five to ten kilometers thick.

31
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:13,195
Now, when I talk about oceanic crust I'm not talking about the oceans, the liquid part, the water,

32
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:15,774
I'm talking about the rock that kind of holds the water.

33
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:18,105
The rock underneath the ocean.

34
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,205
So, this is five to ten kilometers thick.

35
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:23,269
If you were to go to the bottom of the ocean, sit on the rock,

36
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:28,040
then drill, you would have to drill five to ten kilometers to get through that layer,

37
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:30,903
this compositional layer.

38
00:02:30,922 --> 00:02:32,330
So, this is five to ten kilometers.

39
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:40,363
And the continental crust is about ten to seventy kilometers thick.

40
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:45,259
And obviously they are both rigid, they are both solid rock.

41
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:50,068
Now below, when you think of composition, what the layers are made up of.

42
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:58,231
The next layer below that, this is actually the biggest layer of the earth by volume, is the mantle.

43
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,568
So, let me draw it like that.

44
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:05,735
I always have trouble drawing the right hand side of the circle.

45
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:12,458
So this is the mantle right over here.

46
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:16,092
And once again we differentiate it from the crust

47
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:19,562
because it's composed of different types of rock.

48
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:20,844
Now, we go even deeper.

49
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:22,944
Let me give you the depths here.

50
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:28,774
So, the mantle starts below the crust, right below the continental and oceanic crust,

51
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:33,740
and it goes about 2,900 kilometers deeper.

52
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:36,766
So it is much, much, much thicker than the crust.

53
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:42,516
The crust is on the order of maybe 5 to 70 km thick.

54
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:45,033
This is much, much thicker.

55
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:48,132
So, even though I drew the crust fairly thin,

56
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:51,652
I didn't draw it thin enough relative to how thick I've draw the mantle.

57
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:53,609
This isn't drawn to scale.

58
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:59,155
Now you go even deeper than that, you get kind of the densest part of the Earth,

59
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:02,570
and that is the core.

60
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,355
There's going to be a couple of themes here,

61
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:07,131
especially when we think of the mechanical properties of the earth,

62
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:11,482
is that the deeper you get, you're going to get denser elements

63
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:14,099
and you're going to have more heat and more pressure.

64
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,436
The reason why you're going to have denser elements

65
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:19,128
Is when the Earth was first forming and it was kind of in its molten state,

66
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:22,021
the denser elements sunk to the bottom,

67
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:25,157
and the lighter elements would kind of rise to the top.

68
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:29,919
They would have this bouyancy because they are less dense than everything around it.

69
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,852
Even the gases would bubble up and form our atmosphere.

70
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:38,212
So, that's why in general, the densest things are at the center

71
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:41,482
and the least dense things are on the outside - they're in our atmosphere.

72
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,690
And the core, once again, it's composition is

73
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,418
fundamentally different than the mantle and crust.

74
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:51,268
We believe that it is mainly metals, in particular iron and nickel.

75
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:53,720
So that's the structure of the layers of the Earth

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,524
from a composition point of view, a chemical point of view.

77
00:04:56,524 --> 00:04:58,419
Now, let's kind of think of the same layers,

78
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,164
but we're going to think more in terms of what's liquid,

79
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:03,791
what's rigid and solid, and what's in between.

80
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:09,578
So the outermost rigid layer of the Earth is made up

81
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:12,862
of the crust, both the continental and oceanic crust,

82
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:17,701
and the coolest top layer of the mantle.

83
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:22,737
Let me draw that in pink.

84
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:28,549
So what I'm drawing in pink is the cool, rigid, solid part of the mantle.

85
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:35,184
So it is solid rock, part of the mantle is solid rock,

86
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:39,661
its composition is different from the crust, but they are both rigid.

87
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:47,047
So if you combine this top most layer of the mantle with the crust,

88
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:50,220
then you're talking about the lithosphere.

89
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,400
So this is the lithosphere.

90
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:02,729
And this essentially gets you about, depening on where you are on the surface of the earth,

91
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:08,426
is 10-200 kilometers thick.

92
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:12,225
And most of the time, it's closer to the high end of the range.

93
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:16,104
The 10 is kind of where you have hot spots in the mantle

94
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:20,636
and it's essentially been able to dissolve part of the lithosphere,

95
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:24,944
we'll talk about that more when we talk about plate tectonics.

96
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:29,375
These are actually lithospheric plates, and the lithosphere

97
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,973
is actually moving on top of the lower layers of the mantle.

98
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:37,678
The lithosphere it is rigid, solid, it's made up of

99
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:42,961
the crust and the uppermost layer of the mantle.

100
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:46,946
Now, you go a little bit deeper, the temperatures and pressures increased,

101
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:49,501
but now the temperatures have increased enough

102
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:53,435
- you have the same composition as the uppermost, the rigid part of the mantle,

103
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:57,567
but the temperatures have now gone up enough that it now turns it now into

104
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:00,323
not quite a liquid, we won't call it a liquid,

105
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:04,489
it still transmits a certain type of waves that liquids wouldn't transmit.

106
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:09,233
it's more of like a putty-like texture, it has fluid-like properties,

107
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:14,374
it can float, it's way more viscous than what we'd associate with most fluids,

108
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:18,216
so it's not rigid and solid, it can have convection going on in it,

109
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:19,321
but it's not a liquid

110
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:23,432
- it still will transmit some types of waves that liquids won't.

111
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:26,374
This is called the asthenosphere, this kind of jelly, putty layer.

112
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:32,578
It's like that, because it's so hot that the rock has somewhat melted.

113
00:07:32,616 --> 00:07:40,102
So, this is, this layer right here, is the asthenosphere.

114
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,746
I've seen some spellings that have an 'e' after the a,

115
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:46,071
I think that's the european spelling.

116
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:49,033
The aesthenosphere obviously starts right below the lithosphere.

117
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:53,288
It's what the lithospheric plates, when we are talking about tectonic plates, are riding on top of.

118
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:57,658
It's kind of the gummy layer that allows the rigid layer

119
00:07:57,658 --> 00:08:00,016
to kind of move, actually move on top.

120
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:06,186
So it starts below the lithosphere and it ends at around 660 kilometers deep.

121
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:12,015
So, this right here is 660 kilometers deep.

122
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:14,425
And then you go even deeper than that,

123
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:19,978
and now the pressures are so big that even are even higher,

124
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:26,312
the pressures are so big that the same material can't have fluid motion anymore.

125
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:28,216
It's essentially been jammed together.

126
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,907
So you can imagine if you have things that are somewhat fluid,

127
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:38,388
their molecules can kind of slide past each other, maybe very slowly.

128
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:43,823
But, if you increase the pressure enough, they'll be jammed into each other,

129
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,495
and that's essentially what happens in the next layer of the mantle.

130
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:48,959
All of these layers of the mantle are made up of the same thing,

131
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,647
it's just a difference of pressure.

132
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:56,460
So, the next layer of the mantle is called the mesosphere.

133
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:59,618
Mesosphere.

134
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:05,530
This is called the mesosphere, but there is also a layer of our atmosphere

135
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,989
right above the stratosphere that's called the mesosphere.

136
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:11,724
And so, don't get confused here, these are two different mesosphere-s.

137
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:16,027
And this layer, the pressure is so big, that now we are rigid again.

138
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:19,129
We are kind of definetely solid now.

139
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,429
None of this debate about a little bit of fluid motion

140
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:22,931
because the pressure is so big.

141
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:29,589
Now you go a little bit deeper, you are in the core, the metallic core,

142
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:33,790
the temperatures are so high, that even though the pressures are high

143
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,135
because we have a compositional change,

144
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:39,688
we are at pressures where this type of mesospheric rock is rigid,

145
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:44,632
but metals at this temperature can be fluid,

146
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:46,197
can actually be liquid.

147
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:55,961
We actually have a liquid outer core.

148
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:58,751
The entire core, as far as we know, is made up of

149
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:01,381
the same stuff, just the outer part of the core,

150
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:04,418
the temperatures are high enough to melt the metals,

151
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:07,533
but the pressures aren't so high enough to make them solid.

152
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,698
They're definitely high enough to kind of make more

153
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:11,474
rocky materials solid, but not the metals.

154
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:15,143
And then you go even deeper, now the temperature keeps going up,

155
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:19,024
the pressure is so strong that even the metals are solid.

156
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:23,563
So, this is the solid, the solid, inner core.

157
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:25,595
So, when you think about the mechanical properties,

158
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:29,709
the innermost, and just so you know the total distances we're talking about,

159
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,816
the outer core starts at,

160
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:35,198
actually, I didn't tell you where the mesosphere -

161
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:39,966
the mantle ends at about 2900 kilometers deep,

162
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,816
so that's clearly where the mesosphere ends as well,

163
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:46,146
because the mesosphere is kind of the lower mantle.

164
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,629
This is 2900 kilometers deep.

165
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,610
Then you go even deeper.

166
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,782
Now, you're in the liquid outer core, and that extends

167
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:58,961
from about 2900 kilometers deep to about 5100 kilometers deep.

168
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:03,996
So I really should, I frankly should make the liquid core in my drawing a little wider.

169
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:10,746
So, this depth is about 5100 kilometers deep.

170
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:13,436
And then obviously, you have the center of the Earth,

171
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:18,269
and the entire radius of the earth is about 6400 kilometers.

172
00:11:18,326 --> 00:11:20,937
So, hopefully that clarifies things when you hear

173
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:24,216
people talking about the lithosphere or the mantle,

174
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,811
they're really talking about mechanical versus composition.

175
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,370
And when we talk about mechanical, solid inner core,

176
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,557
liquid outer core, essentially solid mesosphere,

177
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:36,641
and then you have something, kind of a spongy,

178
00:11:36,641 --> 00:11:39,716
somewhat fluid, not-solid, not-liquid aesthenosphere

179
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:42,136
that the lithospheric plates can ride on top of,

180
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,517
and then you have your actual rigid, solid lithosphere

181
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:50,296
made up of the uppermost part of the mantle and the crust.
