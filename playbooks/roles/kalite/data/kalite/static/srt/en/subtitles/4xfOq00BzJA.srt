1
00:00:02,477 --> 00:00:05,985
Alright, so I'm Vi Hart and I'm here with Sal Khan

2
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:06,692
Sal: Hello

3
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:12,133
Vi: Yeah were talking about how we think about numbers

4
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:17,000
And what is the most natural way to think about them in our everyday lives

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Sal: And Vi said that she was going to test me right now

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,867
Vi: I - Yeah, right, can I borrow the pen?

7
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:22,400
Sal: Yes, yes

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,067
Vi: I get to use the official pen!

9
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,933
Sal: No that's off screen

10
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:30,667
You need training Vi

11
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:33,533
Looks like a pizza

12
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,698
Vi: It's a triangle

13
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,200
Sal: Where's your test Vi?

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,667
You're diverging

15
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:40,933
Vi: I'm sorry

16
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,933
Alright, so here's the number line

17
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:44,933
Regular old number line

18
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:51,067
I'm going to start at one and go all the way up to a million

19
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm giving you the pen now

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,067
And I'm going to ask: Where is 1,000?

21
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:57,800
Sal: Where is 1,000? Where is 1,000?

22
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,267
I see

23
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:02,400
I see what you're doing

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,733
Vi: So you can think of it logically

25
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:07,933
Yes, yes, So I'll tell you what went through my brain

26
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:13,533
My first reaction was to put 1,000 like, right over here

27
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,667
That's what I was tempted to do

28
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,067
And then my brain kicked in

29
00:01:18,067 --> 99:59:59,999
My highly analytical mind
