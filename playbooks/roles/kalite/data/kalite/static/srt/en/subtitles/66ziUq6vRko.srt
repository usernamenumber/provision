1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,370
This problem asks us, suppose
you isolate an acid from

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,850
clover leaves and know that it
contains only the elements

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,810
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:17,780
Heating 0.513 grams of the
acid in oxygen produces

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,860
points-- let me write these
down or let me underline

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:27,020
them-- so heating 0.513 grams of
the acid in oxygen produces

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:34,960
0.501 grams of carbon dioxide
and 0.103 grams of water.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,130
What is the empirical formula
for the acid?

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,960
So let's just write
the equation here.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,280
And once again, you can't
balance this equation because

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,860
we don't know how many carbons
or hydrogens or oxygens we

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,700
have in the acid.

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,890
But let's just write it
down in general terms.

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,610
So we have the acid.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,210
It has x carbons, y hydrogens,
and z oxygens, and we're going

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,760
to heat it in the presence of
an abundance of oxygen.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,610
And when we do that the problem
tells us that this

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,710
produces-- let me do it in
another color-- this produces

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,450
some carbon dioxide
and some water.

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,020
   

22
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,260
And they tell us the amounts
of carbon dioxide and water

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,690
measured in grams, and they
tell us the amount of our

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,630
original substance.

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,520
Let me write that here.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,630
So we're heating 0.513 grams
of our original substance.

27
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:41,880
And then that produces 0.501
grams of carbon dioxide, and

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,080
0.103 grams of water.

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,620
Now we're going to do this
problem very similar to the

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,490
way that we've done
the last one.

31
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,590
Remember, we just have figure
out the empirical formula.

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,120
We just have to figure out the
ratio, the simplest whole

33
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,310
number ratios of carbon to
hydrogens to oxygens.

34
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,020
The only thing that makes this
slightly more difficult than

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,360
the last one is we have oxygens
here, and the oxygens

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,220
are kind of mixed in with
the two products.

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,260
So we can't just look at the
moles of our two products and

38
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,685
say oh, we must have this
many moles of oxygen.

39
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,730
What we're going to do here is
we're going to figure out the

40
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:22,780
moles of carbon dioxide using
this information there.

41
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,120
And that'll tell us the moles of
carbon that must have come

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,970
out of our mystery acid, because
this was the only

43
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,230
source of carbon
that might have

44
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,990
generated the carbon dioxide.

45
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,370
Then we're going to use the
water to figure out the moles

46
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,200
of hydrogen in the product,
which has to be the same as

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,720
the moles of hydrogen in
our mystery substance.

48
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,000
And then we can figure out the
mass of carbon and hydrogen

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,610
out of this 0.513 grams, we'll
be able to figure out because

50
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,000
we'll know how many moles of
carbon and how many moles of

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,450
hydrogen we started off with.

52
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,420
We'll be able to know their
mass, and then we'll be able

53
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,880
figure out how many grams of
oxygen we must have had in our

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,790
original substance.

55
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,880
And then we can figure out
the moles from there.

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,430
And then figure out
the ratios.

57
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,100
If that confused you, hopefully
just solving through

58
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,190
it will make a lot more sense.

59
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,810
So first let's just figure out
the moles of carbon in our

60
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,150
product, and the only product
here that had carbon was the

61
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,200
carbon dioxide.

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,380
And that'll tell us how many
moles of carbon we had in our

63
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,940
original mystery
acid over here.

64
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:26,310
So we are end up with 0.501
grams of carbon dioxide-- that

65
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,430
tells us right there.

66
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,500
And we want to convert this into
moles of carbon dioxide.

67
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,550
So we want to multiply this
times moles of carbon dioxide

68
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,940
per grams of carbon dioxide.

69
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,750
And if you care about
dimensional analysis you know

70
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,160
that because these grams of
carbon dioxide will cancel

71
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,580
with these grams of
carbon dioxide.

72
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,000
So how many grams is one
mole of carbon dioxide?

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And we've done this
multiple times.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,760
The molar mass of carbon
dioxide-- you have 1 carbon

75
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,430
plus 2 oxygens, so 16 times 2.

76
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,230
That is 12 plus 32 or 44.

77
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,310
So one mole of carbon dioxide
has 44 grams of carbon

78
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,610
dioxide, or 44 grams has 1 mole.
but we wrote it moles

79
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,269
per gram because we want to
cancel out with the grams

80
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,579
right there.

81
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:25,300
So let's cancel that out, and
you're going to get 0.501

82
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,760
divided by 44 moles
of carbon dioxide.

83
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,540
Let's get the calculator out.

84
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:39,970
So we've got 0.501 divided by
44 is equal to 0.-- we have

85
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,265
three significant digits here,
and this is just a pure number

86
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:46,190
or pretty close to a pure
number-- so 0.11-- I'll round

87
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,370
it up to 4-- let me put it on
the side so I don't forget

88
00:04:51,370 --> 00:05:04,160
this-- so this tells us that we
have 0.0114 moles of carbon

89
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,340
dioxide in our product.

90
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,280
Now that also tells us for
every molecule of carbon

91
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,560
dioxide we also have
one atom of carbon.

92
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,730
So however many carbon dioxide
molecules we have, we have

93
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,390
that same number of carbon.

94
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,970
Remember, a mole is
just a number.

95
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,570
When I say 0.0114 moles I'm
just telling you a number.

96
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,850
So this tells me right there--
I'll stay in blue-- this tells

97
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:37,660
me that we also have 0.0114
moles of carbon.

98
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,270
That's what that tells me,
because for every carbon

99
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,600
dioxide I have a carbon.

100
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,460
And the carbons in the product
all had to come from my

101
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,950
mystery substance.

102
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,460
So how many grams of this
mystery substance must have

103
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,410
been carbon?

104
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,830
Well I had this many
moles of carbon in

105
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,100
our original reactant.

106
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,800
They all end up over here.

107
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,200
Let's figure out their grams. So
let's multiply-- so times--

108
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,660
now here we want to do grams per
mole, because we want to

109
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,160
end up in grams. We want to
cancel out the moles.

110
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,630
We want grams of carbon
per mole of carbon.

111
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,880
   

112
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,630
And the molar mass of
carbon is 12-- it's

113
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,330
a good one to memorize.

114
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,170
So we have 12 grams of carbon
per mole of carbon-- we've got

115
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,880
12 over 1 if you like.

116
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,300
So what does this equal?

117
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,280
How many grams of carbon are
we dealing with in this

118
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,150
mystery substance right there?

119
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,450
Get the calculator back.

120
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,160
So if we multiply-- it's
actually this exact same

121
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:45,720
number, let's just multiply it
by 12-- so times 12 is 0.137.

122
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,070
So let me write that down.

123
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:59,560
So we have 0.137 grams
of carbon in

124
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,500
our original reactant.

125
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,010
So of this 0.513 grams
of this mystery acid,

126
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,570
0.137 grams are carbon.

127
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,010
So that's what we got so far,
so we have two good

128
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,530
take-aways.

129
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,590
How many moles of carbon we had
over here, and how many

130
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,180
grams of carbon that
translates to.

131
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,880
Now let's do the same thing
for the hydrogen.

132
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,140
Same drill.

133
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,680
Let's do the hydrogen--
we're using that

134
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,260
information right there.

135
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:36,020
So we're starting off with 0.103
grams of water, and we

136
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,060
want to turn this into
moles of water.

137
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:44,270
So let's multiply it times
moles of water

138
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,180
per grams of water.

139
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,470
Once again, to cancel out the
grams of water, numerator and

140
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,790
denominator.

141
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,660
And what is the molar
mass of water?

142
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,340
You have two hydrogens, so it's
2 times 1 plus the molar

143
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,890
mass of oxygen, which is
16, so it equals 18.

144
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:10,040
So 1 mole of water has 18 grams,
or 18 grams per mole.

145
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,170
But we wrote 18 in the
denominator, because we want

146
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,070
the grams into the
denominator.

147
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:19,800
So these cancel out and
we have 0.103 divided

148
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,090
by 18 moles of water.

149
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,170
Let me get the calculator
back.

150
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:31,640
So we have 0.103 divided
by 18 moles of water.

151
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,460
Let me put this on the side
so I can still see

152
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,659
it, very bad memory.

153
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:44,900
So this tells us that
we have 0.00572

154
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,600
moles of H2O, of water.

155
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,340
We just converted these grams
into the number of molecules

156
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,700
that we actually have.

157
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,890
Now if we have this many moles
of H2O, how many moles of

158
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,360
hydrogen do we have?

159
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,850
For every molecule of
water we have two

160
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,400
molecules of hydrogen.

161
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,000
So you multiply that times 2--
so let me do that right here--

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:23,380
so 0.00572 moles of H2O times,
we have 2 moles of hydrogen

163
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:29,320
for every one mole, I
should say, of H2O.

164
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,740
So we're just going to multiply
this by 2 to get

165
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,795
moles of hydrogen.

166
00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:36,420
So let me get back the--
let's multiply it by 2.

167
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:43,600
So times 2 is equal to 0.114.

168
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,880
So this is equal to-- let
me get that back.

169
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,270
I always forget how many
zeros there are, so

170
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,740
I remember it now.

171
00:09:51,740 --> 00:10:02,470
OK, so it is equal to 0.0114
moles of hydrogen.

172
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,965
So so far we figured out the
number of moles of carbon in

173
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:09,120
our product and its mass that
must have been in the original

174
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,570
reactant, the mystery
reactant.

175
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,550
And we've done the moles
for the hydrogen.

176
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,550
We have this many moles
of hydrogen.

177
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,870
So we must have started
off with that

178
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,110
many moles over here.

179
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,470
Let's figure out the
mass of that.

180
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,230
So what is the molar-- we want
to figure out this in grams--

181
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,590
so times-- the molar mass
of hydrogen, it

182
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,650
is 1 gram per mole.

183
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,520
So hydrogen's easy--
times 1 gram of

184
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,000
hydrogen per mole of hydrogen.

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,350
I wanted the moles in the
denominator so it cancels out.

186
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,110
Moles cancel with moles.

187
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,710
So we also have-- I'll do it in
that same orange color-- we

188
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:51,160
also have 0.0114 grams
of hydrogen.

189
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,240
So that's another important
take-away.

190
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,950
Now we have moles of carbon,
moles of hydrogen.

191
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,900
If we can figure out moles of
oxygen in our original acid

192
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,720
then we can figure out the
smallest whole number ratio

193
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,580
between them, then we would
be able to find

194
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,300
our empirical formula.

195
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,580
And to figure out moles of
oxygen we need to first figure

196
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,850
out how many grams of
oxygen we have here.

197
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,740
And to do that we have a total
of 0.513 grams of this thing.

198
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,840
We subtract out how much of it
is carbon, how much of it is

199
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,510
hydrogen, and that'll tell
us how much is oxygen.

200
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,690
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

201
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,350
So if we want to figure out
how much is oxygen, we

202
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:40,440
literally just take 0.5-- let me
write 0.513 grams-- let me

203
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,490
just write this-- minus
the grams of carbon.

204
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,900
So minus 0.137-- let me do in
that same color so you know

205
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,450
where I'm getting these numbers
from-- minus our grams

206
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:59,580
of carbon, 0.137 grams of carbon
minus-- I'll do it in

207
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,130
the same orange color--
minus the-- where's

208
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,690
our grams of hydrogen?

209
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:12,280
Minus 0.011-- let me, just so
you get the whole idea.

210
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,640
We started off with 513 grams
of acid, whatever it is,

211
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:28,240
minus-- let me write it this way
even better-- CxHyOz minus

212
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:38,600
our 0.137 grams of carbon,
minus our 0.0114 grams of

213
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,750
hydrogen, will give us our grams
of oxygen that we're

214
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,850
dealing with.

215
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,980
So let's figure that out.

216
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,990
Because everything in that
substance, everything in this

217
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,810
mystery acid right here has
to be either carbon,

218
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,980
hydrogen, or oxygen.

219
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,820
We know how much is carbon
and hydrogen, the

220
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,020
leftover has to be oxygen.

221
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:07,220
So we have 0.513 minus 0.137
minus 0.0114 is equal to

222
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,840
0.36-- I'll just round
it-- 0.365.

223
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:21,570
So this is equal to 0.365
grams of oxygen.

224
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,780
Let me make sure that
I got that right.

225
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,320
Yeah, 0.365 grams of oxygen.

226
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,910
So let's figure out how
many moles this is.

227
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:37,990
So we're starting off, or this
mystery acid has 0.365 grams

228
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,960
of oxygen, and we want to
convert that to moles.

229
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,480
So times-- we want moles of
oxygen in the numerator, grams

230
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,800
of oxygen in the denominator,
so they cancel.

231
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,040
And we know the molar mass
for oxygen is 16.

232
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,390
16 grams per mole-- right, the
16 has to match up with the

233
00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:00,420
grams. So this tells us that
we have 0.365 divided by 16

234
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,310
grams of oxygen.

235
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,780
So that's the number
right there.

236
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,670
I'll just divide it by 16.

237
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:12,640
So 0.22, I'll say 8
just to round it.

238
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,260
Or 0.0228-- let me put it aside,
I want to make sure I

239
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,960
don't lose any zeros here.

240
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:26,440
So this tells us that we have
0.0228-- these guys cancel

241
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,430
out-- moles of oxygen.

242
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,790
We're almost done.

243
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:37,400
We now know, we've now been
able to solve the moles of

244
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,150
carbon in our original reactant
because all of this

245
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,840
carbon had to come from here.

246
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,195
We have our moles of hydrogen.

247
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:49,280
   

248
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,260
We were able to figure out from
this information because

249
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,040
all the hydrogen had
to come from here.

250
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,050
And now we know the
moles of oxygen in

251
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,700
our original reactant.

252
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,760
Our moles, because the leftover
out of this 0.513

253
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,580
grams had to be oxygen, so we
were able to figure out the

254
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,920
moles of oxygen.

255
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,100
So let's see if we can figure
out the smallest whole number

256
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,230
ratio between the three.

257
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,200
So the ratio-- and I'll write
the ratio like this-- we

258
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,870
have-- let me do it in the same
colors-- we have 0.114

259
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,690
moles of carbon, to--
and then we have

260
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,380
0.0114 moles of hydrogen.

261
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,750
These look nice, they're
actually the same numbers.

262
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:38,280
So we're going to have a 1:1
ratio, to-- then we have the

263
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:45,840
oxygen, 0.0228 moles
of oxygen.

264
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,180
And this looks like exactly
twice times that.

265
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,160
So if we divide everything, if
we divide-- this is a ratio,

266
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,190
this is another way of writing
the ratio-- if we divide

267
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:02,260
everything by 0.114-- let
me be careful here.

268
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,710
This up here was 0.0114
moles of carbon.

269
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,310
So this was a 0 over here.

270
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,170
Let me clear it out.

271
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,942
I want to be nice
and neat here.

272
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:17,260
So let me clear this.

273
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,530
I'm always afraid that I'm going
to lose a zero here.

274
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:24,590
Our moles of carbon
was 0.0114.

275
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,530
So let's divide everything by
this amount because that is

276
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,000
kind of the smallest number of
moles, and that's exactly that

277
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,910
number there.

278
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,190
Do that in white.

279
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:43,640
So you divide by 0.0114,
0.0114, 0.0114,

280
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,140
and what do you get?

281
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,030
What does this turn into?

282
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,810
This turns into-- this is just
a 1-- so this is 1 mole of

283
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,350
carbon for every-- this is
just a 1 right here-- for

284
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,110
every-- I'll do it in the orange
color-- for every 1

285
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,849
mole of hydrogen-- for every--
this is exactly 2, right?

286
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,410
228 divided by 140, that's 2.

287
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:13,480
This is exactly 2-- for every
2 moles of oxygen.

288
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,400
So that tells us our empirical
formula for our mystery acid.

289
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,920
It must be-- we don't know the
molecular formula, but we know

290
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,619
the simplest ratios, whole
number ratios-- it must be 1

291
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:29,110
carbon for every 1 hydrogen, and
for every 1 carbon and 1

292
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,800
hydrogen we must
have 2 oxygens.

293
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,540
So it's CHO2.

294
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,660
That is the empirical formula
for our mystery acid.

295
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,830
Hopefully you found that fun.
