1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,120
Like we've done in the last
several videos, let's assume

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,170
that we have some set
of basis vectors B.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,640
And let's say our basis
is going to be v1 v2

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,810
all the way to vk.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,340
So this will span a subspace
of dimension k.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,840
And let's assume that each of
these guys are members of Rn.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,400
So v1 v2 all the way to vk.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,530
They're all members of Rn.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,930
Now in the last video, we saw
that we can define a change of

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,530
basis matrix.

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,140
And it's a fancy word, but all
it means is a matrix that has

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,720
these basis vectors
as its columns.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,970
So v1, v2 all the way to
vk as its columns.

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,530
So we're going to have k columns
and we're going to

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,530
have n rows.

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,610
Because each of these guys are
members of Rn, so they're

18
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,880
going to have n entries.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,840
So we're going to have n rows.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,220
So it's going to be
an n by k matrix.

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:08,430
And we saw in the last video
that if I have some vector a

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,030
that is a member of Rn-- and
assuming that a is in the span

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,320
of B-- I can represent a.

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,480
I could say that a is equal to
the change of basis matrix

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,500
times the coordinates of a with
respect to our basis.

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,550
This is what we saw
in the last video.

27
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,030
If I have the coordinates of
a with respect to B, I can

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,960
multiply it by the change of
basis matrix and I'll get my

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,740
vector a in standard
coordinates.

30
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,060
Or if I have my vector a in
standard coordinates, then I

31
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,600
can solve for my vector a in
coordinates with respect to B.

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200
We saw that in the last video.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,490
Now let's take a special case.

34
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,590
Let's assume that
C is invertible.

35
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,080
   

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,530
What does that mean?

37
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,880
Or what does that
tell us about C?

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,430
Well if C is invertible,
it's two things.

39
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,540
It means that C is a square
matrix or has the same number

40
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,450
rows and columns.

41
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,290
And that its rows or columns--
You can pick either of them--

42
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,760
have to be linearly
independent.

43
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,200
So linearly independent, let's
just pick columns.

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,990
Now the second statement
is a bit redundant.

45
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,950
We know that C has linearly
independent columns, because

46
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,410
its columns are bases
for a subspace.

47
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,750
So a basis, by definition, all
of the vectors have to be

48
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,790
linearly independent.

49
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,130
So we know this is
a bit redundant.

50
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,280
But what's interesting is if we
know that C is invertible,

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,200
C has to be square.

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,760
And if all of these vectors are
members of Rn, then k has

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,970
to be equal to n.

54
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:55,600
So C is square means that k is
equal to n or that we have n

55
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,850
basis vectors.

56
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,730
   

57
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,520
Now if that's the case,
what is the span of B?

58
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,430
Think about it.

59
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:20,470
We have n linearly independent
vectors in Rn.

60
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,920
So any time you have n linearly
independent vectors

61
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,590
in Rn, those guys are
a basis for Rn.

62
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,460
Because any basis that has n
entries-- and they're all

63
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,110
linearly independent-- is going
to be a basis for Rn.

64
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:42,640
So then B is a basis for Rn.

65
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,870
So if we know that C is
invertible, we also know that

66
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,570
you can get to any vector in Rn
by some linear combination

67
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,820
of your basis vectors
right there.

68
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,110
In the last video, we had to
make sure that this guy was in

69
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,240
the span of these vectors.

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,720
But now we don't have to make
sure, because if C is

71
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:17,680
invertible, then the span of B
is going to be equal to Rn.

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,899
Or another way you could say
it is if the span of B is

73
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,110
equal to Rn.

74
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,550
If we have n vectors here, if k
was equal to n, then we know

75
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,040
that the span of B would
be equal to Rn.

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,240
And so we'd have n vectors here,
n linearly independent

77
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,295
columns here, and it would be
an n by n matrix with all of

78
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:35,750
the columns linearly
independent.

79
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,330
So then C would be invertible.

80
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,590
So we could write
if and only if.

81
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,280
And we could write
it the other way.

82
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:53,530
If the span of B is Rn,
then C is invertible.

83
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,350
And that's useful, because if
either of these things are

84
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,040
true, then we can rewrite
the same equation.

85
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,570
So let's say if we know this and
we're looking for that, we

86
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,420
can just multiply
C times that.

87
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,520
Let's say we know this and
we're looking for that.

88
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,065
Before we had to do that
augmented matrix and solve for

89
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:10,585
it, whatnot.

90
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:15,650
But if we know C is invertible,
then one, we know

91
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,020
that any vector here can
be represented in

92
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,300
the span of our basis.

93
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,240
So any vector here can be
represented as linear

94
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,830
combinations of these guys.

95
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,090
So you know that any vector can
be represented in these

96
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,680
coordinates or with
coordinates with

97
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,790
respect to our basis.

98
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,140
We can multiply both sides of
this equation times C inverse.

99
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,930
And what do you get
if you multiply?

100
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,520
So it becomes C inverse C times
our coordinates of a

101
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,030
with respect to B is equal
to C inverse times a.

102
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:50,400
This is just the identity
matrix right there.

103
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,220
Another way of writing this is
that the coordinates of a,

104
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,100
with respect to our basis B,
which spans all of Rn, is

105
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,270
equal to C inverse times
our vector a.

106
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,230
Let's apply this a little bit.

107
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,700
Let's apply this.

108
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,050
Let's use this information, what
we've done in this video.

109
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,780
Let's do some concrete
examples.

110
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,420
So let's say I have
some basis.

111
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,480
   

112
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,580
Let me define two vectors.

113
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,290
I'll do it this way.

114
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:28,310
So let's say I have v1 is equal
to the vector 1, 3.

115
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:35,130
And let's say v2 is equal
to the vector 2, 1.

116
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:43,110
And I have a basis that is equal
to the set of v1 and v2.

117
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,750
Now I'll leave it for you to
verify that these guys are

118
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,690
linearly independent.

119
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,860
But if I have two linearly
independent vectors in R2,

120
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:59,960
then B is a basis for R2.

121
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,550
And if we write the change of
basis matrix, if we say C is

122
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,740
equal to 1, 3, 2, 1, we know
that C is invertible.

123
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,700
And actually to show that C
is invertible, we can just

124
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,590
calculate its inverse.

125
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,720
So what's the determinant
of C?

126
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,760
The determinant of C is equal to
1 times 1 minus 2 times 3.

127
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,340
So it's equal minus 5.

128
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,880
That's the determinant of C.

129
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,900
And so C inverse-- We figured
out a general formula for

130
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,190
doing this for 2 by 2 matrices--
is equal to 1 over

131
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:42,230
the determinant of C, so 1
over minus 5 times-- You

132
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,510
switch these two guys, so you
switch the 1's, and you make

133
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,380
these two guys negative.

134
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,760
So minus 2, and then minus 3.

135
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,890
And the very fact that this guy,
the determinant of C, was

136
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,920
non-zero told us that
this was invertible.

137
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,460
But anyway, this is C inverse.

138
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,980
So let's say that I have
some vector a that

139
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,910
is a member of R2.

140
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,480
   

141
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,990
I'm just going to pick
some random numbers.

142
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,600
Let's say that a is
equal to 7, 2.

143
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,590
And I want to find out what the
coordinates of a are with

144
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,900
respect to my basis B.

145
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,690
   

146
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,980
Well we go to this situation.

147
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,340
We know what a is, so we just
multiply a times C inverse to

148
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,179
get this guy right here, to get
the coordinates of a with

149
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,159
respect to B.

150
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,340
So let me write that down.

151
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,280
So what is C?

152
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,419
So C is that.

153
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,429
C inverse is that.

154
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:46,370
So we could write the
coordinates of a with respect

155
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,410
to B is equal to C inverse
times the standard

156
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,990
coordinates of a.

157
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,480
Or this is the same thing.

158
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,680
Let me put the actual
numbers here.

159
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,780
The coordinates of a with
respect to B are going to be

160
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:05,900
equal to C inverse, which is
minus 1/5 times 1 minus 3

161
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:15,030
minus 2, 1, times
a, times 7, 2.

162
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,950
And what is this equal to?

163
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,320
This is equal to minus 1/5.

164
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,140
And then we're going to get 1
times 7 plus minus 2 times 2.

165
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,180
So it's minus 4.

166
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,270
So 7 minus 4 is 3.

167
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,470
And then we're going to get
minus 3 times 7, which is

168
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,660
minus 21, plus 1 times 2.

169
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,790
So minus 21 plus 2
is minus is 19.

170
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:46,020
So the coordinates of a with
respect to the basis B are

171
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,850
going to be equal to-- Let me
just multiply the negative

172
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,610
1/5-- you get minus 3/5.

173
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,230
And then you get plus 19/5.

174
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,050
So 19 over 5.

175
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,830
Just like that.

176
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,480
And let's verify that.

177
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,490
This means that a is equal to
minus 3/5 times our first

178
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,580
basis vector plus 19/5 times
our second basis vector.

179
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,730
Let's verify that
that's the case.

180
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:25,330
So let's see, minus 3/5 times
1, 3, plus 19/5 times 2, 1.

181
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,290
Let's see what this is
going to be equal to.

182
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,160
   

183
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,100
Let me write the two vectors.

184
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,940
This is minus 3/5 times
3 is minus 9/5.

185
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,670
   

186
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,210
And there we're going to
add it to this guy.

187
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:51,690
So this guy is 2 times
19 is 38/5.

188
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,340
Right?

189
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,390
And then 19/5 times 1 is 19/5.

190
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,850
And then if you add
these two vectors

191
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,410
together, what do we get?

192
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,960
We get minus 3/5 plus 38/5.

193
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,810
That's 35/3.

194
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:13,480
35/5 is 7, minus
9/5 plus 19/5.

195
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,320
That's 10/5 or 2.

196
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,570
And there you have it.

197
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,400
That was our original a.

198
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,650
So we see that a can definitely
be represented as

199
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,510
minus 3/5 times our first basis
vector plus 19/5 times

200
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,090
our second basis vector.

201
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,800
Now that was a case where we
had some vector a and we

202
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,870
wanted to represent it in
coordinates with respect to B.

203
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,800
What if we had the other way?

204
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,180
What if we said that some vector
w's coordinates with

205
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:50,170
respect to B are-- I'll do
something simple-- are 1, 1.

206
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,180
Then what is w in standard
coordinates?

207
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,120
Well there we can
just multiply.

208
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,980
Remember w is just equal to
the change of basis matrix

209
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,640
times w's coordinates with
respect to the basis B.

210
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,640
So w is going to be equal to
the change of basis matrix,

211
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:19,500
which is just 1, 3, 2, 1, times
the coordinates of w

212
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,930
with respect to B times 1, 1.

213
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,450
Which is equal to 1 times
1 plus 2 times 1 is 3.

214
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,270
And then 3 times 1
plus 1 plus 1.

215
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,390
So 3 times 1 is 3,
plus 1 is 4.

216
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,380
So w is just equal to
the vector 3, 4.

217
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,240
So there you see if our change
of basis matrix is invertible,

218
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,460
which is really just another way
of saying that are basis

219
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,430
spans Rn-- in this example it
was R2-- then you can easily

220
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,360
go back and forth between
coordinate representations in

221
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:59,560
our standard coordinates and
coordinate representations

222
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,300
with respect to our basis.

223
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,620
Right?

224
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,960
This is with respect
to the basis.

225
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,210
This is in standard
coordinates.

226
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,970
   

227
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,600
And you can do that just simply
by either using this

228
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,600
information or just saying,
oh, the coordinates with

229
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,890
respect to the basis equal to
C inverse times a, or the

230
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,880
inverse of our change of
basis matrix times a.

231
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,540
Or saying our coordinates with
respect to the standard basis

232
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,120
is just equal to the change
of basis matrix times the

233
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,740
coordinates with respect
to the basis.

234
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,133
