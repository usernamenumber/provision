1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,870
In the last video on the lungs
or the gas exchange in our

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,540
bodies or on the pulmonary
system, we left off with the

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,290
alveolar sacs.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,690
Let me draw one right here.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,400
So we have these alveolar sacs
that I talked about and

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,090
they're in these little
clumps like this.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,460
Let me draw a couple of them
just so you get the idea.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,630
And if you remember from the
last video, these are kind of

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,380
where air goes in through our
trachea, then that splits up

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,680
into our bronchi, and then
those split into the

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,730
bronchioles, and
the bronchioles

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,810
terminate at these alveoli.

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,790
So that's the alveoli.

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,950
These are these super-small sacs
that we talked about in

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,680
the last video on the
pulmonary system.

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,420
You might want to watch
that video if none

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,420
of this sounds familiar.

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,180
And then of course we have our
bronchiole that feeds into

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,920
this, and then that might have
branched off from another one

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,160
that feeds into another set of
alveolar sacs, but I don't

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,270
want to get too focused
on that.

22
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,520
I covered that in
the last video.

23
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,460
In the last video, we saw that
air, when we breathe in, when

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,970
our diaphragm contracts and
makes our lungs expand and

25
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,380
fill up that space,
air comes in.

26
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,020
Air comes in and that air that
comes in is going to be-- as

27
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,780
we're breathing atmospheric
air-- it's going to be 21%

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:38,450
oxygen and it's going
to be 78% nitrogen.

29
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,120
And actually, in our atmosphere,
carbon dioxide is

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,290
actually almost a trace gas.

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,540
It's less than 1%.

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,370
So any time you breathe in on
Earth, this is what you're

33
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,770
going to get.

34
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,880
And we said in the last video
that you have these

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,320
capillaries, these pulmonary
capillaries that are running

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,420
all along the side
of these alveoli.

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,160
So let me draw those pulmonary
capillaries-- and so when they

38
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,390
are de-oxygenated-- so they come
here to be oxygenated.

39
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,700
So when they're de-oxygenated,
they might

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,950
look a little purplish.

41
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,050
And then they pick up the
oxygen from inside the

42
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,770
alveoli-- or the oxygen diffuses
across the membrane

43
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,890
of the alveoli, into these
capillaries, into these super

44
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,010
small tubes.

45
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,850
And then once they do, that
makes the blood red.

46
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,470
I'm going to talk in a little
bit about why it becomes red.

47
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,720
So then it becomes red, and now
that the blood is red, it

48
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,950
has its oxygen.

49
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,600
The whole point is to
get the oxygen.

50
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,420
It's ready to go back
to the heart.

51
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,260
So that's just one little
part of it.

52
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,140
And we learned in the last video
that something that goes

53
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,230
away from the heart-- so this is
going away from the heart--

54
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,450
that is an artery. "A" for "way". Artery.

55
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,890
And something that's going
towards the heart is a vein.

56
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,920
So this right here is a vein.

57
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,910
Now one question-- and
this actually came

58
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,920
up in the last video.

59
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,530
Someone asked-- which I think is
a very good question-- is,

60
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,360
gee, when we breathe in, most
of the air is nitrogen.

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,990
Only 21% is oxygen.

62
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,610
What happens to all that
nitrogen there?

63
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,150
How come that doesn't
go into our blood?

64
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,160
And that's actually an
excellent question.

65
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,960
So to answer that, I think that
actually helps explain

66
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,430
what's going on here.

67
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,680
Let's draw a little
bit bigger.

68
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,320
This is the inside of
of an alveolus.

69
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,560
This is its membrane right here,
super thin, almost one

70
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,960
cell thick.

71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,800
And then you have a capillary
running right next to it.

72
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,180
Let me do that in
a neutral color.

73
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,380
So you have a capillary
that's maybe running

74
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,630
right along the surface.

75
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,430
And this is porous to gases
like oxygen, and nitrogen,

76
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,550
carbon dioxide.

77
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,040
And what we have here-- let's
say that this is-- so the

78
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,340
heart is over here.

79
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,020
So this is blood coming from
the heart and then this is

80
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,430
going to go back to the heart.

81
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,530
Well, the heart's
on both sides.

82
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,890
So let me write it this way.

83
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:40,530
From the heart and
to the heart.

84
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,550
And what you have here is--
when we're coming from the

85
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,970
heart, this is de-oxygenated
blood and it's actually going

86
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,396
to have a high concentration
of carbon dioxide.

87
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,500
I already did nitrogen
as green.

88
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,800
Let me do carbon dioxide
as orange.

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,740
There's a lot of carbon dioxide
and actually carbon

90
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,000
dioxide actually gets diffused
in the blood.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,280
It actually is carried in
the plasma of the blood.

92
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,590
It's not carried by red blood
cells that we're going to talk

93
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,810
about in a second.

94
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,270
So that's a bunch of carbon
dioxide here.

95
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,880
And the concentration of
carbon dioxide in the

96
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,580
de-oxygenated blood is going
to be higher than the

97
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,450
concentration of carbon dioxide
in the alveolus.

98
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,800
so if this is porous to carbon
dioxide, this membrane-- and

99
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,150
it is, these carbon dioxide
molecules are going to diffuse

100
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,120
into the alveolus.

101
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,340
Now on the other side of that--
we have oxygen here.

102
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,270
We're breathing it in.

103
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,550
The air is 21% oxygen so you're
actually going to have

104
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,210
a lot more oxygen than
carbon dioxide.

105
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,830
And this is de-oxygenated
blood.

106
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,690
We used all of the oxygen in our
body and we'll talk more

107
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,800
about that either at the end of
this video or in a future

108
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,710
video on how we use it or where
it goes in our body, but

109
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,020
there's no oxygen here so the
oxygen is going to be taken--

110
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:08,450
it's going to diffuse across
this membrane because the

111
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,620
concentration of
oxygen is low.

112
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,890
Now the question is-- so
immediately you see that as

113
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,946
the oxygen diffuses across
this membrane, all of a

114
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:17,460
sudden, this is oxygenated
blood ready to

115
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,270
go back to the heart.

116
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,950
So this transition between
artery and vein is a very

117
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,040
subtle thing.

118
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,990
Very clearly here, you
say that, OK, this is

119
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,440
going from the heart.

120
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,360
This is our vein.

121
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,450
This is going to the
heart-- sorry.

122
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,440
I always get confused.

123
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,930
This is going away from the
heart-- and I was looking for

124
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,040
an A and I wrote from.

125
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,610
This is away from the heart
so this is an artery.

126
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,330
And this is going to the heart
so this is a vein.

127
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,770
So you could make
the division.

128
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,780
You could say, OK, once it's
oxygenated, maybe we're going

129
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,220
back to the heart, but it's kind
of an arbitrary-- sorry.

130
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,060
I spelled artery wrong.

131
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,660
These are my flaws.

132
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,210
Spelling was never
my strong suit.

133
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,840
So it's hard to say where
the artery ends

134
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,830
and the vein begins.

135
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,320
A good demarcation is when the
carbon dioxide concentration

136
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,840
goes low and that the oxygen
concentration goes high.

137
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,690
That's a good time, where
we start from

138
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,060
the pulmonary artery.

139
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,180
Probably in the next video, I
will a make a very-- you'll

140
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,790
see why the pulmonary arteries
are special, because pulmonary

141
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,230
arteries coming away from the
heart have no oxygen or very

142
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,590
little oxygen and they have
a lot of carbon dioxide.

143
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:34,750
So pulmonary veins, which is--
it's arbitrary where the

144
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,160
artery turns into a vein.

145
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,520
Once it gets oxygenated, it's
ready to go back to the heart.

146
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,070
It's a pulmonary vein and
it is oxygenated.

147
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:47,326
So it has oxygenated-- and we
could write de-oxygenated.

148
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,900
Now the reason why I say it's
special besides the fact that

149
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,110
pulmonary arteries and veins go
to and from the lungs, is

150
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,400
that they're kind
of the opposite.

151
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,680
Because in the rest of the body
when we're going away

152
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,420
from the heart or we're talking
about arteries, you're

153
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,910
going to see that that's
oxygenated blood, while when

154
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,020
we're going away from the heart
to the lungs, that's

155
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,480
de-oxygenated blood.

156
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,260
Similarly in the rest of the
body, when we're going to the

157
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,560
heart, where you're to see
that that's de-oxygenated

158
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,220
blood, but in the pulmonary
vein, when we're going to the

159
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,340
heart, it's oxygenated because
the lungs are what take up the

160
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,630
carbon dioxide and give
us the oxygen.

161
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,320
Now I still haven't answered
that interesting question that

162
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,370
rose on the message board
on the last video.

163
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,330
What happens to the 78% of
nitrogen that's sitting here?

164
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:43,320
There's just a ton of nitrogen
over here, more than the

165
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,350
oxygen, a lot more than
the carbon dioxide.

166
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,050
What happens to all of these
nitrogen molecules?

167
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,550
And the answer is, nitrogen can
diffuse and does diffuse

168
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,400
into the blood, but the blood's
ability to take in

169
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,280
nitrogen isn't that high.

170
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,930
And you might say, well,
why is oxygen special?

171
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,800
Why can the blood take
up oxygen so

172
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,360
much easier than nitrogen?

173
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,250
And that's where the red blood
cells come into play.

174
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:09,920
Let me write this down.

175
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,520
I'll write it in red.

176
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,520
Red blood cells, which
are fascinating on a

177
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,050
whole set of levels.

178
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,470
What red blood cells-- these
are these cells that are

179
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,010
sitting in-- they're flowing
through our circulatory system

180
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,260
and they look kind of
like lozenges, if I

181
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,830
were to draw one.

182
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,400
They're kind of like a flattened
sphere with a little

183
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,090
divot on either side of it--
a lot like a lozenge.

184
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,730
So if I were to draw it from
the side, it might look

185
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,480
something like-- well, from the
side, it would look like

186
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,530
that and if you could see
through it, there'd be a

187
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,140
little divot on each side.

188
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,190
If I were to draw it at an
angle, it would look

189
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,440
something like this.

190
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,200
There'd be a little divot on
that side and there'd be a

191
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,960
similar divot on
the other side.

192
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,750
And red blood cells-- and I
could do a whole set of videos

193
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,650
just on red blood cells--
they contain hemoglobin.

194
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,250
Maybe we'll do a whole
video on hemoglobin.

195
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:11,420
The hemoglobin are these
small proteins that

196
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,330
contain four hem groups.

197
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:19,050
So inside of red blood cells,
you have millions of

198
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,750
hemoglobin proteins.

199
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,460
And the hemoglobin proteins--
I'll just draw them as this--

200
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,070
they have these four
heme groups.

201
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,380
And heme groups, the main
component is iron.

202
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,600
And that's why iron
is so important.

203
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,990
If you don't have enough iron,
you're going to have trouble

204
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,450
processing oxygen in your blood
and your hemoglobin

205
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,340
won't be functional enough.

206
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,350
But it has iron on it.

207
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,350
It has four of these
heme groups.

208
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,750
And each of these heme groups
can bond to oxygen molecules.

209
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,140
They're very good binders
of oxygen.

210
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,370
And we're going to see in a
little bit-- probably the next

211
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,430
video-- how they release the
oxygen, but this has tons,

212
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:56,010
this has millions of heme groups
in it and the oxygen

213
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,120
diffuses across the membrane
of the red blood cells and

214
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,970
bonds to to the heme groups
on your hemoglobin.

215
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,470
So because the red blood cells
have the hemoglobin inside of

216
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,380
them, they're like these sponges
for oxygen because

217
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,340
hemoglobin is so good
at taking in oxygen.

218
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,170
So the red blood cells are able
to essentially suck up

219
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,710
all of the oxygen out
of the plasma.

220
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,300
The plasma we can view as just
the general fluid of the

221
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,500
blood, not including the
red blood cells.

222
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,320
So the red blood cell
here isn't so red.

223
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,380
And the reason-- and this is the
key point-- the reason why

224
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,610
it's not so red-- maybe we had
a red blood cell over here--

225
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,190
let me make it clear.

226
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,450
Carbon dioxide for
the most part is

227
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,390
traveling within the plasma.

228
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,640
It gets absorbed into the actual
fluid and I'll talk

229
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,500
about it in a future video.

230
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,590
It's actually in a slightly
different form.

231
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,820
It's as carbonic acid and that's
actually a key point

232
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,040
for how the plasma knows where
to dump the oxygen, but I'll

233
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,720
talk about that in
a future video.

234
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,540
But over here, this red blood
cell has a bunch of hemoglobin

235
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,840
proteins in it, but those
hemoglobin proteins have

236
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,190
dumped their oxygen.

237
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,250
And it actually turns out it's
the hemoglobin-- so with

238
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,080
oxygen, hemoglobin looks red.

239
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,660
It reflects red light.

240
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:19,350
When it doesn't have oxygen,
hemoglobin does not look red.

241
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,190
It looks kind of purplish,
bluish, darkish-- something.

242
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,880
And that's why in most of your
body, your veins that have

243
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,770
de-oxygenated red blood cells
look kind of bluish.

244
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,380
And the reason why it changes
color is that when the oxygen

245
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,860
bonds to the hem sites on the
hemoglobin, it actually

246
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,480
changes the entire confirmation,
the entire

247
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,660
structure of the protein.

248
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,160
We've see that multiple times.

249
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,950
The whole protein folds in
such a way that all of a

250
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,340
sudden, instead of purplish or
dark light being reflected,

251
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,690
now red light is reflected.

252
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,130
And that's why red blood cells
will become red once they take

253
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:54,920
the oxygen.

254
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,240
But I'm going on a tangent.

255
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,720
The whole point here is saying,
why we taking up so

256
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,310
much more oxygen than nitrogen,
given that there's

257
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,260
less oxygen in the atmosphere
than nitrogen?

258
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,720
And the key is these
red blood cells.

259
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,250
These red blood cells have these
millions of hemoglobin

260
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,280
proteins inside of them and they
take them up and they sop

261
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
up all of the oxygen
out of the plasma.

262
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:23,870
Actually, they sop about
98.5% of the oxygen.

263
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,560
So these red blood cells are
just traveling and they're

264
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,440
going to go back to the heart.

265
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,670
They are what make
our blood red.

266
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,010
So you have this thing,
hemoglobin, that's sitting in

267
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,770
red blood cells.

268
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,380
It's sopping up all
the oxygen.

269
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,290
So it keeps the oxygen
concentration and the actual

270
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,610
plasma low.

271
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,760
You have nothing like
that for nitrogen.

272
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,350
There is no cell that's sopping
up the nitrogen.

273
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,280
Nitrogen does not bond
to hemoglobin.

274
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,030
So that's why oxygen
is taken up so

275
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,990
much better than nitrogen.

276
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,690
It's a very interesting question
because if you just

277
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,700
think about how much nitrogen
is, it's kind of a very

278
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,630
natural idea.

279
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,640
Now I want to focus a little
bit on the red blood cell

280
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,840
itself because it's
fascinating.

281
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,240
In the video on the structure
of the cell, I start off

282
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,020
saying, all cells have
a membrane and

283
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,190
they all have DNA.

284
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:22,565
Now, the fascinating thing about
a red blood cell-- I

285
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:26,980
already said it has millions
of hemoglobin molecules or

286
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,580
proteins inside of it.

287
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,950
The fascinating thing
about a red blood

288
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,120
cell-- it has no nucleus.

289
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,200
And no DNA.

290
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,550
This is mind boggling when
I first found out.

291
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,980
I was like, well, why
is it a cell?

292
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,860
Is it really even
a living thing?

293
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,990
And it turns out when
it's growing,

294
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,810
it does have a nucleus.

295
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,310
All cells need a nucleus with
DNA in order to generate the

296
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,530
proteins that build it up,
in order to exist and

297
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,690
structurally make itself the way
it needs to be made, but

298
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,820
the whole point of a red blood
cell is to contain as much

299
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,030
hemoglobin as possible.

300
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,490
And so you can imagine, this
is actually a favorable

301
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,200
evolutionary trait, that as red
blood cells are ready to

302
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,770
go into business, you've built
the whole structure, they

303
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,230
actually get rid of
their nucleus.

304
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,440
They actually push their nucleus
out of the cell and

305
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,950
the whole reason why that's
beneficial is, that's more

306
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,540
space for hemoglobin.

307
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,730
Because the more hemoglobin you
have, the more oxygen you

308
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,610
can take up.

309
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,120
And I can do a ton of videos
on hemoglobin and all of

310
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,040
that-- and actually, I'm going
to do a lot more on the

311
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,370
circulatory system so don't
worry about that, but I want

312
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,870
to go over one other really
interesting thing about

313
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,560
hemoglobin.

314
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,880
We already talked about
red blood cells.

315
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,070
I think it's fascinating that
they actually don't have a

316
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,370
nucleus in their mature form.

317
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,730
They actually have
very short lives.

318
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,360
They live maybe 80, 120 days
so they're not these long

319
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,720
lived cells-- so it's almost
a philosophical question.

320
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,250
Are are they still alive once
they've lost their DNA or are

321
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,420
they just vessels for oxygen
that aren't really alive

322
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,210
because they aren't regenerating
and producing

323
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,530
their own DNA?

324
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,980
So actually, instead of going
into the hemoglobin discussion

325
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,390
right now, I'll leave you
there in this video.

326
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,760
I realize I've been making
20-minute videos where my goal

327
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,810
is really to make
ten-minute ones.

328
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,055
So I'll leave you here and in
the next video, we'll talk

329
00:16:25,055 --> 00:16:28,590
more about hemoglobin and
the circulatory system.
