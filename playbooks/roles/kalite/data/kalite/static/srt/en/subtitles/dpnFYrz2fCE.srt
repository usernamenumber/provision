1
00:00:00,568 --> 00:00:03,169
In the last video, we talked about how the Serbians

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,571
were able to hold back the Austro-Hungarians

3
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:07,237
at the beginning of World War I.

4
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:09,310
But eventually they had to give in.

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,146
They were essentially –

6
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:14,056
They couldn't hold up against the combined forces

7
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,309
of the Bulgarians, the Austro-Hungarians,

8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,244
and the Germans.

9
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:19,140
And they were able to roll through in 1915.

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,142
And then we have to wait until 1918

11
00:00:21,142 --> 00:00:24,033
for the Allies to essentially recapture Serbia.

12
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,229
Now what is noteworthy –

13
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:28,123
There are many noteworthy things in World War I.

14
00:00:28,123 --> 00:00:30,034
And, obviously, we can't cover all of them.

15
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:32,368
is just what a [devastating] loss World War I

16
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:35,698
was to the Serbian people.

17
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:38,195
Just as a little bit of context –

18
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:39,551
[Serbia was a] very small country.

19
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:41,954
We're talking 4.5 million people,

20
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:43,751
as we enter into World War I,

21
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,820
with a reasonably [large army].

22
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,692
I guess, relative to the size of the country,

23
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:49,216
it was a decent-sized army.

24
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,439
But with an army on the order of –

25
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,525
we're talking on the order of 400,000 soldiers.

26
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:57,820
And this was pretty much [everyone].

27
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,424
Everyone in the country who could be in the army

28
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:01,714
was, essentially, in the army.

29
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:04,963
Over the course of the Serbian campaign,

30
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:07,446
and the Macedonian Front, you, essentially,

31
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:10,863
have the Serbian army getting decimated.

32
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:15,032
60% of the Serbian army dies.

33
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:20,364
60% – roughly 60% of the Serbian army is killed.

34
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:22,697
And even from a population point of view,

35
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:26,970
the Serbian population is reduced by 16%.

36
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,768
16% of the Serbian population –

37
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:32,032
civilian and military –

38
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:35,897
is dead by the end of World War I.

39
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:39,107
So a lot of countries suffered horribly

40
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:40,298
during World War I –

41
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:41,770
there were many notable ones –

42
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,029
France – the Russian Empire –

43
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:44,855
We could go on and on and on.

44
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,696
But it would be hard to argue

45
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:48,366
that any country suffered more

46
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:51,767
than what the Serbians did.

47
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:53,970
60% of their military dead,

48
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,261
[as well as] 16% of their [overall] population.
