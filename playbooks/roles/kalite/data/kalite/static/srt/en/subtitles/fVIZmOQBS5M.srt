1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,990
We're told to factor r squared
plus 4r, minus 45.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,740
And there are simpler ways to
factor this, because this has

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,160
1 as a leading coefficient on
the r squared right here, but

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,990
what we're going to do
is we're going to

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,420
factor this by grouping.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,750
And when you factor it by
grouping, what you want to do

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,110
is find two numbers whose
product-- so the two numbers

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,920
are a and b-- whose product is
equal to the coefficient on r

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,910
squared, 1 times negative 45,
which is just negative 45.

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,900
And whose sum is equal to the
coefficient on the first

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,450
degree term, is equal to 4.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,130
a plus b is equal to 4.

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,950
So let's look at all of the
different combinations that

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,180
goes to negative 45, and see
if when you add them,

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,090
you ever get to 4.

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,395
So let's take the
combinations.

18
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:46,980
   

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,910
Let's look at their different
a's and b's, and let's see

20
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,120
what happens when
you sum them.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,200
So I could try 1 and negative
45, but if you take their sum,

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,260
that's not going to get you
anywhere close to 4, even if

23
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,110
you swapped them, negative
1 and positive 45.

24
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,030
Let's see, if you do 3 and 15, 3
and negative 15, or negative

25
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,150
3 and 15, those are way
more than 4 apart.

26
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:07,890
We're going to have
to find numbers

27
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,930
that are closer together.

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,660
So let's see, 3, 4, 5 and 9,
that looks interesting.

29
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,120
5 and 9 are 4 apart.

30
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:24,040
And if we go with 5 and negative
9, what's their sum?

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,930
Their sum is negative 4.

32
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,120
What happens if we go with
negative 5 and positive 9?

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Well, then their sum
is 4, so negative 5

34
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,560
and positive 9 works.

35
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,460
So what we want to do here, now
that we found the numbers

36
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,350
whose product is equal to the 1
times negative 45, and whose

37
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,550
sum is equal to 4, let's break
this 4r up into a sum of

38
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,510
negative 5-- let me break
it up this way--

39
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,390
into 9r minus 5r.

40
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,040
I broke that 4r into that using
our two numbers, and

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,430
then I could put the r squared
out front, r squared, and then

42
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,810
we have a minus 45.

43
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,370
And now we're ready
to group this and

44
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,770
then factor by grouping.

45
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,840
So let's look at this first
group right here.

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,090
They both have the common
factor of r, so let's

47
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,160
factor out an r.

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,900
This is equal to r times-- r
square divided by r is r.

49
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,890
9r divided by r is 9.

50
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,700
So that's that first group.

51
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,510
And the second group right here,
has a common factor of

52
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,510
negative 5.

53
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,760
So let's factor it out.

54
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,470
   

55
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,210
Negative 5r divided by negative
5 is just an r.

56
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,240
Negative 45 divided by
negative 5 is a 9.

57
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,820
And then we have an r plus 9 in
both terms. r times r plus

58
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,060
9, negative 5 times r plus 9.

59
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,710
So we can factor that out.

60
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:58,290
So you factor an r plus 9 out,
and you're left with r times r

61
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,040
plus 9, divided by r plus 9
is just going to be an r.

62
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,350
And then negative 5 times r plus
9, divided by r plus 9 is

63
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,200
negative 5, and we're done!
