Dear Nickelodeon, I've gotten over how Sponge Bob's

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,973
pants are not actually square, I can ignore most of the time

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:08,275
that Gary's shell is not a logarithmic spiral, but what I

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:11,845
cannot forgive is that Sponge Bob's pineapple house

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,515
is a mathematical impossibility!

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,451
There's three easy ways to find spirals on a pineapple.

7
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,620
There's the ones that wind up it going right, the ones

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,421
that spiral up to the left, and the ones that

9
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,311
go almost straight up. Keyword: almost.

10
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:25,592
If you count the number of spiral going left, and the number

11
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,729
of spirals going right, they'll be adjacent Fibonacci numbers.

12
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,797
Three and five, or five and eight, eight and thirteen,

13
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,833
or thirteen and twenty-one.

14
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,769
You claim that that Sponge Bob square pants lives in

15
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,206
a pineapple under the sea, but does he really?

16
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,675
A true pineapple would have Fibonacci spirals, so

17
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,511
let's take a look. Because these images of his house

18
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,529
don't let us pick it up and turn it around and count

19
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:48,855
the number of spirals going around it, it might be hard

20
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:51,552
to figure out whether it's mathematically a pineapple or not

21
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,422
but there's a huge clue in the third spiral, the one going upwards

22
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,748
In this pineapple, there's eight to the right,

23
00:00:57,748 --> 00:01:00,494
thirteen to the left, you can add those numbers together

24
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,430
to get how many numbers are in the set spiraling steeply upwards.

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,532
In this case, twenty-one.

26
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,035
The three sets of spirals in any pineapple are pretty much

27
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,604
always adjacent Fibonacci numbers. The rare mutant

28
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,739
cases might show Lucas numbers or something,

29
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,042
but it will always be three adjacent numbers in a series

30
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:18,545
What you'll never have is the same number of spirals

31
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,215
both ways. Pineapples, unlike people, don't have bilateral

32
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,685
symmetry. You'll never have the third spiral be not

33
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:28,021
a spiral but just a straight line going up a pineapple.

34
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,425
Yet, when we look at Sponge Bob's supposed pineapple

35
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:35,128
under the sea, it clearly has lines of pineapple things going

36
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,432
straight up. It clearly has bilateral symmetry.

37
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,736
It clearly is not actually a pineapple at all because no

38
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,339
pineapple could possibly grow that way.

39
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,089
Nickelodeon, you need to take a long, hard look in the mirror

40
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:49,725
and think about the way you're misrepresenting the

41
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:52,346
universe to your viewers. This kind of mathematical

42
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,648
oversight is simply irresponsible.

43
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,000
Sincerely, Vi Hart.
