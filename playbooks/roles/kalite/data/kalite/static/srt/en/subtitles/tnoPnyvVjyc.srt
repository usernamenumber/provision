99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
xThe continuos function 'F' is defined on the interval -4>x>3, the graph of 'F' consists of two quarter

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
circles, and one line segment so this right here is one quarter circle, and we another quarter circle

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then it has this line segment over here, as shown in the figure above (I put the figure on the side

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that we have some screen relestate down here) Let 'G' of 'X' be equal to 2x plus the definite interval

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from zero to 'X' of 'F' of 'T', 'DT' all right that a little bit interesting, now lets do part 'A'...

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
part 'A': find 'G' of -3, so we wanna find 'G' of -3, so first of all they tell us what 'G' of 'X' is,
