2
00:00:04,202 --> 00:00:06,232
Dr. Steven Zucker: We're in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston

3
00:00:06,232 --> 00:00:10,436
looking at Fitz Henry Lane's Owl's Head, Penobscot Bay, Maine

4
00:00:10,436 --> 00:00:13,797
this is a place that Lane spent a good deal of time

5
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:19,629
and characteristic of this American artist--sometimes called a Luminist

6
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:23,429
--we have this wonderfully quiet--still--moment

7
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,642
Dr. Beth Harris: And that's what we mean by the term Luminism

8
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:35,480
--landscape paintings by a number of American painters--where we have a sense of calm and tranquility

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:43,565
--views of water--a quality of light that allows each element of the landscape to standout in perfect clarity

10
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:47,595
--but there is an overall mood of contemplativeness and peacefulness

11
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:51,874
Dr. Zucker: That's so typical of American art and especially American marine painting

12
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:59,098
--so this is dawn--we can see the peach sky in the background--and the water is still calm--the winds of the day have not started

13
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:05,875
--the ship in the background just put up its sails and is trying to catch whatever breeze is just beginning

14
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:12,848
--we look out on this space almost through the gaze of the fisherman we see in the lower left of the canvas

15
00:01:12,848 --> 00:01:18,424
Dr. Harris: This is very much a romantic landscape--one that looks back on the traditions of romanticism

16
00:01:18,424 --> 00:01:25,032
--we might think of Caspar David Friedrich and the way he used figures looking out to sea with their backs to us

17
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:28,517
--or we might even think about John Constable in England

18
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:36,609
--painting his native landscape of the Stour Valley with that sense of love of his native landscape

19
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:39,342
--and I think that we have that here with Lane

20
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:44,500
Dr. Zucker: There's a way that light is able to take the careful rendering of the veracity

21
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,793
that all this detail and clarity offers us

22
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:54,983
--but still render a painting that is largely poetic--and that's one of the issues most central to the Luminism

23
00:01:54,983 --> 00:02:03,358
--that even with this high pitched specificity--there's still room for a painting that is ultimately one that is emotional

24
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:05,698
--that is almost transcendental

25
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:10,228
Dr. Harris: I think that sense of emotion comes through because of the lack of narrative incident

26
00:02:10,228 --> 00:02:15,327
--we're looking at a seascape but we don't see fishermen busy with activities

27
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:19,563
--we don't see ships coming in and unloading cargo

28
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:23,693
--or other kids of narrative scenes that we might expect in a harbor

29
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:27,508
Dr. Zucker: Light is the main protagonist not the human occupation of this space

30
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:32,049
Dr. Harris: In a way for me the main protagonist is the house

31
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:37,066
that we see on that tiny little island and as you said that peach colored light

32
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:41,745
that we all know so well from looking at the water in the early morning

33
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:47,927
--We're really transported to this place--I can almost hear the water lapping at the shore

34
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:52,224
Dr. Zucker: This painting invites a kind of careful quiet contemplation

35
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:54,683
Dr. Harris: It's very different from other American landscape painting

36
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:57,614
that we might think of by Albert Bierstadt

37
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:02,409
or Frederic Church that's really grand and operatic and sublime and says something big

38
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:09,682
--and those paintings are often very large and depict sublime scenes like the Rocky Mountains or Niagara Falls

39
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:12,962
but here this kind of humble quiet scene

40
00:03:12,962 --> 00:03:16,343
a kind of different strain in American landscape painting

41
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:35,270
