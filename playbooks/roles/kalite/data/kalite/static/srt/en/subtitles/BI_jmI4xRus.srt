1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420
   

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,860
Let's solve some quadratic
equations by factoring.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:12,490
So let's say I had x squared
plus 4x is equal to 21.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,260
Now your impulse might be to
try to factor out an x and

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,250
somehow set that equal to 21.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,650
And that will not lead you
to good solutions.

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,670
You'll probably end up doing

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,880
something that's not justified.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,910
What you need to do here is
put the entire quadratic

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,460
expression on one side
of the equation.

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,460
We'll do it onto the
left-hand side.

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,710
So let's subtract 21 from both
sides of this equation.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,680
The left-hand side then
becomes x squared

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,080
plus 4x minus 21.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,130
And then the right-hand side
will be equal to 0.

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,710
And the way you want
to solve this, this

17
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,170
is a quadratic equation.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,230
We have a quadratic expression
being set equal to 0.

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,560
The way you want to solve this
is you want to factor them,

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,500
and say, OK, each of
those factors could

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,470
then be equal to 0.

22
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,040
So how do we factor this?

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,910
Well, we saw in the last video
that we have to figure out two

24
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:10,040
numbers whose product is equal
to negative 21, and whose sum

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,580
is equal to 4.

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,900
This would be a plus b would
have to be equal to 4.

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,990
Since their product is negative,
they have to be of

28
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,270
different signs.

29
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,050
And so let's see, the number
that jumps out

30
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,530
at me is 7 and 3.

31
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,280
If I have negative 7 and
positive 3, I would get

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,580
negative 4.

33
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,210
So let's do positive
7 and negative 3.

34
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,180
So the a and b are positive
7 and negative 3.

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,250
When I take the product,
I get negative 21.

36
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,660
When I take their sum,
I get positive 4.

37
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,070
So I can rewrite this
equation here.

38
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,180
I could rewrite it as x
plus 7, times x minus

39
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,150
3, is equal to 0.

40
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,680
And now I can solve this by
saying, look, I have two

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,690
quantities.

42
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,040
Their product is equal to 0.

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,610
That means that one or both of
them have to be equal to 0.

44
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,770
So that means that x plus
7 is equal to 0.

45
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,040
That's an x.

46
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,580
Or x minus 3 is equal to 0.

47
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,419
I could subtract 7 from both
sides of this equation.

48
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,990
And I would get x is equal
to negative 7.

49
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,270
And over here, I can add 3 to
both sides of this equation.

50
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,320
And I'll get x is equal to 3.

51
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,540
So both of these numbers are
solutions to this equation.

52
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,750
You could try it out.

53
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,300
If you do 7-- negative
7 squared is 49.

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,200
Negative 7 times 4 is minus
28, or negative 28.

55
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,010
And that does indeed equal 21.

56
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,280
And I'll let you try it out
with the positive 3.

57
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,290
Actually, let's just do it.

58
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,190
3 squared is 9, plus
4 times 3 is 12.

59
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,170
9 plus 12 is, indeed, 21.

60
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,920
Let's do a bunch
more examples.

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:58,300
Let's say I have x squared
plus 49 is equal to 14x.

62
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,090
Once again, whenever you see
anything like this, get all of

63
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,140
your terms on one side of the
equation and get a 0 on the

64
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,540
other side.

65
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,410
That's the best way to solve
a quadratic equation.

66
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,090
So let's subtract 14x
from both sides.

67
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:17,430
We could write this as x squared
minus 14x plus 49 is

68
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,570
equal to 0.

69
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,140
Obviously, 14x minus 14x is 0.

70
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,780
This quantity minus 14x is this
quantity right there.

71
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,590
Now we just have to think about
what two numbers, when I

72
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,580
take their product, I'm going
to get 49, and when I take

73
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,670
their sum, I'm going
to get negative 14.

74
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,520
So one, they have to be the same
sign because this is a

75
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,880
positive number right here.

76
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,290
And they're both going to
be negative because

77
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,940
their sum is negative.

78
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,480
And there's something
interesting here.

79
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,400
49 is a perfect square.

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,890
Its factors are 1, 7, and 49.

81
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,020
So maybe 7 will work, or
even better, maybe

82
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,530
negative 7 will work.

83
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,410
And it does!

84
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,980
Negative 7 times negative
7 is 49.

85
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,100
And negative 7 plus negative
7 is negative 14.

86
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,540
We have that pattern there,
where we have 2 times a

87
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,250
number, and then we have
the number squared.

88
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,000
This is a perfect square.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,209
This is equal to x minus
7, times x minus

90
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,839
7, is equal to 0.

91
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,750
Don't want to forget that.

92
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:28,000
Or we could write this as x
minus 7 squared is equal to 0.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,120
So this was a perfect square
of a binomial.

94
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,010
And if x minus 7 squared is
equal to 0, take the square

95
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,220
root of both sides.

96
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,990
You'll get x minus
7 is equal to 0.

97
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,890
I mean, you could say x minus
7 is 0 or x minus 7 is 0.

98
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,210
But that'd be redundant.

99
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,640
So we just get x minus 7 is 0.

100
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,400
Add 7 to both sides, and you
get x is equal to 7.

101
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,620
Only one solution there.

102
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,240
Let's do another one in pink.

103
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,350
Let's say we have x squared
minus 64 is equal to 0.

104
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,630
Now this looks interesting
right here.

105
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,160
   

106
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,780
A bell might be ringing
in your head on

107
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,010
how to solve this.

108
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,300
This has no x term, but
we could think of it

109
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,410
as having an x term.

110
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:27,660
We could rewrite this as x
squared plus 0x minus 64.

111
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,070
So in this situation, we could
say, OK, what two numbers,

112
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,130
when I multiply them,
equal 64, and when I

113
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,580
add them equal 0?

114
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,720
And when I take their product,
I'm getting a

115
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,980
negative number, right?

116
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,080
This is a times b.

117
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,220
It's a negative number.

118
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,195
So that must mean that they
have opposite signs.

119
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:46,600
   

120
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,590
And when I add them, I get 0.

121
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,740
That must mean that a plus minus
b is equal to 0, or that

122
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,870
a is equal to b, that we're
dealing with the same number.

123
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,500
We're essentially dealing with
the same number, the negatives

124
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,790
of each other.

125
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,270
So what can it be?

126
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,650
Well, if we're doing the same
number and they're negatives

127
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:14,505
of each other, 64 is
exactly 8 squared.

128
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:17,300
But it's negative 64, so maybe
we're dealing with one

129
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,010
negative 8, and we're dealing
with one positive 8.

130
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,250
And if we add those two
together, we do

131
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,720
indeed get to 0.

132
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,840
So this will be x minus
8 times x plus 8.

133
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,300
Now you don't always have
to go through this

134
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,250
process I did here.

135
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,790
You might already remember that
if I have a plus b times

136
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:42,000
a minus b, that that's equal to
a squared minus b squared.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,400
So if you see something that
fits the pattern, a squared

138
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,100
minus b squared, you could
immediately say, oh, that's

139
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:58,330
going to be a plus b-- a is x,
b is 8-- times a minus b.

140
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,720
Let's do a couple more of just
general problems. I won't tell

141
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,270
you what type these
are going to be.

142
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,110
Let me switch colors.

143
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,490
It's getting monotonous.

144
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:14,280
Let's say we have x squared
minus 24x plus

145
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,530
144 is equal to 0.

146
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,650
Well, 144 is conspicuously
12 squared.

147
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,290
And this is conspicuously
2 times negative 12.

148
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,570
Or this is conspicuously
negative 12 squared.

149
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,510
So this is negative 12
times negative 12.

150
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,400
This is negative 12
plus negative 12.

151
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,060
So this expression can be
rewritten as x minus 12 times

152
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,050
x minus 12, or x minus
12 squared.

153
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,550
We're going to set
that equal to 0.

154
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,790
This is going to be 0 when
x minus 12 is equal to 0.

155
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,230
You can say either of these
could be equal to 0, but

156
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,510
they're the same thing.

157
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,580
Add 12 to both sides of that
equation and you get x is

158
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,560
equal to 12.

159
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,020
And I just realized, this
problem up here, I factored

160
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,830
it, but I didn't actually
solve the equation.

161
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,200
So this has to be equal to 0.

162
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,070
Let's take a step back to
this equation up here.

163
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,470
And the only way that this thing
over here will be 0 is

164
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,670
if either x minus 8 is
equal to 0 or x plus

165
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,110
8 is equal to 0.

166
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,200
So add 8 to both
sides of this.

167
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,100
You get x could be equal to 8.

168
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,460
Subtract 8 from both
sides of this.

169
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,770
You get x could also be
equal to negative 8.

170
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,820
Let's do one more.

171
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,159
Just to really, really get the
point drilled in your head.

172
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,650
Let's do one more.

173
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:47,180
Let's say we have 4x squared
minus 25 is equal to 0.

174
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,870
So you might already
see the pattern.

175
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,870
This is an a squared.

176
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,780
This is a b squared.

177
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,180
We have the pattern of a squared
minus b squared,

178
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,140
where, in this case, a would
be equal to x, right?

179
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,020
This is 2x squared.

180
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,230
And b would be equal to 5.

181
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,570
So if you have a squared minus b
squared, this is going to be

182
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,820
equal to a plus b
times a minus b.

183
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,590
In this situation, that means
that 4x squared minus 25 is

184
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:26,660
going to be 2x plus 5
times 2x minus 5.

185
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,520
And of course, that will
be equal to 0.

186
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,400
And this will only be equal to 0
if either 2x plus 5 is equal

187
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,870
to 0 or 2x minus 5
is equal to 0.

188
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,500
And then we can solve
each of these.

189
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,210
Subtract 5 from both sides.

190
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,550
You get 2x is equal
to negative 5.

191
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,280
Divide both sides by 2.

192
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,030
You could get one solution
is negative 5/2.

193
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,950
Over here, add 5
to both sides.

194
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,020
You get 2x is equal
to positive 5.

195
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,420
Divide both sides by 2.

196
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,310
You get x could also be
equal to positive 5/2.

197
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,920
So both of these satisfy
that equation up there.

198
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,000
