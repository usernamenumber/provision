1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:05,157
Let's see if we can figure out 3 times 60.

2
00:00:05,157 --> 00:00:07,300
Well, there's a couple of ways you could think about it.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:15,141
You could literally view this as 60 three times, so you could view this as 60 plus 60 plus 60.

4
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,674
And you might be able compute this in your head.

5
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:22,757
60 plus 60 is 120, plus another 60 is 180. And you'd be done!

6
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:28,500
But another way of thinking about this is that 3 times 60 is the same thing as 3 times...

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,810
and instead of thinking of that as 60, you can think of 60 as 6 times 10.

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,179
3 times 6 times 10.

9
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,008
And when you're multiplying three numbers like this, it doesn't matter what order you multiplay them in.

10
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:48,671
So we could multiply the 3 times the 6 first and get 18 and then multiply that times 10.

11
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:54,476
And 18 times 10 is just going to be 180, it's going to be 18 with another 0.

12
00:00:54,476 --> 00:01:00,327
So this is going to be 180.

13
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:04,460
Now, the more practice you get, you'll realize that I could say:

14
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,567
"3 times 6 is 18 but I have to worry about this 0 right over here,

15
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:12,077
so I'm going to put one more zero at the end, it's going to be 180."

16
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:14,817
Same answer that we've got right over there.

17
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:17,139
Let's do another one of these.

18
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:23,501
So, let's say we want to multiply 50 times 7.

19
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:28,167
And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it yourself and then unpause and see what I do.

20
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:31,814
So 50... Well, there's a couple of ways you could think about it.

21
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:35,064
One: You could literally try to add 50 seven times.

22
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:38,408
Adding 7 fifty times would be taking forever, but you could literally say:

23
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:46,674
50 plus 50 plus 50 plus 50 (let's see... that's four) plus 50 plus 50

24
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:50,668
(let's see... that is 6, I'll do one more right over here) plus 50.

25
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:59,678
So this is 50 seven times. 50 plus 50 is 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350.

26
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:03,764
So you could do it that way, but you could imagine that there's an easier way to do it.

27
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:08,500
You just need to realize that 50 is the same thing as 10 times 5.

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,514
So we could write this as 10 times 5 and we're multiplying that times 7.

29
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:20,167
Once again the order that we multiply does not matter so we could multiply the 5 times the 7 first,

30
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:27,170
we know that that is 35 and we're going to multiply that times 10.

31
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:36,737
10 times 35 (all we do is just got to stick the 0 at the end of the 35) is going to be equal to 350.

32
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:41,845
(Now I want to do that zero in the same color...) It's going to be 350.

33
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:46,489
Now you might realize: "Hey look, I could've just looked at this 5 right over here,

34
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:53,734
multiply the 5 times the 7 and have gotten the 35 and then not forgetting that it's not a 5,

35
00:02:53,734 --> 00:03:01,065
it's a 50 so I have to multiply by 10 again or I have to throw that 0 at the end of it to get that 0 right over here."

36
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:05,000
So 50 times 7 is 350.
