1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,162
Solve this system. And here we have three equations with three unknowns.

2
00:00:06,162 --> 00:00:08,625
And just so you have a way to visualize this,

3
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,852
each of these equations would actually be a plane in three dimensions.

4
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:15,921
And so you're actually trying to figure out where three planes in three dimensions intersect.

5
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:18,867
I won't go into the details here, I'll focus more on the mechanics,

6
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:22,800
but you can imagine if I were to draw a three dimensional space over here.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,667
Now all of a sudden we'll have an x, y, and z axes.

8
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:31,123
So you can imagine that maybe this first plane

9
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:33,133
and I'm not drawing it the may it might actually look.

10
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,733
It might look something like that. (I'm just drawing part of the plane.)

11
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,733
And maybe this plane over here.

12
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:46,200
It intersects right over there and it comes popping out like this and then it goes behind it like that.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,867
It keeps going in every direction, I'm just drawing part of the plane.

14
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:52,800
And maybe this plane over here, maybe it does something like this.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,200
Maybe it intersects over here and over here.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,933
And so it pops out like that and then it goes below it like that

17
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:04,400
and then it goes like that. I'm just doing this for visualization purposes.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,800
And so the intersection of this plane - the x, y and z coordinates that would satisfy

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,067
all three of these constraints the way I drew them - would be right over here.

20
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:19,333
So that's what we're looking for. And a lot of times these three equations with three unknown systems

21
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:25,400
will be inconsistent. You won't have a solution here, because it's very possible to have three planes

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,467
that all don't intersect in one place. A very simple example of that is

23
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:33,800
well, one, they could all be parallel to each other, or they could intersect each other but maybe they

24
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:41,467
intersect each other in kind of a triangle, so maybe one plane looks like that, then another plane maybe

25
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:48,800
pops out like that, goes underneath. And then maybe the third plane cuts in.

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,333
It does something like this: where it goes into that plane

27
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:56,933
and keeps going out like that, but it intersects this plane over here.

28
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:01,067
So you see kind of forms a triangle and they don't all intersect in one point

29
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:05,200
so in this situation, you would have an inconsistent system. So with that out of the way, let's try to

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,467
actually solve this system. And the trick here is to try to eliminate one variable at a time from all

31
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:17,133
of the equations, making sure that you have the information from all three equations here

32
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:20,733
so what we're going to do is we could maybe - it looks like the easiest to eliminate

33
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:23,267
since we have a positive y and a negative y and then another positive y

34
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:26,533
it seems like we can eliminate the Ys.

35
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:30,133
We can add these two equations and come up with another equation

36
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:34,280
that will only be in terms of x and z. And then we could use these two equations

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,467
to come up with another equation that will only be in terms of x and z.

38
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:43,400
But it will have all of the x and z constraint information embedded in it because

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,333
we're using all three equations. So let's do that. So first let's add these two equations right over here.

40
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:54,467
So we have x plus y minus three z is equal to negative ten.

41
00:02:54,467 --> 00:03:03,333
And x minus y plus two z is equal to three. So over here if we want to eliminate y, we can literally

42
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:10,733
just add these two equations. So on the left hand side, x plus x is two x. Y plus negative y cancels out

43
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:16,067
And then negative three z plus two z - that gives us just a negative z

44
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:21,800
and then we have negative ten plus three, which is negative seven.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,625
So using these two equations we got

46
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:28,867
two x minus z is equal to negative seven - just adding these two equations.

47
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:33,533
Now let's do these two equatons. And we can reuse this equation as long as

48
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:38,133
we're using new information here. Now we're using the extra constraint of this bottom equation.

49
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:43,467
So we have x minus y plus two z is equal to three.

50
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:52,600
And we have two x plus y minus z is equal to negative six.

51
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,400
If we want to eliminate the Ys, we can just add these two equations.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:05,267
So x plus two x is three x. Negative y plus y cancels out. Two z minus z - well that is just z.

53
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:09,800
And that is going to be equal to three plus negative six, which is negative three.

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:17,867
So if I add these two equations, I get three x plus z is equal to negative three. Now I have a system

55
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:23,133
of two equations with two unknowns. This is a little bit more traditional of a problem. So let me write

56
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:32,067
them over here. So we have two x minus z is equal to negative seven. And then we have three x plus z

57
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:37,800
is equal to negative three and the way this problem is set up, it gets pretty simple pretty fast, because

58
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,467
if we just add these two equations, the Zs cancel out. Otherwise if it didn't happen so naturally, we'd

59
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:46,800
have to multiply one of these equations, or maybe both of them, by some scaling factor.

60
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
But we can just add these two equations up.

61
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,800
On the left hand side, two x plus three x is five x. Negative z plus z cancels out.

62
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Negative seven plus negative three - that is equal to negative ten.

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Divide both sides of this equation by five and

64
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,200
we get x is equal to negative two. Now we can substitute back to find the other variables.

65
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,800
Maybe we can substitute back into this equation to figure out what z must be equal to.

66
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:25,333
So we have two times x. Two times negative two minus z is equal to negative seven.

67
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:29,400
Or negative four minus z is equal to negative seven.

68
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,067
We can add four to both sides of this equation and then we get

69
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:40,133
negative z is equal to negative seven plus four, which is negative three.

70
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:46,533
Multiply or divide both sides by negative one and you get z is equal to three. And now we can go and

71
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:52,467
substitute back into one of these original equations. So we have x. We know x is negative two.

72
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:59,200
So we have negative two plus y, minus three times z.

73
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,133
Well, we know z is three (so minus three times three)

74
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:06,067
should all be equal to negative ten. And now we just solve for y.

75
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:14,400
So we get negative two plus y minus nine is equal to negative ten. And so negative two minus nine,

76
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
that's negative eleven. So we have

77
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:23,000
y minus eleven is equal to negative ten. And then we can add eleven to both

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,533
sides of this equation. And we get y is equal to negative ten plus eleven, which is one.

79
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:32,933
So we're done!

80
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:37,200
We've got x is equal to negative two. Z is equal to three and y is equal to one.

81
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,333
Now I can actually go back and check it.

82
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,600
Verify that this x, y and z works for all three constraints

83
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,400
that this three dimensional coordinate lies on all three planes.

84
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,333
So let's try it out. We've got x is negative two, z is three, y is one.

85
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:57,067
So if we substituted - let me do it into each of them - so in this first equation

86
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:03,733
that means that we have negative two plus one (remember y was equal to one).

87
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:09,000
Let me write it over here - y is equal to one, x is equal to negative two, z is equal to three.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,600
That was the result we got. Yup, that's the result we got.

89
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,067
So when we test it into this first one, you have negative two plus one minus three times three.

90
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:22,800
So minus nine. This should be equal to negative ten. And it is.

91
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,533
Negative two plus one is negative one, minus nine is negative ten.

92
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:30,133
So it works for the first one. Let's try it for the second equation right over here.

93
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:41,785
So we have negative two minus y (so, minus one) plus two times z (so, z is three, so two times three)

94
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:45,382
So, plus six needs to be equal to three.

95
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,733
So this is negative three plus six, which is indeed equal to three.

96
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:53,000
So this satisifies the second equation. And then we have the last one right over here!

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,405
We have two times x, so two times negative two, which is negative four. Negative four.

98
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:06,733
Plus y, so plus one. Minus z, so minus three. Minus three.

99
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:14,600
Needs to be equal to negative six. Negative four plus one is negative three,

100
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,133
and then you subtract three again. It equals negative six.

101
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:22,133
So it satisfies all three equations, so we can feel pretty good about our answer.
