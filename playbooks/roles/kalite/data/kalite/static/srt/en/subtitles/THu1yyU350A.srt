1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,810
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:06,250
Well, we're now on problem
number 11.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,040
And this says the circle above has center o, and diameter ab.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,220
And it's a dotted line in the book, but I made it a solid

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,190
green line.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,500
The two semi-circles have diameters oa, so this is one

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,600
semi-circle and this is
its diameter, oa.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,370
And then ob, this is the
other semi-circle.

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,500
It's ob.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,870
If the circumference of
the circle is 36 pi.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,020
So, circumference of the circle,
of the big circle--

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,250
and actually I'll do it in yellow, which is the color of

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,840
kind of the perimeter or the circumference of that circle.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,950
So they're saying the
circumference is 36 pi.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,090
What is the length of the curved path from ab to o?

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,680
So they want to figure out the length of, essentially, this

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,260
brown path.

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,210
And so before we break into the math, just how can we

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,540
think about this?

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,580
Well we have a big circle and we know its circumference.

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,850
So if we know its circumference
we could figure

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,730
out its radius or its
diameter, right?

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,860
Because you know the formula,
circumference is

24
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,820
equal to 2 pi r.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,070
So if we know the circumference
of this big

26
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,540
circle, we can actually
figure out its radius

27
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,560
by using this formula.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,960
And the radius of the big circle, which would be-- let's

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,670
say, oa or ob-- they're both radiuses of the big circle--

30
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,540
than those are the diameter of each of these half circles or

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,810
each of these semi-circles.

32
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,820
So if we know this diameter we could take half of it and

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,880
re-use this formula, or say the circumference is pi times

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,370
the diameter.

35
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,780
We could do either one.

36
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,700
And we could figure out-- let's say we know this radius,

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,730
so we could figure out this.

38
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,020
Then we could figure out
the circumference

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,410
of this larger circle.

40
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,370
And I'll actually make the claim that the circumference

41
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,360
of this larger circle is the same as the circumference of

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,232
this half circle plus
this half circle.

43
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:00,770
And I think you know why.

44
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,340
If you just shifted this up then you would get the other

45
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,460
half of this circle.

46
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,940
The other way you could have done it is, you figure out the

47
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,900
circumference of this circle, divide by 2 to get this.

48
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,840
Take the circumference of this circle, divide by 2 to get

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,740
this and then add them.

50
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,800
But you'll get the same thing as just the circumference of

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,890
this circle.

52
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,540
So let's do the problem.

53
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,240
So circumference is
equal to 2 pi r.

54
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,420
We know the circumference of the larger circle is 36 pi.

55
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:32,930
So let's see, 36 pi is
equal to 2 pi r.

56
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,490
Divide both sides by 2 pi, and I'll switch the sides too.

57
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,565
So you get r is equal to 36 pi over 2 pi-- I just divided

58
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:44,020
both sides by 2 pi.

59
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,520
pi's cancel out.

60
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,200
36 divided by 2 is
equal to 18.

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,220
And so what's 18?

62
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,340
18 is this length right here.

63
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,090
Is this length.

64
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,360
We just figured out,
that's the radius

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,880
of the larger circle.

66
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,340
And now we could use this, which is the diameter of the

67
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,020
smaller circle to figure out its circumference using the

68
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,890
same formula.

69
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,400
And now I'm going to use brown for this circumference.

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,870
So circumference is
equal to 2 pi r.

71
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,410
And that's the same thing as-- because 2 times the radius is

72
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,330
the diameter.

73
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,040
So that equals pi times
the diameter.

74
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,760
We know what the diameter
is, the diameter is 18.

75
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,260
So we could say circumference
is equal to

76
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,880
pi times the diameter.

77
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,690
The diameter is 18.

78
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,120
Or if we rearrange that
that's 18 pi.

79
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,030
And we're done.

80
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,450
Because what we just figured out is the circumference of

81
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,360
this larger circle.

82
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,760
We could divide it by 2 and figure out-- we could say that

83
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,530
this is 9 pi right here.

84
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,560
Just this piece.

85
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,710
This piece is 9 pi.

86
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,250
And if we do the same math here on this piece, you would

87
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,090
also get 9 pi.

88
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,710
But that also adds
up to 18 pi.

89
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,570
Hopefully you understand
what I'm saying.

90
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,250
Let's move on to the
next problem.

91
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,760
So in the table above-- this is our classic f of x table.

92
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,000
When x is 0, f of x is a.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,020
When x is 1, f of x is 24.

94
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,700
When x is 2, f of x is b.

95
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,840
It says the table above shows some values of the functions

96
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,100
of f. f is a linear function.

97
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,130
So what does a linear
function mean?

98
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,710
Linear means it's a line.

99
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,200
And that also means that
the slope is constant.

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,960
If you haven't gottem-- well,
if you haven't got past

101
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,120
algebra I, you probably haven't seen functions with

102
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,220
non-constant slopes.

103
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,780
But like, for example,
quadratics don't

104
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,030
have constant slopes.

105
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,845
The linear means that the
slope is constant.

106
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,870
That's the one conclusion you can make from that statement.

107
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,760
And then they want to know, what is the value of a plus b?

108
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,530
a plus b is what?

109
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,800
So the only thing we know is this table and we know that

110
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,910
it's linear.

111
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,560
And linear means that the
slope is constant.

112
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,040
So the slope is constant.

113
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,040
So let's see what we can
figure out the slope.

114
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,860
So that means the slope from x is equal to 0 to x is equal to

115
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,210
1 is the same as the slope from x is equal to 1, to x is

116
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,480
equal to 2.

117
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,140
So what's the slope if we
use these two terms?

118
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,500
Slope is change in-- well change in f of x over change

119
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,780
in x, right?

120
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,110
So change in-- I mean it's
change in y over

121
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,250
change in x, right?

122
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,750
We could call this y instead.

123
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,730
So change in y-- let's see, 24 minus a-- and you might want

124
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,680
to review the slope video
if you forgot this.

125
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,360
24 minus a over the change
in x is 1 minus 0.

126
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,100
Well that's just 1.

127
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,800
So that equals 24
minus a, right?

128
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,310
And what's the slope
from these points?

129
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,080
Because we know it's constant.

130
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,810
We know the slope between these two points is going to

131
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,930
be the same as the slope between these two points.

132
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,900
Well, we do the same thing.

133
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:17,880
We take the end points' change in y, so it's b minus 24 over

134
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,770
change in x, 2 minus 1.

135
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,240
So that equals-- well that's
just 1, so that

136
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,660
equals b minus 24.

137
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,490
So this is the slope between these second two points, and

138
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,600
this the slope between
the first two points.

139
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,130
And since we know it's linear, since we know this is a linear

140
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,180
equation, we can say well they must be equal to each other.

141
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,630
So let's see if that gets us
to where we want to go.

142
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:53,760
So we know that 24 minus a is equal to b minus 24.

143
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,110
Let's add 24 to both sides.

144
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,760
You get 48 minus a
is equal to b.

145
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,600
I just added 24 to both sides.

146
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,110
And if we add a to both sides, I see the end point-- 48 is

147
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,980
equal to a plus b.

148
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,570
And that is choice C.

149
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,110
Let us move on.

150
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,430
And remember, all we did is we used this information, and we

151
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,160
used the fact that slope
is constant.

152
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,670
So the only thing that you would have had to know ahead

153
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,060
of time is the equation of the slope, and that's change in y

154
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,260
over change in x, and that linear means constant slope.

155
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,990
So they write a little
sequence up here,

156
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,500
this is number 13.

157
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,500
It's 3, 5, negative 5.

158
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,540
They say the first term in the sequence of the numbers shown

159
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,720
is 3-- that's obvious.

160
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,280
They show that.

161
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,880
Each even number term is 2 more than the previous term,

162
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,960
so we go from 3 to 5, that was 2 more, because this is the

163
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,630
second term, so it's an
even number term.

164
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,660
So this is 2 more.

165
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,350
And each odd number of term after the first is minus 1

166
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,330
times the previous.

167
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,160
So minus 1 times this
term is minus 5.

168
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,610
So that's what they're saying.

169
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,580
For example, the second term is 3 plus 2, and the third

170
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,640
term is minus 1 times 5.

171
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,240
What is the 55th term
of the sequence?

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,400
So on the SAT, whenever they ask you some crazy term, like

173
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,250
the 100th term or the 55th term, that a huge signal that

174
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,820
this sequence is probably going to repeat itself and you

175
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,010
just have to figure
out the pattern.

176
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,450
And then once you know that pattern I'll show you how to

177
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,710
figure out the 500th term
if you have to.

178
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,789
So with any sequence the best thing to do is just write out

179
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:43,210
a bunch of terms. So we start
at 3, we add 2, we get 5.

180
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,660
We multiply that
by negative 1.

181
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,145
This is plus 2.

182
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:51,450
So we multiply by negative
1, times negative 1,

183
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,130
we get minus 5.

184
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,970
Then we want to add 2.

185
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:01,350
So 2 times negative 5 is--
we're adding 2, right.

186
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,080
2 plus negative 5 is minus 3.

187
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,320
I think I'm already seeing
a pattern here.

188
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,500
And then we have to multiply
that times minus

189
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,430
1 times minus 1.

190
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,970
That's not x minus 1, this
is times minus 1.

191
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,640
So minus 1 times 3.

192
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,630
So minus 1 times 3-- I should
do minus 1 time instead.

193
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,460
Minus 1 times 3,
well that's 3.

194
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,310
And then we add 2 to it,
plus 2, we get 5.

195
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,120
And it's interesting, then it's
going to start repeating.

196
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,610
Minus 1 is minus 5.

197
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,660
So let's see what the repetition
looks like.

198
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,390
The first term is 3, the second
term is 5, the third

199
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:46,000
term is minus 5, the fourth
term is minus 3.

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,770
The fifth term is 3 again.

201
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,010
The sixth term is
5, 7 and so on.

202
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,930
I'm almost out of time.

203
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,130
I'll continue this in
the next video.
