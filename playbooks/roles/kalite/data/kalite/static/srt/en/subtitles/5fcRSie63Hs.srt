1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,880
Let's get going with more examples of function problems, and

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,200
hopefully as we keep doing
this, you're going to get

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,665
the idea of how all
this stuff works.

4
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:12,740
So let's do another problem.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,720
I'll use green this time.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,580
Let me clear everything.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,650
So I'll show you-- I showed you
that 1, you could define a

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,920
function as just kind of a
standard algebraic expression,

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,710
you could also do it a kind of
if number is odd, this is what

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,980
you do, if a number is
this, is what you do.

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,030
You could also define
a function visually.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,810
Let's say-- let me draw a
graph, and I'll use the line

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,060
tool so it's a reasonably
neat graph-- that's

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,480
the x-axis there.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,380
That's pretty good.

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,830
And let's draw the f of x-axis,
or you might be used to calling

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:54,650
that the y-axis, but-- OK.

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,492
I almost had it vertical,
but let's see.

19
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,490
Let's draw a few slashes here.

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,740
And a couple here, like this.

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,760
Sorry if you're getting bored
while I draw this graph.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,750
I should really have some
type of tool so that the

23
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,410
graphs just show up.

24
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:21,830
Let me draw a-- let's
say that-- let me

25
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,500
draw this function.

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,070
So this is what?

27
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,950
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, this is
negative 5, this is 5, this

28
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,770
is 5, this is negative 5.

29
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:38,410
And this is x-axis, and
this is-- we'll call

30
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,770
this the f of x-axis.

31
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,460
Now that might not seem obvious
to you at first, but all this

32
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,210
is saying is let's say when x
is equal to negative 5, this

33
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,450
function-- I'm creating a
function definition-- let's say

34
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:59,436
it equals 2, that's negative 1,
that stays the same, that stays

35
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:10,140
the same, then it goes to here,
and then it goes to here, to

36
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,830
here, and then-- let's see.

37
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,936
I hope I'm not boring you.

38
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,450
And it just keeps moving up.

39
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,910
Let me see, what would
this look like-- this

40
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,820
would look like this.

41
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,240
So if I-- you might think I'm
doing something very strange

42
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,930
right now, but just bear
with me while I draw this.

43
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,983
I hope I don't
mess up too much.

44
00:02:32,983 --> 00:02:35,640
And, see, one like that.

45
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,220
See one like that.

46
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,630
So we're like, Sal, this is a
very strange looking graph.

47
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,570
And it is.

48
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,820
But what this is, is this
is a function definition.

49
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,200
This tells you whenever I input
an x, at least for the x's that

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,660
we can see on the graph, this
graph tell me what

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,030
f of x equals.

52
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,830
So if x is equal to negative
5, f of x would equal plus 2.

53
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,230
And we could draw a
couple of examples.

54
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,550
f of 0, well we go to 0 on
the x-axis, and we say

55
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,840
f of 0 is equal to 0.

56
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,980
f of 1 is equal to-- well, we
go to x equal to 1, and we

57
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,800
just see where the chart is,
well, it equals negative 1.

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,620
I think you get the idea.

59
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,990
This isn't too difficult, but
this is a function definition.

60
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:27,960
So we've defined this graph
right here as f of x.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,330
So if that graph-- that's the
graph of f of x, and let's say

62
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:41,230
that we define g of x is equal
to f of x-- let's say

63
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:48,620
it's equal to f of x
squared minus f of x.

64
00:03:48,620 --> 00:04:03,090
And let's say that h of x
is equal to 3 minus x.

65
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:18,640
So what if I were to ask you,
what is h of g of negative 1?

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,120
So just like we did in the
previous problems, first we'll

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,590
say, well, let's try to figure
out what g of negative 1 is,

68
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,020
and then we can substitute
that into h of x.

69
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:35,130
So g of negative 1 is equal
to-- and this is how I do it.

70
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,390
There's no trick to it.

71
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,360
Wherever you see the x, you
just substitute it with the

72
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,940
number that you're saying
is now the value for x.

73
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,680
So you say, well, that's equal
to f of negative 1 squared

74
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,240
minus f of negative 1.

75
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,203
All I did is at g of negative
1, I just substituted

76
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:56,050
it wherever I saw an x.

77
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,190
Well what's f of negative 1?

78
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,740
Well, when x is equal
to negative 1, f of

79
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,620
x is equal to 1.

80
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,300
So f of negative 1-- let's
write that, f of negative

81
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,660
1 is equal to 1.

82
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,040
So g of negative 1 is equal
to-- well, that's just

83
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,940
1 squared minus 1,
well that equals 0.

84
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,050
Because f of negative 1 is
1, so it's 1 squared minus

85
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,020
1 that equals 1 minus 1.

86
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,500
0.

87
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,940
So g of negative 1 is
0, so this is the

88
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,410
same thing as h of 0.

89
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,070
Because g of negative 1,
we just figured out is 0.

90
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,960
h of 0, we just take that 0 and
substitute it here, so it's 3

91
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,600
minus 0, so that just equals 3.

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,660
And we solved the problem.

93
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,710
Let's do another example, and I
don't want to erase my graph

94
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,470
since I took four minutes to
actually draw it, let me

95
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,230
erase what we just did here.

96
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,500
And what you might want to do
after you watch it the first

97
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,710
time-- and this isn't true just
of this video, actually of all

98
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,080
the videos-- but especially the
functions, after watching it

99
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,890
once, you might want to rewatch
it and pause it right after I

100
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,380
give you the problem and try to
do it yourself, and then see--

101
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,600
and if you get stuck, you can
play it, or if you get an

102
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,150
answer, just you can play the
video and make sure that

103
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,630
we did the same way.

104
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,205
Let's see.

105
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,750
I'm going to create
another definition

106
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,640
for g of x this time.

107
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,565
Let's say that g of x-- oh
whoops, I was trying to write

108
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:38,440
in black-- let's say that
g of x is equal to f of x

109
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:51,000
squared plus f of x plus 2.

110
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:01,380
So now, in this case, what is
g of-- let's pick a random

111
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,320
number-- what is g of minus--
no, let's pick a, let's

112
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,760
say-- what is g of minus 2?

113
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,290
After we try and pick a
number that we could find

114
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,820
an actual solution for.

115
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,010
Well g of minus 2, wherever
we see the x, x is not

116
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,610
going to be minus 2.

117
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:25,230
That is equal to f of
minus 2 squared plus

118
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,080
f of minus 2 plus 2.

119
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,380
All we did is wherever we
saw an x, we substituted

120
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,090
it, minus 2 there.

121
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,120
And let's simplify that.

122
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,110
Well, f of minus 2 squared, we
know what minus 2 squared is,

123
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:45,270
that's the same thing as f of
4, plus f of minus 2 plus 2.

124
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,670
That's 0.

125
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,720
Plus f of 0.

126
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,680
And now we just figure out
what f of 4 and f of 0 is.

127
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,120
Well, f of 4, we go where x
equals r, it's right here,

128
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,220
and when x equals 4,
f of 4 is equal to 2.

129
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,210
So this is equal
to 2 plus f of 0.

130
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,710
And just as a reminder, this
is the definition of f.

131
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,560
We didn't define it in terms of
an algebraic expression, we

132
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,320
defined in terms of an
actual visual graph.

133
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,290
So what's f of 0? f of 0 is 0.

134
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,580
When x is equal to 0-- f of 0
is 0 so that's 2 plus 0-- so g

135
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,880
of negative 2 is equal to 2.

136
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,110
An interesting thing, you might
want to make problems like this

137
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,330
for yourself and keep
experimenting with different

138
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,420
types of functions, and a very
interesting thing would

139
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,870
actually be to graph g of x,
and actually that's a

140
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,670
good idea, I think.

141
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,510
I think maybe we'll do that in
the future modules to kind of

142
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,330
play with functions and
actually to try graph

143
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,090
the functions and see
how they turn out.

144
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,580
I will-- I don't know if I have
enough time-- actually, I'm

145
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,320
going to wait until the next
lecture to do a couple

146
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,250
more examples.

147
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,940
I want to do as many examples
on the functions as I can with

148
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,410
you, because I think as you
keep watching and watching the

149
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,220
function problems and seeing
more and more variations on

150
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,170
functions, you'll see both how
general of a concept this is,

151
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,900
and hopefully you'll get an
idea of how the functions
