1
00:00:00,466 --> 00:00:02,900
I'm Amy, and I work in the education department

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,033
And I am Anna and I am the curator of Native American Arts.

3
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:08,633
And we're standing in the Meso-American

4
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,600
and South American gallery.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,000
And we are looking at a gold vessel.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,933
Yes, this is actually from Peru,

7
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:21,318
and the culture would be Secan

8
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:24,533
and it is a gold vessel or beaker.

9
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:27,300
Now Secan, I don't see that on any other pieces.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,233
Is this the only Secan piece we have?

11
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:38,367
Yes this is the only one. It's related to other cultures within present-day Peru and along the

12
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:42,200
west coast of South America.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,133
And gold work in particular was something that metalsmiths excelled in.

14
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:52,685
So it's typical of cultures from that region

15
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,100
It's sort of a large piece in comparison

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,820
to some of the other vessels that I see in this gallery.

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:05,167
I think its impressive size is due to the fact that it would have been used by a very impressive person.

18
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:09,733
This would have been used by a high-ranking individual.

19
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:12,295
There would have been other vessels

20
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:13,567
made and used at the same time,

21
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,200
but they would have been made

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,300
out of different materials according

23
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,974
to who they were made for.

24
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:19,900
So-- Actually, yeah

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,467
All over the gallery there's a

26
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:22,990
lot of ceramic.

27
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,233
Ceramic, and you would have also

28
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:27,733
had wood beakers or drinking vessels

29
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,833
That is its purpose, this is

30
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,567
actually a vessel to be used in the

31
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,300
consumption of Chicha or

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,900
maize beer, or corn beer.

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,569
Would that taste anything like beer today?

34
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,367
I don't know.

35
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,633
It's definitely, was an alcoholic,

36
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:46,467
is an alcoholic beverage

37
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:50,367
and was consumed on ceremonial occasions

38
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:55,067
Perhaps a political event or occurrence

39
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:58,167
Now, it's face-up at us,but

40
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,421
it's actually upside-down--Yes--so

41
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,233
that seems kind of strange.

42
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:05,867
Yes, well, I think it's linked to the

43
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:07,804
consumption of what would be inside of it.

44
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:10,133
And you wouldn't be able to see

45
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,733
the figure right-side-up until

46
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,300
you were finished drinking what

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,567
was inside the vessel.

48
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,033
So there is even more motivation

49
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,200
to get to the bottom? (Laughs)

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,933
Well, and I think there's also a spiritual aspect

51
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,067
to this being that's depicted in repuse

52
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,800
on the surface of this.

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,033
You see those two kind of stylized eyes

54
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,650
and there's a mouth, perhaps with the tongue

55
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,800
indicated sticking out through the teeth.

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,900
Yes, actually that mouth is really

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,267
interesting, it almost looks like it has fangs.

58
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:43,233
It does! (Laughs) And then there are ears indicated,

59
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,600
and the figure is also

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,413
shown wearing adornment in the ears

61
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:51,833
in the form of ear plugs or ear flares.

62
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,233
So this was a particular deity?

63
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:56,733
It's been referred to as the Secan lord,

64
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:58,600
or Secan deity.

65
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,167
It has like this, interesting three-tiered neck

66
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,933
Is that to keep it standing, or...?

67
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,967
It's probably just decorative,

68
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:10,867
and also a little bit of the metalsmith

69
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,820
kind of showing off their skills on how

70
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,700
to work with the material.

71
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,900
How did they work with the material?

72
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,233
Well, this would have been possibly

73
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:23,342
pounded over a form or a mold, but also

74
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:26,533
would have been hand-worked as well.

75
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:29,667
This particular gold is probably an alloy

76
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,600
of gold and other materials, and we know

77
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,319
that in part because of the coloration

78
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,600
that appears on the surface. You

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,433
can see the kind of a red color coming through.

80
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:42,100
And when you say it could have been

81
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,890
pounded over a mold,

82
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,817
would that have been a mold made

83
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:46,200
out of clay, or made out of wood?

84
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,544
Probably wood, (Wood) and the metalsmiths

85
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:51,867
enjoyed working with this alloy,

86
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,433
because it made it a softer material

87
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,267
and more easily workable than

88
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:58,467
solid gold would be.

89
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,800
Okay. And why-- how has this survived,

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,393
because there was a lot of pillaging, right?

91
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,367
Well, it's quite remarkable actually,

92
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:08,033
that a piece of gold survived the Spanish,

93
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:10,233
who came through and melted down, you

94
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,310
know, hundreds of thousands of pounds

95
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,567
of gold to finance their--

96
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,200
Right, this is a large piece!

97
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,933
Well, it probably survives because it

98
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,867
would have most likely been buried

99
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:23,734
with someone, as an accompaniment

100
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:24,802
for the afterlife.

101
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:26,367
So probably with its owner, this

102
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,400
would have been one of the riches

103
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,233
that not only did he have with him in,

104
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:35,600
in his real life on Earth, but also in

105
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,910
the afterlife and the spiritual world.

106
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,149
And a thousand years later, here it is!

107
00:04:41,149 --> 99:59:59,999
Here it is! Right here in the gallery.
