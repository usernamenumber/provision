1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,790
Let's see if we can tackle a
more complicated partial

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,950
fraction decomposition problem.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:15,386
I have 10x squared plus 12x
plus 20, all of that over

4
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:18,630
x to the third minus 8.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,050
The first thing to do with any
of these rational expressions

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,920
that you want to decompose is
to just make sure that the

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,180
numerator is of a lower degree
than the denominator, and if

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,260
it's not, then you just do the
algebraic long division like

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,350
we did in the first video.

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,660
But here, you can do
from [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,290
the highest degree term here is
a second-degree term, here it's

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,990
a third-degree term,
so we're cool.

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,470
This is a lower degree
than that one.

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,570
If it was the same or higher,
we would do a little

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,790
long division.

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,500
The next thing to do, if we're
going to decompose this into

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,480
its components, we have to
figure out the factors of the

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,090
denominator right here, so that
we can use those factors as the

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,440
denominators in each of the
components, and a third-degree

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,690
polynomial is much, much, much
harder to factor than

21
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,850
a second-degree
polynomial, normally.

22
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,990
But in this case, there's
something that should hopefully

23
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,370
pop out at you-- if it doesn't
immediately, hopefully what I'm

24
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,890
about to say will make it pop
out at you in the future-- is

25
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,880
you should always think about
what number, when you

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,030
substitute into a polynomial,
will make it equal to 0.

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,420
And in this case, what to the
third power minus 8 equals 0?

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,310
And hopefully 2
pops out at you.

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,310
And this is something
you can only do really

30
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,840
through inspection or
through experience.

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,450
And you'll immediately see 2 to
the third minus 8 is 0, so 2 is

32
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:39,890
a 0 of this, or 2 makes this
expression 0, and that tells us

33
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,680
that x minus 2 is a factor.

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,940
So we can rewrite this right
here as 10x squared plus 12x

35
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:55,060
plus 20 over x minus 2
times something something

36
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,810
something something.

37
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,680
We don't know what that
something is yet.

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,420
And I just want to hit the
point home of why this

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,990
is true, or what the
intuition vibe has true.

40
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,600
If 2 makes this 0, 2 should
also make the factored

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,700
expression 0.

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,260
And we know that 2 would make
this factored expression 0,

43
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,920
because when you put a 2 right
here, this factor become 0, so

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,750
it'll make the whole thing 0.

45
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,140
And so that's why, that's the
intuition where, if you

46
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,760
substitute a number here and it
makes this 0, you do x minus

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,490
that number here, and we
know that that will be

48
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,590
a factor of the thing.

49
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,300
Well, anyway, the next step if
we really want to decompose

50
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,590
this rational expression is to
figure out what this part of it

51
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,790
is, and the way to do that is
with algebraic long division.

52
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,770
We essentially just divide x
minus 2 into x to the third

53
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,620
minus 8 to get this,
so let's do that.

54
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:50,790
So you get x minus 2 goes into
x to the third-- and actually,

55
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,050
what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to write-- I leave space

56
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,330
for the second-degree term,
which is 0, the first-degree

57
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,940
term, and then minus 8 is the
constant term, so minus 8-- I

58
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,170
like to put all my degree terms
in their appropriate columns.

59
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,570
You don't have to when you
do algebraic long division.

60
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,590
So x minus 2 goes into x to the
third, or x goes into x to

61
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,370
the third, how many times?

62
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,330
You just have to look at
the highest degree terms.

63
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,530
Well it goes into it x squared
times-- I'll put it in the x

64
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,680
squared column-- x squared
times x minus 2, x squared

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,930
times x is x to the third, x
squared times minus 2

66
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,540
is minus 2x squared.

67
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,680
And now we want to subtract
that from that, so I could

68
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,000
just-- or I could add the
negative, I always find that

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,020
easier-- so these cancel out,
so I'm left with 2x

70
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,620
squared minus 8.

71
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,400
How many times does x minus 2
go into 2x squared minus 8?

72
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,610
You just look at the highest
degree terms, x goes into 2x

73
00:03:50,610 --> 00:04:00,980
squared 2x times, so plus 2x,
2x times x is 2x squared, 2x

74
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,700
times minus 2 is minus 4x.

75
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,000
Subtract that from that, so we
could-- or we could just add

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,560
the negative-- and then we have
4x minus 8, x goes into 4x four

77
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,560
times, 4 times x minus 2 is
4x minus 8, and there's no

78
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,830
remainder, and this is further
confirmation that x minus 2

79
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,720
definitely was a factor of x to
the third minus 8 and the other

80
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,950
factor is this right here.

81
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,290
x squared plus 2x plus 4 times
x minus 2 is equal to x

82
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,470
to the third minus 8.

83
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,080
So now we can write
our original problem.

84
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,590
   

85
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,330
Actually, let me write-- well,
let me write it down here.

86
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,180
What was it, it was 10-- let me
switch to another color-- it

87
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:06,110
was 10x squared-- I have a bad
memory-- plus 12x plus 20, over

88
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,610
x minus 2 times-- what was
that-- x squared

89
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,960
plus 2x plus 4.

90
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,025
   

91
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:21,180
So all the work we did so far
is just to factor out that x to

92
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,450
the third minus 8, but now we
can actually do some partial

93
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,230
fraction expansion, or partial
fraction decomposition.

94
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,020
So this is going to be equal
to-- and this is the

95
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,630
interesting point-- this is
where we diverge or advance

96
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,240
a little bit from what we
did in the first video.

97
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,840
This is going to be equal to a
constant over this denominator,

98
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,260
over x minus 2, plus-- and this
is a little different than what

99
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,785
you were going to see, what you
saw in the last video-- plus an

100
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:52,790
x-term, some coefficient times
an x-term, plus c, so

101
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,340
bx plus c, over this.

102
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,510
x squared plus 2x plus 4.

103
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,550
And you might say, Sal, how
did you know to do that?

104
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,180
Well, what you do is
you look at the degree

105
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,990
of the denominator.

106
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,420
This is a first-degree
denominator, and you say, OK.

107
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,930
The degree of the numerator in
this part of the fraction, I

108
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,960
guess you could call it, is
going to be 1 less than that.

109
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,440
So this first degree-- so this
is going to be a 0-degree or a

110
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,300
constant term-- Here
the degree is 2.

111
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,640
The degree is 2, so the degree
of its numerators is going to

112
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,730
be 1, and since its degree is 1
it could still have a constant

113
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,660
term, which is a 0-degree
term, so you get bx plus c.

114
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,110
And you know, maybe it does end
up just being a constant, in

115
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,060
which case we can solve for
b and it'll just be 0.

116
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,600
And actually, there's another
thing you might be asking, is

117
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,470
hey, why don't we factor this
further, and you can try,

118
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,980
but if you look at it by
inspection, you could kind of

119
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,030
in your head do the quadratic
formula and you'll see that you

120
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,720
only get imaginary roots here.

121
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,830
So this actually isn't more--
this isn't factorable

122
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,070
in the reals anymore.

123
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,140
There no more real 0's to this.

124
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,770
So we have factored this
as much as we can.

125
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,030
So the key now to complete our
partial fraction expansion is

126
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,500
to just solve for the a, b's,
and c's, and we'll do it

127
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,660
exactly the same way we
did it in the last video.

128
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,710
So what we want to do
is essentially add

129
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,090
these two things.

130
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,050
So if we add-- let me write
this on the left hand side-- so

131
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:21,890
10x squared plus 12x plus 20,
over x minus 2 times x squared

132
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:27,170
plus 2x plus 4, is equal to--
if we add these two things, we

133
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,010
want to get a common
denominator, which is x minus 2

134
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:36,340
times x squared plus 2x plus 4,
just multiply the two things,

135
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,290
and that'll be, when we add the
common denominator, then it's a

136
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:51,200
times this, x squared plus 2x
plus 4, plus bx plus c, times

137
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,080
this, times x minus 2.

138
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,630
Well the denominators are the
same, so the numerators have to

139
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:05,030
equal each other, so we have--
I'll rewrite it-- 10x squared

140
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:15,500
plus 12x plus 20 is equal to a
times x squared plus 2x plus 4

141
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:22,200
plus bx plus c, all of
that times x minus 2.

142
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,170
This might look like a hairy
problem, and if you do it kind

143
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,775
of the slow way that I do in
the last video, it would take

144
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:30,240
you forever, it would be three
equations and three unknowns,

145
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,130
very very hairy, but we can do
as a system pretty much the

146
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,080
same way we did it
the first one.

147
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,600
Let's pick x values that
simplify this and allow us to

148
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,910
solve for one of these a, b's,
or c's at a time, and the

149
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,430
immediate thing is what can I--
what x value can I substitute

150
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,030
that will cancel out at
least two of the variables,

151
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,460
two of the a, b, or c,?

152
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,410
And if I put x is equal to 2,
then this thing becomes 0,

153
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,260
which will make this whole
expression 0, and I'll just be

154
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,040
left with an a and the x's,
which I'll know is 2, because

155
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,930
I'm picking x to be equal
to 2, so let's do that.

156
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:05,220
So if x is equal to 2,
then what do I get?

157
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,270
I get 10x squared, so I get 10
times 4, that's 2 squared, plus

158
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:18,850
12 times 2, which is 24, plus
20, is equal to a times 2

159
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,020
squared is 4, plus 4, plus 4.

160
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,980
And then all of this just
becomes 0, because I

161
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,860
picked x is equal to 2.

162
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,780
So this is what, 10 times 4 is
40, plus 44, that's 84, is

163
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:43,230
equal to 12a, divide both sides
by 12, we get a is equal to 7.

164
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,920
We're making progress.

165
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,820
So now let's see.

166
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,530
We know what a is, can we
pick any other x values that

167
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,570
will make the b disappear?

168
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,720
Or the c.

169
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,050
Well, we can make the b
disappear if we make x is equal

170
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,470
to 0, so let's try that out.

171
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,910
So if we say-- let me pick a
new, vibrant color, a yellow--

172
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,840
if we make x equal to 0, then
the left hand side of this,

173
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,780
this is 0,0, we just left
with-- we're just left with 20,

174
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:18,640
is equal to a, which is just 7,
times 0 plus 0 plus 4, 7 times

175
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,160
4, plus-- bx plus c, the bx
just disappears because b times

176
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:32,970
0 is 0, plus c times 0 minus 2,
c times minus 2-- scroll down a

177
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:39,700
little bit-- so we get 20 is
equal to 28 minus 2c, subtract

178
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,930
28 from both sides, minus 8 is
equal to minus 2c,

179
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,580
c is equal to 4.

180
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,560
We're almost done.

181
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,780
Now let me rewrite our equation
up here, with the a's, and

182
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,290
let me see if I can do this.

183
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:55,630
All right.

184
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:06,580
So now I have 10x squared plus
12x plus 20 is equal to 7, 7

185
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:17,340
times x squared plus 2x plus 4
plus bx plus c is 4,

186
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,040
times x minus 2.

187
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,270
Almost ran out of space.

188
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,280
So now we have x's and b's, so
to solve for b, we can really

189
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,310
just substitute any value of x
that makes our math reasonably

190
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,080
easy that doesn't make
the b disappear.

191
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,160
So we can't pick x is equal to
0, but a good number is 1, so

192
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:41,140
if x is equal to 1, we have 10
plus 12 plus 20 is equal to 7

193
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:48,650
times 1, plus 2 plus 4, that's
7, plus b times 1 is just b,

194
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:54,300
plus 4, times 1 minus
2, is minus 1.

195
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:04,400
So this is 22, 42 is equal to
49 minus b minus 4-- see, you

196
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,950
can, I don't want to mess up
the math-- so we can say 42 is

197
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:17,060
equal to 45 minus b, subtract
45 from both sides, you get

198
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:22,110
minus 3 is equal to minus b,
and we get b is equal to 3,

199
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,650
divide both sides by minus 1.

200
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,940
And so on our original problem
up here, we now know that b is

201
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:37,150
equal to 3, c was equal to
4, and a is equal to 7.

202
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,510
So the partial fraction
decomposition of this, we're

203
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:48,200
now done, is 7 over x minus
2 plus 3x plus 4, over x

204
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,830
squared plus 2x plus 4.

205
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,400
Well, that was a pretty tiring
problem, and you can see, the

206
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,150
partial fraction decomposition
becomes a lot more complicated

207
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,090
when you have a higher degree
denominators, but hopefully you

208
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,180
found that a little bit useful.
