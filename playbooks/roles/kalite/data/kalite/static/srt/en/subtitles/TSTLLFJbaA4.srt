1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's think about the market for a certain type of bush

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or a certain type of tree that people can plant in their gardens.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Here is our quantity of that tree planted each year

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1 mln, 2 mln,

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe this is nationwide, these are fairly large numbers for a particular type of tree.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4 mln and so forth and so on...

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then, let me put the price.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the quantity per year planted in our country.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And over here, this is going to be our dollars per tree.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And maybe this is ten dollars, this is twenty,

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is thirty, this is forty.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And our marginal cost curve or our supply curve would look

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just to even get that first tree planted,

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to get someone to plant it, and grow it, and then replant it in your garden

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you are gonna have to pay them at least ten dollars.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then each incremental tree is getting a little bit more expensive

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so our marginal cost curve will look something like that.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's our marginal cost or supply curve.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then our demand curve.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That very first tree, someone is gonna get a huge benefit from it.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then each incremental tree, people might get a little bit lower and lower benefits,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it might look something like this.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Our demand curve will look like that.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Demand.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the market for a certain nice tree.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Nice tree.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you just let the market happen the way it's happening right over here

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we get to a very natural equilibrium quantity.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It looks like it's about 2.7 mln trees planted per year.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Our equilibrium price is about twenty dollars per tree.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We generate all of this total surplus,

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's split essentially between the consumers - the people who are buying the trees

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the people who are producing the trees.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, let's say that a research study comes out

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this particular breed of trees, the "nice tree", it turns out it has all of these benefits to it.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say that it is somehow related to pest control.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe all the pests that people don't like,

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when they eat this bark they go away or something like that.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The mosquitoes go away and you get less disease.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say it also improves air quality.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And, let's say, on top of that, it's just nice-looking.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So even if it's not your tree, you pass it by in the neighbourhood

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it just calms your nerves and makes you feel better about the world.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they are just nice to look at.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this study that this researchers conducted,

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they determined that the benefit of all of these things - of the pest control, the air quality

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and just the aesthetic benefit of society at large

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
comes out over the life of a tree to ten dollars a tree.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it is ten dollars per tree benefit.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they are essentially saying that above and beyond the benefit that the owner of the garden gets,

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there is a societal, there is an external benefit.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you can imagine, when we are talking about positive externalities.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There is an external benefit of planting the tree that amounts to ten dollars per tree.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So how would we factor that in?

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How do we determine if, just given this equilibrium price and quantity,

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
whether we do really have the optimum numer of trees in society?

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the last few videos we had the negative externality.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We had an external cost and so we added that cost to the cost curve.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we have an external benefit.

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have a positive externality.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we can add this benefit to the marginal benefit curve.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Essentially, this is the benefit that the buyers of the tree are getting

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and to that let's add the benefit that society is getting.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So society is getting ten dollars more benefit.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So these 4 mln of trees or it's actually a little bit lower,

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it looks like about 3.5 mln, there is ten dollars of benefit.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But if you combine it with society's benefit, so another ten dollars,

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you would get up here.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
At this frst tree it looks almost fifty dollars of benefit,

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but if you add society's benefit, it is actually closer to sixty dollars of benefit.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so you are essentially taking this demand curve

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you are shifting it up by ten dollars

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when you are factoring in the benefit to society.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You could call this the marginal benefit plus the external benefit curve.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's factoring in all of the benefit that society is getting by these trees planted.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But when you look at that curve, you get a slightly different equilibrium price.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The equilibrium price goes all the way out here.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So now the equilibrium price goes up to this.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Equilibrium price looks closer. Instead of twenty dollars, it's twenty seven dollars

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the quantity actually produced looks closer to 3.3 mln.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we just let the market happen without factoring in this benefit in some way,

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are essentially leaving on the table all of this surplus that could have happened.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we just let the market settle in on its natural equilibrium price and equilirium quantity,

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are gonna produce this 2.7 mln.

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so the total benefit to society is going to be this whole curve.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or you could say,the society's benefit is going to be this right over here.

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The consumers' benefit is going to be this part right over here.

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Actually, this part all the way over here, because our equilibrium prices get right over there.

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The producers' surplus is that right over there.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we are leaving some societal benefit on the table.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you think about it from society's point of view,

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can view this orange area as the deadweight loss.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are leaving that on the table if we don't somehow create an incentive

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for more of these trees to be produced.

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In this situation, a way to make the optimal quantity produced

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in order for society get this surplus, what they could do is...

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the case of a negative externality we imposed a tax that factors in the negative externality

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
... now we could put some type of a subsidy.

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We could say:"Hey, if you plant a tree, buy and plant some of these trees,

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you will get a ten dolar tax credit."

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's essentially saying, whoever plants one of these trees

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
their taxes are going to be ten dollars lower than what they would have otherwise had paid.

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Essentially, they are saying:"Look, whatever benefit you are gonna get from the tree,

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are gonna give you ten dollars more benefit for that."

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so you are essentially making sure that the optimal quantity is being produced.

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In that circumstance, you are essentially giving all of the marginal benefit,

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that extra ten benefit, you are giving it to the people are planting the trees.

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All of this becomes their benefit as well, because they are going to get the ten dollars.

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But the good thing is at least that positive surplus is oing to someone.

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's not being lost. You are not giving up on this orange area right over there.
