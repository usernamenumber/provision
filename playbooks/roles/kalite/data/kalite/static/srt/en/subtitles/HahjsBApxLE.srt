1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As promised, lets do a couple of

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
simple Snell's Law examples.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets say

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lets say that I have

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lets say that I have two, two media.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I guess the plural of Medium's.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets say that I have air right here.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Air

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then right here is the surface

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is the surface.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me do that in a more appropriate color.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That is the surface of...

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the Water!

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this right here is the surface of water.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I know that I have a light ray.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I have a light ray.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Coming in, with an incident angle of

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it has an incident angle, so relative to the perpendicular

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It has an incident angle of, of 35째.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what I want to know is, I want to know what the

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
angle of refraction will be.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it will refract a little bit, it will bend inwards a little bit.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Since this outside's going to be in the air a little longer if you

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
buy into my 'car traveling into the mud' analogy.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, It will then bend a little bit.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And i wanna figure out what this new angle will be.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I wanna figure out the angle of refraction.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll call that 'theta 2'

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is this?

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so we can just, this is just straight up applying Snell's Law.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'm going to use the version with the

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Using the refraction indices.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Since we have a table here from the ck12.org flexbook.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
On the refraction indices.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can go get it, uh, for free if you like.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that just tells us

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That just tells us that the refraction index for

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The first medium, so, that is air.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The refraction index for air times the sine of the incident angle

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In this case its 35째

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Is going to be equal to the refraction index for water

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Is going to be equal to the refraction index for water

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Times the sine of this angle right over here.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Times the sine of 'theta 2'

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we know what the refraction index for air

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and for water is

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then we just have to solve for 'theta 2'

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets just do that.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The refraction index for air is

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This number right over here, 1.00029.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So its going to be 1.00-theres only, theres three zeros

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1.00029 times the sine of 35째

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Is going to be equal to the refraction index for water

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which is 1.33, so its 1.33 times sine, times sine of 'theta 2'

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we can devide both sides of the equation by 1.33

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We divide one, both sides by 1.33

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
On this side we are just left with

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sine of theta 2

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the left hand side, lets get our calculator out for this

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let me get the handy calculator

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we want to calculate, and i made sure my calculator

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is in degree mode

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1.00029 times the sine of 35째

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So thats the numerator, of this expression right here.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The green part. Thats 0.5737, divided by 1.33.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Im just dividing by the numerator here.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This, when you just do, divide this "Ans", it means your last answer.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So thats this numerator up here divided by that denominator.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so I get 0.4314. I'll just round a little bit.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I'll get, so I get. I'll switch colors.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
0.4314 is equal to sine of 'theta 2'

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And now to solve for theta, you just have to take the inverse sine

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of both sides of this. So you get the inverse

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you get the inverse sine- this doesn't mean sine to the -1.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You could also do as the arc-sine.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The sine inverse of 0.4314 is going to be equal to the inverse sine

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of sine is just the angle itself.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or, i gues when we're dealing with, uh, When we're dealing with angles

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in a normal range, its going to be the angle itself.

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And thats going to be the case with this right over here.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if any of that is confusing, you might want to reveiw

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The videos on the inverse sine and the inverse cosine.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they are in the trigonometry playlist
