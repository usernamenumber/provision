1
00:00:00,998 --> 00:00:03,367
What I want to do in this video is revisit a little bit

2
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:06,366
of what we know about pi and really how we measure

3
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:10,253
angles and radians and then think about whether pi

4
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:14,559
is necessarily the best number to be paying attention to.

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,974
So let's think a little bit about what I just said.

6
00:00:16,974 --> 00:00:23,057
So pi we know is defined -- I'll write defined as a triple equal sign,

7
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:24,311
I guess you could call it that way.

8
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:28,491
Pi is defined as the ratio of the circumference of a circle

9
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:32,410
to its diameter, which is the same thing as the ratio

10
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:36,246
of the circumference of the circle to two times the radius

11
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:40,751
and from that we get all these interesting formulas that you get

12
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:41,912
in geometry class.

13
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:45,116
If you've got the radius and you want to calculate the circumference

14
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:50,225
multiply both sides of this definition by two times the radius

15
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:54,311
and you get two times the radius times pi is equal to the

16
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:59,327
circumference or more familiarly it would be

17
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:05,550
circumference is equal to two pi r.

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,408
This is one of those fundamental things that you learn

19
00:01:07,408 --> 00:01:11,308
early on in your career and you use it to find circumferences usually,

20
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:13,630
or figure out radiuses if you know the circumference.

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,553
And from that comes how we measure our angles in radians

22
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:20,968
once we got to trigonometry class. And just as a

23
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:25,380
review here, so let me draw myself a circle...

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,420
Let me draw myself a better circle...

25
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:36,061
So there is my--it'll do the job-- and here is the positive x axis and

26
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:39,823
let me make some angle here. I'll make the angle kind of obvious

27
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:44,234
just so that it ... so let me make this angle.

28
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:49,668
And the way that we measure angles when we talk about radians

29
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:52,733
we're really talking about the angles subtended by something of

30
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:55,659
a certain arc length. And we measure the arc length in --

31
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:59,978
well, the way I like to think about it is -- the angle is in radians

32
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:04,389
and the arc length itself is in radiuses, which isn't really

33
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:08,337
a word but that's how I think about it. How many radiuses

34
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:12,888
is this arc length that subtends the angle in radians?

35
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:15,488
So let me show you what I'm talking about.

36
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:21,851
So, this arc length right here, if the radius is r, what is the length

37
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:26,913
of this arc length? Well, we know from basic geometry, the entire

38
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,303
circumference over here is going to be 2 pi r.

39
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:33,832
This entire circumference that's-- really by definition--

40
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:36,758
this entire circumference is going to be 2 pi r. So what is

41
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:40,009
just this arc length here? I'm assuming this is the fourth of

42
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:45,256
the circle, so it's going to be 2 pi r over four. So this arc

43
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:52,315
length over here, this arc length is going to be 2 pi r over four,

44
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:57,749
which is the same thing as pi over 2r or you could say this is

45
00:02:57,749 --> 00:03:03,647
the same thing as pi over 2 radiuseseses.

46
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:06,665
One of those -- y'know, not a real word but that's how I like

47
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:10,798
to think about it or you could say it subtends an angle of

48
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:18,972
pi over 2 radians. So over here, theta is pi over 2 radians.

49
00:03:18,972 --> 00:03:22,408
And so, really when you're measuring angles in radians,

50
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:24,916
it's really you're saying "okay, that angle is subtanded by

51
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:29,421
an arc of --that has a length of how many radiusi...or

52
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:32,068
I don't even know what the plural of radius is...

53
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:36,387
Actually I think it's "radii" but it's fun to try to say radiuses.

54
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:39,405
"Radii", actually I should do that, just so no one says "Sal, you're

55
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:42,006
teaching people the wrong plural form of radius!"

56
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:47,393
"Radii". So this arc length is pi over 2 radii and

57
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:53,244
it subtends an angle of pi over 2 radians. We could do

58
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:56,820
another one just for the sake of making the point clear...

59
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,839
If you went all the way around the circle-- so if you

60
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,811
went all the way around the circle and you got back

61
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:06,573
to the positive x axis here, what is the arc length?

62
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:10,474
Now all of a sudden the arc length is the entire circumference

63
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:14,142
of the circle, it would be 2 pi r, which is the same thing as

64
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:20,737
2 pi radii and we would say that the angle subtended

65
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:24,037
by this arc length, the angle that we care about

66
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:30,528
going all the way around the circle, is 2 pi radians.

67
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,813
And so, out of this comes all of the things

68
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:37,400
that we know about how do we graph trigonometric

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,667
functions or at least how we measure the graph

70
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:43,082
on the x axis and I also touch on Euler's formula,

71
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,200
which is the most beautiful formula, I think, in all of mathematics.

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,867
And let's visit those right now, just to remind

73
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:52,933
ourselves of how pi fits into all of that. So if I think about our

74
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:55,933
trigonometric functions, remember, if this was a lesson

75
00:04:55,948 --> 00:04:58,333
on trigonometric functions, we assume we have a

76
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,800
unit circle here. So on the trig. functions, this is the

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,600
unit circle definition of the trig functions, this is a nice

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,467
review of all of that. You assume you have a unit circle,

79
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:12,800
a circle of radius 1 and then the trig functions are defined as

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,667
for any angle you have here, for any angle theta,

81
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:21,867
cosine of theta is how far you have to move in...

82
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:28,267
or the x coordinate of the point along the arc that subtans this

83
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:32,067
angle, so that's cosine of theta and then sine of theta is

84
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:42,600
the y value of that point. Cosine of theta is the x value,

85
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,667
sine of theta is the y value. And so if you were to graph

86
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:53,667
one of these functions, and I'll just do sine of theta for convenience,

87
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:56,867
but you can try it with cosine of theta... so let's

88
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:59,533
graph sine of theta. Let's do one revolution of sine

89
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:05,000
of theta. And we tend to label, so when then angle is 0,

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,800
sine of theta is zero -- let me draw the x and y axis

91
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,000
just so you remember this, this is the y axis and this is the

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,867
x axis, right here is x axis. So when the angle is 0,

93
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:22,600
we're right here on the unit circle, the y value there is

94
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,000
0, so sine of theta is going to be right like that, so let

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,733
me draw it like this...

96
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:31,333
so this is out theta and this is -- i'm going to graph

97
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,000
sine of theta along the y axis, we'll say y is equal

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to sine of theta in this graph that i'm drawing right

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,333
over here. And then we could do, i'll just do the simple points

100
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:46,267
here, then if we make the angle go-- if we did in degrees

101
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:50,000
90 degrees, or if we do it in radians, pi over 2 radians

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
what is sine of theta?

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,733
Well, now it is one, this is a unit circle, it has radius one

104
00:06:54,733 --> 00:07:00,200
so when we get to pi over 2, when theta is equal to pi over 2

105
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:06,333
then sine of theta is equal to 1. This is 1 right here,

106
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:11,800
sine of theta is equal to one, then if we go 180 degrees

107
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,867
or halfway around the circle, theta is now equal to pi.

108
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:27,200
When theta is equal to pi, the y value of

109
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,933
this point right here is once again zero, so we go back

110
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:32,800
to zero, remember we're talking about sine of theta,

111
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,933
and then we can go all the way down here, where you

112
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:40,267
can either view it 270 degrees or you can view this as

113
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:52,000
3 pi over 2 radians. So this is in radians, this axis.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,533
So 3 pi over 2 radians, sine of theta is the

115
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,600
y coordinate on the unit circle right over here so it's going

116
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,200
to be negative 1, so this is negative 1. And then

117
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,010
finally, when you go all the way around the circle, you've

118
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:13,467
gone 2 pi radians and you're back where you began

119
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:16,200
and the sine of theta or the y coordinate is now 0

120
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,267
once again. And if you connect the dots or if

121
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:22,867
you plotted more points, you would see a sine curve over

122
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,600
just the part that we've graphed right over here.

123
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,333
So that's another application. You say "hey, Sal,

124
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,400
where's this going?". Well i'm showing you, i'm reminding

125
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,267
you of all of these things because we're going to revisit

126
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:34,600
it with a different number other than pi.

127
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,200
And so i want to do one last visit with pi, you say

128
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,333
"Look, pi is powerful because, or one of the reasons pi

129
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,333
seems to have some type of mystical power, and we've

130
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,800
shown this in the calculus playlist,

131
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:52,800
is there's Euler's formula. e to the i theta is equal

132
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,533
to cosine of theta plus i sine of theta. This by

133
00:08:56,533 --> 00:09:00,067
itself is just one of those mind-boggling formulas, but

134
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:02,467
it sometimes looks even more mind-boggling when

135
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:06,600
you put pi in for theta, because then from Euler's

136
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,000
formula you would get e to the i pi is equal to

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,667
--what's cosine of pi? cosine of pi is negative 1,

138
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:18,600
and then sine of pi is zero, so zero times i, so you get

139
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,800
this formula, which is pretty profound and then you say

140
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,600
"okay, if i want to put all of the fundamental numbers

141
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,667
together in one formula, i can add one to both sides of this

142
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:36,400
and you get e to the i pi plus 1 is equal to 0.

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,867
Sometimes this is called Euler's identity, the most

144
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:41,800
beautiful formula or equation in all of mathematics

145
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,533
and it is pretty profound, you have all of the fundamental

146
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:48,733
numbers in one equation - e, i, pi, 1, 0. Although

147
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:52,000
for my aesthetic taste it would've been even

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,400
more powerful if this was a one right over here.

149
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,175
Because this e to the i pi, this bizarre thing, would've

150
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,400
equaled unity. That would've been super-duper profound

151
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,667
to me. It seems a little bit of a hack to add one to both

152
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,933
sides, "oh look, now i have zero here",

153
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:15,200
but this is pretty darn good. But with that, i'm going

154
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,867
to make, well, i'm not going to argue for it, i'm going

155
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,733
to show an argument for another number, a number

156
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:24,133
different than pi. And i want to make it clear, that

157
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:28,733
these ideas are not my own, it's inspired by many people

158
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:31,333
are on this movement now, the Tau movement, but these

159
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:35,400
are kind of the people that gave me the thinking on this

160
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,533
and first is Robert Palais on "Pi is wrong!" and he doesn't

161
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:41,067
argue that pi is calculated wrong, he still

162
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:43,800
agrees that it is the ratio of the circumference to the

163
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,200
diameter of the circle, that it's 3.14159. But what he's

164
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,133
saying is that we're paying attention to the wrong number.

165
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:53,133
And also you have Michael Hartl, the "Tau manifesto"

166
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:56,533
all of this is available online. And what they argue for

167
00:10:56,533 --> 00:11:00,067
is a number called tau, or what they call tau

168
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:03,400
And they define tau, and it's a very simple change from pi,

169
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,933
they define tau not as the ratio of the

170
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,867
circumference to the diameter, the ratio of circumference

171
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,867
to two times the radius, they say "Hey, wouldn't it

172
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:13,200
be natural to define some number that's the

173
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,733
ratio of circumference to the radius?" And as you

174
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:21,667
see here, this pi is just one half times this over here, right?

175
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,467
Circumference over 2 r, it's the same thing as

176
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:26,867
one half times circumference over r, so pi is just

177
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:31,533
half of tau, or another way to think about it is that tau

178
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:36,667
is just two times pi or, if you -- and i'm sure

179
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:38,733
you probably don't have this memorized, because, like

180
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:41,667
"wait, i've spent all my life memorizing pi", but it's

181
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:47,318
6.283185 and it keeps going on and on and on never

182
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:52,067
repeating just like pi, it's two times pi. And so you're

183
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:57,800
saying "hey, Sal, pi has been around for millenia, really,

184
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,600
why mess with such a fundamental number, especially

185
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,400
when you've just spent all of this time showing how

186
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
profound it is?" And the argument that they'd make

187
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,733
and it seems like a pretty good argument, is that

188
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:10,467
actually things seem a little bit more elegant when you

189
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:13,733
pay attention to this number instead of half of this number

190
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,867
when you pay attention to tau. And to see that let's

191
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:20,133
revisit everything that we did here. Now all of a sudden,

192
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:24,800
if you pay attention to 2 pi as opposed to pi, if you

193
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,133
pay attention to tau instead of tau over 2, what is this

194
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:34,067
angle that we did in magenta?

195
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:37,467
Well, first of all let's think about this formula right over here

196
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,400
what is the circumference in terms of the radius?

197
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,733
Well now we can say that circumference is equal to

198
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,800
tau times the radius, because tau is the same thing

199
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
as 2 pi. So it makes that formula a little bit neater

200
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,800
altough it does make the pi r squared a little bit

201
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,400
messier, so you could argue both sides of that, but

202
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,933
it makes the measure of radians much more intuitive,

203
00:12:56,933 --> 00:13:00,933
because you could say that this is pi over 2 radians or

204
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:05,333
you could say this is pi over 2 radians is the same thing as

205
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:09,400
tau over 4 radians. And where did I get that from?

206
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,667
Remember, if you go all the way around the circle,

207
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,067
that is the circumference, the arc length would be the

208
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:18,667
circumference, it would be tau radii or it would be

209
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:22,667
tau radians would be the angle subtended by that arc

210
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,200
length, it would be tau radians. All the way around is tau

211
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,467
radians, so that by itself is intuitive. One revolution

212
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:33,133
is one tau radians. If you go only one fourth of that,

213
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:36,533
it's going to be tau over 4 radians. So the reason why

214
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:40,467
tau is more intuitive here is because you don't have to do

215
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:43,467
this weird conversion where you say "divide by two,

216
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:46,333
multiply by two" all that, look, however many radians

217
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,667
in terms of tau, that's really how many revolutions you've gone

218
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:54,200
around the circle and so if you've gone 1/4 around,

219
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,000
that's tau/4 radians, if you've gone halfway around,

220
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,867
that'd be tau/2 radians, if you go 3/4 around, that's be

221
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:04,600
3tau/4 radians. If you go all the way around, that would

222
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,333
be tau radians. If someone told you that they have

223
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:14,267
an angle of 10tau radians, you'd go around exactly 10 times.

224
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:15,867
It would be much more intuitive, you wouldn't have to do

225
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:20,200
this mental math, converting the multiplier, divide by

226
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
two when I convert to radians in terms of pi. No, when

227
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,600
you do it in terms of tau radians, it's just natural. One

228
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,067
revolution is one tau radians. And it makes the

229
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,800
sine function over here, instead of writing pi over 2

230
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,533
when you look on the graph, where was this on the

231
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:39,867
unit circle? It's 1/4 around the circle, was this one half?

232
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,333
And this is actually one fourth of the circle, you're

233
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,533
right over here, but now it becomes obvious if you

234
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:48,733
write it in tau. Pau pi -- not pau-- pi over 2 is the same

235
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:52,667
thing as tau over 4, pi is the same thing as tau over 2

236
00:14:52,667 --> 00:15:03,200
3 pi over 2 is 3pi--sorry, 3tau over 4, 3/4 tau. And then

237
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,600
one revolution is tau. And then immediately now

238
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,600
when you look at it this way, you know exactly where

239
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,200
you are in the unit circle. You're 1/4 around the unit circle

240
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,000
, you're halfway around the unic circle, you're

241
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,933
3/4 around the unit circle and then you're all the way

242
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:19,533
around the unit circle. And so the last thing that I think

243
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:21,800
the strong pi defenders would say is "Well look,

244
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,267
Sal, you just pointed out one of the most beautiful

245
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:29,800
identities or formulas in mathematics, how does tau

246
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,800
hold up to this?". Well let's just try it out and see

247
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,800
what happens. So if we take e to the i tau, that will

248
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,533
give us cosine of tau plus i sine of tau. And once again,

249
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:49,667
let's just think about what this is. Tau radians means

250
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,733
we've gone all the way around the unit circle,

251
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:56,000
so cosine of tau - remember, we're back at the beginning

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,333
of the unit circle right over here, so cosine of tau is

253
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:04,267
going to be equal to 1 and then sine of tau is equal to 0.

254
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,533
Sine of tau is equal to 0. So e to the i tau is equal to 1.

255
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:16,980
And I'll leave it up to you to decide which one

256
00:16:16,980 --> 99:59:59,999
seems to be more aesthetically profound
