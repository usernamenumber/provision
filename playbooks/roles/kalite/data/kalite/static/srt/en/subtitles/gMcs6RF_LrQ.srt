1
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:04,624
Let's keep building our table of
Laplace transforms. And now

2
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:07,910
we'll do a fairly hairy problem,
so I'm going to have

3
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:12,500
to focus so that I don't make
a careless mistake.

4
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:16,090
But let's say we want to take
the Laplace transform-- and

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,630
this is a useful one.

6
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:20,620
Actually, all of them we've
done so far are useful.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,740
I'll tell you when we start
doing not-so-useful ones.

8
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:27,650
Let's say we want to take the
Laplace transform of the sine

9
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:31,700
of some constant times t.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,200
Well, our definition of the
Laplace transform, that says

11
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:37,210
that it's the improper
integral.

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:38,620
And remember, the Laplace
transform is just a

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,620
definition.

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,440
It's just a tool that
has turned out to

15
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:43,410
be extremely useful.

16
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:46,000
And we'll do more on that
intuition later on.

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,660
But anyway, it's the integral
from 0 to infinity of e to the

18
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:53,750
minus st, times-- whatever
we're taking the Laplace

19
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:01,560
transform of-- times
sine of at, dt.

20
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,195
And now, we have to go back and
find our integration by

21
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:08,195
parts neuron.

22
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:12,560
And mine always disappears,
so we have to reprove

23
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,560
integration by parts.

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,940
I don't recommend you do
this all the time.

25
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:16,720
If you have to do this on an
exam, you might want to

26
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:17,970
memorize it before the exam.

27
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,280
But always remember, integration
by parts is just

28
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:21,950
the product rule in reverse.

29
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,290
So I'll just do that
in this corner.

30
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:24,760
So the product rule tells
us if we have two

31
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,220
functions, u times v.

32
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,440
And if I were take the
derivative of u times v.

33
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,200
Let's say that they're
functions of t.

34
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:35,290
These are both functions of t.

35
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:37,560
I could have written u
of x times u of x.

36
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,140
Then that equals the derivative
of the first times

37
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,140
the second function, plus the
first function times the

38
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,600
derivative of the second.

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,540
Now, if I were to integrate both
sides, I get uv-- this

40
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,780
should be review-- is equal to
the integral of u prime v,

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,580
with respect to dt-- but I'm
just doing a little bit of

42
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,570
shorthand now-- plus the
integral of uv prime.

43
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,790
I'm just trying to help myself
remember this thing.

44
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,460
And let's take this and subtract
it from both sides.

45
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:17,240
So we have this integral of u
prime v is going to be equal

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:24,620
to this, uv minus the integral
of uv prime.

47
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,920
And, of course, this
is a function of t.

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,370
There's a dt here
and all of that.

49
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,770
But I just have to do this in
the corner of my page a lot,

50
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,780
because I always forget this,
and with the primes and the

51
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,460
integrals and all that,
I always forget it.

52
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,070
One way, if you did want to
memorize it, you said, OK, the

53
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,580
integration by parts says if
I take the integral of the

54
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,530
derivative of one thing and then
just a regular function

55
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,560
of another, it equals the two
functions times each other,

56
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,170
minus the integral
of the reverse.

57
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:50,520
Right?

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Here, when you take the
subtraction, you're taking the

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,530
one that had a derivative,
now it doesn't.

60
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,370
And the one that didn't have
a derivative, now it does.

61
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,610
But anyway, let's apply
that to our problem at

62
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,730
hand, to this one.

63
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,060
Well, we could go either
way about it.

64
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,930
Let's make u prime is equal to--
we'll do our definition--

65
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,580
u prime is equal to e to the
minus st, in which case you

66
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,890
would be the antiderivative of
that, which is equal to minus

67
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:30,415
1 over s e to the
minus st, right?

68
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:33,950
And actually, this is going to
be an integration by parts

69
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,170
twice problem, so I'm just
actually going to define the

70
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,950
Laplace transform as y.

71
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,240
That'll come in useful
later on.

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,810
And I think I actually did a
very similar example to this

73
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,620
when we did integration
by parts.

74
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,660
But anyway, back to the
integration by parts.

75
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,760
So that's u.

76
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,980
And let me do v in a
different color.

77
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,960
So when v-- if this
is u prime, right?

78
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,510
This is u prime,
then this is v.

79
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,395
So v is equal to sine of at.

80
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:04,320
And then what is v prime?

81
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,930
Well, that's just a cosine
of at, right?

82
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,110
The chain rule.

83
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,120
And now, we're ready to
do our integration.

84
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,519
So the Laplace transform, and
I'll just say that's y, y is

85
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,529
equal to-- y is what we're
trying to solve for, the

86
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,070
Laplace transform of sine
of at-- that is

87
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,210
equal to u prime v.

88
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,880
I defined u prime in v, right?

89
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,650
That's equal to that.

90
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,940
The integral of u
prime times v.

91
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,260
That equals uv.

92
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:46,700
So that's minus 1 over s e to
the minus st, times v, sine of

93
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:52,580
at, minus the integral.

94
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,970
And when you do the integration
by parts, this

95
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,540
could be an indefinite
integral, an improper

96
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,950
integral, a definite
integral, whatever.

97
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,080
But the boundary stays.

98
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,210
And we can still say, from 0
to infinity of uv prime.

99
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:20,800
So u is minus 1 over s e to the
minus st, times v prime,

100
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:32,350
times a cosine of at--
fair enough-- dt.

101
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,720
Well, now we have another hairy

102
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,210
integral we need to solve.

103
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,940
So this might involve another
integration by

104
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,360
parts, and it does.

105
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,890
Let's see if we can simplify
it at [? all. ?]

106
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,340
Let's take the constants
out first. Let me

107
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,890
just rewrite this.

108
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:54,440
So we get y is equal to minus
e to the minus st

109
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,090
over s, sine of at.

110
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:09,700
So you have a minus minus plus a
over s-- a divided by s, and

111
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,250
then these two negative signs
cancel out-- times the

112
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:19,420
integral from 0 to infinity,
e to the minus st,

113
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,080
cosine of at, dt.

114
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,110
Let's do another integration
by parts.

115
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,250
And I'll do this in a purple
color, just so you know this

116
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,520
is our second integration
by parts.

117
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,720
Over here.

118
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:40,670
Let's define once again, u prime
is equal to e the minus

119
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,550
st. So this is u prime.

120
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:50,150
Then u is equal to minus 1
over s e to the minus st.

121
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,010
We'll make v equal
to cosine of at.

122
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,730
The hardest part about this is
not making careless mistakes.

123
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,590
And then v prime-- I just want
it to be on the same row-- is

124
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:09,560
equal to minus a sine
of at, right?

125
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,160
The chain rule, derivative
of cosine is minus sign.

126
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,070
So let's substitute that back
in, and we get-- this is going

127
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:21,960
to get hairy; actually, it
already is hairy-- y is equal

128
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:35,620
to minus e to the minus st over
s, sine of at, plus a

129
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,220
over s, times-- OK.

130
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,810
Integration by parts.

131
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,680
uv.

132
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:53,540
So that's minus 1 over s e to
the minus st, times v, times

133
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:06,910
cosine at, minus the integral
from 0 to infinity.

134
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,310
This problem is making
me hungry.

135
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,800
It's taking so much glucose
from my bloodstream.

136
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm focusing so much not to
make careless mistakes.

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,380
Anyway, integral from
0 to infinity.

138
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:26,250
And now, we have uv prime, so
u is minus 1 over s e to the

139
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,460
minus st. That's u.

140
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,480
And then v prime
times minus a.

141
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,159
So let's make that minus cancel
out with this one.

142
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,400
So that becomes a plus.

143
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:46,860
a sine of at, dt.

144
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,170
I'm starting to see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

145
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,700
So then, let's simplify
this thing.

146
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,610
And, of course, we're going to
have to evaluate this whole

147
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,730
thing, right?

148
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,350
Actually, we're going to have
to evaluate everything.

149
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,440
Let's just focus on the
indefinite integral for now.

150
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,020
We're going to have to take
this whole thing and

151
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,180
evaluate-- let's just say that
y is the antiderivative and

152
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,340
then evaluate it from
infinity to 0.

153
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,850
From 0 to infinity.

154
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:15,125
So y is equal to minus
e to the minus st

155
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:19,072
over s, sine of at.

156
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:21,690
Now let's distribute this.

157
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:32,950
Minus a over s squared, e to
the minus st, cosine of at.

158
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,430
Right?

159
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,990
OK, now I want to make sure I
don't make a careless mistake.

160
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,380
OK.

161
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,390
Now, let's multiply this times
this and take all of the

162
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,520
constants out.

163
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,450
So we have an a and an s.

164
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,790
a over s.

165
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,740
There's a minus sign.

166
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,470
We have a plus a to the s.

167
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:56,740
So we'll have a minus a squared
over s squared, times

168
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,990
the integral from 0-- well, I
said I'm just worrying about

169
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,060
the indefinite integral right
now, and we'll evaluate the

170
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,680
boundaries later.

171
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,760
e to the minus st,
sine of at, dt.

172
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,800
Now, this is the part, and we've
done this before, it's a

173
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,580
little bit of a trick with
integration by parts.

174
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,500
But this expression, notice,
is the same thing as our

175
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,940
original y.

176
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,400
Right?

177
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,410
This is our original y.

178
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,110
And we're assuming we're doing
the indefinite integral, and

179
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,340
we'll evaluate the
boundaries later.

180
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,440
Although we could have kept the
boundaries the whole time,

181
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,120
but it would have made
it even hairier.

182
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,440
So we can rewrite this
integral as y.

183
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,580
That was our definition.

184
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,440
And actually, I just realized
I'm running out of time, so

185
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,010
I'll continue this hairy problem
in the next video.

186
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,260
See you soon.
