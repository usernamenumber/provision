1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450
   

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,550
Let's see if we can name
this guy right here.

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,790
In all of these problems, I
guess you can call them, we

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,456
look for the longest chain or
the longest ring, and this one

5
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:10,490
is pretty obvious here.

6
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,130
The ring in the middle is
clearly the longest carbon

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,830
structure here.

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,470
It has one, two, three,
four, five, six,

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,800
seven, eight carbons.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,020
Let me highlight that.

11
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,570
It is eight carbons, so we will
be you using the prefix

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,830
oct-, and it is in a cycle, so
it will be cyclooct-, and it's

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,500
all single bonds, so
it's cyclooctane.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,106
This right here tells us that
our core is cyclooctane.

15
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:43,970
   

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,890
Now let's look at the different
subgroups or the

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,660
different branches off
of the main ring.

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,760
Over here, we have a one, two,
three, four-carbon group.

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,040
It is in a cycle or it's in
a ring, so this is cyclo-.

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,420
Four carbons are but-,
cyclobutyl, -yl because it's a

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,710
subgroup or it's off of the main
chain or the main ring,

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,390
so that is our cyclobutyl
right there.

23
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,000
We also have another cyclobutyl
right here, four

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,330
carbons in a ring, so that's
another cyclobutyl.

25
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,670
   

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,400
Up here, we have three
carbons in a cycle.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,920
The prefix for three carbons
is prop-, so this is

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,170
cyclopropyl.

29
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:40,330
   

30
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,070
Then down here, let's start with
the common names, because

31
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,020
those tend to be a little
bit easier.

32
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,850
We have one, two, three,
four carbons.

33
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,520
Actually, we have it
there and there.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,330
One, two, three, four, these
are the same groups.

35
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,800
We're going to be dealing with
but- if we do common names,

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,110
and you see it has
this Y shape.

37
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,255
We're kind of connected to the
base of the Y in either case,

38
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:05,790
so we are dealing
with isobutyl.

39
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,890
   

40
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,070
The Y shape tells us that we're

41
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,500
dealing with iso-, isobutyl.

42
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,530
That's both of these
right there.

43
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,020
Now, we have to figure out how
we're going to number, where

44
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,520
we're going to number ourselves
on this ring.

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,770
And to do that, we look for
the group that is first

46
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,590
alphabetically.

47
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,200
This is a little bit of a
confusing point sometimes.

48
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,940
If this was a tert-butyl or
sec-butyl, we would consider

49
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,900
the B, but when it's isobutyl,
it's all considered one word,

50
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,370
so we'll consider the I.

51
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:49,950
We need to compare the I to the
C, to the C, to the C, so

52
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,170
the C's definitely
win out on the I.

53
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,580
If we look at all of these
cyclos, cyclobutyl definitely

54
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,350
takes precedence over
cyclopropyl.

55
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,960
It comes first alphabetically.

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,350
Let's make our starting point
this cyclobutyl, although you

57
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,150
could have made it that
cyclobutyl as well, so we'll

58
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,880
make that our starting point.

59
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,220
We're going to go in a clockwise
direction, so that

60
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,690
we could get to this one first,
so that the next group

61
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,580
is only going to be a two.

62
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,260
Otherwise, the next group would
have been at three.

63
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:24,050
So one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, so this is a

64
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,960
1-cyclobutyl.

65
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,230
This is a 6-cyclobutyl.

66
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,590
This is a 7-cyclopropyl.

67
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,200
   

68
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,580
This is a 2-isobutyl, so this is
a 2-isobutyl and this is a

69
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,850
4-isobutyl.

70
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,090
We want to write them all
in alphabetical order.

71
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,160
The cyclobutyls win, so we
have a cyclobutyl at one.

72
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,130
We have a 1-cyclobutyl.

73
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,320
We also have a 6-cyclobutyl.

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,900
we have two of them, so
it is dicyclobutyl.

75
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,570
   

76
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,820
Let me capitalize since that's
where we're starting.

77
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,570
   

78
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,580
So we got those two guys out
of the way, and then

79
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,620
alphabetically, cyclopropyl
is next, so then we have a

80
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,980
7-cyclopropyl.

81
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,120
Let me do that in that orange
color of the cyclopropyl.

82
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,079
   

83
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,660
7-cyclopropyl, got that
guy out of the way.

84
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,610
Then at two and four we
have an isobutyl.

85
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,570
We have a 2,4-, and we have
two of them, so it is

86
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:49,160
diisobutyl, and then finally
cyclooctane.

87
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,320
We got the 2,4-diisobutyls out
of the way, and then we have

88
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,540
our cyclooctane, so I'll just
write the cyclooctane.

89
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,750
   

90
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,810
And we're done.

91
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,420
This was the common naming.

92
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,370
Now, if we want to do systematic
naming, we would

93
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,460
have to use something else
other than the isobutyl.

94
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,010
And to do that, let me
do that over here.

95
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,300
What you do is you use your
connection point as one, and

96
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,520
you just branch.

97
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,240
Let me do this in a color I
haven't used for before.

98
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,510
Green.

99
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,370
So let's make that our core
chain, so that is one, two,

100
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,990
three, carbons, so it's propyl,
and then on the second

101
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,650
carbon, on the number two carbon
that we are attached

102
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,720
to, you have a methyl group.

103
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,970
So this is 1-methylpropyl.

104
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,370
   

105
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,690
That's what each of these--
that's a 1-methypropyl and

106
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,810
then that is a 1-methylpropyl.

107
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,280
Another way to think about, an
isobutyl is the same thing as

108
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,070
a 1-methylpropyl.

109
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,330
This is the propyl part, and
then this right here-- let me

110
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,250
do that in that color--
that right there

111
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,780
is the methyl part.

112
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,370
Oh, sorry, this isn't
a 1-methlypropyl.

113
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,790
Let me be very careful
with my numbering.

114
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,780
This is the one carbon, two
carbon, three carbon.

115
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,090
The methyl comes off of
the second carbon.

116
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,200
So this is a 2-methylpropyl:
one, two, three.

117
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,400
Methyl comes off of
the second carbon.

118
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,070
This is a 2-methylpropyl
group.

119
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,620
And now when we look at it
alphabetically, methylpropyl

120
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,550
still comes after cyclobutyl, so
it definitely won't change

121
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,790
the numbering of things, and so
it still would be last. It

122
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,480
also comes after cyclopropyl.

123
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,360
If we were to do the systematic
naming, it would be

124
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,040
1,6-dicyclo-- there's something
very strangely fun

125
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,290
about this-- dicyclobutyl.

126
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,420
   

127
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,670
Then you have your cyclopropyl,
7-cyclopropyl.

128
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:55,110
   

129
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,960
It's like a secret code.

130
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,200
And then you have your-- now,
this is interesting.

131
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,340
You have two of these
guys, right?

132
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,150
Now you don't say di- when you
have this kind of more complex

133
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,000
naming or this systematic
naming.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,590
Instead you use the word
bis-, so we have bis-.

135
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,790
So let me write it.

136
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:21,930
We're at two and four,
2,4-bis, this thing.

137
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,180
I can just bis-(2-methylpropyl).

138
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:33,540
   

139
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,940
So this part right here
is the exact part as

140
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,970
that part right there.

141
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,990
This the common name.

142
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,980
This is the systematic naming.

143
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,250
And then we have our
cyclooctane.

144
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:47,200
