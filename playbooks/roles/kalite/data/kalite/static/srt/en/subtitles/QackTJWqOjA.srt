1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now let's do Part b).

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Find the average velocity of the particle for the time period between time 0 and time 6.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the easy way to think about this, average velocity, is that your

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
average, or one way to think about it, the distance that you

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
travel, sometimes I use "d" for distance or "s" for displacement

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But your distance in general is equal to your average

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
velocity times time.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or, your average velocity is equal to the distance

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you travel, divided by time.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so how do we figure out the distance that we travel

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over that period?

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Especially because they didn't explicitly give us

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the position function.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well if you think about it,

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's think about the velocity function over here

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which they did give us,"v(t)"

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I don't know exactly what it looks like,

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me just draw a general velocity function right over here

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is our t-axis,

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is our velocity axis right over here

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we care about between time 0 and time 6,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and let's say our function does something like this,

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it doesn't really matter, this is just a general drawing

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over here, How do we figure out the total

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
distance over that time?

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, if you take any small time,

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here,and you multiply it

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times roughly the constant velocity over that

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
time period, then that will tell you the area of

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this little column, which will tell you

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
approximately, the distance traveled

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over this very small interval of time.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because you have time times an approximately

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
constant velocity, which will give you a

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
distance.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so in general if you take the area

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
under this curve, from 0 to 6,

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that will give you the total distance

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
travelled.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So "d" is equal to the definite integral

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from 0 to 6 of "v(t)"

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of this thing right over here,

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"v(t)dt"

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you want the average velocity,

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you just find the distance, which is

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this definite integral, and then

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you divide that by the time, or the

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
elapsed time, in this case,

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I could actually write times delta t

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here, our change in time

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here, is going to be 6

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we start at 0 and we finish at 6, so we

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just have to evaluate this

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
definite integral, which is not that easy to evaluate

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
analytically, it's lucky for us that

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they do allow us to use calculators in this part

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we'll evaluate it using a calculator

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we just have to divide it by 6

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's first find out teh distance

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
travelled between time 0 and time 6.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And to do that,

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can use the TI-85

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll go to catalog,

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this tells us all of the different

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
functions they have.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And to evaluate definite integrals, we use the
