PROBLEM: "In the following graph,

2
00:00:02,464 --> 00:00:05,582
is y a function of x?"

3
00:00:05,582 --> 00:00:08,302
So, in order for y to be a function of x,

4
00:00:08,302 --> 00:00:11,493
for any x that you input into the function –

5
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:15,095
any x for which the function is defined –

6
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:17,786
So let's say we have y is equal to f(x), [y=f(x)]

7
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:19,588
So we have our little function machine.

8
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:24,128
it should spit out exactly one value of y.

9
00:00:24,128 --> 00:00:25,899
If it spits out multiple values of y,

10
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:28,324
we don't know what f(x) is going to be equal to.

11
00:00:28,324 --> 00:00:29,523
It could be equal to any of those

12
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:31,157
possible values for y.

13
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:35,215
So, let's see if, for this graph, whether, for a given x,

14
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:38,285
it spits out exactly one y.

15
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:41,349
Well, the function seems to be only defined –

16
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:44,354
so the domain of this function is x is equal to -2.

17
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:45,135
That's the only place

18
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:47,101
where we have a definition for it.

19
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:53,947
– and if we try to input -2 into this little black box,

20
00:00:53,947 --> 00:00:55,015
what do we get?

21
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:57,090
Do we get exactly one thing?

22
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,549
No. If we put a -2 in here, we could get anything.

23
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:04,367
The point -2, 9 is on this relation.

24
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:06,366
-2, 8 is on this relation.

25
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,649
-2, 7

26
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:08,833
-2, 7.5

27
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,901
-2, 3.14159

28
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,363
They're all on these.

29
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,830
So, if you put a negative 2 into this relation,

30
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,466
you actually get –

31
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:19,765
essentially, you actually get an infinite set of values.

32
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:22,834
It could be 9. It could be 3.14.

33
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,647
It could be 8. It could be -8.

34
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:28,032
You get an infinite number of results.

35
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:29,741
So, since it does not map

36
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:32,590
to exactly one output of this function,

37
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:38,102
in the following graph, y is not a function of x.
