1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,670
We're on problem 14.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,970
If the function f as defined
by f of x is equal to x

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,160
squared plus bx plus c, where
b and c are positive

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,110
constants, which of the
following could be

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,440
the graph of f?

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,330
So b and c are positive.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,470
So what does that tell us?

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,560
So a couple of things you
immediately know.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,455
The x squared term-- whatever's
the coefficient of

11
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:34,650
x squared, that tells us whether
the parabola opens up

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,110
or opens down.

13
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,820
It opens up if the coefficient
on the x term is positive,

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,360
which it is.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,650
It's positive 1, right?

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,480
So we know the graph is
going to open up.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,840
It's not going to be a

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,870
downward-opening graph like that.

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,080
So we know the graph is going
to look like a U, as opposed

20
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,760
to-- I don't know what
this is like.

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,800
An A without the line?

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,710
Whatever.

23
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,180
So we know it's going
to be a U.

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,210
And what else do we
know about it?

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,450
What do we know about
its y-intercept?

26
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,320
Well, this is the y-intercept.

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,340
When x is equal to 0, f
of 0 is equal to what?

28
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,530
These two terms are going to be
0, so f of 0 is equal to c.

29
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,280
And so we know that the
y-intercept is positive.

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,450
So let's see if that
alone allows us

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,700
to solve the problem.

32
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,040
   

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:28,850
So we know that the y-intercept
is positive, so

34
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,110
when f of 0 is going to
intersect someplace on the

35
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,230
positive y-axis.

36
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,660
And we know that it's an
upward-opening graph.

37
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,800
So the graph could
look like this.

38
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,520
   

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,820
It could also look like-- well,
this b term-- I won't

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,480
get too much into the b term.

41
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,350
So we actually know that it
is shifted to the left.

42
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,070
But based on just what I said,
that it's opening upwards and

43
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,350
that it has a positive
y-intercept-- this would've

44
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,540
also been a legitimate graph.

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,780
Anything that is opening upwards
like a U-- because

46
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,630
this is a positive x squared
here-- and intersects the

47
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,680
y-axis in the positive area
would be a correct answer.

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,690
And if you look at the choices,
A opens down.

49
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,440
That's not the right answer.

50
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,250
B opens down.

51
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,890
Not the right answer.

52
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,440
C intercepts the y-axis
at 0, so that's

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,430
not the right answer.

54
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,330
D opens up, but it intersects
the y-axis in the negative y.

55
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,450
And then finally E is
very similar to

56
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,390
what I drew in yellow.

57
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,270
So that is our answer.

58
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,610
E.

59
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,860
Next problem.

60
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,430
   

61
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,690
Almost finished with
this section.

62
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,670
OK, they drew us a cube.

63
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,760
Let me draw it big, because
this looks like it might

64
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,905
involve some fancy-- let
me draw the cube.

65
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:55,642
So this is the front face.

66
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,107
Whoops.

67
00:02:58,107 --> 00:02:59,810
Undo.

68
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,890
All my time is spent drawing
diagrams. Cube.

69
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,860
   

70
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,660
Drawing a diagram.

71
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,690
And then it comes
back like that.

72
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:24,422
   

73
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:28,130
Goes back like that.

74
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,660
I should always draw the back
first. Good enough.

75
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,530
I think you get the point.

76
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,660
And it draws the dotted line.

77
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,550
Maybe I'll draw that later,
if I have to.

78
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,970
So they tell us this is point
A, and that this right

79
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,790
here is point B.

80
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,660
They say the cube shown above
has edges of length 2.

81
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,670
So each of these sides are 2.

82
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,450
2, 2, 2, 2, and so on.

83
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,900
And A and B are midpoints
of the two edges.

84
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,310
So A and B are midpoints.

85
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,760
So this side is equal
to this side.

86
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,410
So if the whole side is equal
to 2, and A is a midpoint,

87
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,200
then we know that this
is 1, this is 1, this

88
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,910
is 1, this is 1.

89
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,540
What is the length of AB?

90
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,362
So this is what they want
us to figure out.

91
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:18,779
They want me to draw it in
kind of a darker color.

92
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,089
No, that's not a darker--
that's that line.

93
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,860
This is a pure visualization
problem.

94
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,950
And at first, you're like, boy,
that's three dimensions.

95
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,840
It's crazy.

96
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,895
What am I going to do?

97
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:30,470
What you're going to have to
do is do the Pythagorean

98
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,000
Theorem twice.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
So what do we know?

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,960
Well, we know everything we need
to solve this problem.

101
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,410
Let's see if we can do it.

102
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,530
So let me draw that bottom
surface of the cube.

103
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,360
   

104
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,100
So I'll ask you a question.

105
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,310
Can we figure out-- so
let me draw a line

106
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,620
along the bottom surface.

107
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,250
Let's say that this line I'm
drawing is along the bottom

108
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,430
surface of the cube.

109
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,570
So I'm going to draw
this line.

110
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,560
   

111
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,640
That's along the bottom
surface of the cube.

112
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,860
And let me label this
side like this.

113
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,800
This is actually a really
fun problem.

114
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,050
I'll do this in yellow.

115
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,460
   

116
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,560
So can we figure out what
that magenta dotted

117
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,260
line's length is?

118
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,950
Well, sure.

119
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,960
We know, first of all, that
is a right triangle,

120
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,740
the way I drew it.

121
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,770
I can redraw it like this, where
this is yellow, brown,

122
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,020
and then dotted line magenta.

123
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,500
   

124
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,450
All I did is I kind of
flipped it up so that

125
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,820
you could see it.

126
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,370
So what is that?

127
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,640
We know the brown length.

128
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,200
We know that's 1.

129
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,270
We know the yellow
length is what?

130
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,070
It's 2.

131
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,460
Because all the sides
of the cube are 2.

132
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,240
So we can use the Pythagorean
Theorem to figure out the

133
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,040
magenta line.

134
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,460
So it's 1 squared plus
2 squared is equal

135
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,295
to this side squared.

136
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:03,040
So we can just take the
square root of it.

137
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
So that equals the square
root of 5, right?

138
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,580
1 plus 4.

139
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,420
Square root of 5 is
this magenta line.

140
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,340
   

141
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,830
So now can we figure
out that gray line

142
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,310
that I drew at first?

143
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,770
Well, sure.

144
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,350
Because now we have another
right triangle.

145
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,490
That gray line is just the
hypotenuse of this right

146
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,720
triangle, that's kind
of at an angle.

147
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,350
So let me make sure you
understand what I'm saying.

148
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,610
If I were to flatten
it out, I have this

149
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,330
green side right here.

150
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:41,180
I have this dotted line base,
and then I have the gray line,

151
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,430
which is the hypotenuse.

152
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,170
   

153
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,170
And just so you know, this point
right here would be A,

154
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,250
and then this point right
here would be B.

155
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,000
And do we know the sides?

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,480
Yes, we do.

157
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,540
We know this green line here is
1, so this side here is 1.

158
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,080
I'm just redrawing it here.

159
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,550
We know the magenta dotted line
at the bottom, which I

160
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,320
kind of switched colors a bit.

161
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,880
We just figured out that that
magenta bottom line is

162
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,830
square root of 5.

163
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,010
So now we can just use the
Pythagorean Theorem to figure

164
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,950
out the length of this line.

165
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,750
The length of this line squared
is going to be equal

166
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,670
to the square root of 5,
squared, plus 1 squared.

167
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,460
So the hypotenuse squared is
equal to this, so we could

168
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,700
take the square root of that.

169
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,940
So that equals the square
root of-- what's the

170
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,995
square root of 5 squared?

171
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,480
Well, it's just 5, right?

172
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,010
Plus 1.

173
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,440
So it's just equal to the
square root of 6.

174
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,150
So this line is equal to
the square root of 6.

175
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,530
And that is choice D.

176
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,830
We luckily have not
made a mistake.

177
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,080
Last problem.

178
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,610
   

179
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,780
Problem 16.

180
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,930
Let x-- with this kind of
oval-looking thing around it--

181
00:07:53,930 --> 00:08:01,830
be defined as x squared minus
x, for all values of x.

182
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:11,540
If a-- so they're telling us
that a is equal to a minus 2,

183
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,510
what is the value of a?

184
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,320
So what does this mean? a
kind of with this oval?

185
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,680
Well, that just means that
a squared minus a, right?

186
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,700
That maps to that,
just like that.

187
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,750
And what does a minus
2 map to?

188
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,470
And I'm just bringing
the equal sign down.

189
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,800
a minus 2 maps to-- every place
where I see an x, I put

190
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,669
an a minus 2 in there.

191
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:39,510
So that equals a minus 2
squared, minus a minus 2.

192
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,115
And now we just keep solving.

193
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:43,280
And most of the solving is
on the right-hand side.

194
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,700
So let's see.

195
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:57,850
That equals a squared minus
4a plus 4 minus a plus 2.

196
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:04,190
So we get a squared minus
a is equal to a

197
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,480
squared minus 5a, right?

198
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,200
Minus 4a minus a plus 6.

199
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,270
We can subtract a squared
from both sides.

200
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,730
Let me add 5a to both sides.

201
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,370
So 5a, so you get 4a
is equal to 6.

202
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,040
Divide both sides by 4.

203
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,732
You get a is equal to 6/4, which
equals 1 and 1/2 or 3/2.

204
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:36,540
And that is choice C.

205
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,260
And we are done this section.

206
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,800
I'll see you in the next
practice test.
