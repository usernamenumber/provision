1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:02,073
In this video, I really wanted to introduce

2
00:00:02,073 --> 00:00:06,404
you to some terminology for some basic angle types

3
00:00:06,404 --> 00:00:09,668
and terminology. I wanted to introduce you to are

4
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:20,867
acute angles, right angles, and obtuse angles.

5
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:22,446
I think when we go through these,

6
00:00:22,446 --> 00:00:24,869
it will be pretty self-explanatory.

7
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,191
And an acute angle is an angle --

8
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:29,360
let me just draw them first

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,397
then you might,

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,333
you might,

11
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,856
it might start to make sense.

12
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:33,785
So an acute angle

13
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:35,039
will look something like that.

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:35,800
I draw two rays

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,779
coming from a common point.

16
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:38,708
I could also --

17
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,866
so the acute angle could be this angle right over here.

18
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:43,955
I could also draw an acute angle;

19
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:47,160
maybe an angle that is formed from an intersection of two lines,

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,853
so this angle would be acute,

21
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:51,432
and so will this angle.

22
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:52,533
They're both acute angles.

23
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,533
We are going to see acute angles as ones

24
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,705
that are --

25
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:58,027
that since I haven't defined right angles yet.

26
00:00:58,027 --> 00:00:59,188
They are narrower,

27
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:00,600
so we are going to see that they are

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,928
smaller than right angles.

29
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,110
Right angles are when the rays

30
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,200
or the lines are going, oh

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,533
I guess, I don't want to use the word "right"

32
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:12,609
in my definition.

33
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:13,800
They are kind of

34
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,581
if one is going horizontal

35
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:17,578
then the other one will be going vertical.

36
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,867
so let me draw with rays first

37
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:20,039
so the right angle

38
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,800
this one is going from the left to the right

39
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,172
and the other ray is going from the bottom

40
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:25,426
to the top

41
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:27,200
this angle right over here

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,863
is a right angle

43
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:30,535
and I could label it like that

44
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:31,603
but as a traditional angle

45
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:32,857
but the general,

46
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:35,504
the general convention for labeling right angles

47
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:36,525
is to put a little,

48
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:39,358
a kind of a half of a box over there.

49
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:44,188
That tells me that this is a right angle

50
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,903
or, that if this is going left to right

51
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:50,179
this is going perfectly top to bottom

52
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,600
that this is a no way kind of

53
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,847
that this is a completely,

54
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:54,916
I guess the best way to think about it

55
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,262
why it's called right

56
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:58,909
is that this ray is completely upright

57
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,933
compared to this ray over here

58
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:03,667
let me draw with some lines

59
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,922
if I have one line like this

60
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:08,522
and I have another line like that

61
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:11,355
a right angle over here

62
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:12,841
actually all of these would have to be

63
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,770
right angles

64
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,163
it would mean that this line

65
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:15,906
is completely,

66
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:16,928
if this line were the ground,

67
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,600
this line is completely upright

68
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,247
relative to this line over here.

69
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:22,501
so either these,

70
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,333
so that is what a right angle means

71
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,845
so now that we defined right angle

72
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,167
I can give you another definition for acute angle

73
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:31,092
so an acute angle has a measure

74
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,933
or it's smaller than a right angle

75
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,619
so you learn about radients and degrees

76
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:38,667
which are different ways to measure angles

77
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:39,916
so you'll see that a right angle

78
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,516
can be measured as 90 degrees

79
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:45,535
this over here is less than 90 degrees

80
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:48,933
so this is less than 90 degrees.

81
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,108
and one way to conceptualize this is

82
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:52,362
that this angle,

83
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:54,359
it's opening is smaller

84
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:55,845
it's more narrow,

85
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:58,770
it's lines are,

86
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,278
you would have to rotate one line

87
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:03,000
less to get to the other line

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,111
then you would over here.

89
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:05,000
here, you would have to move

90
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,247
all the way over there

91
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:07,594
here you only have to move it a little bit

92
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:10,467
so the acute angle is less than a right angle

93
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:12,533
so you might imagine already

94
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:14,096
what an obtuse angle is

95
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:16,510
it is greater than a right angle

96
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,182
so let me draw a couple of examples

97
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:19,000
of obtuse angles

98
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,922
so an obtuse angle might look like

99
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:25,566
let me get it a little clearer

100
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,842
might look like that

101
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:30,442
if it was a right angle,

102
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:32,439
then this line over here

103
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,275
would be,

104
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:33,925
would look something like that

105
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,365
it would be completely upright

106
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:36,573
relative to this, if this were the ground.

107
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:38,244
but we don't see that

108
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:41,449
this orange ray over here is actually

109
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,935
opened out wider

110
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:44,932
it's opened up wider

111
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:47,439
so it is obtuse.

112
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,251
it is obtuse

113
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:50,597
so this kind of comes from the actual

114
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,667
everyday meaning

115
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:54,823
acute means very sharp or very sensitive

116
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:58,000
obtuse means not very sharp or not very sensitive.

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,861
you could imagine this looks like a sharp point

118
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:02,904
or it's, it's not opening up much.

119
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,947
so maybe it's more sensitive to

120
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:06,155
you know, relative to other things

121
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,245
I don't know, just trying to make connections

122
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:10,102
This is less sensitive

123
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:11,495
It's all big and open

124
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:13,585
It won't be able to notice things that are small

125
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:17,765
or maybe that is not an appropriate analogy

126
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:19,437
but one way to think about it

127
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:20,667
it's kind of open up wider,

128
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:23,105
or it's bigger than a right angle

129
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:24,916
it's larger than 90 degrees

130
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,238
larger than 90 degrees

131
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:28,167
if you measure it

132
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,400
you would have to rotate this ray more to

133
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,601
get to this other ray

134
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:34,947
than you would if you had right angles

135
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:37,333
and definitively a lot more if they were acute angles.

136
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,499
If I were to draw this with lines,

137
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:44,189
which of the angles are obtuse and

138
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,200
which are acute?

139
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,440
Well the way I drawn them right over here,

140
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,251
these two over here are acute

141
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:51,852
are acute

142
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:54,266
and then these over here are going to be

143
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:55,567
obtuse

144
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:56,496
so this one

145
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,285
and this one

146
00:04:57,285 --> 00:05:00,907
these are both obtuse angles

147
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:02,440
and I actually drew them up here as well.

148
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,505
This one and this one are going to be

149
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,524
obtuse

150
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:09,592
so very simple idea

151
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:12,564
if one line

152
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:14,514
or if one ray is relative to the other one

153
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,582
is straight up and down

154
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,667
versus left to the right

155
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,867
or is completely upright

156
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,948
then we're talking about a right angle

157
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:21,945
if they are closer to each other

158
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:23,245
if you had to rotate them less

159
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:24,267
you're talking about a acute angle

160
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,939
if you had to rotate them more

161
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,935
you are talking about an obtuse angle

162
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,096
and I think if you look at them visually

163
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:31,279
it's pretty easy to pick out
