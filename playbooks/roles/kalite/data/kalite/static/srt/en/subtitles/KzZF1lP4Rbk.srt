1
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:06,046
We're in the British museum and

2
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:11,244
we're looking at the frieze that went around the Parthenon.

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:15,285
And not exactly on the exterior of the Parthenon...

4
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:17,200
Inside the porch, basically.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,513
They're carved quite shallow,

6
00:00:18,513 --> 00:00:21,088
and although they would've been painted more brightly,

7
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,008
I still think it would've been a little tough to see.

8
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:29,312
Essentially what we have is a procession of the citizens of Athens

9
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:33,803
on the birthday of Athena, patron goddess of Athens

10
00:00:33,803 --> 00:00:36,246
..and it would wind its way through the city

11
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:38,190
until it actually reach her temple.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,765
Right, the Parthenon.

13
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:42,911
And inside the Parthenon was a giant sculpture

14
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,334
by Phidias of the goddess Athena.

15
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:47,252
What we have here then,

16
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:50,471
is actually not a representation of some mythology

17
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:52,198
but actually a representation of something

18
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:54,760
that the Athenians would have lived themselves.

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,568
...Yes, and they're putting themselves in the realm of the gods,

20
00:00:57,568 --> 00:01:00,141
because they take part in the procession

21
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:02,560
looking very ideal and very noble,

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,872
and the procession ends with a sacrifice to the gods,

23
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:09,164
in the presence of the gods and goddesses.

24
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:12,567
And so in a way the human realm and the divine realm

25
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,770
...that definition dissolves.

26
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,297
Let's take a close look at the procession.

27
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:18,470
because first of all it's extremely long,

28
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,987
it's on two sides of the building.

29
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:22,705
The procession actually starts off kind of slowly here

30
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:25,671
...right, and it gathers momentum and energy.

31
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:29,057
And we are talking about dozens of horses,

32
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:33,857
dozens of riders, each one depicted slightly differently.

33
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:38,012
Horses overlapping horses, overlapping riders.

34
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:40,274
There is an incredible sense of rhythm and actually movement

35
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:43,282
I mean all of this is frozen, its stone, right?

36
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:45,892
Nothing is moving but there is such a complexity

37
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:47,938
of the hooves of the horses,

38
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,190
of the legs of the horses,

39
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,324
of the legs of the riders...

40
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:53,488
the anatomy of the horses, the muscles, their veins...

41
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,865
and each one is in a slight,

42
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,919
as you said is in a slightly different position,

43
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,900
but all creating this momentum.

44
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,177
And to my ear, I almost hear, the footfalls of those horses.

45
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:07,099
The male figures have these wide shoulders and narrow hips,

46
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,171
and beautiful torsos, incredible muscles on their arms

47
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:14,932
with these very beautiful faces that are very calm.

48
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:19,671
We see those humans, these Athenians actually controlling the power

49
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:22,951
and the wildness of nature represented through the horses.

50
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:28,002
And there's something really wonderful about an animal

51
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:31,446
that's acting very wild and passionate.

52
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:37,071
And a human rider just sitting holding its...so nobly,

53
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:39,648
maybe turning and looking back behind him,

54
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:44,102
not even worried about that animal that's about to rear up,

55
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:48,269
but in such control that he can even turn his back on it.

56
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:53,044
There's something about that that speaks to a kind of nobility and heroism.

57
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:58,384
So if in fact, the frieze depicts the Panathenaic Procession

58
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,345
and that's generally accepted.

59
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:04,941
Although there's some other historians that have suggested alternate possibilities.

60
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:09,716
Then most likely what we are seeing is the folding of the Peplos here

61
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:12,287
which was actually woven by the Athenians,

62
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:13,528
It was a great honor

63
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:16,815
and of course it was ultimately paraded through the city

64
00:03:16,815 --> 00:03:21,124
to drape the statue of the goddess Athena herself

65
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:22,703
in the temple, the Parthenon.

66
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:27,815
This group of sculptures would have been directly over the main entrance to the Parthenon

67
00:03:27,815 --> 00:03:31,927
The Parthenon itself could actually be surmounted from any direction.

68
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:34,413
In order to walk into the main chamber

69
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,938
you would have walked directly under this, and so...

70
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:38,500
...and you would've looked up at the gods.

71
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,466
These are in lustic condition,

72
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:43,247
and there's a kind of stillness here

73
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:45,481
and a more of an isolation to the figures

74
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:50,546
than these rough and tumble of the horses and the riders

75
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:52,448
in the procession that I love so much.

76
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,364
But what's really remarkable in these figures

77
00:03:55,364 --> 00:03:57,674
is the treatment of the drapery.

78
00:03:57,674 --> 00:03:59,892
It's almost like there was a sculptor,

79
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:02,437
who under Phidias' direction,

80
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:06,176
just loved playing with the patterns of the drapery.

81
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:09,223
They swirl and move, and gather.

82
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:11,973
We were looking at three figures here,

83
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:15,308
who sit facing each other, but one turns away,

84
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:18,929
and there's one figure here who just..

85
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:20,148
I've never seen anything...

86
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:20,767
Ares, the god of war

87
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:21,267
Is that who it is?

88
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:21,767
Yeah

89
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:26,031
It's so human, and so divine at the same time, and even though we

90
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:30,536
can't see his face, there's a kind of total

91
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:35,433
confidence and idealism to his body, and the way he holds his body

92
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:39,359
and the way he moves and he lifts up his knee and leans back

93
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:42,467
and looks on, and has a sense of

94
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:47,033
total tranquility, and yet his gesture is so human

95
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:49,967
There is a kind of complete comfort within his own body

96
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:53,523
that the sculpture is able to express just exquisitely.

97
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:59,189
But its remarkable for its variety, for its complexity, for its unity..

98
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:03,694
...for its understanding of the variety of human experience of motion

99
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:09,685
of the relationship between animal and man, and man and god

100
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:13,864
and very much in that way is a mirror, of the way the Greeks saw

101
00:05:13,864 --> 99:59:59,999
themselves and the world.
