1
00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:03,002
We humans have known for thousands of years,

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,867
just looking at our environment around us,

3
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,207
that there're different substances.

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,333
These different substances...tend to have different properties.

5
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,954
Not only do they have different properties;

6
00:00:11,954 --> 00:00:14,745
one might reflects light in a certain way, or not reflect light.

7
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:17,601
Or be a certain color, or be have a certain temperature;

8
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,457
be liquid, or gas or be a solid.

9
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:22,108
But we also start to observe

10
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:24,867
how they react with each other in certain circumstances.

11
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:27,663
and here's pictures of some of these substances.

12
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:31,477
This right here is carbon, and this is in the...in its graphite form

13
00:00:31,477 --> 00:00:36,069
This right here is lead; this right here is gold

14
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,719
and all of the ones that I've drawn, that I've shown pictures of here,

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,369
I got them all from this website right over there

16
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,453
All of these are in their solid form, but we also know that we...

17
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:47,395
It looks like there's certain types of air in it,

18
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,338
certain types of air particles,

19
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:52,210
and depending on what type of air particles you're looking at

20
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,079
whether it is carbon, or oxygen, or nitrogen,

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,948
that seems to have different types of properties.

22
00:00:57,948 --> 00:00:59,425
Or, there are some other things that can be liquid,

23
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:02,082
or even if you raise the temperature high enough on these things.

24
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:05,018
If you raise the temperature high enough on gold or lead,

25
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:06,503
you could get a liquid.

26
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:09,841
Or if you kind of -- if you burn this carbon,

27
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,076
you can get it to a gaseous state,

28
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:13,351
you can release it into the atmosphere,

29
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:14,702
you can break its structure.

30
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:17,271
So these are things that we've all kind of

31
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:20,585
that humanity has observed for thousands of years.

32
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:22,452
But that leads to a natural question

33
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:24,226
that used to be a philosophical question,

34
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:26,405
but now we can answer it a little bit better,

35
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:30,898
and that question is, if you keep breaking down this carbon

36
00:01:30,898 --> 00:01:33,518
into smaller and smaller chunks,

37
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:35,554
if there's some smallest chunk,

38
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:39,867
some smallest unit of this stuff, of this substance

39
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:43,166
that still has the properties of carbon?

40
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,256
And if you were to somehow break that down even further,

41
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:48,390
you would lose the properties of the carbon?

42
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,354
And the answer is: there is.

43
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:52,200
And so just to get our terminology,

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,156
we call these different substances, that these pure substances

45
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:59,025
that have these specific properties at certain temperatures,

46
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:01,185
and react in certain ways,

47
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:05,291
we call them elements.

48
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,729
Carbon is an element. Lead is an element. Gold is an element.

49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,400
You might say that water is an element.

50
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,221
And in history, people have referred to water as an element.

51
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:17,892
But now we know that water is made up of more basic elements.

52
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:20,405
It's made of oxygen and of hydrogen.

53
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:25,014
And all of our elements are listed here

54
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:27,758
in the periodic table of elements.

55
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:29,374
C stands for carbon

56
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:30,400
-- I'm just going through the ones

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,379
that are very relevant to humanity --

58
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,502
but over time you'll probably familiarize yourself with all of these.

59
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:39,148
This is oxygen. This is nitrogen. This is silicon.

60
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:42,867
This is -- Au is gold. This is lead.

61
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:51,995
And that most basic unit of any of these elements is the atom.

62
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,559
So if you were to keep digging in

63
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:57,079
and keep taking smaller and smaller chunks of this.

64
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,415
Eventually you would get to a carbon atom.

65
00:02:59,415 --> 00:03:00,755
Do the same thing over here,

66
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,536
eventually you'd get to a gold atom.

67
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:03,991
You did the same thing over here,

68
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:05,856
eventually you'd get some of this little small

69
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,758
-- for a lack of a better word -- particle,

70
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:09,185
that you'd call a lead atom.

71
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:11,239
And you wouldn't be able to break that down anymore

72
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,597
and still call that lead,

73
00:03:13,597 --> 00:03:17,043
for it still have the properties of lead.

74
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:18,330
And just to give you an idea

75
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,193
-- this is really something that I have trouble imagining --

76
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:24,040
is that atoms are unbelievably small.

77
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,901
Really, unimaginably small.

78
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,555
So for example, carbon.

79
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:29,379
My hair is also made out of carbon.

80
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,882
In fact most of me is made out of carbon.

81
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:35,912
In fact most of all living things are made out of carbon.

82
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:40,533
And so if you took my hair. And so my hair is carbon.

83
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,231
My hair is mostly carbon.

84
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:43,989
So if you took my hair right over here

85
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,565
-- my hair isn't yellow

86
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:46,766
but it contrasts nicely with the black.

87
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:47,950
My hair is black. But if I did that,

88
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,713
you wouldn't be able to see it on the screen.

89
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:51,970
But if you took my hair here, I would have asked you

90
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,200
how many carbon atoms wide is my hair?

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,467
So if you took a cross-section of my hair, not the length,

92
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,361
the width of my hair, and said:

93
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:03,255
how many carbon atoms wide is that?

94
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:07,049
And you might guess, oh, Sal already told me, it's very small,

95
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,150
so maybe there's a thousand carbon atoms there,

96
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,484
or ten thousand, or a hundred thousands,

97
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,788
and I would say, no!

98
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:14,249
There are one million carbon atoms.

99
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:17,439
Or you could string one million carbon atoms

100
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,933
across the width of the average human hair.

101
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,585
And that's obviously an approximation,

102
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:24,026
it's not exactly one million,

103
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:26,605
but that gives you a sense of how small an atom is.

104
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,441
You know, pluck a hair out of your head

105
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:30,991
and just imagine putting a million things

106
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:33,991
next to each other across the hair,

107
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:37,037
not the length of the hair, the width of the hair.

108
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:39,175
It's even hard to see the width of hair.

109
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:40,718
And there would be a million carbon atoms

110
00:04:40,718 --> 00:04:42,979
just going along it.

111
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:48,092
Now it would be pretty cool in and of itself

112
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:49,026
-- we do know that

113
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:51,375
there is this most basic building block of carbon,

114
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,933
this most basic building block of any element.

115
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,952
But what's even neater is that

116
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:59,066
those basic building blocks are related to each other.

117
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:02,556
A carbon atom is made of even more fundamental particles.

118
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:07,469
A gold atom is made up of even more fundamental particles.

119
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:10,445
And they are actually defined by

120
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:12,759
the arrangement of those fundamental particles.

121
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,087
And if you were to change

122
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:15,901
the number of fundamental particles you have.

123
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,844
You could change the properties of that element,

124
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:18,891
how it would react,

125
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:22,769
or you could even change the element itself.

126
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:25,144
And just to understand it a little bit better.

127
00:05:25,144 --> 00:05:28,010
Let's talk about those fundamental elements.

128
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,825
So you have the proton.

129
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:35,524
And the proton is actually the defining

130
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:38,003
-- the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom

131
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,096
and I'll talk about the nucleus in a second --

132
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:42,969
that is what defines the element.

133
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,492
So this is what defines an element.

134
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,333
When you look at the periodic table right here,

135
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,154
they are actually written in order of atomic number,

136
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:51,575
and the atomic number is

137
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:54,667
literally just the number of protons in the element.

138
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:58,667
So by definition, hydrogen has 1 proton.

139
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:02,800
Helium has 2 protons. Carbon has 6 protons.

140
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,333
You cannot have carbon with 7 protons.

141
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,172
If you did, it would be nitrogen,

142
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:09,234
It would not be carbon anymore.

143
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:10,589
Oxygen has 8 protons.

144
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,673
If somehow you were to add another proton to there,

145
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,050
it wouldn't be oxygen anymore.

146
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,333
It would be fluorine. So it defines the element.

147
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,067
It defines the element.

148
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:22,967
And the atomic number, the number of protons,

149
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,447
the number of protons -- and remember,

150
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:27,674
that's the number that's written right at the top here

151
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:30,116
for each of these elements in the periodic table

152
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:31,529
-- the number of protons

153
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,133
is equal to the atomic number.

154
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,852
Is equal to the atomic number.

155
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,861
And they put that number up here because that is

156
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:42,221
the defining characteristic of an element.

157
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:46,133
The other two constituents of an atom

158
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,702
-- I guess we could call it that way --

159
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:55,123
are the electron and the neutron.

160
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,541
And the model you can start to build in your head

161
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,420
-- and this model, as we go through chemistry we'll see,

162
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,833
it will get a little bit more abstract

163
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,821
and really hard to conceptualize --

164
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:06,548
but one way to think about it is

165
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:08,348
you have the protons and the neutrons

166
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:09,825
that are the center of the atom.

167
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:11,600
They are the nucleus of the atom.

168
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,867
So for example, carbon, we know, has 6 protons.

169
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:19,067
So one, two, three, four, five, six.

170
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:22,385
Carbon 12, which is a version of carbon,

171
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:24,200
will also have 6 neutrons.

172
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,748
You can have versions of carbon

173
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:28,021
that have a different number of neutrons.

174
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:30,113
So the neutrons can change, the electrons can change,

175
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:31,733
you can still have the same element.

176
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,267
The protons can't change.

177
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:35,905
You change the protons, you got a different element.

178
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:39,200
So let me draw a carbon 12 nucleus.

179
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,200
So one, two, three, four, five, six.

180
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,487
So this right here is the nucleus of carbon 12.

181
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:48,333
And sometimes it will be written like this.

182
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,132
And sometimes they will actually write

183
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:53,831
the number of protons as well.

184
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:56,133
And the reason why we write it carbon 12

185
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:58,677
-- you know I counted out 6 neutrons --

186
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:00,379
is that this is the total

187
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,675
you could view this as the total number of

188
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:04,741
-- one way to view it,

189
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,405
and we'll get a little bit of nuance in the future

190
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:07,770
-- is that this is the total number

191
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,844
of protons and neutrons inside of its nucleus.

192
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:15,240
And this carbon by definition has an atomic number of 6,

193
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,628
but we can rewrite it here

194
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,596
just so that we can remind ourselves.

195
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:21,342
So at the center of the carbon atom we have this nucleus.

196
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:24,863
And carbon 12 will have 6 protons and 6 neutrons.

197
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:27,495
Another version of carbon, carbon 14, will still have

198
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:30,909
6 protons, but then it would have 8 neutrons.

199
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,467
So the number of neutrons can change,

200
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:34,610
but this is carbon 12 right over here.

201
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,842
And if carbon 12 is neutral --

202
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:40,665
and I'll give a little nuance on this word in a second as well --

203
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:43,200
if it's neutral it will also have 6 electrons.

204
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,400
So let me draw those 6 electrons.

205
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,467
One, two, three, four, five, six.

206
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,836
And one way -- and this is maybe the first order way

207
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:54,634
of thinking about the relationship

208
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,892
between the electrons and the nucleus --

209
00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:58,846
is that you can imagine the electrons

210
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:00,835
are kind of moving around,

211
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:02,956
buzzing around this nucleus.

212
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:04,692
One model is you could kind of

213
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:06,700
thinking of them as orbiting around the nucleus,

214
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,000
but that's not quite right.

215
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,499
They don't orbit the way that a planet, say,

216
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:11,660
orbits around the Sun.

217
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,749
But that's a good starting point.

218
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:16,267
Another way is that they kind of jumping around the nucleus

219
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:18,691
or they are buzzing around the nucleus.

220
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,956
And that's just because

221
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:22,073
reality just gets very strange at this level,

222
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:23,544
and we'll actually have to get to quantum physics

223
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:26,408
to really understand what the electron is doing.

224
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:29,190
But a first mental model in your head is

225
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,400
at the center of this atom, of this carbon 12 atom,

226
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,067
you have this nucleus.

227
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,644
You have this nucleus right over there.

228
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:40,733
And these electrons are jumping around this nucleus.

229
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:43,009
And the reason why these electrons

230
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:45,135
don't just go off away from this nucleus,

231
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,200
why they are kind of bound to this nucleus,

232
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,308
and they form part of this atom,

233
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:54,579
is that protons have a positive charge,

234
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:57,918
and electrons have a negative charge.

235
00:09:57,918 --> 00:10:02,477
And it's one of these properties of these fundamental particles.

236
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,620
When you start thinking about

237
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,467
what is a charge fundamentally other than a label,

238
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:06,867
and it starts to get kind of deep.

239
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,400
But the one thing that we know,

240
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,697
when we talk about electro-magnetic force,

241
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:13,146
is that unlike charges attract each other.

242
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,959
So the best way to think about it is:

243
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,546
protons and electrons,

244
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:18,133
because they have different charges,

245
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,129
they attract each other.

246
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:21,457
Neutrons are neutral,

247
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:25,088
so they're really just sitting here inside of the nucleus,

248
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:28,579
and they do affect the properties on some level,

249
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:33,154
for some atoms of certain elements.

250
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,005
But the reason why we have the electrons

251
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:36,818
not just flying off on their own

252
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:38,600
is because they are attracted.

253
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,333
They are attracted towards the nucleus.

254
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,067
And they also have an unbelievably high velocity

255
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,140
-- it's actually hard for --

256
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,446
we start touching once again

257
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:51,546
on a very strange part of physics

258
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:52,570
once we start talking about

259
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,164
what an electron actually is doing

260
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:55,946
-- but is has enough --

261
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,842
I guess you could say

262
00:10:56,842 --> 00:10:57,924
it's jumping around enough

263
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,733
that it doesn't want to just fall into the nucleus,

264
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,867
I guess is one way of thinking about it.

265
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:08,123
And so, I mentioned carbon 12 right over here

266
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:09,769
defined by the number or protons.

267
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,403
Oxygen would be defined by having 8 protons.

268
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:16,467
But once again, electrons can interact with other electrons.

269
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,650
They can be taken away by other atoms.

270
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,025
And that actually forms

271
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,271
a lot of our understanding of chemistry.

272
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:25,995
It's based on how many electrons an atom has,

273
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:27,600
or a certain element has.

274
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,467
And how those electrons are configured,

275
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:33,867
and how the electrons of other elements are configured,

276
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:36,018
or maybe other atoms of that same element.

277
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:41,267
We can start to predict how an atom of one element

278
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,333
can react with another atom of that same element,

279
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,733
or an atom of one element -- how it could react,

280
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,695
or how it could bond, or not bond, or be attracted to,

281
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:52,200
or repel another atom of another element.

282
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,420
So for example,

283
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,300
and we'll learn a lot more about this in the future,

284
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,144
is: it is possible for another atom some place

285
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:02,723
to swipe away an electron from a carbon,

286
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:05,552
just because for whatever reason --

287
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:10,338
and we'll talk about certain neutral atoms of certain elements

288
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:13,723
have a larger affinity for electrons than others.

289
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:15,218
So one, maybe one of those,

290
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:17,160
swipes an electron away from a carbon,

291
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,230
and then this carbon will be

292
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,831
having less electrons than protons,

293
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:25,138
so then we'll have 5 electrons and 6 protons.

294
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:27,800
And then we'd have a net positive charge.

295
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,039
So in this carbon 12, the first version I did,

296
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:34,267
I had 6 protons, 6 electrons, the charges canceled out.

297
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:36,553
If I lose an electron, then I only have 5 of these,

298
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:38,933
and then I would have a net positive charge.

299
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,785
And we're going to talk a lot more

300
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:42,867
about all of this throughout the chemistry playlist,

301
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,302
but hopefully you have an appreciation that

302
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:46,133
this is already starting to get really cool.

303
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:51,800
We can already get to this fundamental building block

304
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,118
called the atom.

305
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:54,920
And what's even neater is that

306
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,759
this fundamental building block is built of

307
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,667
even more fundamental building blocks.

308
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,867
And these things can all be swapped around

309
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:03,129
to change the properties of an atom,

310
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:06,044
or even go from an atom of one element

311
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:09,036
to an atom of another element.
