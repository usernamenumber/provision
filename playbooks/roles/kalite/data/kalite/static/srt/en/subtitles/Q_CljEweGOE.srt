00:00:01,614 --> 00:00:02,780
What I want to do in this video is

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,536
think about the idea of fraction.

3
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:09,603
And for the sake of this video, as we learn

4
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:11,806
what a fraction is, you can think of it

5
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:13,655
as a part of a whole.

6
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:17,073
Later on we will think of it in even more ways.

7
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:20,447
What do I mean by a "part of a whole"?

8
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:29,946
Let's imagine we have a pizza,

9
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:45,203
and let's say I divide it into 4 equal parts.

10
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:58,068
So there is a total of 4 equal slices of pizza.

11
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:01,469
And let's say on 3 of these slices

12
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,648
I have cheese, only cheese.

13
00:01:06,787 --> 00:01:15,561
And in the fourth slice I have cheese and olives.

14
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,696
So we can ask ourselves what fraction

15
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:21,472
of this pizza has olives on it?

16
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:28,286
Well, we have 4 total slices, all equal sections,

17
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:31,372
and 1 of those has olives.

18
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:39,623
So we can say 1/4 of this pizza

19
00:01:39,993 --> 00:01:46,285
has olives on it, 1 out of the 4.

20
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:48,366
Now, someone says, what fraction

21
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:50,803
of this pizza only has cheese?

22
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:53,427
Well, this slice has cheese but also olives,

23
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:58,066
so we don't count that, but we have 3

24
00:01:58,112 --> 00:02:01,032
of this 4 slices with only cheese.

25
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:16,752
So, 3/4 of the pizza has only cheese.

26
00:02:16,814 --> 00:02:18,552
Let's do a couple more examples,

27
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,603
because this is probably one of the most important

28
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:25,674
and useful idea you can have in your brain.

29
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:37,701
Let's imagine instead we were looking at some fruit,

30
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:53,390
let's say that I have an orange, a banana,

31
00:02:54,698 --> 00:03:28,072
a lemon, an apple and some grapes.

32
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:33,953
If I were to ask you what fraction of the fruit

33
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:44,372
I have is, let's say, yellow?

34
00:03:44,372 --> 00:03:54,200
Well, we could say we have a total of 5 pieces of fruit.

35
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,408
What fraction of those pieces of fruit are yellow?

36
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:01,955
Well, I have 2 yellow pieces right over here,

37
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:17,294
so let's say 2/5 of the fruit is yellow.

38
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:20,371
Let me do one more example,

39
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:22,490
just to make the point clear.

40
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:28,935
Let me draw a candy bar, so that's all food-related.

41
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,954
Let's say I have a candy bar, just like that,

42
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:44,933
and let me divide it into 5 equal pieces.

43
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:53,222
Let's assume these are all equal pieces,

44
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,524
and I'm hungry, so I eat this piece and this piece,

45
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:01,846
so they essentially go away.

46
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,535
So, what fraction of these pieces have I eaten?

47
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:12,534
Well, I have a total of 5 pieces,

48
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:24,858
and I ate 2 of them, so 2/5 of this bar

49
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:29,535
have been eaten.

50
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:31,121
So I'll leave you there,

51
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,790
maybe I'll make another video that

52
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,221
doesn't have as many food analogies,

53
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,472
but this is a super useful concept

54
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:37,881
and I encourage you to think about it

55
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,284
as much as possible and then try the exercises

56
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:41,000
here on Khan Academy.
