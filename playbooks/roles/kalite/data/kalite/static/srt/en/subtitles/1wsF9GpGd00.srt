1
00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:02,703
Let's define some sets.

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:13,036
Let's say the set A is composed of 
the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 and 18

3
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:25,371
Let's say the set B is composed of 1, 7, and 18

4
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:38,581
and let's say that the set C is composed of 18, 7, 1, and 19.

5
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:42,582
What I want to start thinking about in this 
video is the notion of a subset.

6
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:47,414
The first question is: Is B a subset of A?

7
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,872
What does a subset mean?

8
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:56,319
It's a subset if every member of the set 
is also a member of the other set.

9
00:00:56,319 --> 00:01:04,195
We can write that B is a subset of A, this is the notation.

10
00:01:04,195 --> 00:01:06,600
B is a subset of A.

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,426
B is a subset, let me write that down.

12
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:14,717
B is subset of A.

13
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:18,881
Every element of B is a member of A.

14
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:23,717
We can go even further and say B is a "strict" subset of A

15
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:27,230
because B is a subset of A, but it does not equal A

16
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,633
which means that there are things in A that are not in B.

17
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:37,477
So we could go even further and say that B is a strict, or sometimes a "proper" subset of A.

18
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:45,768
You can almost imagine that this is a less than or equal sign, and then you cross out the equal part of the sign.

19
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:47,706
So this means a strict subset

20
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:54,293
which means that everything that is in B is a member of A, but everything that is in A is not a member of B.

21
00:01:54,323 --> 00:02:03,364
B is a strict subset or proper subset.

22
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:09,189
For example, we can write that A is a subset of A.

23
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:15,771
In fact, every set is a subset of itself because everyone of its members is a member of A.

24
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:21,297
We cannot write that A is a strict subset of A.

25
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:25,697
This right over here is false.

26
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:28,771
Let's give ourselves a little bit more practice.

27
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:40,430
Can we write that B is a subset of C?

28
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:48,231
Let's see. C contains 1, 7, 18, so every member of B is indeed a member of C

29
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:51,364
so this right here is true.

30
00:02:51,364 --> 00:03:05,090
Can we write that C is a subset of A?

31
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,935
Every element of C needs to be in A.

32
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:19,425
A has 18, 7, 1, but it does not have 19, 
so once again, this is false.

33
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:27,955
We could write that B is a subset of C, or we 
could even write that B is a strict subset of C.

34
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:34,027
We can also reverse the way we write this, and then we're really just talking about supersets.

35
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:42,762
We could reverse this notation and 
say that A is a superset of B.

36
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:45,678
This is just another way of saying that B is a subset of A.

37
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:53,248
The way you can think about this is 
A contains every element that is in B.

38
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:57,101
It might contain more or it might contain every element.

39
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:02,575
You can view this as the equal symbol 
if this was greater or equal to (â‰¥)

40
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,434
they're not quite exactly the same thing

41
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:13,034
but we know already that we can also 
write that A is a strict superset of B

42
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:17,099
which means that A everything that B has, and then some.

43
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:19,301
A is not equivalent to B.

44
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:23,301
So hopefully this familiarizes you with the notions of 
subsets and supersets and strict subsets.
