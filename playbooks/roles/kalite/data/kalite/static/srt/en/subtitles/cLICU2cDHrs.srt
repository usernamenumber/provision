1
00:00:04,869 --> 00:00:08,204
- We're in Santa Maria del Popolo.
- In Rome.

2
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:12,303
Looking at one of the great 
Caravaggio's of the Baroque.

3
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:15,405
This may actually be my favourite Caravaggio.

4
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:17,978
Although I said that about the last Caravaggio.

5
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:21,138
You may have.
This is the Crucifixion of Saint Peter.

6
00:00:21,138 --> 00:00:25,968
We talked about the diagonals of the Baroque 
and the sense of action in the momentary,

7
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:29,203
but Caravaggio just makes 
that seem so simple.

8
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:33,573
It's such an activated, 
complex set of movements and weights,

9
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:34,515
countermovements.

10
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:41,402
- And gravity plays this intense role.
- Very powerful feeling of the pulling gravity.

11
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:46,305
But what gets me is Peter. 
Caravaggio went out to the street and got a guy.

12
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:49,636
He's a real and powerful, intense figure.

13
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:52,238
And he looks really crabby just the way Peter should be.

14
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,369
Now with the story of course.

15
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:58,178
- He has to be crucified not the way the Christ did. 
- That's right. So upside down.

16
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:03,536
Turning the cross upside down. 
He looks poor and kind of messy.

17
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:06,857
Not idealised at all. 
This is in such contrast that comes.

18
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:10,127
Seems like a guy hanging out in a bar in Rome.

19
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:12,405
Well, that's what Caravaggio is so known for.

20
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,854
It's all of the pomp and ceremony of Rome,
of the Catholic Church,

21
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:17,995
it's here turned on it's head by Caravaggio.

22
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:22,536
I think now this in contrast to the medieval traditions,
where there is no sense of gravity,

23
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:24,533
no sense of weight, 
no sense of physicality.

24
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:29,567
We're really seeing the ramifications of the Renaissance 
but brought into the Baroque here

25
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:33,642
with the kind of intense and emotionalism, 
and physicality.

26
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:36,872
- And that even puts the Renaissance to shame.
- And it's shoved in your face.

27
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:38,841
The guy who's lifting the cross, 
he's got all under it.

28
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:41,071
He's hoisting it with his back.

29
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:45,536
We see his butt in our face, 
we see his leg, his dirty feet.

30
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:45,656
That's right.

31
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:50,400
And this notion of really pushing it out, 
past the picture plane, into our faces.

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,003
- Absolutely...
- Into our space...

33
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:56,169
And look at the diagonal of Peter 
as his feet come towards us,

34
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:59,236
you'r absolutely right. 
It breaks out into our world.

35
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:03,003
Right, and in fact the cross as it moves out 
into our space by his feet,

36
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:06,211
gives us a very closeup view of the nails.

37
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:09,765
As a kind of way, that it gets to you and your body, 
so that you almost go "augh".

38
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:13,129
- This oldest tension actually... 
- You can feel that...

39
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:17,100
And the nails through his hands are 
very real and descriptive,

40
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,538
and the way that there is 
that black background.

41
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:22,776
Because light is really emphasizing,
what you're talking about.

42
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:26,472
You know when the knees portrew, 
the way in which the body sort of pushed forward.

43
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:30,535
All of that is highly controlled 
by the way the light is played here.

44
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:32,765
And on his abdomen and his knees.

45
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:38,101
They make his body look very normal, 
like you know, it's the regular man's body,

46
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:41,004
so different than the kind of bodies 
we used to see in the Renaissance.

47
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:41,868
That's true.

48
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:44,836
Although there is some kind of heroism here 
in terms of it's mass and it's strength.

49
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:48,379
- But it's only expressed...
- Belied a little bit by the face though,

50
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,546
- I think, which makes it so vulnerable. 
- It's true.

51
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:55,904
There is this kind of incredible tension, 
because, all of the forces of nature play here.

52
00:02:55,904 --> 00:03:02,430
And we're not quite sure if that rope is strong enough,
we're not quite sure if those men are strong enough.

53
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,402
- It may just fall. 
- They may though think it collapses.

54
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:09,036
Absolutely, this is kind of sense of 
transience in the momentary.

55
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:11,370
And sort of human frailty.

56
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,839
In a sense Caravaggio's brilliance is to be able to 
create the sense of newness and freshness,

57
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:22,968
as if this hadn't been rehearsed hundreds of times
in paintings for hundreds of years.

58
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:26,369
It's as if it's the first time.
