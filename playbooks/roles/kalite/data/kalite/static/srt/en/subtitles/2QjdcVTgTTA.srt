1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:01,927
What I want to do in this

2
00:00:01,927 --> 00:00:02,995
video is show you a way to

3
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:06,235
represent a vector by its component

4
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:09,669
And this is sometimes called engineering notation for vectors.

5
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:11,308
But its super useful because

6
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:12,584
it allows us to keep track

7
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:14,545
of the components of the vector, and

8
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:16,324
it makes it a little bit tangible when we

9
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:18,321
talk about the individual components.

10
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:20,643
So lets break down this vector right over here.

11
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:22,639
I'm just assuming it is a velocity vector, vector v ,

12
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:26,171
its magnitude is 10 m/s and its pointed in the direction

13
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:30,333
30 degrees above, above the horizontal.

14
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,743
So we have broken down these

15
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:33,213
vectors in the past before.

16
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:34,667
The vertical component right

17
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,571
over here, its magnitude,

18
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:40,240
its magnitude would be, so, the magnitude of

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,655
the vertical component right over here,

20
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:45,256
is going to be 10 sin of 30 degrees,

21
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:47,917
is going to be 10 meters per sec times

22
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:50,643
the sin of 30 degrees

23
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:53,243
, sin of 30 degrees, this just comes

24
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:55,844
from basic trigonometry from soh cah toh,

25
00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:57,655
and I covered that in more details

26
00:00:57,655 --> 00:00:59,234
in previous videos

27
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:01,231
sin of 30 degrees is 1/2

28
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:04,342
So this is going to be 5 or 5 meters per second

29
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:08,661
Ten times 1/2 is 5, 5 meters per second so

30
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:11,494
that is the magnitude of its vertical component

31
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:13,259
And in the last few videos I kind of

32
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:16,092
, in a less tangible way of specifying

33
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:20,225
the vertical vector, I often used this notation

34
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:22,223
which isn't that tangible as I like it,

35
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:23,661
that's why I am going to make it little bit

36
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:24,359
better in this video.

37
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,667
I said that the vector

38
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:29,327
its self is 5 meters per sec, 5 meters per sec

39
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:31,467
but what I told you that the direction is

40
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,228
implicitly given because this

41
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:34,250
is a vertical ,

42
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,340
this is a vertical vector and I told you

43
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,826
in previous videos that

44
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:39,590
if its positive, it means up

45
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,192
and if its negative its means down.

46
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:43,909
So I kind of have to give you this context

47
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:45,674
here so that you could appreciate

48
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:46,835
that this is a vector, that just the sign

49
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:48,971
of it is giving you its direction

50
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:50,000
But I have to keep telling you this

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,990
a vertical vector.So its a little bit

52
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,955
it wasn't that tangible,and so we had the same issue,

53
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:56,840
when we talked about the

54
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,276
we had the same issue talked about

55
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:01,394
the horizontal vectors, so this horizontal vector

56
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:05,000
right over here, the magnittude of it,

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,501
the magnitude of this horizontal vector is going

58
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:10,334
to be 10 cosine of 30 degres.

59
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,841
And once again comes straight out of basic trigonometry.

60
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,649
tan cosine of 30 degrees and so

61
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:17,846
cosine of 30 degres is

62
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,668
square-root of three over 2

63
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:21,733
square root of 3 over 2.

64
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,610
multiply it by ten, you get

65
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,584
5 square roots of 3 meters per sec.

66
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:30,674
And once again in previous videos

67
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,671
I said, look this is actually

68
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:34,668
I used this notation sometimes

69
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:35,667
where I was actually saying the vector is

70
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,965
5 square root of 3 metres per sec

71
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:40,667
but in order to ensure that this wasn't not just the

72
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,331
magnitude I kept having to tell you that

73
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:43,631
in the horizontal direction if its positive

74
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,333
, its going to the right and

75
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,578
if its negative its going to the left.

76
00:02:47,578 --> 00:02:49,667
But what I want to do in this video

77
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,990
is give us a convention so that I don’t have to

78
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,894
keep doing this for the direction

79
00:02:53,894 --> 00:02:56,634
and it all, it makes all a little bit more tangible

80
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,235
And so what we do is we introduce

81
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:02,253
the ideas of, or the idea of unit vectors.

82
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:04,575
Of unit vectors.

83
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:07,176
so by definition we introduce the

84
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:09,667
vector i, the vector i, sometimes its called

85
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,888
i hat, and I'll draw it like here.

86
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,839
So the vector.Let me make it a little bit smaller,

87
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:17,671
So the vector i hat,

88
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:20,829
so that right there is a picture of the vector i hat

89
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,594
we put a hat on top of i

90
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:24,591
to show that it’s a unit vector.

91
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:26,588
And what a unit vector is,

92
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:28,585
so the i hat vector goes in the

93
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:29,653
positive x -direction.

94
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:31,325
That‘s just how its defined

95
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:33,972
and we also, unit vector tells us

96
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:36,247
that its magnitude is one.

97
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:39,067
So, the magnitude of the vector i hat

98
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:42,006
is equal to one and its direction

99
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:45,257
is in the positive x -direction.

100
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:46,975
So if we really wanted to specify

101
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:52,501
this kind of x -component vector in a better way.

102
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:55,241
We really should call it

103
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:55,892
, we really should call it,

104
00:03:55,892 --> 00:03:59,733
five square roots of 3 times this unit vector.

105
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,400
Because it 5, this green vector over here

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,994
is going to be 5 squared roots of 3

107
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,969
times this vector right over here.

108
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,316
cause' this vector just has length 1.

109
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:11,635
So its 5 squared of 3 times the unit vector.

110
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:13,585
and what I like about this is that

111
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:14,560
now I don’t have to, tell you

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,675
Remember this a horizontal vector,

113
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:16,650
positive is,

114
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,904
positive is to the right and

115
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:18,972
negative to the left,

116
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:19,901
It’s implicit here,

117
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,991
because clearly if it’s a positive value

118
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:24,963
Its going to be a positive multiple of i,

119
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,333
its going to go to the right

120
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,564
If its a negative value

121
00:04:27,564 --> 00:04:28,667
it flips around the vector and

122
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,164
its goes to the left .

123
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:31,836
So this is a actually a better way of specifying,

124
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:34,994
of specifying,

125
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:37,177
the x component vector

126
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,895
or if I broke it down this vector v,

127
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,335
into its x components

128
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:42,239
this is a better way of specifying that vector.

129
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:44,653
Same thing for the y -direction,

130
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,836
We can define a unit vector

131
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:48,508
and let me pick a color,

132
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:49,669
that I have not used yet,

133
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:51,667
let me find a, oh, this pink I haven’t used.

134
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,220
We can define a unit vector

135
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,660
that goes straight up in the

136
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,517
y-direction called unit vector j

137
00:04:57,517 --> 00:05:01,836
and once again the magnitude of unit vector j

138
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:02,672
is equal to 1

139
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:05,319
This little hat on top of it tells us

140
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,316
or sometimes is called a caret,

141
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:08,663
a caret character,

142
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:10,985
tells us that it is a vector but

143
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,007
it is a unit vector

144
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,493
and has magnitude of 1.

145
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:16,000
And by definition the vector j

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
goes in, has a magnitude of 1

147
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,666
in positive y-direction, so this

148
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,174
the y -component of this vector,

149
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:25,010
instead of saying its,

150
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,914
5 meters per second in upwards direction

151
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:28,493
and instead of saying that its implicitly upwards

152
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,908
because the vertical vector or its

153
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:34,298
vertical component in its positive,we can now be a little bit more

154
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:36,341
Or a little bit more specific about it ,we could

155
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:37,827
say it’s a equal to

156
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:41,667
equal to 5 times j

157
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:44,004
, 5 times j

158
00:05:44,004 --> 00:05:46,326
because you see this magenta vector,

159
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:49,251
is going the exact same direction as j

160
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:51,248
, the exact same direction as j

161
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:52,641
it is just 5 times longer,

162
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:53,895
I don’t know if its exactly 5 times,

163
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,242
I'm trying to estimate it right now.

164
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:57,007
Its 5 times longer

165
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,004
Now what's really cool about this, is besides

166
00:05:59,004 --> 00:06:01,233
just being able to express the components as

167
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:03,508
now multiple of explicit vectors,

168
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:05,923
instead of just being able to do that

169
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:08,067
which we did do, or we are

170
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,335
representing the components as explicit vectors

171
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,564
we also know that the vector, v

172
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:14,236
is the sum of its components,

173
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:15,676
if you add, if you start with this, this

174
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,230
green vector right here

175
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,320
and you add this vertical component

176
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,317
right over here you have head to tails

177
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,639
you get, you get the blue vector,

178
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,007
and so we can actually use the components

179
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:29,004
to represent the vector itself

180
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:31,400
we don't always have to draw like this

181
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,667
So we can write,

182
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,320
that vector, v is equal to

183
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,992
its equal to vector,

184
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:39,639
let me write it this way, is equal to its x-component

185
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,007
vector plus the y- component vector

186
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:44,979
, plus the y- component vector,

187
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,580
And we can write that, x-component vector

188
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,295
is 5 square roots of 3 times i

189
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,571
, 5 square roots of 3 times i,

190
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:57,007
and then its going to be plus

191
00:06:57,007 --> 00:07:00,583
the y component, the vertical component

192
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,626
which s five times j,

193
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:06,899
which s five times j

194
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,964
and so what's really neat here

195
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:11,667
is now you can specify any vector

196
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,982
in two dimensions,

197
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:15,676
by some combintion of i and j

198
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:18,067
scaled up combination of i and j

199
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:20,970
and if you want to go in three dimension, and you

200
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,828
often will,

201
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:25,568
as specially physics class moves on through the year

202
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:30,165
you can introduce a vector in the positive z-direction

203
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,000
depending upon how you want to do it,

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,509
although z is normally up and down,

205
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:35,645
but whatever the next dimension is

206
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:37,596
you can divine, divide a vector k

207
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:39,667
that goes into that third dimension

208
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,667
here I will do it in a kind of unconventional way

209
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,308
I'll make k go in that direction.

210
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:45,490
Although the standard convention when you do

211
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,977
in the three dimensions is that k is the

212
00:07:46,977 --> 00:07:48,648
up and down dimension.

213
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:50,645
But this by itself is already petty neat because

214
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:52,921
we can now represnt any vector,

215
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:55,000
any vector through its components

216
00:07:55,000 --> 99:59:59,999
and its also going to make the math much easier.
