1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
   

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,560
The standard question you often
get in your algebra class is

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,300
they will give you this
equation and it'll say identify

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,050
the conic section and
graph it if you can.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,140
And the equation they give you
won't be in the standard form,

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,845
because if it was you could
just kind of pattern match with

7
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:15,470
what I showed in some of the
previous videos and you'd

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,080
be able to get it.

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,600
So let's do a question
like and let's see if

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,230
we can figure it out.

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:28,990
So what I have here is 9x
squared plus 4y squared

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:41,400
plus 54x minus 8y plus
49 is equal to 0.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,050
And once again, I mean who
knows what this is it's just

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,000
not in the standard form.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,500
And actually one quick clue to
tell you what this is you look

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,980
at the x squared and the y
squared terms if there are.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,130
If there's only an x squared
term and then there's just a y

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,990
and not a y squared term, then
you're probably dealing with a

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,970
parabola, and we'll go
into that more later.

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,770
Or if it's the other way
around, if it's just an x

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,330
term and a y squared term,
it's probably a parabola.

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,555
But assuming that we're dealing
with a circle, an ellipse, or a

23
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:09,450
hyperbola, there will be an x
squared term and a

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,970
y squared term.

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,970
If they both kind of have the
same number in front of them,

26
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,580
that's a pretty good clue
that we're going to be

27
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,710
dealing with a circle.

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,550
If they both have different
numbers, but they're both

29
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,550
positive in front of them,
that's a pretty good clue

30
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,500
we're probably going to be
dealing with an ellipse.

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,906
If one of them has a negative
number in front of them and

32
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:30,420
the other one has a positive
number, that tells you that

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,690
we're probably going to be
dealing with a hyperbola.

34
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,290
But with that said, I mean that
might help you identify things

35
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,440
very quickly at this level, but
it doesn't help you graph it or

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,500
get into the standard form.

37
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,370
So let's get it in
the standard form.

38
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,720
And the key to getting it in
the standard form is really

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,790
just completing the square.

40
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,710
And I encourage you to re-watch
the completing the square

41
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,245
video, because that's all we're
going to do right here to get

42
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:49,740
it into the standard form.

43
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,490
So the first thing I like to do
to complete the square, and

44
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,590
you're going to have to do it
for the x variables and for

45
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,190
the y terms, is group
the x and y terms.

46
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:56,590
Let's see.

47
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:02,796
The x terms are 9x
squared plus 54x.

48
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:09,370
   

49
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,740
And let's do the y
terms in magenta.

50
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:22,130
So then you have plus 4y
squared minus 8y and then you

51
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,500
have-- let me do this in a
different color-- plus

52
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,290
49 is equal to 0.

53
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,060
And so the easy thing to do
when you complete the square,

54
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,320
the thing I like to do is, it's
very clear we can factor out a

55
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,390
9 out of both of these numbers,
and we can factor out a

56
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,460
4 out of both of those.

57
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,790
Let's do that, because
that will help us

58
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,260
complete the square.

59
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,630
So this is the same thing
is 9 times x squared plus

60
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,790
9 times 6 is 54, 6x.

61
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,490
I'm going to add something
else here, but I'll

62
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,480
leave it blank for now.

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,250
Plus 4 times y squared minus
2y I'm probably going to add

64
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,520
something here too, so I'll
leave it blank for now.

65
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,870
Plus 49 is equal to 0.

66
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,880
So what are we
going to add here?

67
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,980
We're going to
complete the square.

68
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,340
We want to add some number here
so that this whole three term

69
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,780
expression becomes
a perfect square.

70
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,990
Likewise, we're going to add
some number here, so this

71
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,750
three term number expression
becomes a perfect square.

72
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,240
And of course whatever we add
on the side, we're going

73
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,670
to have to multiply it by
9, because we're really

74
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,170
adding nine times that.

75
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,740
And add it on to that side.

76
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,135
Whatever we add here, we're
going to have to multiply

77
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,160
it times 4 and add
it on that side.

78
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,180
If I put a 1 here, it's really
like as if I had a 4 here,

79
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,720
because 1 times 4 is 4 and if I
had a 1 here it's 1 times 9.

80
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,930
So 9 there.

81
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,220
Let's do that.

82
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,990
When we complete the square,
we just take half of

83
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,130
this coefficient.

84
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,100
This coefficient is 6, we
take half of it is 3, we

85
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,290
square it, we get a 9.

86
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,420
   

87
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,850
Remember it's an equation, so
what you do to one side, you

88
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,140
have to do to the other.

89
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,320
So if we added a 9 here, we're
actually adding 9 times 9 to

90
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,030
the left-hand side of the
equation, so we have to add 81

91
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,070
to the right-hand side to make
the equation still hold.

92
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,550
And you could kind of view
it if we go back up here.

93
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,490
This is the same thing, just
to make that clear as if I

94
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,200
added plus 81 right here.

95
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,640
Of course I would have had
to add plus 81 up here.

96
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,210
Now let's go to the y terms.

97
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,980
You take half of this
coefficient is minus 2,

98
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,750
half of that is minus 1.

99
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,660
You square it, you get plus 1.

100
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,350
1 times 4, so we're really
adding 4 to the left-hand

101
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,170
side of the equation.

102
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,210
And just so you understand
what I did here.

103
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,030
This is equivalent as if I just
added a 4 here, and then I

104
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,520
later just factored out this 4.

105
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,350
   

106
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,930
And so what does this become?

107
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,630
This expression
is 9 times what?

108
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,820
This is the square of-- you
could factor this, but we did

109
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:05,940
it on purpose-- it's x plus 3
squared and then we have plus

110
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,910
4 times-- What is
this right here?

111
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,430
That's y minus 1 squared.

112
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,560
You might want to review
factoring of polynomial or

113
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,280
completing the square if
you found that step

114
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,290
a little daunting.

115
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:26,330
And then we have plus 49 is
equal to 0 plus 81 plus

116
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,550
84 is equal to 85.

117
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:38,080
All right, so now we have 9
times plus 3 squared plus 4

118
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,180
times y minus 1 squared.

119
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,360
And let's subtract
49 from both sides.

120
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,380
That is equal to-- let's see if
I subtract 50 from 85 I get 35,

121
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,360
so if I subtract 49, I get 36.

122
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,560
   

123
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,300
And now we are getting close to
the standard form of something,

124
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,130
but remember all the standard
forms we did except for the

125
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,000
circle-- we had a y-- and we
know this isn't a circle,

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,780
because we have these weird
coefficients, well not weird

127
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,520
but different coefficients
in front of these terms.

128
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,040
So to get the 1 on the
right-hand side let's

129
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,140
divide everything by 36.

130
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:20,770
If you divide everything by 36,
this term becomes x plus 3

131
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:28,030
squared over see 9 over 36 is
the same thing as 1 over 4, and

132
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,780
then you have plus y minus 1
squared 4 over 36 is the same

133
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,140
thing as 1 over 9 and all
of that is equal to 1.

134
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,740
And there you go.

135
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,580
We have it in the standard
form, and you can see our

136
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,990
intuition at the beginning
the problem was correct.

137
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,010
This is indeed an ellipse, and
now we can actually graph it.

138
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,860
So first of all, actually
good place to start, where's

139
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,030
the center of the this
ellipse going to be?

140
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,640
It's going to be x is
equal to negative 3.

141
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,820
What x value makes
this whole terms 0?

142
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,980
So it's going to be x is
equal to minus 3, and y is

143
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,940
going to be equal to 1.

144
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,910
What y value makes this
term 0? y is equal to 1.

145
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,310
That's our center.

146
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,510
So let's graph that, and then
we can draw the ellipse.

147
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,475
It's going to be in the
negative quadrant.

148
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:22,680
This is our x-axis and
this is our y-axis.

149
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,660
And then the center of our
ellipse is at minus 3

150
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,010
and positive 1, so
that's the center.

151
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,350
And then, what is the
radius in the x direction?

152
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,640
We just take the square
root of this, so it's 2.

153
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,200
So in the x direction we
go two to the right.

154
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,800
We go two to the left.

155
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,340
And in the y direction,
what do we do?

156
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,120
Well we go up three
and down three.

157
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,890
The square root of this.

158
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,610
Let me do that.

159
00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:06,150
   

160
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,430
Remember you have to take the
square root of both of those.

161
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,080
The vertical axis is actually
the major radius or the

162
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,430
semi-major axis is 3, because
that's the longer one.

163
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,960
And then the 2 is the minor
radius, because that's

164
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,100
the shorter one.

165
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,780
And now we're ready to
draw this ellipse.

166
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,310
I'll draw it in brown.

167
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,410
Let me see if I can
do this properly.

168
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,820
I have a shaky hand.

169
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,940
All right, it looks
something like that.

170
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,950
And there you go.

171
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,730
We took this kind of crazy
looking thing, and all we did

172
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,470
is algebraically manipulate it.

173
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,980
We just completed the squares
with the x's and the y terms.

174
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,180
And then we divided both sides
by this number right here and

175
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,465
we got it into the
standard form.

176
00:08:50,465 --> 00:08:51,970
We said oh this is an ellipse.

177
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,800
We have both of these terms,
they're both positive, we're

178
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,090
adding we're not subtracting,
they have different

179
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,930
coefficients underneath here.

180
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,510
So we're ready to go over the
ellipse, and we realized that

181
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,160
the center was at minus 3,1,
and then we just drew the

182
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,990
major radius, or the major
axis and the minor axis.

183
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,490
See you in the next video.

184
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,269
