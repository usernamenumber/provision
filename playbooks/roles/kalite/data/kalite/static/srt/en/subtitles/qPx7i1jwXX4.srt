1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,630
On Monday morning, there
were 12 inches

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,290
of snow on the ground.

4
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,130
The weather warmed up, and
by Tuesday morning,

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,520
2 inches had melted.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,440
All right, so we'll
have 10 left.

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,350
2 more inches melted by
Wednesday morning.

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,980
This pattern continued
throughout the week until no

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,300
more snow was left.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,280
So they're essentially saying
that we had 12 inches of snow

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,790
on the ground on Monday and that
every day after that, two

12
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,640
inches melted.

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,220
So after Tuesday, you'd have
10 inches, and after

14
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,780
Wednesday, you'd have
eight inches, and

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,220
that pattern continued.

16
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,640
And what they say is create an
equation and a graph to show

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,790
the relationship between the day
and the amount of snow on

18
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,330
the ground.

19
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,670
So let's define a variable that
tells us how far away we

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,670
are from Monday.

21
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:49,010
So let's let x equal
days after Monday.

22
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:57,040
   

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,050
And then let y be equal to
inches of snow on the ground.

24
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:11,560
   

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,110
So, one way to think about it
is, OK, when x is 0, when

26
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,905
we're on Monday, when we're 0
days after Monday, we're going

27
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:23,880
to have 12 inches of snow on
the ground, and every day

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,280
after that, we're going
to lose two inches.

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,550
So if we're on Tuesday, we're
going to have 2 inches times

30
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,975
1, because Tuesday is one day,
so if x is 1, that means we're

31
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:34,890
on Tuesday.

32
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,130
If x is 2, that means we're 2
times 2, we've lost 4 inches,

33
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,770
which is what the case
is on Wednesday.

34
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,280
So this is our equation for the
relationship between the

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,370
day and the amount of
snow on the ground.

36
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,885
x is the day, how many days
after Monday, and then y is

37
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:57,440
the inches of the snow
left on the ground.

38
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,670
We start with 12, and
then every day we

39
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,060
lose exactly two inches.

40
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,310
Now let's graph this.

41
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,040
   

42
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,009
So I'll make my vertical axis
the y-axis, that's inches on

43
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:11,780
the ground.

44
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,420
y is equal to inches
left on the ground.

45
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,400
And then the horizontal axis,
that is our x-axis-- let me

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:31,940
scroll down a little bit-- this
is days after Monday.

47
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,200
   

48
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,790
And so we have 0 days after
Monday, we have 1, 2,

49
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:46,000
3, 4, 5, and 6.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,630
And then on Monday, which is
exactly 0 days after Monday,

51
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,380
that is Monday, we have 12
inches on the ground.

52
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,970
So I'll do it up here, so we
have 12 inches on the ground

53
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,210
right there.

54
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,740
And actually, I could do
a table if you like.

55
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,420
Let me draw this.

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:11,610
So if we do x and y, this is
the days after Monday, so

57
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,050
there's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

58
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,730
And then on the first day, we
have 12 inches, on Monday, 0

59
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,770
days after Monday.

60
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,610
Then we lose two inches
each day.

61
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:28,600
On day 1 we have 10, day
2, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0.

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,690
So let's plot these points.

63
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,240
We already plotted 0, 12
in that blue color.

64
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,820
Now let's plot 1, 10.

65
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,505
1, 10 is right about there.

66
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:41,690
It'll be right over there.

67
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,500
Then we can plot 2, 8.

68
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,730
So 2 days after Monday,
we have 8

69
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,450
inches left on the ground.

70
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,580
So this is on Wednesday,
so that's 8 inches.

71
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,650
And then on 3 days after Monday,
we have 6 inches on

72
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,900
the ground.

73
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,950
   

74
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,340
You can see that a line
is forming here.

75
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,810
And then if we go to 4 days
after Monday, we have 4 inches

76
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,060
on the ground.

77
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,809
   

78
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:18,890
So that is 4.

79
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,850
And then 5 days after
Monday, we have 2

80
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,100
inches on the ground.

81
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,340
   

82
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,350
And then finally, on the sixth
day, 6 days after Monday-- so

83
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,650
what are we at, Sunday now-- we
are going to have no inches

84
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,550
on the ground.

85
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,450
So that's that right there.

86
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,580
And you can see that there's
this line that formed, because

87
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,720
this is a linear relationship.

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,230
It looks a little curvy because
I didn't draw it

89
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,690
perfectly, but that is a line.

90
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,660
So we've done everything.

91
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,010
We've created the equation.

92
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,030
We start with 12 inches,
every day after

93
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,500
that we lose two inches.

94
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,050
And we showed a graph that
depicts the relationship.

95
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,400
