1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,180
In the last video we had this
second order linear

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,320
homogeneous differential
equation and we just tried it

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,700
out the solution y is equal
to e to the rx.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,720
And we figured out that if you
try that out, that it works

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,540
for particular r's.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,990
And those r's, we figured out in
the last one, were minus 2

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,490
and minus 3.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,880
But it came out of factoring
this characteristic equation.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,060
And watch the last video if
you forgot how we got that

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,160
characteristic equation.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,310
And we ended up with this
general solution for this

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,340
differential equation.

13
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,439
And you could try it
out if you don't

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,840
believe me that it works.

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,150
But what if we don't want the
general solution, we want to

16
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,530
find the particular solution?

17
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,120
Well then we need initial
conditions.

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,880
So let's do this differential
equation with some initial

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,360
conditions.

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,610
So let's say the initial
conditions are-- we have the

21
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,560
solution that we figured
out in the last video.

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,330
Let me rewrite the differential
equation.

23
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:01,330
So it was the second derivative
plus 5 times the

24
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:07,460
first derivative plus 6 times
the function, is equal to 0.

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,770
And the initial conditions we're
given is that y of 0 is

26
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,010
equal to 2.

27
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,120
And the first derivative
at 0, or y prime at

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,640
0, is equal to 3.

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,460
What does y equal at the point
0, and what is the slope at

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,990
0-- at x is equal to 0--
and the slope is 3.

31
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,420
So how do we use these to
solve for c1 and c2?

32
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,550
Well, let's just use the first
initial condition. y of 0 is

33
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:44,530
equal to 2, which is equal
to-- essentially just

34
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,010
substitute 0 in into
this equation.

35
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,670
So it's c1 times e to the
minus 2 times 0, that's

36
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,970
essentially e to the 0,
so that's just 1.

37
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,760
So it's c1 times 1, which is
c1, plus c2 times e to the

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,960
minus 3 times 0.

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,230
This is e to the 0,
so it's just 1.

40
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,410
So plus c2.

41
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,979
So the first equation we get
when we substitute our first

42
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,590
initial condition is essentially
c1 plus c2 is

43
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,680
equal to 2.

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,800
Now let's apply our second
initial condition that tells

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,620
us the slope at x
is equal to 0.

46
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,580
So y prime is 0.

47
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,170
So this is our general solution,
let's take its

48
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,180
derivative, and then
we can use this.

49
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,590
So y prime of x is
equal to what?

50
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:39,360
The derivative of this is equal
to minus 2 c1 times e to

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
the minus 2x.

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,060
And what's the derivative
of this?

53
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:51,710
It's minus 3 c2 times
e to the minus 3x.

54
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,970
And now we can use our initial
condition, y prime at 0.

55
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,620
So when x is equal
to 0, what's the

56
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,760
right-hand side equal?

57
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,130
It's minus 2 times c1 and then
e to the minus 0, e to the 0,

58
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,390
that's just 1.

59
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,360
Minus 3 c2, and then once again
x is 0, so e to the

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,350
minus 3 times 0,
that's just 1.

61
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,980
So it's just 1 times
minus 3 c2.

62
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,920
And it tells us that when x is
equal to 0, what does this

63
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,580
whole derivative equal?

64
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,050
Well, it equals 3, right?

65
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,940
Y prime of 0 is equal to 3.

66
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,990
So now we go back into your
first year of algebra.

67
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,100
We have two equations-- two
linear equations with two

68
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,840
unknowns-- and we could solve.

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,140
Let me write them in
a form that you're

70
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,970
probably more used to.

71
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:42,980
So the first one is c1 plus
c2 is equal to 2.

72
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:55,650
And the second one is minus 2
c1 minus 3 c2 is equal to 3.

73
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,390
So what can we do?

74
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,230
Let's multiply this
top equation by 2.

75
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,260
There's a ton of ways to solve
this, but if you multiply the

76
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,540
top equation times 2, you'll
get-- and I'll do this is a

77
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,130
different color, just so that
it's changed-- I'm just

78
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,570
multiplying the top one by 2,
you get 2 c1 plus 2 c2 is

79
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,560
equal to 4.

80
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,230
And now we can add these
two equations.

81
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,360
Minus 2 c1 plus 2,
those cancel out.

82
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:27,140
So minus 3 plus 2, you get
minus c2 is equal to 7.

83
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:33,360
Or we could say that c2
is equal to minus 7.

84
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,990
And now we can substitute
back in here.

85
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:41,950
We have c1 plus c2-- c2 is minus
7-- so minus 7, is equal

86
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:49,500
to 9, or we know that c--
oh sorry, no I'm already

87
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,310
confusing myself.

88
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,950
My brain was getting
ahead of myself.

89
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,600
c1 plus c2, that's minus 7,
is equal to 2, right?

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,340
I'm just substituting back
into this differential

91
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,950
equation-- sorry, to this
equation, not a differential

92
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,580
it's just a simple linear
equation-- and then we get c1

93
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,290
is equal to 9.

94
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,510
And now we have our particular
solution to the

95
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,790
differential equation.

96
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,460
So this was our general
solution.

97
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,240
We can just substitute our c1's
and our c2's back in.

98
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,480
We have our particular solution
for those initial conditions,

99
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,440
and I think that warrants
a different color.

100
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,993
So our particular solution is
y of x is equal to c1,

101
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:34,190
which we figured out is 9e to the
minus 2x, plus c2-- well, c2

102
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:41,230
is minus 7-- minus 7e
to the minus 3x.

103
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,510
That is the particular solution
to our original

104
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,415
differential equation.

105
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:48,230
And it might be a good exercise
for you to actually

106
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,975
test it out.

107
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:53,440
This particular solution to this
differential equation.

108
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,160
I'll do another example
in the next video.

109
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,790
I'll see you soon.
