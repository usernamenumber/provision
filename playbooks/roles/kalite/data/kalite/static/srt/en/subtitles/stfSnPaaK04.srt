1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,770
It is common misconception that price levels are dictated purely by the quantity of money out there.

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,769
To see why this is not the case, let's imagine an island that has two players in it.

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:21,168
So it has a farmer, who will obviously produce food and it also has, let's call him a landlord/builder,

4
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:28,302
who will either rent out buildings or can build you more buildings or build themselves more buildings to rent out.

5
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:33,769
And we are living in a reality where all you need is food and shelter. And let's imagine one reality,

6
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:38,572
where this island or whatever, this country, whatever you want to call it,

7
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,375
they have not discovered a lot of currencies.

8
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,902
So they only have a little bit of gold.

9
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:46,837
So maybe the farmer only has a couple of gold coins to start off with

10
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:52,337
and the landlord/builder also only has a couple of gold coins to start off.

11
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:56,042
They are very currency poor, only a little bit of gold.

12
00:00:56,042 --> 00:01:00,642
But they are very optimistic. The farmer says hey, you know what, things are looking good landlord,

13
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:05,902
I want to rent a nice building from you for my family and

14
00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:09,922
I want you to build more buildings. So here take both of these coins

15
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:15,172
and build me or rent me out something nice. And he gets both coins over here.

16
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:20,367
And then the landlord/builder says wow, things are good, the farmer seems pretty optimistic.

17
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:26,368
Farmer, I want you to buy me, I want you to grow me a ton of really good food because things are good.

18
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:34,102
So here take four coins from me and really grow me a ton of really nice food.

19
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:42,702
You know stuff that is really hard to grow. So he gets those four coins now.

20
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:47,707
These are now gone. The farmer doesn't have those anymore.

21
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:51,589
Now the farmer is feeling really great, really optimistic.

22
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:54,769
And these are now gone, now the landlord has given them to the farmer.

23
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:58,175
The farmer is feeling really optimistic and says, landlord, you know what,

24
00:01:58,175 --> 00:02:01,925
I'm feeling even better than I did before. Why don't you build me even a few more buildings.

25
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:06,589
I want to expand my house even more. But now the landlord is like man, you know,

26
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:09,095
you already have given me a lot of money and I already have a lot of work to do.

27
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:13,590
you gotta pay me more, if you want me to work overtime, because that is going to take time away

28
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,848
from my family and all the rest.

29
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:21,300
And the farmer says, sure. Last time I paid you two gold coins for some buildings and now

30
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,839
I pay you three gold coins for the same number of buildings.

31
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:31,367
And so he gives three gold coins and all he is going to get for return is what he used

32
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:33,337
to get for two gold coins.

33
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:38,850
And if you think about it, the price has gone up for whatever service or product the builder is providing.

34
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,336
And he gives those three gold coins to the landlord/the builder.

35
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:46,036
And then the builder says, oh you know, things are really good, I'm getting a lot of business

36
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:48,927
from the farmer, I can get even more food from the farmer.

37
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:51,702
And he goes to the farmer and says, hey give me what you just gave me that last time

38
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:55,376
for two gold coins. The farmer says, no you know what, I'm really busy now.

39
00:02:55,376 --> 00:03:00,107
I'm almost tapped up. If you want me to work overtime or expand my facilities,

40
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:02,769
you gotta give me three gold coins for what I gave you before.

41
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,840
And besides that the cost of my houses has just gone up to three gold coins,

42
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,034
so you have to give me three gold coins now. So the builder says, oh sure, I will give you three gold coins.

43
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:16,703
So the one thing I want you to notice in this video is, we only started off with two gold coins

44
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:20,847
for each of these players but because they were really confident, because they kept spending

45
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:27,102
with each other, because there were a lot of transactions, there was a high velocity of the actual money

46
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:31,000
that you actually had an increase in prices.
