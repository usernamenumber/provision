1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
   

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,030
Welcome to the video on
the introduction to

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,020
differential equations.

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,200
What's a differential?

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,700
Well, we've been doing things
like if I said that y is

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,900
equal to, I don't know, 3x.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,497
If we took the derivative of
both sides of this equation and

8
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:18,720
we said -- one of the notations
we used is we said dy

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,620
over dx is equal to 3.

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,830
We took the derivative
of both sides of that.

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,460
But this you could almost
use differential notation.

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,640
dy is a differential and
dx is a differential.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,730
What does a differential mean?

14
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,170
A differential just means an
infinitely small change in y,

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,140
in this case, so that's a
differential in y, or an

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,330
infinitely small change in x.

17
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,570
So a differential it's like a
difference -- when we learned

18
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,340
slope, we said slope is change
in y over change in x.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,950
Or you could say the difference
in y over difference in x.

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,100
But once we started taking the
slope of curves we had to make

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,130
this difference and this
difference approach 0.

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,800
That's what a differential
essentially is.

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,900
A differential is a really,
really, really, really

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,810
infinitely small difference.

25
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,910
So what is a
differential equation?

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,680
Well it's an equation that
involves differentials.

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,460
So, for example, this is
a differential equation.

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,070
This will be the first
example that we solve.

29
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:26,790
dy over dx is equal
to x squared plus 1.

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,520
So how do we solve this
differential equation?

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,750
Well, there's a couple of
ways you could say it.

32
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,030
You say oh, well this is the
same thing as f prime of x.

33
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,860
You know, y to the function
of x and you just take the

34
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,530
antiderivative of both sides.

35
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,700
But let's solve this properly
as a differential equation.

36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,330
So you can actually manipulate
these differentials the same

37
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,780
way that you would manipulate
numbers for the most part.

38
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,030
And so what could we do here?

39
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,840
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by dx.

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:00,510
So you get, for a very small
change in y, dy, you get x

41
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,550
squared plus 1 times a very
small change in the x.

42
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,500
Or another way to say it is for
a very small change in x, if

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,330
you want to figure out how much
does y change, you multiply

44
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,760
times x squared plus 1 wherever
you are on the curve.

45
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,190
So what does that do for us?

46
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,240
Well let's take the
antiderivative of both

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,810
sides or let's take the
integral of both sides.

48
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,890
And if you watched all of the
videos on integration and the

49
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,590
definite integral and area and
a curve, you realize that an

50
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,950
integral is essentially a sum,
it's kind of an infinite

51
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,400
sum of a bunch of these
infinitely small dy's.

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,020
So if you take the sum of
all of the changes in dy's,

53
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,070
you're left with a y on
this side of this equation.

54
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,620
You might want to re-watch
all the videos that we

55
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,010
did on integration.

56
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,760
Then what is this?

57
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,670
This is essentially just
-- this is the indefinite

58
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,230
integral of x squared plus 1.

59
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,020
So it's the
antiderivative of that.

60
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,510
And what's the antiderivative
of x squared plus 1?

61
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,500
Well it's x to the
third over 3.

62
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,690
We're just taking the
derivative backwards.

63
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,690
And once again, watch the
videos on the antiderivative.

64
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,030
There's I think eight
or nine of them.

65
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,120
Plus x and then plus c.

66
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,890
And where does the c come from?

67
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,760
Well we know that when we
take the derivative of a

68
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,590
constant it goes to 0.

69
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,540
So when you take the
antiderivative, we're like

70
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,140
well, there could have
been a constant there.

71
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,290
And that's where that
plus c comes from.

72
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:33,530
So this is the general solution
to this differential equation.

73
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,770
And that's something
interesting.

74
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,910
So with traditional equations,
the solution tended to

75
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,680
be a number, right?

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,920
If I just told you y is
equal to 2y minus 1.

77
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,820
Then you would get minus y
is equal to minus 1, you'd

78
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,380
get y is equal to 1.

79
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,390
So this is a traditional
equation and your solution

80
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,360
was just a value -- you
solved for the variable.

81
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,370
Differential equations
are something different.

82
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,690
The solution is
actually a function.

83
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,470
You're saying what
function satisfies this

84
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,380
differential equation.

85
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,910
So that's something
to keep in mind.

86
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,670
Right now we're doing very
basic differential equations,

87
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,490
but that's something to keep in
mind the whole time you learn

88
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,210
differential equations.

89
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,520
I think I'll eventually do
a play list on essentially

90
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,600
an introductory course on
differential equations that

91
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
you would take at college.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,880
And that applies even when
you start doing partial

93
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,090
differential equations,
et cetera, et cetera.

94
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,730
The solution to a differential
equation is not a number,

95
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,660
it is a function.

96
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,490
So anyway, this was the
general solution to this

97
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,490
differential equation.

98
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,370
And if you want the particular
solution, people normally give

99
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,120
you initial conditions or they
give you points on the function

100
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,740
and then you can
substitute back.

101
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,150
In this problem they said that
dy dx equals x squared plus 1.

102
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,230
And they said that -- let me
switch colors -- they said that

103
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,980
y is equal to 1 at x is equal
to 1, or y is equal to 1

104
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,690
when x is equal to 1.

105
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,380
So we can use this information
now to solve for c.

106
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,080
How do you do that?

107
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,060
Well it says y is equal to 1.

108
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,440
So 1 is equal to when x is
equal to 1, is equal to 1/3,

109
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:18,170
right, 1 over 3, 1 to the third
power over 3, plus 1 plus c.

110
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,130
And let's see what I can do.

111
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,200
Subtract one from both
sides -- this comes 0.

112
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,910
Subtract 1/3 from both
sides and you get c is

113
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,420
equal to minus 1/3.

114
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,860
So using these conditions, a
point where this function

115
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,560
crosses through, we can now
give you the particular

116
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
solution to this
differential equation.

117
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:48,010
And that is y is equal to x to
the third over 3 plus x minus

118
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,280
1/3, and then we just
solve for the c.

119
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,670
And if you don't believe me,
take this expression and

120
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,760
substitute it here and you will
see that it equals, if you were

121
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,310
to take the derivative of y
with respect to x, you would

122
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,670
see that it equals
x squared plus 1.

123
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,550
Let's do another one.

124
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,410
   

125
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,420
So it tells us -- so this is a
little bit more interesting --

126
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:24,160
it says dy dx is equal to
x over y, and it has

127
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,830
the same conditions.

128
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,980
It says y equals
1 at x equals 1.

129
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,640
Or when x equals 1, y equals 1.

130
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,790
So let's find the function
that satisfies this equation.

131
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,130
This one's interesting because
we have an x and a y on

132
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,380
the right hand side
of the equation.

133
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,910
So this kind of looks like
something we got after we

134
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,680
did some type of implicit
differentiation.

135
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,480
But let's see where we go.

136
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,840
So let's do the same thing.

137
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,280
Let's multiply both sides of
this equation by dx until you

138
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,380
get dy is equal to x over y dx.

139
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,290
And let's get this y over
onto the dy side, because

140
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,280
it will be easy to take
the antiderivative then.

141
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:11,990
So we get y dy is
equal to x dx.

142
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,796
Now we can take the integral of
both sides of this equation, or

143
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:18,070
take the antiderivative on this
side with respect to y on

144
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,960
the side with respect to x.

145
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,630
   

146
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,790
I don't know why I
did it in brown.

147
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,650
So what's the
antiderivative here?

148
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:34,500
Well, it is y squared over 2.

149
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,060
And I could say plus
c, some constant.

150
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,180
Let me do that.

151
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,750
There could be a constant here.

152
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,410
I'll call it c1.

153
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,410
We don't know what
that constant is.

154
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:57,590
And that equals x squared
over 2 plus c2, right?

155
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,720
Or some other constant.

156
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,630
Maybe it's the same
number, I don't know.

157
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,350
But we don't know what
either of these are.

158
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,010
I could re-write it as --
let's see, what could I do?

159
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,820
Let me take the x
out of that side.

160
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:18,450
So I could have y squared over
2 minus x squared over 2 is

161
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,700
equal to -- and let me subtract
this from that side so I get

162
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,070
the constants all on the right
hand side of the equation.

163
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,840
c2 minus c1.

164
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,960
I just took a c1, put it on the
right hand side, took the x

165
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,530
squared over 2, put it on the
left hand side, that's

166
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,430
why it's negative.

167
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,500
And we didn't know.

168
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,990
We said this could be
any constant and this

169
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,760
could be any constant.

170
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,200
So the difference between two
arbitrary constants could just

171
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,610
be a third arbitrary constant.

172
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,720
So I'll just
re-write that as c.

173
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,620
So the general solution to this
differential equation is y

174
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:56,080
squared over 2 minus x squared
over 2 is equal to c.

175
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,810
Actually let's do something
else just to clean it up a

176
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,090
little bit, because once again
this could be any constant.

177
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,870
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 2 and

178
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,740
you get y squared minus
x squared equal to 2c.

179
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,280
Well now this is still any
constant number, so we could

180
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,460
still write this as a c.

181
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,070
So we have y squared minus
x squared is equal to c.

182
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,570
Now let's use our initial
conditions to see what c is.

183
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:29,110
So when y is 1, so 1 squared
minus when x is 1, 1 squared is

184
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,770
equal to c, this is 1 minus 1,
so it's 0, right?

185
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,590
c is equal to 0.

186
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,570
So what is the particular
solution to this

187
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,350
differential equation?

188
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,480
I'll do it in green.

189
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,350
It is y squared minus x
squared is equal to 0.

190
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,270
Or we could add x squared
to both sides of that.

191
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:55,510
We could also write it as y
squared is equal to x squared.

192
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,870
Now you might be tempted to
take the square root of both

193
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,490
sides of this and say
that y is equal to x.

194
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,370
The reason why this would not
be accurate is because here x

195
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:14,290
could be minus 2 and y could
be plus 2 or vice versa.

196
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,560
So this would satisfy this
equation, but it would not

197
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,710
satisfy this equation.

198
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,380
So be careful when you
take that square root.

199
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,180
You have to worry about
the plus or minus.

200
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,020
Let's do one more.

201
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:29,750
   

202
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:36,210
So this one says the derivative
of y with respect to x is equal

203
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:42,130
to -- OK, so this is even a
little bit more interesting.

204
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,775
This is equal to the
square root of x over y.

205
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:51,200
   

206
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,890
And it says that y is equal
to 4 when is equal to 1.

207
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,220
Yup, I think I'm
reading that right.

208
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,670
We could do this one
very similarly.

209
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,960
So let's just do the same step.

210
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,660
So multiply both sides of
the equation times dx.

211
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,940
So you get dy is equal to --
and just to skip a step, I'm

212
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,630
going to re-write square root
of x over y is the square root

213
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,210
of x over the square root
of y, and I multiply both

214
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,180
sides of that times dx.

215
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,010
Now let's multiply both
sides of this equation

216
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,800
by the square root of y.

217
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,530
And I'm just going to re-write
it as y to the 1/2 power.

218
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,310
That's the same thing as
the square root of y.

219
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,730
dy is equal to x to
the 1/2 power dx.

220
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,400
I just multiplied that
there and re-wrote

221
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,310
it as y to the 1/2.

222
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:45,320
So what is the antiderivative
of y to the 1/2 power?

223
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:54,780
Well it's just this plus 1, so
it's y the 3/2 power, and then

224
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,960
times the inverse of this.

225
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,940
So times 2/3.

226
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,730
   

227
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,320
Or you could have said
divided by this, either way.

228
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,610
And if you're not sure about
this, because sometimes it is

229
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,560
confusing with the fractions
and whatever else,

230
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,670
take the derivative.

231
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,540
3/2 times 2/3 is 1, and then
you subtract this 1 from

232
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,220
the exponent and you
get y to the 1/2.

233
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,140
So that works.

234
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:19,540
And of course, we kind of go
through the same drill, plus c1

235
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,710
is equal to -- it's going to be
the same thing on this side

236
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:29,460
-- 2/3 x to the 3/2 plus
c2, and what can we do?

237
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,890
Well let's take the x to the
left hand side of this

238
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:42,990
equation, so we get 2/3 y to
the 3/2 minus 2/3 x to the 3/2

239
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:49,190
is equal to c2 minus c1, which
we can just re-write as c.

240
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,820
And let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 3/2, so

241
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,440
these two will become 1.

242
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:03,980
So you get y to 3/2 minus x to
the 3/2 is equal to -- well

243
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,970
what's 3/2 times
some constant c.

244
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,800
But we didn't even know what
it was, we haven't solved for

245
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
it, so we can still write c.

246
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,060
I hope that doesn't
confuse you.

247
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,100
3/2 c, we didn't
know what it was.

248
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,480
We could call this c3
and now this is c4.

249
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,440
It's a different constant, but
we still have to solve for it.

250
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,790
And now let's use our
initial conditions.

251
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,725
So the initial conditions tell
us that 4 -- and they don't

252
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:25,640
have to be initial conditions.

253
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,140
You can kind of say conditions
or points where we know that

254
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,830
the particular solution to this
differential equation

255
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,370
are satisfied.

256
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:45,670
So 4 to the 3/2 minus 1 to
the 3/2 is equal to c.

257
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,830
What's 4 to the 3/2?

258
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,620
So 4 to the 1/2 is 2, and then
that to the 3 power, that's 8.

259
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,130
Then 1 to any power, but
especially in this case, 1 to

260
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,440
the square root of 1 is 1.

261
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Then to the third power is 1.

262
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,890
So 8 minus 1 is equal to c.

263
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,640
And so c is equal to 7.

264
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,630
So the particular solution of
this differential equation I

265
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:19,966
will do in a different color,
and it is y to the 3/2 minus

266
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:24,620
x to the 3/2 is equal to 7.

267
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,000
