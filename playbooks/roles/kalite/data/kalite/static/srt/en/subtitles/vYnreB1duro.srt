1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,350
I think most of us know what the heart does in our body.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,790
It pumps the blood and in particular it takes in the blood from the rest of the body.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,800
That is blue over here in this diagram, because that blood does not have carried oxygen

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:20,030
And it pumps that blood to the lungs where the blood gets oxygenated.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:27,420
And then it comes back from the lungs, depicted as red blood, now that it has oxygen in it.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,040
And then that oxygenated blood is pumped to the rest of the body.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,140
And I think also, most of us have the general idea that when people talk about heart disease or heart attacks,

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:45,490
which we learn, are two different things, related but different things, that has something to do with the clogging of arteries.

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,280
so when I was a kid and I first learnt about the clogging of arteries.

10
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,550
and I knew enough that the heart is all about pumping blood to the body.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:00,340
I assumed the artery that people were talking about these big arteries that were coming away from the heart

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,560
to the rest of the body that somehow these things got clogged up.

13
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,160
so let me draw that, different colour you can see

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,740
so this was my ....this is what I thought

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,620
people were talking about when they were saying clogging of the arteries

16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,050
and maybe when they got clogged enough, the stopped blood flow to the rest of the body somehow

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,870
and that would actually kill the person. I want to make it very clear right now.

18
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,350
Those are not the arteries that people are talking about getting clogged,

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,360
when people talk about heart disease or heart attacks.

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,370
The arteries that they are talking about are the arteries that actually provide blood to the heart.

21
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,930
Remember the heart itself is a muscle. It itself needs oxygen.

22
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:51,170
So you have these arteries right over here, the red tubes. Those are arteries.

23
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,880
and then the blue ones are veins.

24
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,300
They're taking the de-oxygenated blood away from the tissue of the heart.

25
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,390
And these are called coronary arteries.

26
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,700
And this one over here at least from the point of view of me or you looks like it's on the right.

27
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,670
Or from the point of view of the person whose heart it is, it's on the left.

28
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,320
This right over here is called the left coronary artery or LCA.

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,310
And this right over here in red is called the right coronary arteries or the RCA.

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,310
And so when people talk about arteries getting blocked or getting clogged,

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,930
they're talking about the coronary arteries.

32
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,380
They're talking about the things that supply blood to the heart.

33
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:40,320
So let's zoom in on one of them....Maybe we can zoom in right over here, that part of the artery.

34
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:49,240
That's the tube....clear where I am zooming in. I am zooming in right over here.

35
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:55,550
So over time, I am not going into the details how this happened. It is subject for another video.

36
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,150
You can have these plaques build up along the walls of the artery.

37
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,770
So over time if a person doesn't have the right diet, or maybe they just have a predisposition to it,

38
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,350
you can have these things called plaques form on the walls of the arteries.

39
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,760
And the plaques, the material inside of them are lipids, so things like

40
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,150
fat, cholesterol and also dead white blood cells,

41
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:28,730
which is this kind of messy substance right over here. This is what we call a plaque.

42
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,190
And the formation of these plaques that obstruct the actual blood vessel, that actually obstruct the artery.

43
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:44,070
We call it.....make it clear you see that. This is kind of tube over here. Let me draw the blood

44
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:59,180
So this formation of these plaques we call atherosclerosis.

45
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,860
So you can imagine if you have these things build up,

46
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,810
it's narrowing the actual vessel that's supplying blood downstream from that obstruction.

47
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:16,570
So it would be destructing the blood flow downstream right over there.

48
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:23,000
In that general process we talk about the restriction of blood flow, that is ischemia that's happening.

49
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,430
So ischemia is deprivation of blood flow and oxygen downstream from this right over there.

50
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:39,400
That's what we call coronary artery disease, or heart disease.

51
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:52,380
So this causes coronary artery disease, which is sometimes called heart disease.

52
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:58,570
Coronary heart disease would be redundant, because coronary is already referring to the heart.

53
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:07,170
This is also sometimes called heart disease. And so you can imagine if downstream the muscle tissue is

54
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,970
not getting all the oxygen it needs, especially maybe when this person, whoever's heart this is,

55
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:17,380
when they are exerting themselves, they need more oxygen. The heart needs to pump a little harder.

56
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,960
If downstream the cells are not getting all of the oxygen they need,

57
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,500
you can imagine that the heart maybe not able to provide all of the functions,

58
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,340
whoever's heart this is, that they needed to do.

59
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,770
And when that happens that's called heart failure.

60
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,350
So heart disease is one of the causes of heart failure.

61
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,460
Now I want to be clear, heart failure does not mean that the heart is stopping.

62
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,710
That the heart is stopped and the person is dead, it literally just means

63
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,550
that the heart is failing to do what it should be doing. It's failing to provide the needs of that person.

64
00:05:53,550 --> 00:06:01,280
So it's not pumping hard enough or well enough to provide adequate function for that person.

65
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,670
The other symptom that actually might occur when someone has coronary heart disease,

66
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,000
where they have obstruction or this ischemia

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,700
or this deprivation of oxygen downstream from this obstruction, is that they might experience this kind of strangling chest pain

68
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,260
That's called angina pectoris or sometimes angina.

69
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:33,330
Very few people say the pectoris part. Sometimes you hear people say oh angina.

70
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:40,260
Angina pectoris, which is really chest pain, angina literally comes from meaning this kind of strangling feeling,

71
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,920
and pectoris is in the chest. This is strangling feeling in the chest.

72
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:53,120
This is a symptom of heart disease. Now this is already not a situation you want to get into

73
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,300
because already your body is not able to function as well as it maybe could be, as maybe it could.

74
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,140
Sometimes as I might describe here is a plaque.

75
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,910
Some plaques are actually unstable. These plaques just grow and grow and grow.

76
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,250
It makes probably heart disease worse and worse, heart failure worse, and angina pectoris worse.

77
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,740
These plaques are unstable. It can actually rupture.

78
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:25,720
You can imagine all these blood flows, as plaque grows, the blood flows become a little turbulent around these plaques.

79
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,130
It has to go really fast through this narrow section. It comes out turbulent on the inside and

80
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:35,290
creates these friction and all the rest. At some point, you can imagine this plaque is unstable.

81
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:45,590
It could actually rupture. Let me draw ruptured plaque over here....let me draw the same one....I am gonna draw the ruptured.

82
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:54,700
Now this plaque has rupture. It got so big. Maybe the turbulent blood flow helped stimulate this and whatever else.

83
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,520
For whatever reason, it ruptures.

84
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:05,100
When it ruptures, now it sudden i am doing a simplification of the process right over here.

85
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:13,510
Now the content of this plaque: the lipid, the cholesterol, the fat, the dead white blood cell.

86
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:19,450
Now it sudden is exposed to the blood flow. in particular to the clotting factor in the blood.

87
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:25,450
This is highly thrombogenic material. Thrombogenic, very fancy word.

88
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:31,440
That just means, that tends to cause blood clot. Thrombosis is a blood clot.

89
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,130
What happened is, as soon as this type of things happened, it can literally happen in seconds or in minutes.

90
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,840
All the sudden you could have these clotting factors form a clot right over here right at the actual plaque.

91
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:50,910
As this happens, it starts to really really really obstruct the blood vessel.

92
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,730
Sometimes it can even completely obstruct the blood vessel.

93
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,720
When it happens, you are significantly depleting the blood flow going downstream from there.

94
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:12,790
You might even be shutting it off. When you do that, the cells downstream will no longer get oxygen.

95
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:27,020
They will die. This right over here, is called an infarction. an infarct is actually a dead heart tissue.

96
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:37,200
You can imagine when heart tissue begins to die, this is even worse than what we were describing with coronary heart disease.

97
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,770
Not only coronary heart disease just is not getting enough oxygen, now they are actually dead.

98
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:55,740
They are turning into dead tissue. This process of completely or almost completely depriving cells of oxygen so that they die, this is a heart attack.

99
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:05,050
Let me completely obstruct this artery to make the point clear. this right over here is a heart attack.

100
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,210
This is the primary cause of heart attack.

101
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:16,200
It's less likely but sometimes a plaque could also go downstream, kind of form a thromboembolism.

102
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:22,060
It would be this thrombogenic material, the clots around it.

103
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,980
It would actually go and block the artery further downstream and be embolism.

104
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:34,240
That can also block the artery and cause tissue to die. But the main cause is this intense clotting that can

105
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:41,260
occur pretty quickly and completely obstruct the artery. There is one last word i want to touch

106
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:52,220
sometimes mixed in with all the other words, that is cardiac arrest. That's because sometimes we use them in the same context.

107
00:10:52,220 --> 00:11:03,130
one thing can lead to another. Heart attack is not cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is the actual dying of the heart.

108
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:12,915
What I just described in a heart attack, people can have a heart attack. They will have some part of their muscle tissue die.

109
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:22,260
Some part infarct, that's what they called myocardial infarction. Myocardial means the tissue of heart or the muscle of the heart that's dying.

110
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:27,370
Sometimes it is called myocardial infarction. That is not cardiac arrest.

111
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,950
Cause you can have some of your heart tissue die and you can survive. Your heart would be impaired.

112
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:37,660
But you will continue to live. Cardiac arrest is literally your heart stopping.

113
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,830
This would obviously cause someone to die. If you have a bad enough heart attack,

114
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:53,362
if you have enough of the tissue get starved of oxygen so that it dies, infarction occurs.

115
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:57,980
Then it could lead to cardiac arrest. It always won't lead to cardiac arrest.

116
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,810
Frankly, heart attack is not the only thing that can cause cardiac arrest.

117
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:11,160
I also want to once again differentiate cardiac arrest from heart failure, because they sound the same, sound like heart is failing.

118
00:12:11,170 --> 99:59:59,999
Cardiac arrest is heart stopping. Heart failure is essentially just saying that heart can not provide all of the needs for the body.
