00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:05,782
I want to make one clarification on my video on super, or actually I should say supernovae,

2
00:00:05,782 --> 00:00:11,800
because that's the plural for supernova, is that I said this supernova occurred a thousand years ago.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,955
That's actually not precisely right.

4
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:17,067
The supernova was first observed 1,000 years ago.

5
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:24,762
Or the light from that first explosion was observed by astronomers, we believe, 1,000 years ago.

6
00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:32,518
But we have to be very clear here because the Crab Nebula, and its core is roughly 6,500 light years

7
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:39,683
away. Even this light, even this image we see right here is that nebula as it was 65 hundred years ago.

8
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:45,023
And so the supernova itself, if you think about when it actually occurred,

9
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:48,800
it actually must have occurred about 75 hundred years ago.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,030
So it must have occurred about 75 hundred years ago, years ago, and that first light,

11
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:03,333
from that first explosion from that first energetic event reached us about a thousand years ago.

12
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:08,133
So it took 65 hundred years to get to us, and reached us a thousand years ago.

13
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:16,021
So first, first light 1,000 years ago, 1,000 years.

14
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:18,400
I just wanted to make that clear, it might have been obvious to some of you all,

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,432
but always important to think about it. When I said a thousand years ago,

16
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:25,467
I really should have said it was first observed, the explosion was observed a thousand years ago.

17
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:30,133
But since it's so far, the actual event must have occurred 75 hundred years ago.
