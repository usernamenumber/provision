1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,510
We've already talked about how
a benzene ring is very-- let

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,380
me draw a better looking benzene
ring than that-- that

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,220
a benzene ring is very stable,
because it's aromatic.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,510
That these electrons in these
pi orbitals that form these

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,090
double bonds, they're actually
just not in this double bond,

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,140
they can keep swapping.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,140
This one can go here.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,010
This one can go there.

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,160
That one can go there.

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,490
Actually, they don't
go back and forth.

12
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,280
They actually just completely
go around the entire ring.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,750
And when a molecule is aromatic,
it stabilizes it.

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,180
But we've seen examples of
aromatic, or actually, in

15
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,750
particular, we've seen examples
of benzene rings that

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,240
have other things bumping off
of them, whether they're

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,160
halides or whether they're OH
groups, and what we want to do

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,810
in this video is think about how
that might happen, how do

19
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,890
things get added on
to a benzene ring.

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,360
We're going to learn about
electrophilic aromatic

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,590
substitution.

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,080
Let me write that down.

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:08,690
Electrophilic aromatic
substitution.

24
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,190
   

25
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,260
And you might say, well, Sal,
you just said you're adding

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,020
things to the ring.

27
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,700
But the reality is that there's
six hydrogens here.

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,480
There's one hydrogen, two
hydrogens, three hydrogens,

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,170
four hydrogens, five hydrogens
and six hydrogens.

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:25,910
They're always there.

31
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,725
If you don't draw them, they
are implicitly there.

32
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:32,080
So what we're actually doing,
when you add a chlorine or a

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,580
bromine or an OH group, it's
actually replacing one of

34
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,360
these hydrogens.

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,030
That's why it is substitution.

36
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,480
It's aromatic, because we're
dealing with a benzene ring.

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,240
We're dealing with an aromatic
molecule, and we're going to

38
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,770
see that we need a really strong
electrophile in order

39
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,510
to do this.

40
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,710
Let's think about this
how this will happen.

41
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,980
Before I do that, let me just
copy and paste this, because I

42
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,980
don't want to have
to redraw this.

43
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,690
Let me just copy it,
just like that.

44
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,550
So let's say we have a really
strong electrophile.

45
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,830
And I'll give you particular
cases in the next few videos,

46
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,530
so you can better visualize
what a really strong

47
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,850
electrophile is.

48
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,380
But just from the word itself,
electrophile, you could

49
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,920
imagine it's something
that loves electrons.

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,690
It wants electrons really,
really, really,

51
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,500
really, really badly.

52
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,930
And usually, it has
a positive charge.

53
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,750
   

54
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,180
So it wants electrons badly.

55
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,110
And actually, let me
make it very clear.

56
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,040
Instead of saying it wants
electrons badly, because when

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,160
you're talking about
electrophiles or nucleophiles,

58
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,060
you're actually talking about
how good something is

59
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,240
reacting, you're not actually
talking about the actual

60
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,300
energies involved.

61
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,530
Let me put it a different way:
good at getting electrons.

62
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,460
   

63
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,000
Really, really, really,
really, really

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,980
good at getting electrons.

65
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,140
So what would happen?

66
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,310
We already said this is
already pretty stable.

67
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,090
These guys, these electrons,
these pi electrons can

68
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,170
circulate all around.

69
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,210
If it bumps just in the right
way to something that's really

70
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,410
good at getting electrons, what
might happen-- let's say

71
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,295
we have this electron
right here.

72
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:15,910
The way we've drawn it, it's
on this carbon right here.

73
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,390
Obviously, the carbon is just
at the intersection.

74
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,860
I never drew the carbon.

75
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,060
But if this electrophile,
which is really good at

76
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,850
getting electrons, bumps in
just the right way, this

77
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,040
electron can go to that
electrophile.

78
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,020
   

79
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,440
And then it would be left with--
so let me copy and

80
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,930
paste our original molecule.

81
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,490
So then what would
we be left with?

82
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:45,030
So we no longer have this
bond right here.

83
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,910
   

84
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,570
It has now been bonded
to the electrophile.

85
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,220
Let me make it clear.

86
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,170
We had this electron
right here.

87
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,320
That electron is still on this
carbon right over here at this

88
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,310
intersection, but the other end
of it, the other electron,

89
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,520
has now been given to the
electrophile, the thing that's

90
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,130
good at getting them.

91
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,085
So the other side has been given
to this electrophile.

92
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:11,050
This electrophile now
gained an electron.

93
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,940
So it had a positive charge,
now it will be neutral.

94
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,279
And once again, I'll show you
a particular, or several

95
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,730
particular cases of this
in the next few videos.

96
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,850
Let me just make it clear.

97
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:25,250
So this bond, you could now view
it as being this bond.

98
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,150
Now, this carbon right over
here, this lost an electron.

99
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,830
So if it lost an electron,
it will now

100
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,135
have a positive charge.

101
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:36,640
   

102
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,350
Now, this is hard to do to a
resonance-stabilized molecule,

103
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,370
to a benzene ring.

104
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,100
So that, once again, and I said,
and I'm being a little

105
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,840
bit repetitive, this has
to be a very good

106
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,950
electrophile to do it.

107
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,790
But once this is there, this
is a actually relatively

108
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,490
stable carbocation.

109
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,330
The reason why it is, it's only
a secondary carbocation,

110
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,180
but it's actually a
resonance-stabilized

111
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,590
carbocation because this
electron right

112
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,670
can be given to that.

113
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,130
If this electron goes there,
then it would look like this.

114
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,340
Let me redraw it.

115
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,790
I'll draw the resonance
structures quickly.

116
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,410
You have your hydrogen.

117
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,490
You have your electrophile.

118
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,510
That's not an electrophile
anymore, but you have that E

119
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,790
that's now been added.

120
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,310
You have that hydrogen.

121
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,020
You have a double bond here.

122
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,410
Let me draw a little
bit neater.

123
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,340
You have this hydrogen.

124
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,130
You have this hydrogen, this
hydrogen and this hydrogen.

125
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,780
What I said is, this
is stabilized.

126
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,220
So an electron here can actually
jump over here.

127
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,030
So if this electron jumps over
here, the double bond is now

128
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,700
over there If that goes over
there like that, the double

129
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,490
bond is now over here.

130
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,750
Now this guy lost his electron
and it would

131
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,020
have a positive charge.

132
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,580
And then that is resonance
stabilized.

133
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,030
It can either go back to this
guy, or this electron over

134
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,750
here can jump over there.

135
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,570
Let me redraw the whole
thing over again.

136
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,930
   

137
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,960
Let me draw all the hydrogens.

138
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,300
This right here, you have
the E and the hydrogen.

139
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,340
You have a hydrogen here,
hydrogen here, hydrogen here,

140
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,280
hydrogen here.

141
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,290
And normally you don't worry
about the hydrogens, but one

142
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,950
of the hydrogens is going to
be nabbed later on in this

143
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,160
mechanism, so I want to draw all
the hydrogens just so you

144
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,730
know that they are there.

145
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,440
But as I said, this is
resonance stabilized.

146
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,890
If this electron right here
jumps over there, then this

147
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,720
double bond is now
this double bond.

148
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,810
And now this guy over here lost
an electron, so it would

149
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,070
have a positive charge.

150
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,030
And again, once you had this
double bond up here, this

151
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,020
double bond up there is
that double bond.

152
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,170
So we can go back and
forth between these.

153
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,050
The electrons are just swishing
around the ring.

154
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,460
So it's not going to be maybe as
great as the situation that

155
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,830
we had when we had a nice
benzene ring that was

156
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,150
completely aromatic.

157
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,750
The electrons can just go around
the p-orbitals, around

158
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,330
and around the ring, stabilize
the structure, but this is

159
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,220
still a relatively stable
carbocation, because the

160
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,610
electrons can move around.

161
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,790
You can kind of view it as a
positive charge that gets

162
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,970
dispersed between this carbon,
this carbon, and that carbon

163
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,130
over there.

164
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,500
As I said, it's still not
a great situation.

165
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,130
The molecule wants to go back to
being aromatic, wants to go

166
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,230
to that really stable state.

167
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,770
And the way it can go back to
that really stable state is

168
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,020
somehow an electron can be
added to this thing.

169
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,040
And the way that an electron can
be added to this thing is,

170
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:46,030
if we have some base flying
around, and that base nabs

171
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,350
this proton, this proton right
here that's on the same carbon

172
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,910
as where the electrophile
is attached.

173
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,720
So if this base nabs a proton,
so it just nabs the hydrogen

174
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,260
nucleus, then that electron that
the hydrogen had, that

175
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,040
electron-- let me do that
in a different color.

176
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,990
That electron that the hydrogen
had right over there

177
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,640
could then be returned to
this carbon up there.

178
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,190
And maybe that makes it
a little confusing

179
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,120
when I cross lines.

180
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,020
It can be returned to that
carbon right there.

181
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,550
So what would it look
like after that?

182
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,000
After that it would
look like this.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,850
Let me draw my-- so if that
happened, and we drew it in

184
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:33,010
yellow, we have our
six-carbon ring.

185
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,210
Let me draw all the hydrogens.

186
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,240
What did I do that in?

187
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,169
It likes like a slightly green
color I did that in.

188
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,515
So I have all the hydrogens
on that ring.

189
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:45,640
   

190
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,360
Now, I have to be careful.

191
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,430
This hydrogen right there, just
the nucleus of it, got

192
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,180
nabbed by this base.

193
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,600
So that hydrogen has now been
nabbed by the base.

194
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,500
This electron right
here has now been

195
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,100
given to this hydrogen.

196
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,540
So that electron has now been
given to this hydrogen, and

197
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,070
then the other electron in the
pair is still with the base.

198
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,120
   

199
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
So now this is the conjugate
acid of the base.

200
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
It has gained a proton.

201
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,000
And on this carbon, right here,
we just have what was

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,250
the electrophile.

203
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,650
   

204
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,670
And I'll do the same colors,
just to make it clear.

205
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,260
What was the electrophile
right over there, this

206
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,650
bond is this bond.

207
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,570
And then finally, we had-- and
I'll color code it here just

208
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:33,990
to make it clear.

209
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,380
We had this double bond here,
which is this double bond

210
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,620
right over here.

211
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,610
We had this double bond.

212
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,140
We had this double bond, which
is that double bond there.

213
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,630
And then this electron gets
returned to this top carbon

214
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,470
right here.

215
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,120
So that electron-- let me make
it very, very clear.

216
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,280
So the bond and that
electron are

217
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,140
returned to that top carbon.

218
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,290
So that we have the bond and
that electron returned to that

219
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,330
top carbon.

220
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,520
That top carbon is now
going to be neutral.

221
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,540
And once again, we are
resonance stabilized.

222
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,180
   

223
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,040
One thing I forgot, just to make
the charge stabilized,

224
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,470
maybe this base had a negative
charge to begin with.

225
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,520
It didn't have to.

226
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,830
But if this base did have a
negative charge to begin with,

227
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,050
it now gave an electron
to the hydrogen,

228
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,620
so it is now neutral.

229
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,780
And this should make sense
because before we had a plus

230
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,660
charge and a negative charge,
and then when everything

231
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,730
reacted, everything
is neutral again.

232
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,490
The total net charge is zero.

233
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,060
But this is the electrophilic
aromatic substitution.

234
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,490
We substituted one
of the hydrogens.

235
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,560
We substituted this hydrogen
right here with this

236
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,390
electrophile, or what was
previously an electrophile,

237
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,280
but then once it got an
electron, it's just kind of a

238
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,650
group that is now on
the benzene ring.

239
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,030
And by going through this little
convoluted process, we

240
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,780
finally got to another aromatic
molecule that now has

241
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,680
this E group on it.

242
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,940
In the next video, I'll show
you this with particular

243
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,650
examples of electrophiles
and bases.
