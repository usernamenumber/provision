1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,930
I think now's as good a time as
any to play around a little bit

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,960
with the formula for variance
and see where it goes.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,300
And I think just by doing this,
we'll also get a little bit

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,680
better intuition of just
manipulating sigma notation

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,540
or even what it means.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,670
So we learned, several
times, that the formula for

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,640
variance-- and let's just do
variance of a population.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,420
It's almost the same thing
as variance of a sample.

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,140
You just divide by n
instead of n minus 1.

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,450
Variance of a population is
equal to-- Well you take each

12
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,260
of the data points, x sub i.

13
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,930
You subtract from
that the mean.

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,920
You square it.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,090
And then you take the
average of all of these.

16
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,910
So you add the squared distance
for each of these points from i

17
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,430
equals 1 to i is equal to N.

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,730
And you divide it by N.

19
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,590
Let's see what happens if we
can-- Maybe we want to multiply

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,480
out the squared term and
see where it takes us.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,170
So let's see.

22
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,460
And I think it'll take us
someplace interesting.

23
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,760
So this is the same thing
as the sum from i is equal

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,530
to 1 to N of-- Let's see.

25
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,710
This, we just multiply it out.

26
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:17,430
This is the same thing as x sub
i squared minus-- This is your

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,300
little algebra going on here.

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,280
So when you square it-- I
mean, we can multiply it out.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:29,950
We could write it x sub i minus
mu times x sub i minus mu.

30
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,710
So we have x sub
i times x sub i.

31
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,590
That's x sub i squared.

32
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,180
Then you have x sub i times
mu-- times minus mu.

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,670
And then you have minus
mu times x sub i.

34
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,730
So when you add those two
together, you get minus

35
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,480
2 x sub i mu, right?

36
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,910
Because you have it
twice. x sub i times mu.

37
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,760
That's 1 minus x sub i mu.

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,860
And then you have another one.

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,450
Minus mu x sub i.

40
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,390
When you add them together,
you get minus 2 x sub i mu.

41
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,780
I know it's confusing with me
saying sub i and all of that.

42
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,010
But it's really no different
than when you did

43
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,490
a minus b squared.

44
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,530
Just the variables look a
little bit more complicated.

45
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,100
And then the last term is minus
mu times minus mu, which

46
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,470
is plus mu squared.

47
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,560
Fair enough.

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,160
Let me switch colors just
to keep it interesting.

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,110
Let me cordon that off.

50
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,430
OK.

51
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,460
So how can we-- Well the sum of
this is the same thing as the

52
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,915
sum of-- Because, if you think
about it, we're going

53
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:28,900
to take each x sub i.

54
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,110
For each of the numbers in
our population, we're going

55
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,200
to perform this thing.

56
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,260
And we're going to sum it up.

57
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,200
But if you think about it, this
is the same thing as-- If

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,930
you're not familiar with a
sigma notation, this is a good

59
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,190
kind of thing to
know in general.

60
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,630
Just a little bit of intuition.

61
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,940
This is the same thing as--
I'll do it here to have space

62
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:53,420
--as the sum from i is equal to
1 to N of the first term, x sub

63
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,580
i squared minus-- And actually,
we can bring out the

64
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,890
constant terms.

65
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,550
You just can't take-- When
you're summing, the only thing

66
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,150
that matters is the thing
that has the ith term.

67
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,720
So in this case, it's x sub i.

68
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,040
So x sub 1, x sub 2.

69
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,070
So that's the thing that you'd
have to leave on the right-hand

70
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,080
side of the sigma notation.

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,040
And if you've done the calculus
playlist already, sigma

72
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,970
notation is really kind of like
a discrete integral

73
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,120
on some level.

74
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,390
Because in an integral, you're
summing up a bunch of things.

75
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,300
You're multiplying them
times dx, which is a

76
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,420
really small interval.

77
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,600
But here, you're
just taking a sum.

78
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,950
And that's what-- Well we
showed-- In the calculus

79
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,590
playlist I said that an
integral actually is kind of

80
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,810
this infinite sum of infinitely
small things, but I don't

81
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,360
want to digress too much.

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,920
But this is just a long way of
saying that the second-- The

83
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,730
sum from i equals 1 to N of the
second term is the same thing

84
00:03:43,730 --> 00:04:00,150
as minus 2 times mu of the sum
from i is equal to

85
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,290
1 to n of x sub i.

86
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,920
And then finally you have
plus-- Well this is just

87
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,230
a constant term, right?

88
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,920
This is just a constant term so
you can take it out --times

89
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:23,880
mu squared times the sum i
sub-- from i equals 1 to N.

90
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,000
And what's going to be here?

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,300
What's going to-- It's
going to be a 1, right?

92
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,260
We just divided a 1.

93
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,080
We just divided this by 1
to get out of the sigma

94
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,780
sign, out of the sum.

95
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,430
And you're just left
with a 1 there, right?

96
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,760
Actually we could have just
left the mu squared there.

97
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,180
But either way, let's just
keep simplifying it.

98
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,780
So this is-- This we
can't really do.

99
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,100
Well actually we
could-- Well, no.

100
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,310
We we don't know what
the x sub i's are.

101
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,950
So we just have to
leave that the same.

102
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,130
So that's the sum-- Oh sorry.

103
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,110
This is just the
numerator, right?

104
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,610
This whole simplification.

105
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,820
We're just simplifying
the numerator.

106
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
And later, we're just
going to divide by N.

107
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,610
So that is equal to
that divided by N.

108
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,020
Which is equal to this
thing divided by N.

109
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,060
I'll divide by N at the end.

110
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,590
Because it's the numerator
that's the confusing

111
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,180
part, right?

112
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,040
We just want to simplify
this term up here.

113
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,910
So let's keep doing this.

114
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,970
So this is equal to the
sum from i equals 1 to

115
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,780
N of x sub i squared.

116
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,680
And let's see.

117
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,340
Minus 2 times mu.

118
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,620
Sorry.

119
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,330
That mu doesn't look good.

120
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:27,940
Edit, undo.

121
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:42,090
Minus 2 times mu times the sum
from i is equal to 1 to N x i.

122
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,560
And then what is this?

123
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,280
What is another way
to write this?

124
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,820
Essentially we're going to add
1 to itself N times, right?

125
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,770
This is kind of saying just
whatever you have here just

126
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,610
iterate through it N times.

127
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,110
If you had an x sub i here, you
would use the first x term,

128
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,810
then the second x term.

129
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,350
When you have a 1 here, this is
just essentially saying add

130
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,900
1 to itself N times, right?

131
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,710
Which is the same thing as N.

132
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:15,430
So this is going to be
plus mu squared times N.

133
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,710
All right.

134
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,970
Then-- See if there's anything
else we can do here.

135
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,220
Remember this is
just the numerator.

136
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,440
So this looks fine.

137
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,410
We add up each of those terms.

138
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,950
And we just have
minus 2 mu, right?

139
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,820
From i equals 1 to-- Oh.

140
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,000
Well think about this.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,620
What is this?

142
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,110
What is this thing right here?

143
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,210
Well, actually let's
bring back that N.

144
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,350
So this is this simplified to
that divided by N, which

145
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,590
simplifies to that whole thing.

146
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,440
Which simplifies by this whole
thing divided by N, right?

147
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,890
Which simplifies to this
whole thing divided by N.

148
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,540
   

149
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,730
Which is the same thing as each
of the terms divided by N.

150
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,150
Which is the same
thing as that.

151
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,210
Which is the same
thing as that.

152
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,140
Which is the same
thing as that, right?

153
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,760
And now, well how
does this simplify?

154
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,750
This is the interesting part.

155
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,670
Well this-- Nothing
much I can do here.

156
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:24,640
So that just becomes the sum
from i is equal to 1 to N x sub

157
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,540
i squared divided by big N.

158
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,690
Now this is interesting.

159
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,200
What is-- If I take each of the
terms in my population and I

160
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,800
add them up and then I divide
it by N, what is that?

161
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,140
This thing right here.

162
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,210
If I sum up all the terms in my
population and divide by the

163
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,510
number of terms there are,
that's the mean, right?

164
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,860
That's the mean of
my population.

165
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,840
So this thing right
here is also mu.

166
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,660
So this thing
simplifies to what?

167
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,000
Minus 2 times what?

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,090
Mu times-- This whole
thing is mu too.

169
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,760
So times mu squared, right?

170
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,890
Mu times mu.

171
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,130
This is the mean of
the population.

172
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,010
So that was a nice
simplification.

173
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,850
And then plus-- What
do you have here?

174
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,220
Let's see.

175
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,480
You have mu.

176
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,320
Well you have n over n.

177
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,910
Those cancel out.

178
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,350
So you just have
plus mu squared.

179
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,550
So that was a very
nice simplification.

180
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,770
And then this simplifies to--
Can't do much on this side.

181
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:36,500
So the sum from i is equal to 1
to N of x sub i squared over N.

182
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,570
And then you see we have minus
2 mu squared plus mu squared.

183
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:47,340
Well that's the same thing
as minus mu squared, right?

184
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,730
Minus the mean squared.

185
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,700
So this, already, we've kind of
come up with a neat way of

186
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,990
writing the variance, right?

187
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,880
You can essentially take the
average of the squares of all

188
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,530
of the numbers in your, in
this case, a population.

189
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,410
And then subtract from that
the mean of your population--

190
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,930
the mean squared of
your population.

191
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,270
So this could be, depending on
how you're calculating things,

192
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,850
may be a slightly faster way
of calculating the variance.

193
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,260
So just playing with a little
algebra, we got from this

194
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,410
thing, where you have to, each
time, take each of your

195
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,300
data points, subtract
the mean from it.

196
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,200
And then square it.

197
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,640
And, of course, before you
do anything, you have

198
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,550
to calculate the mean.

199
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,040
Then you take the square, then
you sum it all up, then you

200
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,850
take the average, essentially,
when you divide it-- when

201
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,300
you sum and divide it by N.

202
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,060
We've simplified it, just using
a little bit of algebra,

203
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,715
to this formula.

204
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:35,620
And this is-- We're getting
to something called

205
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,610
the raw score method.

206
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,490
We could-- What we want to do
is, write this right here

207
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,190
just in terms of x i's.

208
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,430
And then we really are at, what
you call, the raw score method.

209
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,350
Which is, oftentimes, a
faster way of calculating

210
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,350
the variance.

211
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,000
So let's see.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,910
What is mu equal to?

213
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,270
What is the mean?

214
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:58,160
The mean is just equal to the
sum from i is equal to 1 to N

215
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,680
of each of the terms, right?

216
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,780
You just take the sum
of each of the terms.

217
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,810
And you divide by the number
of terms there are, right?

218
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,470
So that is equal to-- So
if we look at this thing.

219
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,610
This thing can be written as--
Let me draw a line here.

220
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,660
This thing can be written as
the sum from i is equal to

221
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,980
1 to N of x sub i squared.

222
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,640
All of that over N.

223
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,210
Minus mu squared.

224
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,800
Well mu is this.

225
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,520
So this thing squared.

226
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,590
So this thing squared is what?

227
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:46,450
This is, let's see, x sub
i-- take the sum --to N.

228
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,270
i this is equal to 1.

229
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,730
You're going to take-- You're
going to square this thing.

230
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,680
And then you're going to divide
it by-- We squared right?

231
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,490
You divide it by N squared.

232
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,300
And what's-- This might seem
like a more-- Out of all of

233
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,690
them, this actually seems like
the simplest formula for me.

234
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,780
Where you, essentially, you
just take-- If you know the

235
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,030
mean of your population, right?

236
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,830
You say OK.

237
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,710
My mean is whatever and I can
just square that and just

238
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,090
put that aside for second.

239
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,760
But first, I can take each of
the numbers, square them,

240
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,120
and then sum them up, and
divide by the number of

241
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,990
numbers I have, right?

242
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,870
I don't know if I wrote-- No.

243
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,080
I've erased the last
set of numbers I had.

244
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,650
But we could show you
that you'll get to

245
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,370
the same variance.

246
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,440
So to me, this is almost
the simplest formula.

247
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,270
But this one's even faster in a
lot of ways because you don't

248
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,230
really have to even calculate
the mean ahead of time.

249
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,710
You can just say for each x i,
I just perform this operation.

250
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,260
And then I divide by N squared
or N accordingly and I'll

251
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,330
also get to the variance.

252
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,960
You don't have to do this
calculation before you figure

253
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,680
out the whole variance.

254
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,070
But anyway, I thought it would
be instructive and hopefully

255
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,800
give you a little bit more
intuition behind the algebra

256
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,360
dealing with sigma notations.

257
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,930
If we kind of worked out these
other ways to write variances.

258
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,250
And frankly, some books
will just kind of say,

259
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,430
oh yeah you know what?

260
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,313
The variance could be written
like this or-- And we're

261
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:01,400
talking about the variance
of a population.

262
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,870
Or it could be
written like this.

263
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,130
Or maybe they'll even
write it like this.

264
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,790
And it's good to know that you
can just do a little bit of

265
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,840
simple algebraic manipulation
and get from one to the other.

266
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,820
Anyway, I've run out of time.

267
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,710
See you in the next video.

268
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,400
