1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,100
Multiply and express as
a simplified rational.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,710
State the domain.

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,340
Let's multiply it, and then
before we simplify it, let's

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,370
look at the domain.

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,880
This is equal to, if we just
multiplied the numerators, a

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:22,210
squared minus 4 times a plus 1,
all of that over-- multiply

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:28,010
the denominators-- a squared
minus 1 times a plus 2.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,560
   

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,270
Now, the a squared minus 4 and
the a squared minus 1 might

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,650
look familiar to us.

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,880
These are the difference in
squares, a special type of

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,040
binomial that you could
immediately, or hopefully

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,005
maybe immediately recognize.

15
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:45,950
It takes the form a squared
minus b squared, difference of

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,570
squares, and it's always going
to be equal to a plus b

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,530
times a minus b.

18
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,590
We can factor this a squared
minus 4 and we can also factor

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,010
this a squared minus 1, and
that'll help us actually

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,370
simplify the expression or
simplify the rational.

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:10,400
This top part, we can factor
the a squared minus 4 as a

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,300
plus 2-- 2 squared is 4-- times
a minus 2, and then that

23
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,550
times a plus 1.

24
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,680
   

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,650
Then in the denominator, we can
factor a squared minus 1--

26
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,540
let me do that in a
different color.

27
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,290
a squared minus 1 we can
factor as a plus 1

28
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,110
times a minus 1.

29
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,620
If you ever want to say, hey,
why does this work?

30
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,640
Just multiply it out and you'll
see that when you

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,120
multiply these two things, you
get that thing right there.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,020
Then in the denominator, we
also have an a plus 2.

33
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,270
   

34
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,400
We've multiplied it, we've
factored out the numerator, we

35
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,980
factored out the denominator.

36
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,640
Let's rearrange it
a little bit.

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,690
So this numerator, let's put the
a plus 2's first in both

38
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,820
the numerator and
the denominator.

39
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,550
So this, we could get a plus 2
in the numerator, and then in

40
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,460
the denominator, we also
have an a plus 2.

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,490
In the numerator, we took
care of our a plus 2's.

42
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,270
That's the only one that's
common, so in the numerator,

43
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,200
we also have an a minus 2.

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,690
Actually, we have an
a plus 1-- let's

45
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,970
write that there, too.

46
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,240
We have an a plus 1
in the numerator.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,510
We also have an a plus
1 in denominator.

48
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,310
   

49
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,770
In the numerator, we have
an a minus 2, and in the

50
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,680
denominator, we have
an a minus 1.

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,550
So all I did is I rearranged
the numerator and the

52
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,740
denominator, so if there was
something that was of a

53
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,270
similar-- if the same expression
was in both, I just

54
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,420
wrote them on top of each
other, essentially.

55
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,430
Now, before we simplify, this is
a good time to think about

56
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,120
the domain or think about the
a values that aren't in the

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,200
domain, the a values that would
invalidate or make this

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,550
expression undefined.

59
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,880
Like we've seen before, the a
values that would do that are

60
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,570
the ones that would make the
denominator equal 0.

61
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,320
So the a values that would make
that equal to 0 is a is

62
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,960
equal to negative 2.

63
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,920
You could solve for i.

64
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,040
You could say a plus 2 is equal
to 0, or a is equal to

65
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
negative 2.

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,040
a plus 1 is equal to 0.

67
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,300
Subtract 1 from both sides.
a is equal to negative 1.

68
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,920
Or a minus 1 is equal to 0.

69
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,060
Add one to both sides, and
you get a is equal to 1.

70
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,080
For this expression right here,
you have to add the

71
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:30,520
constraint that a cannot equal
negative 2, negative 1, or 1,

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,030
that a can be any real number
except for these.

73
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,110
We're essentially stating
our domain.

74
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,730
We're stating the domain is all
possible a's except for

75
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,970
these things right here, so we'd
have to add that little

76
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,010
caveat right there.

77
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,000
Now that we've done that,
we can factor it.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,715
We have an a plus 2
over an a plus 2.

79
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:51,700
We know that a is not going to
be equal to negative 2, so

80
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,000
that's always going
to be defined.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,220
When you divide something
by itself, that is

82
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,250
going to just be 1.

83
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,900
The same thing with the a plus
1 over the a plus 1.

84
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,330
That's going to be 1.

85
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,790
All you're going to be left
with is an a minus 2

86
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,590
over a minus 1.

87
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,200
So the simplified rational is a
minus 2 over a minus 1 with

88
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,790
the constraint that a cannot
equal negative 2,

89
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,079
negative 1, or 1.

90
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,610
You're probably saying, Sal,
what's wrong with it equaling,

91
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,970
for example, negative 1 here?

92
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,145
Negative 1 minus 1, it's only
going to be a negative 2 here.

93
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:26,460
It's going to be defined.

94
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,690
But in order for this expression
to really be the

95
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,400
same as this expression up here,
it has to have the same

96
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,950
constraints.

97
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,530
It has to have the
same domain.

98
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,450
It cannot be defined at negative
1 if this guy also is

99
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,930
not defined at negative 1.

100
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,070
And so these constraints
essentially ensure that we're

101
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,070
dealing with the same
expression, not one that's

102
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,740
just close.

103
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,333
