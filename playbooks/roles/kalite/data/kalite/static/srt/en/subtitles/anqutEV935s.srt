00:00:00,087 --> 00:00:03,777
In this video we're going to look at the definitions of acids and bases

2
00:00:03,823 --> 00:00:05,330
The definition most commonly used

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,845
in organic chemistry is a Bronsted-lowry acid and a Bronsted-Lowry base

4
00:00:08,906 --> 00:00:12,956
a Bronsted-lowry acid refers to a proton donor

5
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:17,841
and a Bronsted-lowry base refers to a proton acceptor

6
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:22,244
So lets really quickly review, exactly what a proton is referring to

7
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:25,550
so in the most common isotope of hydrogen

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,337
there's one proton in the nucleus, and there's an electron

9
00:00:30,337 --> 00:00:34,171
somewhere outside of our nucleus, so here is a very simple picture

10
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:39,218
of a hydrogen atom. This is a neutral hydrogen atom. Its neutral because the positive

11
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:43,138
and the negative charge cancel each other out, so there's no overall charge

12
00:00:43,138 --> 00:00:46,208
if we were somehow able to take away that electron,

13
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,766
we'd be left with just a proton

14
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:51,775
So we took away a negative charge, right, so it's no longer balanced.

15
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:58,141
So now we have H plus, we have the positively charged nucleus of a hydrogen atom,

16
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:03,946
which consists of only a proton, so H plus is equal to a proton.

17
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:10,368
This is very important to understand when you are looking at organic chemistry mechanisms

18
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:12,987
and a proton is being exchanged.

19
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:17,453
So let's go ahead and do one of those mechanisms. A very simple general chemistry reaction,

20
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,973
alright you could start of with water here

21
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:24,285
the dot structure for water, two non-pairs of electron on my oxygen.

22
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:30,947
and I'm going to show water reacting with HCL, so we have HCL, and my dot structure for HCL

23
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:38,139
would look like this, now and the bond between the hydrogen and the chlorine, one of those electrons

24
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:43,250
came from hydrogen and one of those electrons came from chlorine, like that

25
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,796
So in this mechanism, HCL is going to be our Bronsted-lowry acid

26
00:01:48,796 --> 00:01:54,133
So this is going to be our Bronsted-Lowry acid, it's going to donate a proton

27
00:01:54,133 --> 00:02:01,020
and water is going to accept that proton, so water is going to be our Bronsted-lowry base

28
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,890
like that, let's go ahead and get some more room here, so in this mechanism,

29
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:11,686
a lone pair of electrons in this oxygen are gonna take this proton from the HCL,

30
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:19,513
so if it's just taking the proton, right, the electron that hydrogen had is gonna be left behind on the chlorine

31
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:26,303
So if I go ahead and highlight that electron in blue here, this is the one that came from the hydrogen atom in the dot structure

32
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:30,389
so you can think about it being this electron right here, and so if I go ahead

33
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:37,176
and draw the product of this acid based reaction, right, so the oxygen is going to pick up a proton

34
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:43,347
So the oxygen is going to pick up a hydrogen here in the dot structure, and also a positive charge

35
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:47,210
and there's still a lone pair of electrons left on that oxygen.

36
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:51,595
So you can think about the oxygen being positively charged because it's picking up a proton

37
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:55,611
or you can think about this oxygen as having a plus 1 formal charge,

38
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:58,823
if you know how to calculate formal charge already.

39
00:02:58,838 --> 00:03:05,540
So the other products would be , we would have CL over here, which use to have three lone pairs of electrons

40
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:12,763
but it's going to pick up an extra lone pair here, so the the electron in blue, the electron that use to belong to the hydrogen,

41
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:18,544
or the electron that hydrogen brought to the dot structure, now ends up on chlorine, to form the chloride anion

42
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:22,707
right so you can think about the chlorine picking up an extra electron

43
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:29,091
to having a negative 1 charge, or you can think about the chloride as having a negative 1 formal charge, so either one works

44
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:38,260
and so we've shown the transfer of one proton from HCL to water to form H3L plus and CL minus

45
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:46,111
And we know that HCL of course is a strong acid, so technically these reactions are at equilibrium,

46
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:52,163
for an extremely strong acid like HCL the equilibrium lies extremely far to the right

47
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:56,913
so I'm only going to draw an extremely small arrow in here going back to the left

48
00:03:56,928 --> 00:04:05,180
So the reverse reaction is possible, although highly unlikely, so hcl is pretty much completely dissociated in practice

49
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:12,574
but lets think about the reverse reaction occurring, so if h3l plus and cl minus reacted, right

50
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:20,835
the h3l plus would be donating a proton this time, so this would be my acid, right, the h3l plus would be an acid,

51
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:29,868
and the CL minus would be a base. The cl minus would pick up a proton to form HCL and the H3L would lose a proton to form H20

52
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:32,731
So in practice of course this doesn't really occur.

53
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:37,365
but it's important to think about acid based reactions being at equilibrium.

54
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,657
And, we can also think about conjugate acid base pairs, and so over here on the left

55
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:46,280
HCL was functioning as a bronsted-lowry acid

56
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,868
Once it donates it's proton, you're left with a conjugate base, which is CL minus

57
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:55,987
and so HCL and CL minus are a conjugate acid base pair.

58
00:04:55,987 --> 00:05:00,173
The differ in terms of only one proton, 1H plus.

59
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:04,996
Another conjugate acid base pair, would be water over here on the left,

60
00:05:04,996 --> 00:05:06,880
which is functioned as a bronsted-lowry base,

61
00:05:06,896 --> 00:05:10,961
and then over here on the right H3L plus is the conjugate acid.

62
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:15,085
So H2O and H3L plus, are also a conjugate, acid base pair.

63
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:19,448
again there's one proton difference between those two.

64
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:22,941
So the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base.

65
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:27,310
That's one of those general chemistry principles, and since HCL is extremely strong,

66
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,820
that means the chloride anion is going to be extremely weak.

67
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:36,424
Right, so CL minus is an extremely weak base. It's not really going to take any protons from H3L plus,

68
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:43,402
if it did, that would mean that you would reform the HCL and so the HCL wouldn't be as strong as an acid as you anticipate.

69
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:48,339
Since HCL is extremely strong, CL minus is a weak base.

70
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:54,060
Let's look at another definition for acids and bases, that's sometimes used in organic chemistry.

71
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:02,978
And this is the Lewis definition. So a lewis acid is an electron pair acceptor, and a lewis base is an electron pair donor.

72
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:09,259
The good way to remember this is that Lewis Acid, right, is an electron pair acceptor

73
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,908
so we have two a's

74
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:20,946
lewis base is an electron pair donor. If you take this d here and you reflect it, and you get a b, right, a lowercase b, which of course would refer to a base

75
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:25,467
That's just a quick way of remembering which is which here for your definitions.

76
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:31,433
Let's go ahead and look at a reaction where you have to use the definition of Lewis acid and base.

77
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:38,064
I'm gonna go ahead and draw a cyclic ether here so with lone pairs of electrons on my Oxygen,

78
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,832
and then I'm gonna draw a dot structure for Borane, and so BH3 is Borane

79
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:46,446
and so there is my dot structure.

80
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:51,983
Something a little bit strange about the dot structure of borane, right it doesn't have an octet around it

81
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:57,782
it has six electrons around it, but it can form an octet, because of it's location on the periodic table.

82
00:06:57,797 --> 00:07:01,003
And so that makes borane extremely reactive.

83
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:04,990
If you think about the hybridization of the boron atom right here

84
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:16,101
right, it has a ,it would be SP2 hybridized, right so this would be sp2 hybridized, meaning that the boron has a free P orbital

85
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:22,499
So there's an empty orbital here, and this is what makes borane extremely reactive

86
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,868
as a matter of fact, it will react with itself sometimes,

87
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:29,698
but if we think about this reaction right here,

88
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:37,270
the borane, the boron has an empty orbital, so it's capable of accepting a pair of electrons,

89
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,102
and this ether over here on the right, has a pair of electrons that it can donate.

90
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:51,117
So I can think about this pair of electrons filling the empty orbital and forming a bond with the boron atom.

91
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:58,077
Let's go ahead and draw this acid base reaction here and so we have our Oxygen right

92
00:07:58,153 --> 00:08:04,006
One lone pair of electrons is still on our oxygen, the other lone pair formed a bond with the boron,

93
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:08,866
and the boron is still attached to some hydrogens here, like that.

94
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:15,318
If you already know your formal charges, you can calculate a formal charge of plus 1 on the oxygen here

95
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:19,566
and a formal charge on of negative 1 on the boron. like that

96
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:29,602
And so this is technically an acid base reaction and since the ether over here, on the left, donated a pair of electrons,

97
00:08:29,602 --> 00:08:34,430
so this must be our Lewis Base. An electron paired donor.

98
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:40,241
The borane accepted a pair of electrons and so this must be our lewis acid.

99
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:46,056
So Lewis acid and base definition comes up occasionally in organic chemistry, and it is important to understand.

100
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:50,056
But the most important definition is definitely Bronsted Lowry, so make sure you understand that concept extremely well.
