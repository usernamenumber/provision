00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,320
We know from the last few videos

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:11,460
we have light exiting a slow medium. Let's say I have light ray exiting a slow medium there

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,090
Let me draw. This is its incident angle right over there

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,540
Though it's not the true mechanics of light, you can imagine a car was coming from

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:33,210
a slow medium to a fast medium; it was going from the mud to the road

6
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,400
If the car was moving in the direction of this ray, the left tires would get out of the mud

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,330
before the right tires and they are going to be able to travel faster

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,590
So this will move the direction of the car to the right

9
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,490
So the car will travel in this direction, like that

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,350
where this angle right over here is the angle of refraction

11
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,750
This is a slower medium than that. This is the fast minimum over here

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,440
We get theta 2 is going to be greater than theta 1

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,740
What I want to figure out in this video is

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,720
is there some angle depending on the two substances that the light travels in

15
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,860
where if this angle is big enough--because we know that this angle is always

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,490
is always larger than this angle

17
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,400
that the refraction angle is always bigger than the incident angle

18
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,840
moving from a slow to a fast medium

19
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,580
Is there some angle--if I approach it right over here

20
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,900
Let's call this angle theta 3

21
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,210
Is there some angle theta 3

22
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,550
where that is large enough that the reflected angle is going to be 90 degrees

23
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,470
if that light is actually never going to escape into the fast medium?

24
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:55,340
And if I had a incident angle larger than theta 3, like that

25
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:02,210
So whatever that is, the light won't actually even travel along the surface

26
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,980
it definitely won't escape. It won't even travel on surface. It will actually reflect back

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,190
So you actually have something called total internal reflection

28
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,990
To figure that out, we need to figure out at what angle theta three

29
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:25,020
do we have of a fraction angle of 90 degrees?

30
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,020
That incident angle is going to be called our critical angle

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,790
Anything larger than that will actually have no refraction

32
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,180
It's actually not going to escape the slow medium

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,280
It's just going to reflect at the boundary back into the slow medium

34
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,070
Let's try to figure that out and I'll do it with an actual example

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,720
So let's say I have water. This is water

36
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,310
It has an index of refraction of 1.33

37
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,580
And let's say I have air up here

38
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,560
And air is pretty darn close to a vacuum

39
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,970
And we saw this index of refraction 1.00029 or whatever

40
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:11,260
Let's just for sake of simplicity say its index of refraction 1.00

41
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:21,530
For light that's coming out of the water

42
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:29,120
I want to find some critical angle. I'll call it theta critical

43
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,950
and so if I have any incident angle less than this critical angle, I'll escape

44
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,600
At that critical angle, I just kind of travel at the surface

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,280
Anything larger than that critical angle, I'll actually have total internal reflection

46
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,700
Let's think about what this theta, this critical angle could be

47
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,410
So I'll break out Snell's Law again

48
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,990
We have the index of refraction of the water

49
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:16,720
1.33 times the sine of our critical angle

50
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,670
is going to be equal to the index of refraction of the air which is just one

51
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:30,470
times the sine of this refraction angle, which is 90 degrees

52
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,350
Now what is the sine of 90 degrees? To figure that out, you need to think about the unit circle

53
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,130
You can't just do the soh-cah-toa

54
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,990
This is why the unit circle definition is useful

55
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,610
Think of the unit circle

56
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,820
You go 90 degrees. We are now here on the unit circle

57
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,490
And the sine is the y coordinate. On a unit circle, that is 1

58
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:57,240
So the y coordinate is 1. So this right over here is going to be 1

59
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,520
So to figure this out, we can divide both sides by 1.33

60
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:16,170
So we get the sine of our critical angle is going to be equal to be 1 over 1.33

61
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,390
If you want to generalize it, this is going to be the index of refraction--

62
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,530
this right here is the index of refraction of the faster medium

63
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,750
That right there we can call that index of refraction of the faster medium

64
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:35,600
This right here is the index of refraction of the slower medium. So it's ns

65
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,530
Because the sine of 90 degrees is always going to simplify to 1

66
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,680
when you're finding that critical angle

67
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,840
So I'll just keep solving before we get our calculator out

68
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,880
We take the inverse sine of both sides

69
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:57,580
And we get our critical angle. It's going to be the inverse sine 1 / 1.33

70
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,110
Let's get our handy TI-85 out again

71
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:11,960
We just want to find the inverse sign of 1 / 1.33

72
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:43,230
which tells us if we have light leaving water at an incident angle of more than 48.8 degrees

73
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,280
it actually won't even be able to refract; it won't be able to escape into the air

74
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,410
It's actually going to reflect at that boundary

75
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,980
If you have angles less than 48.8 degrees, it will refract

76
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,810
So if you have an angle right over there

77
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,250
it will be able to escape and reflect a little bit

78
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,330
And then right at 48.8, right at that critical angle

79
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,710
you're gonna have refraction angle of 90 degrees

80
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,130
or really just travel at the surface of water

81
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,910
And this is actually how fiber-optic cables work. Fiber-optic cables are just--

82
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,580
You can view them as glass pipes

83
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:29,600
And the light is traveling and the incident angles are so large here

84
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,250
that the light would just keep reflecting within the fiber-optic

85
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,580
So this is the light ray

86
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,090
If they travel at larger than the critical angle

87
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,640
so instead of escaping into the surrounding air or whatever

88
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,610
it'll keep reflecting within the glass tube

89
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,150
allowing that light information to actual travel

90
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,331
Anyway, hopefully you found that reasonably interesting

91
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:55,000
