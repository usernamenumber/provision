1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:03,487
We've already been exposed to points and lines

2
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:06,007
Now, let's think about planes

3
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:11,674
and you can view planes as really a flat surface that exists in three dimensions

4
00:00:11,674 --> 00:00:13,604
that goes off in every direction.

5
00:00:13,604 --> 00:00:14,745
So for example,

6
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:17,401
if I have a flat surface like this,

7
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:21,076
and it's not curved and it just keeps going on and on and on

8
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:23,271
in every direction

9
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:24,268
Now the question is,

10
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:27,321
&quot;How do you specify a plane?&quot;

11
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:28,213
Well, you might say-

12
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:29,282
well, let's see

13
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:30,338
let's think about it a little bit.

14
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:35,152
Could I specify a plane with one point right over here?

15
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:38,802
Let's call that point A. Would that alone be able to specify a plane?

16
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:43,579
Well, there's an infinite number of planes that could go through that point

17
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,910
I could have a plane that goes like this

18
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,238
where that point A sits on that plane,

19
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,341
I could have a plane like that,

20
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:55,157
or I could have a plane like this,

21
00:00:55,157 --> 00:00:59,538
I could have a plane like this, where point A sits on it as well

22
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:01,337
Also, I can have a plane like that

23
00:01:01,337 --> 00:01:03,569
and I could just keep rotating around A

24
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:08,492
So one point by itself does not seem to be sufficient to define a plane.

25
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:12,567
Well, what about 2 points? Let's say I had a point B

26
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:15,492
right over here. Well, notice, the way I drew this

27
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,314
point A and B, they would define a line

28
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:22,005
For example, they would define this line right over here

29
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,902
So they would define, could define

30
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:26,411
this line right over here

31
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:27,738
but both of these points, and in fact

32
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:31,910
this entire line, exists on both of these planes that I just drew

33
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,743
and I could keep rotating these planes

34
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:36,159
I could have a plane that looks like this,

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,827
I could have a plane that looks like this, that both of these points actually sit on

36
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:44,405
I'm essentially just rotating around this line

37
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:47,571
that is defined by both of these points

38
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:50,152
So two points does not seem to be sufficient.

39
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,205
Let's try three.

40
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:57,143
So there's no way that I could- well, let's be careful here

41
00:01:57,143 --> 00:02:01,492
I could put a third point right over here, point C

42
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:04,472
And C sits on that line and C sits on all of these planes

43
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:08,602
so it doesn't seem like just a random third point is sufficient

44
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:12,243
to define, to pick out any one of these planes.

45
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:13,906
Well, what if we make the constraint

46
00:02:13,906 --> 00:02:16,820
that the three points are not all on the same line?

47
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,730
Obviously, two points will always define a line,

48
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,878
but what if the three points are not collinear?

49
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:23,904
So instead of picking C as a point,

50
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:29,604
what if we pick- is there any way to pick a point D that is not on this line

51
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:33,608
that is on more than one of these planes?

52
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:34,072
Well, no!

53
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,337
If I say- well, let's see

54
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:38,271
the point D- let's say point D is right over here

55
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:40,003
so it sits on this plane right over here

56
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:41,827
(one of the first ones that I drew)

57
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:44,003
So point D sits on that plane

58
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:48,930
Between point D, A, and B, there's only one plane that all three of those points sit on.

59
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,826
So a plane is defined by three noncollinear points.

60
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:57,325
So D, A, and B, you see,

61
00:02:57,325 --> 00:02:59,075
do not sit on the same line.

62
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:00,824
A and B can sit on the same line,

63
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:02,336
D and A can sit on the same line,

64
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:04,154
D and B can sit on the same line,

65
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:09,005
but A, B, and D does not sit on- they are noncollinear.

66
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:12,672
So for example, right over here in this diagram,

67
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:16,237
we have a plane- this plane is labeled S

68
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,731
but another way that we can specify plane S

69
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,336
is we could say

70
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:21,322
plane

71
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:25,074
And we just have to find the three noncollinear points on that plane

72
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:31,819
So we could call this plane "AJB"

73
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:40,135
We could call it plane &quot;JBW&quot;

74
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:41,874
We could call it plane- and I could keep going

75
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:47,244
plane "WJA"

76
00:03:47,244 --> 00:03:50,522
But I could NOT specify this plane uniquely by saying-

77
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:57,273
so I could not say plane &quot;ABW&quot;

78
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:58,667
And the reason why I can't do this is 'cause

79
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,067
A, B, and W are all on the same line

80
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,412
and this line sits on an infinite number of planes

81
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:05,070
I could keep rotating around the line

82
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,577
just as we did over here

83
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:10,577
It does not specify only one plane.
