1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,400
My cousin Nadia is taking a
summer calculus course and

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,731
she called me last night.

3
00:00:04,731 --> 00:00:07,150
And she had some limit
problems and they were

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,020
excellent problem.

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,050
So I thought it was worthwhile
to make videos on the problems

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,040
that she had to figure out.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,830
Anyway, so let's do them.

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,930
If I remember them correctly.

9
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,070
I'm doing this on memory.

10
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,785
So I hope the answers work out
like they did last night when

11
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:21,500
we were going over
them on the phone.

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,750
So if I remember correctly,
the first one was the limit

13
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:33,530
as z approaches 2 of x.

14
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:33,870
Oh no.

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,440
Not that-- There's no x.

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,230
It's a z.

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:50,080
Of z squared plus 2z minus 8.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:57,020
All of that over z to
the fourth minus 16.

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,810
So the first thing when you
want to do when you try a limit

20
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,270
problem is, well you just try
to substitute the value into--

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,970
Maybe there's no problem when z
equals 2 and you just evaluate

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,820
the function at z equals 2.

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,980
If it's a continuous function,
then the limit as z

24
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,480
approaches 2 is going to
be the function at 2.

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,410
But you immediately see a
problem if you put 2 right

26
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,850
here-- 2 to the fourth minus
16 --and you get a 0 in the

27
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,970
denominator, which is
undefined, so we have to

28
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,590
figure out some way
to get around that.

29
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,600
And nine times out of 10, when
you see a problem like this,

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,650
the solution, because both the
numerator and the denominator

31
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,330
look factorable, is to factor
the numerator and

32
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,130
the denominator.

33
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:42,130
So this is equal to the
limit as z approaches 2.

34
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,940
What's the numerator factored?

35
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,400
Let's see.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,550
Something when you add two
numbers, you get positive

37
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,490
2, and you multiply
them, you get minus 8.

38
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,370
So it's probably plus
4 and minus 2, right?

39
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,380
So this is going to
be x plus-- No.

40
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,510
Not an x.

41
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,140
I'm so conditioned.

42
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,300
I'm like a dog.

43
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,380
Oh.

44
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,730
I can't even undo it anymore.

45
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,440
Anyway, well z-- Actually
let me erase that.

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,536
I don't want to be messy.

47
00:02:12,536 --> 00:02:13,810
Let me erase.

48
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,130
I tried to undo it and it
doesn't remember everything.

49
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:24,220
So it's z plus 4
times z minus 2.

50
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,300
That's just factoring
a quadratic.

51
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,420
And what is this?

52
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,130
This has the form a squared
minus b squared, right?

53
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,380
So that's going to be-- But a
squared-- If this is a squared

54
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,450
minus b squared, a would
be z squared, right?

55
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:48,330
So it's z squared plus 4
times z squared minus 4.

56
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,830
And then, of course, this
also has the form a squared

57
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,790
plus b squared, right?

58
00:02:52,790 --> 00:03:02,110
So this will further factor
into z plus 2 times z minus 2.

59
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,790
Well, our factoring paid off.

60
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,280
We see a term in the numerator
and the denominator

61
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,230
that are the same.

62
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,630
And not only are they the
same, but they-- This is

63
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,570
the term that was giving
us the problems, right?

64
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,510
Because you put a 2 in
here, you got a 0.

65
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,590
So let's assume that we're not
evaluating it at z equals 2.

66
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,420
And so, for all other
values, we can divide those

67
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,430
because those are going
to be the same values.

68
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,260
And then what are we left with?

69
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,150
This is equal to the limit--
and I've change colors

70
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:40,060
arbitrarily --as z approaches
2 of z plus 4 over z squared

71
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,870
plus 4 times z plus 2.

72
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,240
Which is equal what?

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,000
That's equal to 6 over--
what's 2 squared plus 4?

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,880
Is 8.

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,570
And then 2 plus 2 is 4.

76
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,820
6 over 12 is equal to 1/2.

77
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,250
There you go.

78
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,820
I thought that was a pretty
interesting problem.

79
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,980
Let's do another one.

80
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,290
And this one I found
even more interesting.

81
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,160
She gave me-- It's really
testing my memory to see

82
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,860
if I can-- But I remember
the gist of the problem.

83
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,640
So I might not get the exact
numbers she'd given me, but

84
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,930
hopefully I get the
exact properties.

85
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:27,250
So it's the limit as x
approaches infinity of the

86
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:40,080
square root of x squared
plus 4x plus 1 minus x.

87
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,860
So when you look at this
you're like well let's see.

88
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,070
What's happening here?

89
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,160
Let's see this.

90
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,460
As you go to infinity, this
term will get really big.

91
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,750
But then we're taking
the square root of it.

92
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,810
And it seems like this term
would overpower this term.

93
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,460
And then, so maybe this kind
of converges to x, but then

94
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,670
we would subtract an x.

95
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,700
So maybe it approaches 0.

96
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,860
So that's, at least, that
was my first intuition

97
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
when I spoke to her.

98
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,930
But as we will see, the
intuition here is wrong.

99
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,050
And really to do this you
have to know a little

100
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,340
bit of a trick.

101
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,470
And this trick pays off a lot
whenever you see something with

102
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,950
the square root sign, then
subtracting something else, if

103
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,730
you want to get rid of
that square root sign.

104
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,120
So what we are going to do is
going to multiply-- Essentially

105
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,380
the conjugate we normally
apply to complex numbers.

106
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,300
But if we have something like
a plus b, the conjugate

107
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,920
is a minus b, right?

108
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,630
Or if we have something
like a minus b, the

109
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,300
conjugate is a plus b.

110
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,150
And the reason why-- And what
we're going to do is we're

111
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,650
going to multiply by
the conjugate of this.

112
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,060
And why does-- Why
is that normal?

113
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,880
Why is that useful?

114
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,065
Because we have a minus b.

115
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:46,110
If we multiply it times a
plus b, we get a squared

116
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,440
minus b squared.

117
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,530
Which will make this radical
sign disappear without

118
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,240
too much work.

119
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,190
So let's do that.

120
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,560
Let's multiply by the
conjugate of this thing.

121
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,060
But we can't just
multiply it, right?

122
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,800
We have to multiply it
by it over itself.

123
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,790
Because you can only-- To not
change the value of something,

124
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,140
you can only multiply it by 1.

125
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:09,020
So let's multiply it by the
conjugate: x squared plus

126
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,930
4x plus 1 plus x, right?

127
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,630
That's the conjugate, right?

128
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,660
Instead of minus x,
we have a plus x.

129
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,780
And we can't just
multiply that.

130
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,360
We have to multiply it by
1, otherwise we would

131
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,240
be changing the value.

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
So it's going to be divided
by the same thing.

133
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,630
x squared plus 4x
plus 1 plus x.

134
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,610
Let me erase this stuff
down here so we don't

135
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,970
get distracted.

136
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,770
Don't want to get distracted.

137
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,930
And so what do we have?

138
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:48,530
This will become the limit
as x approaches infinity.

139
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,240
Well, this is a minus
b times a plus b.

140
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,560
So we end up with a squared.

141
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,340
Well, what's this squared?

142
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:01,250
That's x squared plus 4x
plus 1 minus b squared.

143
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,600
Well what's b squared?

144
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,350
Well, b is x.

145
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,400
So it's going to be
minus x squared.

146
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,740
This is just algebra.

147
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:15,150
Divided by this thing: the
square root of x squared

148
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,995
plus 4x plus 1 plus x.

149
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:22,720
So let's see.

150
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
There's a little
simplification we can do.

151
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,900
We can subtract-- We can--
These top two terms cancel out.

152
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,820
So x squared minus x squared.

153
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,890
And now let's see
what we can do.

154
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,700
Well since we're taking x
to infinity, and this is

155
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,490
what you normally do what
you take x to infinity.

156
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,270
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator by

157
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,730
our highest degree term.

158
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,800
And in this case, our highest
degree terms is x, right?

159
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,520
We have an x here
and an x here.

160
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,080
And then when you take-- And
then, of course, when you

161
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,725
divide something like this
by x, and you take it to,

162
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,070
infinity, this will approach 0.

163
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,180
So let's do that.

164
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,440
Let's divide the numerator
and the denominator by x.

165
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,000
And remember: anything you do
in the numerator, you have

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,700
to do in the denominator.

167
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,420
Otherwise you're
changing the value.

168
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,630
So times 1 over x
over 1 over x.

169
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,350
I'm just dividing the numerator
and the denominator by x.

170
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,360
So this is equal to the limit
as x approaches infinity of--

171
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:24,620
What's-- That's going to
be 4 plus 1 over x over--

172
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,420
Let me ask you a question.

173
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,320
What is 1 over x
times this thing?

174
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,920
What is-- This is a bit of an
algebra review, but 1 over x.

175
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,230
What's 1 over x times x
squared plus 4x plus 1?

176
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,150
I'm just doing a little
on the side here.

177
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,360
Well if we take the 1 over
x and we put it into the

178
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,310
radical sign, it becomes
1 over x squared, right?

179
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,630
This is the same thing as--
You can say 1 squared

180
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,660
over x squared, but--
1 over x squared.

181
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,890
You could say 1 squared.

182
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,640
You could put a square there,
but-- Times x squared

183
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,410
plus 4x plus 1.

184
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,250
And that should make
sense to you, right?

185
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,380
Because if we started with
this, we could easily just

186
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,980
take the square root of
this and take it outside.

187
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,325
And the square root
of this is 1 over x.

188
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,640
I'm just going in the
other direction, right?

189
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,050
So, assuming you're comfortable
with that, everything

190
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,020
under the radical sign.

191
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,070
Even though we're actually
dividing by 1 over x, since

192
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,060
we're going into the radical
sign, we're actually

193
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,340
dividing by x squared.

194
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,840
So it becomes-- this is the
radical sign --x squared

195
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,770
divided by x squared
is 1, right?

196
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,820
I hope you understand why we're
dividing by x squared here.

197
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,860
We're actually
dividing by 1 over x.

198
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,690
But when you put it under the
radical sign, it becomes

199
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,440
1 over x squared.

200
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,540
Let me put it this way.

201
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,800
1 over x times the
square root of a.

202
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,140
That's the same thing.

203
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,600
That equals the square
root of 1 squared over x

204
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,630
squared times a, right?

205
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,970
And this is just 1
over x squared.

206
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,280
So that's the property, or the
algebra that we're using.

207
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,020
So anyway, we divide all
of this by x squared.

208
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:11,160
So that becomes a 1 plus 4
over x plus 1 over x squared.

209
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,770
And then, of course, we divide
this one by-- This term right

210
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,450
here, we divide by x, right?

211
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,970
Because it's not in
the radical sign.

212
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,140
So that just becomes a 1.

213
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,150
So now what's the limit as
x approaches infinity?

214
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,900
Well as x approaches infinity,
this term right here

215
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,720
goes to 0, right?

216
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
1 over infinity is 0.

217
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,560
This term right here goes to 0.

218
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,790
This term right here goes to 0.

219
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,520
And so what are we left with?

220
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:44,270
This is equal to 4 over the
square root of 1 plus 1.

221
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,070
Well that's just 1.

222
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:53,040
So that equals 4 over 2,
which is equal to 2.

223
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,840
There you go.

224
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,860
Now let's do one more problem.

225
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,120
This is the third
one she'd given me.

226
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,720
In it, we had to kind of brush
off our trig identities.

227
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,560
And really these harder limit
problems, they're all about

228
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,620
kind of knowing your algebra
and your trigonometry

229
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,150
really well.

230
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,750
Just so you know how to
manipulate these functions.

231
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,790
Because the limit part-- You
just have to get it into a form

232
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,405
where taking the limit is
fairly straightforward.

233
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,880
So let's do that trig problem.

234
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,102
Clear image.

235
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:20,950
Invert colors.

236
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:27,110
So it was the limit
as x approaches 0

237
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:33,170
of cotangent of 2x.

238
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,370
Was that it?

239
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:34,610
Yeah.

240
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:43,080
It was cotangent of 2x
over the cosecant of x.

241
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,870
And this one, just like
previous problems, more than

242
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,940
knowing your pre-calculus or
your calculus, you need to

243
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,020
know your trig identities.

244
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,500
So cosecant of x.

245
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,070
That's just 1 over sine.

246
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,650
I remember that by saying
it's not intuitive.

247
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,800
You would have thought that the
cosecant is 1 over cosine.

248
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,230
But it's not.

249
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,060
It's 1 over sine.

250
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,740
So I remember that
it's not intuitive.

251
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:11,480
And cotangent of 2x is equal
to 1 over tangent of 2x.

252
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,330
And tangent is sine over
cosine, so cotangent's

253
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:14,610
the opposite.

254
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:22,290
And so that equals cosine of
2x over sine of 2x, right?

255
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,430
OK.

256
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,180
So what is this equal to?

257
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,100
So this is going to be the
limit as x approaches 0.

258
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:37,740
Cotangent of 2x, we said, was
cosine of 2x over sine of 2x.

259
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,490
And then it's going to be all
of that over the cosecant of x.

260
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,000
Well that's just 1
over sine of x.

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,820
Well if you divide by 1 over
sine of x, that's the same

262
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,120
thing as multiplying
by sine of x.

263
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,780
So we have-- What do we have?

264
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:08,110
We have cosine-- Well we have
sine of x times cosine of 2x.

265
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,060
All of that divided
by sine of 2x.

266
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,610
Just doing a little arithmetic.

267
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,910
And we have a
problem here still.

268
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,200
Because when you take x
approaches 0, this term right

269
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,080
here goes to 0 and we have a 0
in the denominator, which

270
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,140
is just not acceptable.

271
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,130
Because it's undefined.

272
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,520
And that's the whole reason
why we're doing this

273
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,780
limit to begin with.

274
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,230
And actually that's the first
thing you should have done.

275
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,730
You should have tried to put it
and you would have seen that

276
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,070
you would've gotten a 0 value
in the denominator and it would

277
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,600
have been unevaluatable.

278
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,170
Right.

279
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,390
Because really, this is
just-- We haven't even

280
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,340
done any manipulation yet.

281
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,190
This is the same thing as this.

282
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,870
And if you put the 0 right
here, you get undefined.

283
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,040
So what can we do?

284
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,210
Well this is where your
break out the trig or you

285
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,710
brush off your memory.

286
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,270
What is the sine of 2x equal?

287
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,490
And this is your double-- One
of the double angle formulas.

288
00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:01,660
Sine of 2x is equal to 2
sine of x cosine of x.

289
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,570
So if you know that, then
you've gone a long way because

290
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,290
then it becomes pretty
simple to simplify.

291
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:13,710
So it becomes 2 sine
of x cosine of x.

292
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,710
And if we assume that x isn't
0, it's just approaching 0, we

293
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,140
can divide the numerator and
the denominator by sine of x.

294
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,340
And what are we left with?

295
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:29,870
We're left with the limit as
x approaches 0 of cosine

296
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,420
of 2x over 2 cosine of x.

297
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,270
Well what's cosine of 0?

298
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,400
Cosine of 0 is 1, right?

299
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,010
So cosine of 2 times 0,
which is 0, that's also 1.

300
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,560
So that is equal to 1 over--
right, cosine of 0 is

301
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,490
1 --over 2 times 1.

302
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,690
So it equals 1/2.

303
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,160
There you go.

304
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,840
I think those are three
fairly meaty limit problems.

305
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,020
And if you know that, you're
probably prepared for something

306
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,670
that your calculus teacher
might throw at you.

307
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,960
See you in a future video.
