1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,270
Let's think about how put options can

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,570
give us leverage on a downside,

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,710
or should I say a bet that the stock

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,840
will go down relative to shorting

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,360
and this one is a little more complicated because

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,110
shorting is a little bit less intuitive.

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,220
But if you were to short a stock, in order to short it,

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,150
you might say"hey, I don't have to put any money up front...

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,760
"...because I essentially just borrow the stock immediately

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,180
and then I would sell it for $50..."

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,280
But the reality is that you do have to put some capital

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,830
up front because the short can move against you.

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,960
Usually you have to put at least 50%

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,060
of the value of the short.

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,020
So in our "short scenario" you would have to put

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,320
at least $25 up front and then you would borrow the stock,

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,570
sell it for $50, so essentially you will have $75

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,420
to play with that you would eventually have to

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,660
use to buy back the stock, but the upfront capital is $25.

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,560
Now in our scenario where the stock went down

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,310
which was a good thing if you're shorting,

22
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,690
you want the stock, that was your bet

23
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,850
you want the stock to go down.

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,950
In this scenario where the stock went down to $20

25
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,790
you made a profit of $30.

26
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,110
You were able to buy that stock for $20

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,940
and then give it back to the original person

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,740
so you were able to keep that $50 although net for that $20

29
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,320
so you made $30.

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,140
So you made $30 on a $25 investment.

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,320
So your gain -- you make $25 plus another $5

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,520
so that's a 120% gain.

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,180
So let me write that down

34
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,860
You made a 120% gain.

35
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,100
Of course in this scenario you gained

36
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,360
when the stock went down.

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,050
In terms of loss, here, when the stock went up

38
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,080
the stock went up to $80 we lost $30 by shorting.

39
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,640
We had a 120% loss.

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,450
So once again 120% loss.

41
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,860
So it's important to realize in a short situation,

42
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,850
the best thing that can happen for you

43
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,410
is your stock goes to 0.

44
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,220
In which case you can kind of...

45
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,010
buy it back for nothing which means you can keep your $50.

46
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,600
So in the best possible scenario you have to put $25 up

47
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,200
front you can keep the $50 that you got from

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,430
borrowing and selling the stock

49
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,020
so you can make a 200% return.

50
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,720
In the worst case scenario

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,770
(so the best scenario is this is 200%)

52
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,760
this would be infinite.

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,030
So you have to be very careful while you're shorting.

54
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,100
But let's think about the put option.

55
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,340
In the put option we only have to put $5 up front

56
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,850
to actually buy the put and when the stock went down to $20,

57
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,440
when the stock went down to $20

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,400
we made $15. So this was a 300% gain.

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,170
And on the other side of the equation

60
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,520
when the stock went up the worst we could do

61
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,160
was just lose all of our money.

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,040
So the worst thing we can do is just lose 100%.

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,020
So once again we were able to multiply,

64
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,680
we were able to multiply our gains relative to shorting

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,480
although it's a little more mixed on the downside

66
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,250
because the put gives you a little bit of protection there.
