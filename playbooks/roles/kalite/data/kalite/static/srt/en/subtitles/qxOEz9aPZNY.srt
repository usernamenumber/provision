1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,580
There's been a lot of talk very
recently, or definitely

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,940
over the last several years,
about the idea of intelligent

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,970
design and how it compares
to evolution.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,580
And my goal in this video
isn't to enter into that

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,950
discussion, or it's actually
turned into an argument in

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,505
most circles, but really to make
my best attempt to kind

8
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:25,710
of reconcile the notions.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,110
So the idea behind intelligent
design is really that there

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,250
are some things that we see in
our world that are just so

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,560
amazing that it seems hard to
believe that it could be the

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,390
product of a set of
random processes.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,130
And the example that tends to
be given is the human eye,

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,630
which truly is an awe-inspiring
device.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,200
You can call it an organ
or a machine.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,820
Whatever you want to call
it, it does all of

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,680
these amazing things.

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,900
It can focus at different
lengths.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,740
It brings the light into focus
at just the right spot, and

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,420
then you have your retinal
nerves and you have two eyes

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,260
so can see in stereoscopic
vision.

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,850
You can see in colors, and then
you can adjust to light

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,500
and dark, so the human eye
truly is awe inspiring.

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,020
And the argument tends to go
that, look, how can this be

25
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,460
created from random processes?

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,510
And the goal of this isn't to
trace the evolution of the

27
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,050
eye, but I'll do a little side
note here that evolution is--

28
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,140
and natural selection, and
I like the word natural

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,680
selection more because
it's not talking

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,920
about an active process.

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,710
Natural selection is acting over
eons and eons of time,

32
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,370
and we do see evidence in our
world of a progression of

33
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,460
different types of eyes.

34
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,940
In fact, all evidence shows
that the human eye is not

35
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,970
perfect, and that there
is variation.

36
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,230
I mean, we all know some of us
are nearsighted, some are

37
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,900
farsighted.

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,620
We have astigmatisms. It
degenerates over time.

39
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,750
People generate cataracts, so
there's a whole set of things

40
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,480
that can go wrong with
the human eye.

41
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,070
I'm not using that as a
rebuttal, but I'm just showing

42
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,850
you that there is variation,
even in what I believe is

43
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,320
truly an amazing piece
of biology.

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,490
And even if you go outside of
the human world, there's

45
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,139
obviously a huge spectrum
of eyes.

46
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,570
You have fish at the bottom of
the ocean that have eyes that

47
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,410
are really just light sensors,
that barely can maybe tell

48
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,780
you-- and some insects are like
this-- whether there's

49
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,760
some light or some heat
around, nothing

50
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,950
really more than that.

51
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,850
And at the other end of the
spectrum, far better than

52
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,930
humans, you have certain birds
and a certain type of

53
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,650
nocturnal creatures where they
can see in the dark.

54
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,330
You know, maybe you have a
certain-- actually, all cats

55
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,080
have this reflective material in
their eye that allows them

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,570
much better night vision, so in
that way they're superior

57
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,710
to humans, and they can see just
as good as humans during

58
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,090
the daytime.

59
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,070
You have certain birds who can
see with far more visual

60
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,750
clarity at far better distances
than humans can, so

61
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,490
there is no perfect eye.

62
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,750
So I'll go into a little bit
of a theological argument

63
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,800
here, and for those of you who
watch my videos, you know that

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,380
I'm one to stray away from
theological arguments,

65
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,640
although I might eventually do
a whole philosophy playlist,

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,520
but I want to be very careful
not to offend anyone's

67
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,330
sensibilities, because
that truly, truly,

68
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,100
truly is not my intention.

69
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,440
But the whole point I want to
make is that, look, if you

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,310
believe in a God, and I won't
take sides on that argument in

71
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:23,030
this video right here, it's to
some degree, I would say,

72
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,640
almost disparaging of an
all-powerful being to say that

73
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,850
this human eye, it kind of gives
too much importance to

74
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,100
us as individuals.

75
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,430
I always think that religion--
and actually science.

76
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,530
Or actually everything.

77
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,480
I mean, we should be humble in
our lives, and there should be

78
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,950
the realization that we, as
humans, really-- this isn't

79
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:51,050
perfection, and to imply that
this is the best that a

80
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,220
perfect entity or an
all-powerful entity could

81
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,330
produce I think is a little
actually disparaging of it.

82
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,960
I'll give you another example.

83
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,600
I give you another example, and
I'll put my engineering

84
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,460
hat on here.

85
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,670
And once again, I want
to be very clear.

86
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,950
My goal isn't in this video to
say, oh, you know, look, hey,

87
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,130
evolution, random processes,
that by itself, there is no

88
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,850
God, and you just have
to live with it.

89
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,820
No, that's not my point.

90
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,160
I'm actually making the opposite
argument, that a

91
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,370
belief in God would not point
to a God who-- a belief in a

92
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,300
universal, all-powerful God
would not point to a God who

93
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,510
designs the particular, who
designs each particular.

94
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,640
And even more, the imperfections
that we see

95
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,790
around us would-- and especially
because we see

96
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,420
variation and they're being
selected for it.

97
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,950
I mean, we can't just
focus on the eye.

98
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,160
We would have to focus on
viruses and cancers, and it

99
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,460
would have to speak to a God
that is designing one off

100
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,990
every version of every sequence
of DNA that we see,

101
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,790
because if someone talks about
designing an eye, we know that

102
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,220
the eye is the byproduct of DNA,
and we know the DNA is a

103
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,950
sequence of base pairs, you
know, ATG, C, A, and, you

104
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,240
know, billions and
billions of them.

105
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,970
And so when we talk about
design, we would be talking

106
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,550
literally about designing
the sequence.

107
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,490
And we even know that a lot of
the sequence, there's some

108
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,230
noise in there.

109
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,210
We know that a lot of it comes
from primitive viruses deep in

110
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:18,890
our past.

111
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,800
So the argument I'm making here
is that in order to give

112
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,380
credit to the all powerful, at
least to my mind, a system

113
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:44,410
that comes from very simple and
elegant basic ideas like

114
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:50,050
natural selection and
variations, that in our DNA,

115
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,350
we call those mutations, in
the laws of physics and

116
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,090
chemistry, and those, from that
simple and elegant basic

117
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,350
ideas, for complexity
to emerge.

118
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,540
So this is one idea and this
is what really evolution

119
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,700
speaks to, that, look, our
universe is this profound

120
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,560
world, this profound
environment, where from these

121
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,750
very basic, simple, beautiful
ideas, we have this complexity

122
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,730
in the structure that is truly,

123
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,060
truly, truly awe inspiring.

124
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,030
This is, in my mind, what
evolution speaks to.

125
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,070
And in my mind, even as an
engineer, this speaks to a

126
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,930
higher form of design.

127
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,165
This speak to a more
profound design.

128
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:37,620
   

129
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,330
So this whole video, the whole
argument, is that if one does

130
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,210
believe in a God, and, you know,
I'm not going to take

131
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,860
sides in that in this video,
and a God that speaks to

132
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:58,060
beauty and elegance and is
infinitely powerful, then this

133
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,670
idea of the laws of physics
and chemistry and natural

134
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,910
selection, which is really-- I
mean, you know, when I talked

135
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,800
about natural selection in the
last video, it was really-- I

136
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,900
think you would find it was
a bit of common sense.

137
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,290
That this is a very profound
design and it speaks to the

138
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,160
art of the designer as opposed
to designing each of these

139
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,150
entities one off.

140
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,100
And what's even more profound
about the design

141
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,970
is that it's adaptive.

142
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,070
If there's environmental
stress, then the other

143
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,420
variations survive
more frequently.

144
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,930
And so it's never changing,
that perfection, that no

145
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,140
instance can ever be pointed to
and say this is the highest

146
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,830
point that this design
can reach.

147
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,480
That is always-- I don't want
to say getting better.

148
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,650
It's always getting more suited
to its environment as

149
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,840
it changes, and that to
me is a better design.

150
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,250
Now, just following
up on that, and I

151
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:53,970
want to be very clear.

152
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,460
This whole idea is to kind of
raise the standard of what we

153
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,230
expect out of design.

154
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,290
It's to kind of show other
points or other places in the

155
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,310
scientific or mathematical world
where this does emerge.

156
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,900
And the best example I see
of that is with fractals.

157
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,850
A lot of you-all might have
seen-- this is the Mandelbrot

158
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,610
set, a very famous
set of fractals.

159
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,230
It's immensely complex.

160
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,580
In fact, you can keep zooming
in on the Mandelbrot set at

161
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,370
any point, and when you zoom it
out, it becomes infinitely

162
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,940
complex, and you can explore
it indefinitely.

163
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,870
But the beauty of it, the true
beauty of it, is all of this

164
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,360
can be described by one
equation, one almost

165
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,409
shockingly simple equation, and
that's this: The next z is

166
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,340
equal to the z before
it squared plus 1.

167
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,080
And you're like you know, Sal,
you started talking about

168
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,070
intelligent design and evolution
and all of that.

169
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,500
Why are you all of a sudden
breaking into fractals?

170
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,340
And the point I'm trying to make
here is that if I had two

171
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,280
designers and one set out to
go and paint this exact

172
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,710
particular fractal and say,
oh, you know, I'm going to

173
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,620
make this brown and I'm going
to make this blue and I'm

174
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,950
going to make this a circle
with other circles, you'd

175
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,430
think this is an amazing
painter.

176
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,590
For example, if you were to go
to someone 300 years ago and

177
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,920
you were to show them this, they
would say that this is

178
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,380
the finest design that anyone
might have ever been able to

179
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,780
devise, because it's so
infinitely complex.

180
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,150
But now we know that this can
be completely described by

181
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,880
this simple equation,
literally.

182
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,020
For those of you are interested,
all they're doing,

183
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,170
this is a complex plane, and
they're starting at zero--

184
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,890
excuse me, not plus 1, plus c.

185
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,020
Let me make that very clear.

186
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,170
This is the equation plus c.

187
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,990
So for every point on the
complex plane, you put that

188
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,850
point in for c, and then you
start with zero, and you keep

189
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,360
doing this.

190
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,860
So you say zero squared plus
that number, that complex

191
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,100
number, is equal to that.

192
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,230
Then you put that in here, and
then you do that number

193
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,290
squared plus that complex
number, and you do it again.

194
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,050
You do it over and
over and over.

195
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,110
So turns out that some numbers
don't go to infinity and those

196
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,520
numbers are in black.

197
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,860
They're considered part
of the Mandelbrot set.

198
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,790
And then the numbers that do go
to infinity, as you iterate

199
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,130
on this formula, you color it
based on how fast it goes to

200
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,800
infinity, and it creates this
infinitely beautiful and

201
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,640
complex pattern.

202
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,190
Now, if you were to say what is
a more profound design, and

203
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,640
you can ask any engineer this,
in my mind, this is the most

204
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,840
profound design.

205
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,610
Because it's simple and elegant,
but it describes

206
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,100
something of infinite
complexity.

207
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,580
It's not just focused on the
particular, it's focused on

208
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,000
kind of the metalevel.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,280
It's focused on creating just
the idea of which this is just

210
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,270
an example.

211
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:55,680
So anyway, this is probably my
video where I steer most away

212
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,690
from the science of it all and
maybe I focus a little bit

213
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,260
more on the slightly

214
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,610
metaphysical or the awe inspiring.

215
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,290
But my whole point here is to
really throw out my little

216
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,440
idea of how you can reconcile
these notions.

217
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,350
That evolution, the randomness
of it, does not speak to a

218
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,280
Godless universe, although
I'm not going to

219
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,290
take sides on that.

220
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,930
It speaks to a more profound
God, in my mind.

221
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:27,170
So anyway, forgive me for taking
my liberties, and I

222
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,710
want to make it very clear, I
don't want to offend anyone's

223
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,910
sensibilities, but I really
just wanted to throw

224
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,700
this idea out there.

225
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,440
See you in the next video.
