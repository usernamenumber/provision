1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
   

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:08,300
In the last video we saw that
if you wanted to take a plus b

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,000
to the nth power, and if n is
larger than, really, 2-- but

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,590
really, especially larger than
3-- it is very tedious to

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,930
multiply it out, essentially
using the distributive

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,480
property, or doing polynomial
multiplication, or FOIL, or

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,130
however you learned it.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,410
It is extremely,
extremely tedious.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,920
And then we learned that the
binomial theorem, which said

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:34,170
this, that that is equal to
the sum from k is equal to 0,

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,470
to n of n choose k-- right?

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,390
Where that was what we learned
in combinatorics as the

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,350
binomial coefficient.

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,130
And that's why it's called a
binomial coefficient, because

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,970
it's actually the coefficient
of the binomial theorem.-- Of

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,570
x to the n minus k-- oh,
sorry, I keep writing x.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,210
Let me undo that.

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,920
Edit, undo.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,250
Edit, undo.

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,250
Oh, it's taking too long.

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,810
Oh, let me just-- oh no, that's
not what I wanted to do.

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,860
Let me erase it.

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,086
OK.

24
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:11,190
I keep writing x.

25
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,680
It could be an x, but then
this would have to be

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,650
an x here, as well.

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,570
   

28
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,810
Maybe I should do that.

29
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:26,780
--Of a to the n minus
k, times b to the k.

30
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,840
So each term-- you know, the n
stays constant-- but each term,

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,130
you start at k equals 0 and
you keep incrementing up.

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,060
And we did an example to solve
a plus b to the fourth power

33
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,210
in the previous video.

34
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,840
And as you saw, that was
tedious, but less tedious than

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,640
actually multiplying it out.

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,610
And if you get really fast
at computing n choose k

37
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,640
for different ns and k, it
could be reasonably fast.

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,130
So what I want to do is, I'm
going to show you a slightly

39
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,010
faster method than
what we just did.

40
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,060
Kind of a faster way to compute
the binomial coefficients.

41
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,480
And then after that, I'm going
to show you a super fast way

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,290
that, short of memorizing the
coefficients-- which I actually

43
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,520
know some people who've done
that-- is a pretty amazing way

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,590
to essentially multiply
out any binomial.

45
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,410
So what's my pseudo
fast way of doing it?

46
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,820
Well, I hinted in the last
presentation that those

47
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,640
coefficients were actually
terms of a Pascal triangle.

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,720
So what's a Pascal triangle?

49
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,430
So if we start off with a 1 and
then you just go-- actually,

50
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,210
let me do it-- well, yeah,
let me do it right here.

51
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,190
And then, actually let
me start with two 1s.

52
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,340
And what you do is, you take
the sum of both of these.

53
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,100
So that's a 2.

54
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,190
And then you bring down
a 1, to the left and

55
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,450
the right hand side.

56
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,620
And notice, these are
the coefficients of

57
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,740
a plus b squared.

58
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,330
   

59
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,100
And these are the
coefficients of a plus b.

60
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,530
You could say a
plus b to the one.

61
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,480
1a plus 1b.

62
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,980
This is a squared-- so you
could rewrite, a plus b

63
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:14,070
squared. is 1a squared
plus 2ab plus 1b squared.

64
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,400
So these are the coefficients
of a plus b squared.

65
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,110
Let me arbitrarily
switch colors.

66
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,090
And so, 1 plus 2 is 3.

67
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,290
2 plus 1 is 3.

68
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,010
Bring down the 1.

69
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,610
Bring down the 1.

70
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,560
And now we have the
coefficients for a

71
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,720
plus b to the third.

72
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,570
Which we computed in
the-- that was the very

73
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,150
first thing we did.

74
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,250
We actually multiplied it out.

75
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,520
And we just know the pattern.

76
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,150
The first coefficient is 1.

77
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,780
So it's 1a to the third, b to
the zero-- so we don't have

78
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,200
to write the b-- plus 3.

79
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,680
We just decrement
this exponent 1.

80
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:03,370
3a squared b plus 3ab squared,
and then plus 1a to the zero--

81
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,680
which is just 1-- b cubed.

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,790
So that was pretty fast.

83
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,260
And we can keep going down
the Pascal triangle.

84
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,890
So let's do the next one.

85
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,760
So we can bring down a 1.

86
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,750
1 plus 3 is 4.

87
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,220
3 plus 3 is 6.

88
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,080
And this is neat.

89
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,400
I mean, just very simply, you
can actually generate binomial

90
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,990
coefficients without
having to compute them.

91
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,160
Very simple, I guess you
could call it an algorithm.

92
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,750
Or drawing.

93
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,970
And it's symmetric, just as
you would expect it, right?

94
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,750
Because you could
easily switch b and a.

95
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,540
a plus b is the same thing
as b plus a, so you

96
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,620
should essentially
get the same answer.

97
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,920
And so, we just-- very quickly
we figured out the binomial

98
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,770
coefficients for a
plus b to the fourth.

99
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,990
Which was a lot faster than
we did in the last example.

100
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,660
a plus b to the fourth.

101
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,700
So then we-- I think
you get the point.

102
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,660
But, so it's 1-- let me write
in a different color-- 1a

103
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,080
to the fourth, b to the
zero, plus 4a cubed b

104
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,400
squared-- b to the one.

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,930
Plus 6a squared b squared.

106
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,640
Which makes sense that, you
know, this is a middle number

107
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,890
and they both-- and a and b
have the same exponent

108
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,150
at this point.

109
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,490
And then plus 4a-- we
decrement it-- b cubed.

110
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,640
Plus b to the fourth.

111
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,946
1b to the fourth, right? a
to the zero, so that's what

112
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:23,780
we didn't write there.

113
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,620
So 1b to the fourth.

114
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,940
And that was very fast compared
to what we had to do at

115
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,420
the end of the last video.

116
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,460
We could just keep going.

117
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,990
You know, for 5.

118
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,980
So 1 plus 4 is five.

119
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,250
4 plus 6 is 10.

120
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,810
6 plus 4 is 10.

121
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,910
4 plus 1 is 5.

122
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,620
Bring down the 1.

123
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,240
So these are the coefficients
for the expansion of a

124
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,910
plus b to the fifth power.

125
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,360
And so this is a reasonably
fast way of doing it, although

126
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,040
it can get-- one, it will
take a lot of space.

127
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,270
And it can work reasonably
well, you know, for up to a

128
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,030
power of eight or nine or ten.

129
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,490
Even then it starts to get
pretty big and cumbersome.

130
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,080
But you know, for powers
up to seven or eight or

131
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,450
nine, you could do this.

132
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,400
You could draw it out really
fast and do this, and it's

133
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,950
probably faster than actually
computing each of the

134
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,830
binomial coefficients.

135
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,590
Although you might be pretty
fast at computing n choose k,

136
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,580
in which you don't
have to do this.

137
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,230
So with that out of the way,
let me show you an even faster

138
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,200
way of doing it, short
of memorizing it.

139
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,810
And this will allow you to
really calculate a plus b

140
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,200
to the nth-- you know, to
the twentieth power--

141
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,030
almost in your head.

142
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,610
Depending on how good you are
at arithmetic in your head.

143
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,850
So here is the trick.

144
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,800
And I encourage you to
experiment for why it

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,720
works, but it does work.

146
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,580
And I mean it's
not even a trick.

147
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,340
It's just-- and this Pascal's
triangle isn't even a trick.

148
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,960
Pascal's triangle is just an
alternative way to generate

149
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,480
binomial coefficients, and what
I'm about to show you is just

150
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,380
another way of essentially
generating the binomial

151
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:03,960
coefficients.

152
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,301
Although it's probably a
faster way to compute them.

153
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,450
   

154
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,690
And it's a good project for you
to think about why this works.

155
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,010
So I'm just going to start
with a very concrete example.

156
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,020
Instead of a plus b, let
me just do x plus y.

157
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,320
Just because you might
see the binomial theorem

158
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,140
written that way.

159
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,160
So let's say x plus y
to the tenth power.

160
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,100
This would take me all
day if I was to actually

161
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,150
multiply it out.

162
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,570
It would take me probably 20
to 30 minutes, without

163
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,720
making careless mistakes, to
actually figure out all the

164
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,680
binomial coefficients.

165
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,670
Maybe not that long, but
it would take me a while.

166
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,130
And to draw Pascal's triangle
would fill up a whole page,

167
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,570
and I'd still probably
make a careless mistake.

168
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,990
So how can I do this?

169
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,700
So what you do is-- so
one thing you know.

170
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,260
This is going to have
11 terms, right?

171
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,160
Because you're going to
start with x to the

172
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,435
tenth, y to the zero.

173
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,230
And you're going to go all
the way to y to the tenth.

174
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,602
So if you start at 0 and you
go to 10, that's 11 terms.

175
00:08:02,602 --> 00:08:03,790
So it has 11 terms.

176
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,340
What I want you to do
is just write down the

177
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,700
first, just the numbers.

178
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,210
You know, you can almost
count the terms.

179
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,820
You don't have to go all the
way to 11, and I'll show you.

180
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,830
But actually, let's write
all the way to 11.

181
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:26,010
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

182
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,780
Just squeezed it in.

183
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,250
And you'll see, you don't
actually have to go

184
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,770
all the way to 11.

185
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,680
You could probably
just stop at 6.

186
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,450
So here's the trick.

187
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,430
We know that the first
term is going to be x

188
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,350
to the tenth, right?

189
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,100
We know that x to the tenth.

190
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,310
Actually, we know that it's
going to be x to the tenth.

191
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,320
The second term is going
to be x to the ninth.

192
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,680
Then it's going to
be x to the eighth.

193
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,510
It's going to be x
to the seventh.

194
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,630
A little tedious.
x to the sixth.

195
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,080
x to the fifth.

196
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,735
x to the fourth.

197
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,400
x to the third.

198
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,790
x squared.

199
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,750
x.

200
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,060
And then there's going to be
x to the zero, or just one.

201
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,970
Let me just do the y's.

202
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,410
So this was x to the tenth.

203
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,400
That's not bright
enough, this color.

204
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,080
So this is y to the zero.

205
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,910
So we don't have to
write it there.

206
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,230
But then we have a y.

207
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,770
y to the first.

208
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,650
y squared.

209
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,370
y to the third.

210
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,120
y to the fourth.

211
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,320
y to the fifth.

212
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,470
Which makes sense, this
is the middle term.

213
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,750
y to the sixth.

214
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,830
y to the seventh.

215
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,750
y to the eighth.

216
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,860
y to the ninth.

217
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,300
I don't want you to get
confused, each of these

218
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,120
is a separate term.

219
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,890
I don't want you to think
I'm multiplying them all.

220
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:43,420
   

221
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,010
And then, we just have to
figure out the coefficients

222
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,820
on each of these terms.

223
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,500
Those are divider lines
I attempted to draw.

224
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,350
I wasn't trying to
confuse you more.

225
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,970
I just wanted to-- because they
seemed to be running together,

226
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,770
each of the terms
that I'm writing.

227
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,130
But I think you know
what I'm doing.

228
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,570
So now we have to figure
out the coefficients.

229
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,100
And then this is the neat part.

230
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,250
So we know that the coefficient
on the first term-- let me draw

231
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,370
a dividing line here and here--
the coefficient on the first

232
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,710
term is always 1, right?

233
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,570
So, the coefficient is 1.

234
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,110
So the coefficient on the
second term is going to be the

235
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,750
exponent on the first term
times its coefficient-- so 10

236
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,670
times 1-- divided by
the term that it is.

237
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,510
So it's going to be 10
times 1, divided by 1.

238
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,900
So it's going to be 10.

239
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,720
The third term's coefficient
is going to be the

240
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,180
exponent on the x, right?

241
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,980
So it's 9 times its
coefficient-- which is 10-- so

242
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,040
it's going to be 9 times 10--
divided by the term it is.

243
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,510
So it's going to be 9 times its
coefficient, 10, divided by 2.

244
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,480
So what's 9 times 10?

245
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,440
That's forty-- it's 90
divided by 2 which is 45.

246
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,640
And you keep going.

247
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,700
The fourth term is going to be
the third term's exponent-- so

248
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,140
it's going to be 8 times-- let
me write this down in a

249
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:06,840
different color-- it's going to
be 8 times its coefficient,

250
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,140
times 45 divided by
which term it is.

251
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,050
So it's the third term.

252
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,610
Divided by 3.

253
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,740
Well, that's just 8 times 15.

254
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,060
And we'll see,
that's 80 plus 40.

255
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,920
So that's equal to 120.

256
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,730
So that is the fourth term.

257
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,745
And so then let me just
draw these dividers.

258
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:27,630
I know it's getting a
little complicated.

259
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,310
And I'm writing it all out like
this, but if you practice

260
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,510
this enough, you can actually
just write it straight out.

261
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,060
And so the fifth term.

262
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,230
What is the fifth term?

263
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,910
Well, you take the
exponent on the x.

264
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,670
So 7 times the fourth
term's coefficient--

265
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,960
times 120-- divided by 4.

266
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,220
Right?

267
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,040
Divided by the
previous term, by 4.

268
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,950
Well, that's just 7 times
30, which equals 210.

269
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,900
That's the fifth coefficient.

270
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,010
What's the sixth coefficient?

271
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:06,280
Well, it's 6 times-- you
know the exponent on

272
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,160
the x-- times 210.

273
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,780
Times its coefficient-- times
the fifth term's coefficient--

274
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,830
divided by 5, for
the fifth term.

275
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,780
Well, 5 goes into
210 how many times?

276
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,100
42 times, right?

277
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,020
So it's 6 times 42--
that's 240 plus 12.

278
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,250
That's 252.

279
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,590
And then once you're at the
middle point-- the sixth term

280
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,220
is the middle term-- you'll
see that, you know, you start

281
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,130
going back the other way.

282
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,360
And we learned one from the
Pascal's triangle, or even the

283
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,240
definition of the binomial
theorem, that the

284
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,450
coefficients are symmetric.

285
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,830
So we know that the next one is
going to be the same-- this was

286
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,040
the middle one, right?-- so we
know the next one is

287
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,340
going to be 210.

288
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,620
And you could calculate it
using the same system.

289
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,020
This is just a quick
way of doing it.

290
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,680
This one's going to be 120.

291
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,800
This one's going to be 45.

292
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,880
And this one is going to be
the tenth coefficient--

293
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,860
this is going to be 10.

294
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,640
And then of course the last
coefficient is just 1.

295
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,210
1y to the tenth power.

296
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:15,510
So if I were to write this out,
the answer is-- and if you

297
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,870
practice this, you'll find that
you can do quite fast-- it's x

298
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:35,280
to the tenth, plus 10x to the
ninth y, plus 45x to the eighth

299
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:43,500
y squared, plus 120x to the
seventh y to the third, plus

300
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,910
210x to the sixth y to the
fourth, plus 252-- already at

301
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:56,520
the middle term-- x to the
fifth y to the fifth, plus 210x

302
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,460
to the fourth y to the sixth--
I'm running out of space.

303
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,070
But you can you can hopefully
extrapolate what I'm doing,

304
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,100
and it makes sense to you.

305
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,620
And hopefully you have an
appreciation that if you

306
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,346
actually had to multiply out x
plus y to the tenth, it would

307
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:09,960
have taken you all day.

308
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,213
Maybe I'll do one more video
with a smaller example to show

309
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:15,620
you that it's a little less
complicated when you do, say,

310
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,260
x plus y to the sixth power.

311
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,762
