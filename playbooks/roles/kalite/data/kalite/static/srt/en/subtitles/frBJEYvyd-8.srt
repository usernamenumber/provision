1
00:00:00,287 --> 00:00:04,359
We're told to plot these values on a number line.

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:06,372
And you see every one of these values

3
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:08,321
have an absolute value sign.

4
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:10,419
So let's take a little bit of a review of

5
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:12,959
what absolute value even is.

6
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:18,344
Absolute value

7
00:00:18,344 --> 00:00:19,796
The way I think about it,

8
00:00:19,796 --> 00:00:21,220
there's two ways to think about it.

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,503
The first way to think about it is,

10
00:00:22,503 --> 00:00:25,644
how far is something from 0?

11
00:00:25,644 --> 00:00:29,687
So let me plot this negative 3 here.

12
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:30,669
So let me do a number line.

13
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:32,305
This isn't the number line for our actual answer,

14
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:35,518
or to this command, plot these values on a number line.

15
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:38,288
I'm just first going to plot the numbers

16
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,755
inside the absolute value sign,

17
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:41,391
and then we're going to take the absolute value

18
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:42,486
and plot those,

19
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:44,520
just like they're asking us to do.

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,533
So on this number line, if this is 0,

21
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:48,541
if we go to the negative

22
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,886
we're going to go to the left of 0.

23
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:56,287
So this is negative 1, negative2, negative 3.

24
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:58,270
Negative 3 sits right over there,

25
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,679
so this is negative 3 right there.

26
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,892
The absolute value of negative 3 is essentially saying

27
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:07,637
how far are you away from 0?

28
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:11,119
How far is negative 3 from 0?

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,937
And you say, well, it's 1, 2, 3 away from 0.

30
00:01:15,937 --> 00:01:19,436
So you'd say that the absolute value of negative 3 is

31
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:22,970
equal to positive 3.

32
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,436
Now that's really the conceptual way to imagine absolute value.

33
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:31,436
How far are you away from 0?

34
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:34,103
But the easy way to calculate absolute value signs,

35
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:37,237
if you don't care too much about the concept is

36
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:38,686
whether it's negative or positive,

37
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:39,887
the absolute value of it is

38
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:41,336
always going to be positive.

39
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:44,020
Absolute value of negative 3 is positive 3.

40
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,269
Absolute value of positive 3 is still positive 3.

41
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:48,264
So you're always going to get

42
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:50,938
the positive version of the number, so to speak.

43
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:52,121
But conceptually,

44
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:55,436
you're just saying how far away are you from 0.

45
00:01:55,436 --> 00:01:57,153
So let's do what they asked.

46
00:01:57,153 --> 00:02:00,903
So that first value, on this number line,

47
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:02,309
so all of these are absolute values.

48
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:03,859
So they're all going to be positive values.

49
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,339
So they're all going to be greater than 0.

50
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:11,605
So let me draw my number line like this.

51
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:13,402
I can do a straighter number line than that.

52
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:15,512
Let's see. Well, that's a little bit straighter.

53
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:17,453
And let's say, if this is 0,

54
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:18,970
this would be negative 1,

55
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:25,703
then you'd have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

56
00:02:25,703 --> 00:02:27,069
I think that'll do the trick.

57
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:29,392
So this first quantity here,

58
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:30,620
I'll do it in orange,

59
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,124
the absolute value of negative 3,

60
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:35,330
we just figured out, that is positive 3.

61
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,169
So I'll plot it right over there, positive 3.

62
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:40,538
Then this next value,

63
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:44,020
right here, the absolute value of 7.

64
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,937
If we look over here,

65
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:48,204
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

66
00:02:48,204 --> 00:02:50,836
7 is how far away from 0?

67
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:53,700
It is 7 away from 0.

68
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,953
So the absolute value of 7 is equal to 7.

69
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:00,353
So you already see the pattern there.

70
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:02,040
If it's negative, it just becomes positive.

71
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,166
If it's already positive, it just equals itself.

72
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,669
So plotting this value,

73
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:10,787
I'll just place it right over there.

74
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:13,194
So the absolute value of 7 is 7.

75
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:18,678
Absolute value of negative 3 is positive 3.

76
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,437
Let me mark out the 0 a little bit better,

77
00:03:20,437 --> 00:03:22,507
so you see relative to 0.

78
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:29,836
Now we have the absolute value of 8 minus 12.

79
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:31,470
Well, first of all,

80
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,994
let's figure out what 8 minus 12 is.

81
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:35,969
So if you take 12 away from 8,

82
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:37,357
you're at negative 4.

83
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:38,819
12 less than 8 is negative 4.

84
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,904
And you can do that on a number line,

85
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:45,768
if you don't quite remember how to do this.

86
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,604
But if you, you know

87
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:49,421
if you take 8 away from 8,

88
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,815
you're at 0, and then you take another one,

89
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:51,571
you're at negative 1,

90
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:55,487
then negative 2, negative 3, all the way to negative 4.

91
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:59,407
So this is equal to the absolute value of negative 4.

92
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:04,305
If we just plot negative 4, we go 1, 2, 3,

93
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:06,971
negative 4 is right over there.

94
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,995
But if we're taking its absolute value,

95
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:12,036
we're saying, how far is negative 4 from 0?

96
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:14,004
Well it's 4 away from 0.

97
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:19,059
1, 2, 3, 4. So this is equal to positive 4.

98
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,760
So we'll plot it right here.

99
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,929
This number line is

100
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,369
the answer to this command up here.

101
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:28,820
So the absolute value of 8 minus 12,

102
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,203
which is negative 4, is positive 4.

103
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:37,930
Then we have the absolute value of 0.

104
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,823
So how far is 0 from 0?

105
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,019
Well, it's 0 away from 0.

106
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,327
The absolute value of 0 is 0,

107
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:49,205
so you can just plot it right over there.

108
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,125
And we have one left.

109
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,422
Let me pick a suitable color here.

110
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:59,914
The absolute value of 7 minus 2.

111
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:01,795
Well, 7 minus 2 is 5,

112
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:02,821
so this is the same thing as

113
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:04,687
the absolute value of 5.

114
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:07,120
How far is 5 away from 0?

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,081
Well, it's just 5 away.

116
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:10,510
It's almost, you know, too easy.

117
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,748
That's what makes it confusing.

118
00:05:11,748 --> 00:05:15,739
If I were to plot 5, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

119
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:18,954
It is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 spaces from 0.

120
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:21,424
So the absolute value of 5 is 5.

121
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:24,704
So you plot it just like that.

122
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:25,720
So conceptually,

123
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,503
it's how far you are away from 0.

124
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:28,519
But if you think about it

125
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,921
in kind of just very simple terms,

126
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:31,907
if it's a negative number,

127
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:33,292
it becomes a positive version of it.

128
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,618
If it's a positive number already,

129
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:35,780
it just equals itself,

130
00:05:35,780 --> 99:59:59,999
when you take the absolute value.
