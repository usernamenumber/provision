1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Let's continue with the GMAT problems

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,300
We're on problem 16 on page 279

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,870
Problem 16

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,610
Is x greater than 1.8?

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,120
That's all they're asking us

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,640
And statement one says, x is greater than 1.7

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,670
Well that doesn't help us because --I don't know

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,720
x could be 1.71, in which case this wouldn't be true

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,600
Or x could be a million, in which case this is true

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,970
So this isn't really that helpful

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,530
We immediately see that

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,070
Statement two says that x is greater than 1.9

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,530
Well, if you're greater than 1.9

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,960
you're definitely greater than 1.8

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,770
So this is all we need, statement number two

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,210
So b

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,450
Problem 17

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:57,190
If n is an integer, is n plus 1 odd?

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,320
Well if n plus 1 is odd, that's the same thing as asking

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,560
is n even?

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,940
And I haven't looked at the statements yet

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,080
but that's just something

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,460
your brain might automatically connect

24
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,630
And let's see

25
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,250
What do they tell us?

26
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:16,140
Statement one tells us that n plus 2 is even

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,350
Well if n plus 2 is even, then n is definitely even

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,820
If you don't believe me, think about the number 4

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,860
4 is even, and 4 plus 2 is 6, which is still even, Right?

30
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,520
Because if you add 1, you're going to go from even to odd

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,830
You add 2, you go back to even, right?

32
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,060
So this is all we need

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,620
If n plus 2 is even, then we know that n is even

34
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,410
and n plus 1 is odd

35
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,380
And you could try it out with numbers if you don't believe me

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,580
Two

37
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,470
What is statement two?

38
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,830
n minus 1 is odd

39
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,950
Well this is the same thing. n minus 1 is odd

40
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,710
Once again this tells us that n has to be an even number

41
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,090
If you subtract 1 from it and you get an odd number

42
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,970
then it has to be even

43
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,590
If you say that n is 4, 4 minus 1 is 3

44
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,900
And try it for any even number

45
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,630
I don't want to over-explain with a fairly simple problem

46
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,770
So anyway, the answer is either of them alone are

47
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,280
sufficient, D

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,490
And try it out with numbers if you don't believe me

49
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:23,850
Problem 18

50
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,020
Is x between 1 and 2?

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,360
Is essentially what they're saying

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,500
It can't be 1 or 2, because these aren't equal signs

53
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,950
they're less than signs

54
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,600
OK

55
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,530
So that's what they're asking

56
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,550
Statement one tells us that x is essentially greater than 0

57
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,520
They wrote it a little different, they said 0 is less than x

58
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,400
So x is greater than 0

59
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,690
That doesn't help us. x could still be 0.1

60
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,840
It could be still be 1/2

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,280
So that doesn't tell us where it is in this range

62
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,980
It could also be 100, in which case it's out of this range

63
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,380
Statement two tells us that x is less than 3

64
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,840
So this alone doesn't help us

65
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,250
x could still be 2.1

66
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,820
Or x could still be minus a million

67
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,770
This doesn't help us

68
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,990
And even if we took them together

69
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,940
that would just tell us that 0 is less than x

70
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,390
which is less than 3

71
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,640
Which is a superset of this, right?

72
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,620
If we know that x is in this range

73
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,420
it doesn't tell us that x is definitely in this range

74
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,460
For example, if we know this is true

75
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,480
x could still be equal to 1/2

76
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,660
But 1/2 isn't in this range

77
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,480
x could be equal to 1.5, which is in the range

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,580
Or x could be equal to 2.5, which isn't in the range

79
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,700
So both of these, even taken together, are not sufficient

80
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,370
So the answer is e

81
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,130
Problem 19

82
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,240
These are going fast. Maybe too fast

83
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,510
Let me know if I'm going too fast

84
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:50,950
OK

85
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,100
Water is pumped into a partially filled tank

86
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,000
at a constant rate through an inlet pipe

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,490
At the same time, water is pumped out of the tank at a

88
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,000
constant rate through an outlet pipe

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,040
OK

90
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,230
So essentially we have a tank

91
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,620
There's a pipe here

92
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,260
So water is going in at, x-- we could say, I don't know--

93
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,920
meters cubed per second or-- units shouldn't matter

94
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,250
And it's getting pumped out at y meters cubed per second

95
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,430
At what rate in gallons per minute--

96
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,510
OK, so these aren't meters cubed per second

97
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,440
these are gallons per minute--

98
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,200
at what rate in gallons per minute is the amount of water

99
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,080
in the tank increasing?

100
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,140
So in order for the water to be increasing

101
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,730
more has to be coming in than going out

102
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,830
And the rate of it is going to be the difference

103
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,120
So essentially they just want to know

104
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,930
what x minus y gallons per minute are

105
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,060
If x is less than y, and we get a negative number here

106
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,120
then actually we have more coming out than going in

107
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,760
And so the water isn't increasing

108
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,520
So anyway, they tell us that, one

109
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,350
the amount of water initially in the tank is 200 gallons

110
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,800
That's useless

111
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,130
Why is that useless?

112
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,160
Because it just tells us how much water is in the tank

113
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,190
It doesn't tell us anything about the rates going in or out

114
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,990
So that's useless

115
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,290
Two

116
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,390
Water is pumped into the tank at a rate of

117
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,410
10 gallons per minute

118
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,260
So x is equal to 10 gallons per minute

119
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,240
That's the rate you're pumping into it

120
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,680
And out of the tank at a rate of 10

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,320
gallons every 2 1/2 minutes

122
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:43,020
So y is equal to 10 gallons per 2.5 minutes

123
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,380
Which is equal to what?

124
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,260
That's 4 gallons per minute

125
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,180
So that second statement

126
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,170
that second part of statement two

127
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,970
is a little bit shady, but you get a y

128
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,300
It's 4 gallons per minute

129
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,280
So you actually don't have to figure it

130
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,400
But if you wanted to, you could say that the rate at

131
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,950
which water is increasing is--

132
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,110
the rate at which it's coming in at 10

133
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,570
minus the rate it's going out

134
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,500
So 6 gallons per minute is actually the answer to the question

135
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,430
But all you have to know is that

136
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,390
you just needed statement two

137
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,160
which gives us this information to figure it out

138
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,260
And statement one was useless

139
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:22,520
So that's b, statement two alone is sufficient

140
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,960
Let's do another one

141
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,130
OK

142
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,960
So we have problem number 20

143
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,910
Is x negative?

144
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,310
OK

145
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:47,140
The first statement,they tell us that 9x is greater than 10x

146
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,970
So this is an interesting situation

147
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,700
So let's try to solve this equation

148
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,710
Let's subtract 10x from both sides of this equation

149
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,790
And if you're adding or subtracting on both sides of

150
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,920
an equation or inequality

151
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,520
the inequality stays the same

152
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,510
So let's subtract 10x from both sides of this

153
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:13,590
So you get 9x minus 10x is greater than 10x minus 10x

154
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:18,310
And then you get minus x is greater than 0

155
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,120
Or you can multiply both sides by negative 1

156
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,280
And when you multiply or divide by a negative number

157
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,760
with an inequality, you switch the inequality

158
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,250
x is less than 0, so we know that x is definitely negative

159
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,300
The other way you could have done it

160
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,710
you could have subtracted 9x from both sides

161
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,170
and you would have gotten 0 is greater than x

162
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,250
Which is a faster way of doing it

163
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,870
But either way, statement one lets us know that

164
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,250
x is definitely negative

165
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,060
Let's see what statement two does for us

166
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,240
Statement two

167
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,730
x plus 3 is positive

168
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,280
Well I mean, x could be 100

169
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,490
If x is 100, then 103 is definitely positive

170
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,740
Or x could be negative 1, right?

171
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,740
Because negative 1 plus 3 is positive 2

172
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,940
So this doesn't tell us any information about

173
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,050
whether x is negative

174
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,310
So this is useless

175
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,460
So the answer is a

176
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,380
Statement one alone is sufficient

177
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,120
Statement two alone is useless

178
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,600
Let's see how much time I have. I'm doing well on time

179
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,640
I'm on problem 21

180
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:36,560
Does 2m minus 3n equal 0?

181
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,540
And let's just think about this

182
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,260
That's the same thing as asking, does 2m equal 3n?

183
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,110
If you just add 3n into both sides

184
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,250
these are equivalent questions

185
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,320
If you can answer one, you can answer the other

186
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:58,790
So statement one says, m does not equal 0

187
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,120
Well that seems fairly useless to me

188
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,760
I mean, m does not equal 0, so m is still--

189
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,640
I could pick a random m, not equal to 0

190
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,840
and depending on what n is

191
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,660
this may or may not be true

192
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,060
So far that seems kind of useless for me

193
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,270
but maybe it's useful in conjunction with two

194
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,180
The next thing they say, 6m is equal to 9n

195
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,820
This one's interesting

196
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:30,410
So what does this tell us?

197
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,420
So 6m is equal to 9n

198
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:41,110
So let's divide both sides by 3

199
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,800
We get 2m is equal to 3n

200
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,010
And then we can subtract 3n from both sides

201
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,450
And you get 2m minus 3n is equal to 0

202
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,960
So statement two--

203
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,090
I mean, you essentially just do a little bit of algebra

204
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,780
and you get what we're trying to prove

205
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,900
So statement two is good

206
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,310
Statement one, do we need it at all?

207
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,810
Well no, because-- I mean, that is one solution

208
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,450
that if m and n are both equal to 0, that this thing is true

209
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,450
But it doesn't really do as much in the way of anything else

210
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,370
And we don't need it, to come up with this

211
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,910
So the answer is b

212
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,750
Statement two alone is sufficient

213
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,830
I'm already past 10 minutes

214
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,640
So that's it

215
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
I'll do 22 in the next video

216
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,000
See you soon
