1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:03,733
In this video we are hopefully going to understand why the

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:11,733
complex form of the - why the <i>exponential</i> form of a complex number is actually useful.

3
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,267
So lets say we wanted to find- so lets say we want to solve the

4
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:18,933
equation x to the third power is equal to 1.

5
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:25,133
So we want to find all of the real and/or complex roots of this equation right over here,

6
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:28,667
this is the same thing as x to the third minus one is equal to zero.

7
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:31,733
So we are looking for all of the real and complex roots of this.

8
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:35,733
And there are ways to do this without exponential form of a complex number,

9
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:39,667
but what the- the technique we are gonna see in this video can be applied if

10
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:43,133
this is x to the fifth minus one or x to the thirteenth minus one,

11
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:46,933
and its also gonna show us kind of the- the patterns that emerge

12
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:50,000
when you start looking at things on an argand diagram.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,133
So to do this, lets think about, lets think about the exponential representation of 1.

14
00:00:56,133 --> 00:01:00,400
So lets just say z is equal to 1. 1 is a complex number it is a real number,

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,067
a real numb-, all real numbers are also complex numbers, they are a subset.

16
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:08,067
They're, they are in the complex plane, they just dont have an imaginary,

17
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,426
They just don't have an imaginary part.

18
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:16,600
So lets draw this on an argand diagram, so that's my real axis,

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:24,800
this is my imaginary axis, this is my imaginary axis, and so, this is

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,133
the real, this the imaginary, and if I wanted to represent z equals 1,

21
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:34,667
it only has a real part. So let me just draw 1 all around:

22
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:44,733
-1, -1, z, z looks like this: z would look like, z would look like that.

23
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:48,533
A position vector that just goes to 1,0. One way to view it:

24
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:54,467
This is the same thing as equal to 1 plus, 1 plus zero i.

25
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:59,133
Now, lets put this in exponential form. Well its magnitude is

26
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:04,333
pretty straightforward, the magnitude of z is just the length of this vector,

27
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,000
or its the absolute value of 1, and well, that's- that's just going to be,

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,733
that's just going to be 1. Now whats the argument? Whats the argument of z?

29
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:19,867
Whats the angle that this vector makes,with the positive real axis?

30
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,667
Whats on the positive real axis? Its a real number.

31
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:27,467
So it has no angle. So its the arg of z is 0.

32
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:32,000
So that might not be to interesting so far, we just wrote, we just figured out that

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,667
1 could be equal to, 1 is equal to 1 times e to the 0i.

34
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:43,867
0i. And this is kind of obvious. e to the 0, this is just going

35
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:48,133
to be 0, 0 times i is 0, e to the 0 is just going to be 1 times 1 is equal to 1.

36
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:52,733
Not a big deal there. But what IS neat, is that this argument,

37
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:56,467
you could view it as 0 radians, or you could go all the way around

38
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,067
and add 2pi to it and get to the same point.

39
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:03,467
You can go all the way around, and add 2pi and get to the same point.

40
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:08,733
So the argument of our complex number, or the number 1, really,

41
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:14,667
could also be an angle of 2pi, or an angle of 4pi, or an angle of 6pi,

42
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:18,933
or angle of 8pi, so we can write 1, we can write 1 as-

43
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,600
we could also write it as 1 times e, I won't write the 1 anymore,

44
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:31,000
1 times e, to the 2pi i, or 1 times e to the 4- to the 4pi i.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And the reason why this is interesting, is in this equation,

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,533
this equation right here can be written in multiple ways.

47
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:41,600
It can be written as x to the third is equal to 1.

48
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,133
x to the third is equal to 1. It could be written as

49
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:50,267
x to the third is equal to e to the 2pi i, e to the 2pi i.

50
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:55,333
Or, it could be written as x to the third is equal to e to the 4pi i.

51
00:03:55,333 --> 00:04:00,641
e to the 4pi i. And this is interesting, we are gonna see this in a second,

52
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:05,733
lets take both sides of all these equations to the 1/3 power to solve for x.

53
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:09,600
So to the 1/3 , we are gonna take that to the 1/3, we are

54
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,800
gonna do that same thing over here, we are just taking

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,667
everything to the 1/3 power, to solve for the x's in each

56
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,667
of these equations.

57
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:20,400
To the 1/3 power. So this first equation over here becomes

58
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,067
x is equal to 1 to the 1/3 power, which is just equal to 1.

59
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,933
Now whats this second equation become? This second

60
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:32,667
equation, x is equal to e to the- well this is just going to be

61
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:41,933
the 2pi over 3i power. e to the 2pi over 3i power.

62
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:46,667
And then this equation over here is going to be, so x is going to be equal to,

63
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,667
obviously the 3 to the 1/3, that just becomes x to the 1,

64
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:54,533
x is going to be- let me do that same blue- x over here

65
00:04:54,533 --> 00:05:03,067
is going to be equal to e to the 4 pi over 3. The 4pi over 3i.

66
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:07,333
So lets think about- lets think about this for a little bit.

67
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:11,667
What is this- so we could- so immediately, whats the argument here?

68
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:15,333
So let me- let me write- let me- these are 3 different roots

69
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:19,267
let me call them x sub 1, x sub 2, and x sub 3.

70
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:22,933
So these are three different numbers. One of the roots is 1,

71
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:26,600
that's pretty clear over here. 1 is one of the cubed roots of

72
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,467
itself, but these are other numbers, and these are going

73
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:33,600
to be complex numbers. So lets- lets visualize these numbers a little bit.

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,533
So what is the argument? So for all of these- so the magnitude of

75
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:42,600
x sub 2- the magnitude of x sub 2 is still clearly 1.

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,462
Its the coefficient out in front of the e, its clearly 1.

77
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:49,067
The magnitude of x sub 3 - we're gonna do that same color-

78
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:53,600
the magnitude of x sub 3 is also clearly going to be 1.

79
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,133
But what is the argument of x sub 2? What is Ï†?

80
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:01,733
What is the argument? Well its 2pi over 3.

81
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:06,600
Its 2pi over 3. So how we draw, how would we draw x sub 2?

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,000
So the angle is 2pi over 3- I always, its easier for me to

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
visualize in degrees- so 2pi is 360 degrees, 360 degrees

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,933
divided by 3 is 120 degrees. So this is going to be 120 degrees

85
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:25,333
is sixty short of- so its going to look like this.

86
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,733
It is going to look like this.

87
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:32,333
Just like this. This is- so this angle right here, its argument is going to be

88
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:37,400
100, 120 degrees which is the same thing as 2pi,

89
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,267
as 2pi over 3, and its going to have the exact same length.

90
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,400
So let me do this in the same color.

91
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,400
So this is x sub 1, so that is this green color right over here.

92
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,200
x sub 2 is this magenta one, right over here, and they

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,400
all have the same magnitude, so we really just rotated-

94
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,333
we rotated 120 degrees. And what about x sub 3?

95
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,333
Whats its argument?

96
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,133
Whats x sub 3's argument?

97
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:04,800
Its argument is 4pi, 4pi over 3.

98
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,267
That's the same thing as 720 degrees over 3, if we were

99
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,933
to put it into degrees, and so

100
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:15,800
3 goes into 720, 3 goes into 720,

101
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,600
3 goes into 720- what is it?

102
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,333
240? 720...is uh 240. Right, I should have known that.

103
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,400
So 240 degrees, we are gonna go 180 degrees, and then

104
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,267
go another 60 degrees. So its going to be right over here.

105
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:34,733
Its going to be right over here.

106
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:37,733
So let me draw it like this:

107
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:40,000
its going to right, over here.

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,067
So this is going to be, that angle right over there is

109
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:49,400
4pi over 3 radians. 4pi over 3 radians, which is equal to-

110
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,133
which is equal to 240 degrees. And once again, it has the

111
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,733
same magnitude.

112
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,267
So what we just saw is, that when I take the cubed roots

113
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:01,733
of this real number, I'm essentially taking the entire

114
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:06,600
- I guess we could call it the entire circle, or the entire 360 degrees,

115
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,400
or the entire 2pi radians- and I'm dividing it into,

116
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,000
into angle- into 3 essentially.

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,400
This is 1/3, then we have another 120 degrees,

118
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,733
and then we have another 120 degrees.

119
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:20,733
And so you kind of see the pattern of where all of the roots are.

120
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,333
And in case you are still not satisfied-

121
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,000
you're just like, "well, you know that you said you would find complex roots or

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,800
Yeah, you know, I- I'm not used to this, or this is actually

123
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,067
being complex numbers. I want- I actually want it to be in the form a+bi."

124
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,467
We can easilly figure this out from this over here.

125
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:43,200
So x sub 2, x sub 2 is going to be equal to- its going to be equal to

126
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:52,733
the cosine, the cos(2pi/3) + i*sin(2pi/3).

127
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:57,600
Sine of 2pi over 3. And if you look at this over here,

128
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,467
we can figure out what those things are going to be.

129
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:01,533
This is the angle right over here.

130
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:04,933
If this angle right over here is 60 degrees, which it is

131
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:08,467
because this up here is 30 degrees, and this- the hypotenuse

132
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,333
or the length is 1, then this over here is the

133
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,467
square root of 3/2 and then this distance right over here

134
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:19,800
is -1/2. So x sub 2 is going to be equal to,

135
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,067
is going to be equal to,

136
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:27,733
cos(2pi/3) is -1/2. Did I do that right?

137
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:34,067
Yep, -1/2 + i*sin(2pi/3), thats this height over here

138
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:37,800
which is square root of 3/2i.

139
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,733
So thats x sub 2, and we can do the exact same thing

140
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:44,267
with x sub 3. x sub 3 is going to be equal to

141
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:48,200
its x value, or I should say its real value is going to be

142
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,800
the exact same thing, its going to be -1/2.

143
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,400
And then it's y, its, um, its imaginary value,

144
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,067
so this angle right over here, is also- its just from the

145
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:02,667
negative real axis down to the real vector is going to be

146
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:05,867
negative 60 degrees, so this height right over here is going to be

147
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:13,133
negative square root 3/2. So its -1/2 minus the square root of 3/2i.

148
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:18,267
So using this technique, we were able to find the three roots,

149
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:20,933
the three complex roots of 1.

150
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,400
This is one of them.

151
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,333
This is another one.

152
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,867
and of course 1 is one of them as well.

153
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:28,733
Where did we do that?

154
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,333
1 is one of them as well.

155
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,400
And you can use this exact same technique if you were finding the

156
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,467
4th root, we would take the 300- or 2pi radians, 360 degrees,

157
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:39,133
and divide it into 4, and so it would actually be this:

158
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:43,000
it would be i, it would be -1, and it would be -i.

159
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,267
And we know, if you take i to the 4th, you get 1,

160
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:48,600
if you take -i to the 4th, you get 1,

161
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,133
and if you take -1 to the 4th you get 1,

162
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,733
And if you take 1 to the 4th you get 1.

163
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:53,933
So you could do this- you could find

164
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,000
the 8th roots of 1 using this technique.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,933
Now the other question that might be popping into your mi-

166
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:02,333
brain is why did I stop at e to the 4pi i?

167
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,467
Why didn't I go on, why didn't I go on and say, well

168
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:08,467
is equal to e to the 6pi i, and look for another root?

169
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,333
And so if I did that, if I did that, if I said x to the 3rd, lets say

170
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,133
I wanted to find a 4th root here maybe, x to the 3rd is

171
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,667
equal to e to the 6pi i.

172
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:21,733
And I take both sides of this equation to the 1/3 power.

173
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:22,933
So I would get x is equal to-

174
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,733
taking this to the 1/3, I would get e to the 2pi,

175
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,400
I would get e to the 2pi i.

176
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,267
Well whats e to the 2pi i?

177
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:33,067
e to the 2pi i would just get us back to 1.

178
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,933
So when I added 2pi again it just gets us

179
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:36,667
back to this root again.

180
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:40,000
And if I- if I took e to the 6pi- if I took e to the 8pi

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
I would get this root again. So you're gonna get

182
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,467
only three roots, if you're- if you're taking- if you're taking-

183
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:49,600
well if- if you're- if you're finding the third root of something.

184
00:11:49,600 --> 99:59:59,999
Anything beyond that it just becomes redundant.
