1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say there is a country made up only of this

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
island and it's sitting in the middle of this

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lake. And on that island, there is only this one dude here,

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he has one house and some land on which crops

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can be grown, but he wants to think more formally

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
about his economy. He's starts setting up some

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
institutions that start to resemble what we would see in

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
more complex economies. So, what he decides to

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
do is--he's decides to set up a firm.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me put the firm right over here...

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He decides to create a legal entity called

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some firm over here--some corporation--and he's

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sitting here--he's the household of exactly one person.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is him as a household, and he decides to

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
give multiple factors of production to the firm.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, he essentially rents out his building, so he

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
gets capital, he rents out the land to the firm.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He's giving land, and he works for the firm, so he

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is giving labor. He is the owner of the firm

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and he was the guy who thought of this

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
entrepreneurial activity, so he is giving this

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
factor of production, but throws in there

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some entrepreneurship.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And in return, the firm will essentially pay rent

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for these factors of production. So the firm will

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pay him money in exchange for being allowed to

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
use all of these things. So, for the rent on the

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
capital--the building itself--let's say that this

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in a given year, the firm (which he owns) is going to pay him $1,000 per year.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is the building rent--the building lease--is $1,000.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For the land rent, he's also going to get paid another

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
$1,000 per year and then for his wages--essentially the rent on his labor--he's renting his energy and his time,
