1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,220
Let's do a couple more
rotational volume problems, and

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,710
I'm going to make these a
little bit more difficult.

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,290
And hopefully after these if
you've understood everything

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,370
we've done up to now and the
ones I'm about to do, I think

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,300
you're pretty set for most
of what you should face

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,220
in most math classes.

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,460
And definitely I think you'll
be set for the AP exam,

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,690
and either ab or bc
on this concept.

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,050
So let's do another example.

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,990
OK.

12
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,510
So let's say that I want
to-- actually, let me

13
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,005
do something different.

14
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,780
Let me draw here.

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,480
So that's my y-axis.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,260
This is my x-axis.

17
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,100
Now let me draw the function
y is equal to x squared.

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,560
   

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,370
And we know that that could be
written as y is equal to x

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,570
squared, or we could write that
as x is equal to square root of

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,540
y, depending on what we want
to be a function of what.

22
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,150
   

23
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,530
This is the y-axis.

24
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,570
This is the x-axis.

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:12,950
Let's say I also have
the line y equals 2.

26
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,270
Goes over what I just wrote.

27
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,640
y equals 2.

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,170
Now this problem is going to
be slightly different then

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,310
what we've done so far.

30
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,570
I'm going to take a rotation,
but instead of taking a

31
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,370
rotation around the y or the
x-axis, I'm going to take a

32
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,610
rotation around another line.

33
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:40,330
So let's say I want to
take a rotation between

34
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,510
x is equal to 0.

35
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,680
   

36
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,130
Actually let me do
something arbitrary.

37
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,370
Let me say between x is equal
to 1, so that's that point,

38
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,590
and x is equal to 2.

39
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,230
That's where they intersect.

40
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,710
This is the point right
here, this is 2,2.

41
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,050
   

42
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,990
I'm sorry, no, 2,4.

43
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,230
Because y is equal
to x squared.

44
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,610
So this is 2,4.

45
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,190
This is the point 4.

46
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,100
So what point is this.

47
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,670
This is the point 1, right?

48
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,980
So our y values go from 4 to 1,
our x values go from 1 to 2.

49
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,170
And that makes sense,
because y is x squared.

50
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,560
And so if we were to kind of
take the area that we're going

51
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,230
to rotate, and I haven't told
you what we're going to rotate

52
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,230
it around yet, and this might
prove to be shocking to you.

53
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,005
So this is the area
we're going to rotate.

54
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:34,320
   

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,580
Instead of rotating it around
the y-axis, I want to rotate

56
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:44,010
it around the line y
is equal to minus 2.

57
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,340
So if that's 2, y equals minus
2 should be roughly here.

58
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,440
So I'm going to rotate this
area around this line.

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,390
   

60
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,450
So what's it going
to look like?

61
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,780
It's going to be a
fairly big ring.

62
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,300
Like if I were to try to draw
it-- let me see if I can

63
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,870
even make an attempt.

64
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,370
Once again this is always the
hardest part, just drawing

65
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,180
what I'm trying to rotate.

66
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,450
I'll try to do it from
an upward perspective.

67
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,040
So that's kind of the inner
loop, and then there

68
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,880
will be an outer loop.

69
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,150
The top is flat right, because
it's defined by y is equal

70
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,320
to 4, so that's the top.

71
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,850
   

72
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,010
And the inside is also
going to be a hard edge.

73
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,760
   

74
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,180
But then the outside is
going to curve inward.

75
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,300
I don't know if you see what
I'm saying, because this is the

76
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,150
outside, it's curving inward.

77
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,490
So it's going to be a big ring.

78
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,180
So if I were to draw the axis,
this would be the y-axis access

79
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,570
coming in-- no, no, sorry.

80
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,150
   

81
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,400
Whoops.

82
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,630
   

83
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,320
The y-axis is actually going to
be closer to this hand side.

84
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,160
The y-axis is going to be in
the middle of kind of-- so

85
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,860
this is going to be the
y-axis coming up here.

86
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,240
   

87
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,140
And then the x-axis is
going to come below that.

88
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,780
I'm drawing everything at
an angle as best as I can.

89
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,290
The x-axis is going to
come a below that.

90
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,960
And then this line we're
rotating it around,

91
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,690
that's going to be
someplace over here.

92
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,670
   

93
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,880
That's going to be
something like that.

94
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,440
It's going to go behind there
and come back over there.

95
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,310
Hopefully that makes sense.

96
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,010
We're just getting a big ring.

97
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,780
So how are we going to do this?

98
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,810
Well actually there's a
couple of things we can do.

99
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,700
First we could just
use the shell method,

100
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,650
using the x value.

101
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,362
So how do we do that?

102
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:56,650
The important thing is
to always visualize

103
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,710
the shell or the disk.

104
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,450
So the shell method we're going
to take slivers like this,

105
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,220
where the width of
that sliver is dx.

106
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,650
I could draw it really big.

107
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,510
So that's our direct
angle, is going to be dx.

108
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,530
What's the height going
to be of the sliver?

109
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,590
Well it's going to be
the top function minus

110
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,360
the bottom function.

111
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,760
It's going to be y equals
4 minus x squared.

112
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,650
So this is going to be 4 minus
x squared, the height at

113
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,510
any point right here.

114
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,880
And then if I were to do
the shell just like we did

115
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,300
before-- let me see if I
can draw a decent shell.

116
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,650
   

117
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,390
I think I'm getting
better at this.

118
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,560
This is one edge of the shell,
that's the other shell.

119
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,020
We already figured out that
the width of the shell is dx.

120
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,410
The height is 4 minus x
squared, the top function minus

121
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,070
the bottom function because of
the distance between the two.

122
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,200
And then what's the
radius going to be?

123
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,040
What's the radius of
that shell going to be?

124
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,570
Well, is it going to be just x?

125
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,220
Is it just going to be x value?

126
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,580
No, the x value will tell you
the distance from the y-axis to

127
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,750
that shell, and it's going to
be from minus 2 to the e value.

128
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,630
So it's going to be
essentially 2 plus x.

129
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,220
That's going to be the
radius at any point.

130
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,030
And this is where we diverge
from what we've done before.

131
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,630
Before the radius was just
x, but now it's 2 plus x.

132
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,280
So what's the circumference
of each shell going to be?

133
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,460
Well circumference is
equal to 2 pi r, and

134
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,890
our radius is 2 plus x.

135
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:48,690
So it's 2 pi times 2 plus
x, which equals 4 pi

136
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:54,310
plus 4 pi plus 2 pi x.

137
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,840
That's the circumference.

138
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,940
And then what's the
surface area of this?

139
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,960
Well it's going to be the
circumference times the height.

140
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,630
So surface area is
equal to that.

141
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:12,180
The circumference 4 pi plus 2
pi x, all of that times the

142
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,220
height-- times 4
minus x squared.

143
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,540
And let's see if we
can foil this out or

144
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,870
distribute this out.

145
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,810
So 4 pi times 4 is 16 pi.

146
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:31,580
4 pi minus x squared
minus 4 pi x squared.

147
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:38,040
2 pi x times 4 plus 8 pi x, and
then 2 pi x times minus x

148
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,030
squared, so that's minus
2 pi x to the third.

149
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,980
So that's the surface
area of each ring.

150
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,820
And then if we want the volume
of each shell, essentially

151
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,890
we multiply it times
the width, the dx.

152
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:56,390
   

153
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,220
So that's the volume of
each shell, and if we want

154
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,180
the volume of all the
shells, we sum them up.

155
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,800
So we take the integral, that's
an integral sign, and I'm

156
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,720
running out of space
like I always do.

157
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,015
And where did I take
the integral from?

158
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:11,550
I take the integral from x is
equal to 1 to x is equal to 2.

159
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,340
From 1 to 2.

160
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,980
That's probably too
small for you to read.

161
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,710
So let's see if we can take
the antiderivative of this.

162
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,610
Let me make some space
free just so I don't

163
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,220
have to write so small.

164
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,360
So I'll keep this down here,
because that's the set

165
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,965
up of the problem.

166
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:31,600
   

167
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,360
I think I can get rid
of a lot of this.

168
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,995
I think that is pretty good.

169
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:41,460
   

170
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,360
OK.

171
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,876
And let me switch
to another color.

172
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:45,280
And we're going to take
the antiderivative.

173
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,550
So what's the
antiderivative of this?

174
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,405
So the antiderivative
of 16 pi is 16 pi x.

175
00:08:52,405 --> 00:09:01,250
   

176
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,570
And then what's the
antiderivative of

177
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,530
4 pi x squared?

178
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,370
It's going to be x to the third
over 3, so it'll be minus 4

179
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:14,370
pi over 3-- sorry-- 4 pi
over 3 x to the third.

180
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,350
   

181
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,100
Well this will be x squared
over 2, so it'll be

182
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,400
plus 4 pi x squared.

183
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
And then minus, this will
be x to the fourth over

184
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,390
4, so minus pi over 2.

185
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,550
Just divided by 4.

186
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,170
x to the fourth.

187
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,320
I'm going to evaluate that.

188
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,840
This is a much hairrier problem
then what we've been doing.

189
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,940
2 and at 1.

190
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,770
So what is it evaluated at 2?

191
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:50,720
It is 32 pi minus 4 pi over 3
times 8 plus 4 pi times 4 plus

192
00:09:50,720 --> 00:10:00,640
16 pi minus 2 to the fourth is
16 divided by 2 minus 8 pi.

193
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,920
And then I just realized I'm
running out time, so I will

194
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,130
continue this in
the next video.

195
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,430
