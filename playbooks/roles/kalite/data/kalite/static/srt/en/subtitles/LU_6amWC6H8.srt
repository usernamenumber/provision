1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:06,933
So one of the main purposes of accounting for anything of making these accounting statements in the first place

2
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:16,133
is so that you can reflect what's going on in a buisness and that might be for investors, to see how a buisness is doing, or it might be for the managers of a buisness

3
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:22,333
So they can see where the buisness is doing well, where it's not doing well, or maybe how rescorces should be allocated

4
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:27,067
So let's se which of these two methods of accouting, the cash method and the accrual method

5
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:34,800
Give a better indication of what's actually going on in the buisness, and the way I did it in the first two videos, the first column over here

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:44,333
This is the cash basis of accounting and this is the accrual, and let's just look at the income statement

7
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:50,933
We are assuming a very simple world, were the is no taxes, we have no debt, we have no intrest or things

8
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:56,267
like that. We just litterally have Revenue and just a simple profit.

9
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:58,067
And we'll make it more complicated in the future

10
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:00,667
So this right here you could view as our income statement.

11
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:07,533
This is our income statement for month one on a Cash basis and a Accurual basis

12
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:15,800
Now when you look at either basis on month one, it's the same thing so it's not that interesting

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,400
But let's go to month two. On the cash basis of accounting it looks like you just lost $200

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,267
To a outsider who doesn't know the details of what's actually going on it would seem somthing shady

15
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,533
is going on or it's a money losing buisness.

16
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:33,333
"Why would I want to invest in this buisness that's losing $200 a month?"

17
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:38,267
But if you look at the accrual basis it better reflects that you actually did some catering

18
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:41,067
that month. As a matter of fact, you did a pretty large catering.

19
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:49,667
So if you recognise the Revenue for the service you actually did that month, that $400

20
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,533
You could say look, I performed services that will earn me $200 in the future

21
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:57,533
Assuming the customer is good for the money.

22
00:01:57,533 --> 00:02:04,267
And instead of putting that $400 in cash, because you didn't get the cash you can't do that,

23
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:09,133
We said look, the customer owes us $400, which is still a asset

24
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:12,600
A asset is anything someone owes you some future benefit.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,800
So the customer is going to give you cash in the future.

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,867
Cash is a asset because you can use it to buy stuff and get people to do stuff for you

27
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,200
To get some future benefit.

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,733
So both cash and Accounts Receivables are assets.

29
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:30,067
So in month two I think it's fair that the Accrual method is giving us a better indication

30
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,733
of what's actually going on.

31
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:37,067
Let's go to month three. When you look at the example, you actually did nothing on month three.

32
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:40,133
You could have gone on vacation on month three.

33
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,467
There was no catering done.

34
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,533
But on a cash basis it looks like it was your best catering month ever

35
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,867
Because you got $600 inflow in cash.

36
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,800
And you didn't have to spend any expenses because you didn't do any accounting.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,267
But when you look at the Accrual basis it actually reflected what happened.

38
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:57,067
You had no Revenue and no expenses assosiated with the Revenue.

39
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:01,867
So once again, to a outsider they'd say maybe you took a break, maybe a vactation,

40
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:05,067
Or maybe it was just slow time in your buisness.

41
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:09,800
And you don't recognize these $200 in advance

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,733
Because you didn't do anything to get it.

43
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:16,267
You said: Look. I got this $200. It's a cash advance.

44
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:18,933
You could even say it's a cash advance from customers.

45
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,200
But I'm not recognizing the Revenue in the month that I got it.

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,133
I'm waiting until I actually do the service. So I'm deferring the Revenue.

47
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:31,267
So you defer it to month four, when you actually perform the service.

48
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:44,667
On the cash basis it looks like you lost money again.

49
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:50,400
So hopefully this gives you a idea of why accrual gives a better picture

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,933
of what's happening in a buisness.

51
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:57,733
In the next video, I'll try to reconcile what the Accrual income statement is telling us

52
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:59,400
and the actual cash.

53
00:03:59,400 --> 99:59:59,999
Because right now it might look a little mysterious.
