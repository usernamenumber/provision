1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,440
We're on problem 17.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,850
And it asks us which expression
shows the complete

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:15,310
factorization of 12x
squared minus 147?

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,920
Let's see, first of all,
can we factor out?

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,750
147 is a strange
looking number.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,690
Let's see if we can factor
out something.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,390
It's definitely not divisible
by 12, because

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,490
12 goes into 144.

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,460
Is it divisible by 3?

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,230
1 plus 4 is 5, 5 plus 7 is 12,
and 12 is divisible by 3.

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,409
And I don't know if you've
seen that before.

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,420
You just add up the digits and
if that is divisible by 3,

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,120
then the number's
divisible by 3.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,100
So 147 is the divisible by 3.

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,700
Let's see what it is.

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,570
Let's work it out.

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,460
It's 4 times 3 is
12, 27, it's 49.

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,960
So we can factor
3 out of this.

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,761
So then it becomes 3 times--
what's 12 divided by 3-- 4x

21
00:00:55,761 --> 00:01:00,410
squared minus-- 147 divided
by 3, which we just

22
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,070
figured out, was 49.

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,340
And now this, once again, looks
just like a squared

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,250
minus b squared, where a would
be 2x and b would be 9.

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,320
So now we can factor
that more.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,910
And I'll just switch
colors arbitrarily.

27
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:25,690
That becomes 3 times a plus b,
so that would be 2x plus 7

28
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,420
times a minus b.

29
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,380
2x minus 7.

30
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,030
And that is choice D.

31
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,780
In choice D, they wrote the 2x
minus 7 first, but it's the

32
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,315
same difference.

33
00:01:36,315 --> 00:01:38,140
So it's choice D.

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,930
Problem 18.

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,780
Let me see if I can get
problem 18 going.

36
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,720
Problem 18.

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,310
Well, maybe I should
cut and paste it.

38
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,260
Why not?

39
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,650
So I copied it and then
let me paste it here.

40
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,140
That's the problem.

41
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,900
I'll rewrite it because I don't
if that's big enough for

42
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,390
you to see.

43
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:08,479
So it says x plus 3 over x plus
5 plus 6 over x squared

44
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,040
plus 3x minus 10.

45
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,170
So when you add fractions,
whether you're doing it with

46
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,030
algebraic fractions or regular
fractions, you have to find a

47
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,510
common denominator.

48
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,260
And let's see, we have to find
the least common multiple of

49
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,960
the denominators here, but I
have a suspicion that this x

50
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,260
plus 5 goes into this.

51
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,150
So let's see if I
can factor this.

52
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,000
What two numbers, when I
multiply them, equal minus 10,

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,710
and when I add them
equal plus 3?

54
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,030
Let's see.

55
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,930
Well, 5 times what
is minus 10?

56
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,730
It's 5 times minus 2 and 5 plus
minus 2 is 3, so that

57
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,870
works. x minus 2.

58
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,060
So this is actually our
least common multiple.

59
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,110
This expression right here.

60
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,880
So let me write it that way.

61
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,570
So that is equal to-- I'm just
going to rewrite this as x

62
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,200
plus 5 over x minus 2.

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,420
Now, x plus 3 over x plus 5, if
we were to multiply both of

64
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,680
those times x minus 2 to get
something in this form, this x

65
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,250
plus 3 over x plus 5 is the same
thing as x plus 3 times x

66
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,480
minus 2 over x plus 5 times
x minus 2, right?

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,680
You could just cancel this
out right here and

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,260
you'd get back to that.

69
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,970
And now we're adding that.

70
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,120
We're adding this term
to this term.

71
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,420
6 over this, well, this is the
same thing as this, so that's

72
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,780
just plus 6.

73
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,836
And now we just get into
simplification mode.

74
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:39,122
So x times x is x squared.

75
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:43,380
x times minus 2 is minus 2x.

76
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,940
3 times x is plus 3x.

77
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,340
3 times minus 2 is minus 6, so
that's this term right here.

78
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,880
Got us that.

79
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,120
And then we have the plus 6.

80
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,030
And then all of that
is over this stuff.

81
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,580
And I look at the choices and it
seems like they have it in

82
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,830
this form, so I'll just
write it in that form.

83
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,060
x squared plus 3x minus 10.

84
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,920
And let's see, the minus 6 and
the plus 6 cancels out, and

85
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,240
we're left with minus
2x plus 3x.

86
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:22,540
So that's x squared-- minus 2
plus 3-- plus x over x squared

87
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,760
plus 3x minus 10.

88
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,590
And that is choice A.

89
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,180
Choice A.

90
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,030
Next problem.

91
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,020
I'm almost out of space.

92
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,980
I'll draw a line here, just so
you don't get distracted.

93
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,720
What is the simplified form of,
and they write 3a squared

94
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,570
b to the third, c to the minus
2, all of that over--

95
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:57,180
interesting-- a to the minus 1
b squared c, and all of that

96
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,090
is to the third power.

97
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,660
So let's get in simplification
mode.

98
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,820
So this bottom part, we can
re-simplify as-- let's see,

99
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,770
maybe I wrote too big.

100
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,630
3a squared, b to the third,
c to the minus 2.

101
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,610
All of that, it's a to the
negative 1, b squared, c to

102
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,220
the third power, that's
each of these items

103
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,090
to the third power.

104
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,070
So a to the minus 1 to
the third power.

105
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,470
You can multiply
the exponents.

106
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,050
That becomes a to the minus 3.

107
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,200
I just took the negative
1 times the 3.

108
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,360
b squared to the third power.

109
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,500
That's b to the 2 times 3.

110
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,200
That's b to the sixth power.

111
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,990
And then finally c.

112
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,770
Well, that's just c to the first
of the third power, so

113
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,020
that's c to the third.

114
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,740
And now we can just say, well,
this is the same thing.

115
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,790
Let me switch colors.

116
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,890
This color's getting mundane.

117
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:53,750
This is equal to 3 times a to
the 2-- we're dividing by a to

118
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,900
the negative third-- so
it's 2 minus minus 3.

119
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,090
Let me write that, just so you
understand-- 2 minus minus 3

120
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,160
power-- that's where I got the
2; that's where I got the

121
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,170
minus 3, and I subtracted
because I'm dividing-- times b

122
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:18,300
to the 3 minus 6, times c
to the minus 2 minus 3.

123
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,200
Once again, if we were
multiplying these two, I would

124
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,890
add the exponents.

125
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,020
But anyway, let's
simplify this.

126
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:30,850
This equals 3a, 2 minus minus,
so that's plus, 3a to the

127
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:36,330
fifth, b to the minus
3, c to the minus 5.

128
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,410
   

129
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,050
And this is the same thing
as 3a to the fifth.

130
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,120
b to the minus 3 is the same
thing as 1 over b to the

131
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,875
third, so over b to the third.

132
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:53,390
And this is the same thing
as 1 over c to the fifth.

133
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,290
And that is choice A.

134
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,650
Choice A.

135
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,900
Next problem.

136
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,260
   

137
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,280
Next problem.

138
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,830
Oh, we already finished
that page.

139
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,670
All right.

140
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,990
Let me copy and paste
what they wrote.

141
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,940
   

142
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:19,730
Let me put it at the top of this
right there and paste it.

143
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,600
That's what they're asking
and I'll write it.

144
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,630
20x to the minus fourth
over 27y squared

145
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,590
divided by this fraction.

146
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,620
So first of all, when you divide
by a fraction, that's

147
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,120
the same thing as multiplying
by the inverse, right?

148
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,520
So let's do that.

149
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,130
I want to get rid of this
pesky-looking division sign.

150
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:44,130
So let's rewrite this as 20x to
the minus fourth over 27y

151
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,770
squared times-- instead of
dividing by this, let's

152
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,070
multiply by the inverse.

153
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,600
So what's the inverse?

154
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:57,570
15y to the minus 5 over
8x to the minus 3.

155
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,340
I just flipped it.

156
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,500
All right?

157
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,600
So let's see what
we can do here.

158
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,890
It seems like a lot of these
numbers have common factors.

159
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:11,530
Let's see, if we divide 15
by 3 and 27 by 3, so

160
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,910
this becomes 5.

161
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,960
27 divided by 3 becomes 9.

162
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,380
And just so you can think,
you can view this as one

163
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,760
continuous denominator or
one continuous fraction.

164
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,020
20x to the minus 4 times-- well,
now it's 5y to the minus

165
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,780
fifth divided by 9y squared.

166
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,440
Because when you multiply
fractions, you just multiply

167
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,230
the numerator times the
numerator divided by the

168
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,140
denominator times
the denominator.

169
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,950
Anyway, let's just
keep simplifying.

170
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:39,669
If you divide this
by 4, you get 5.

171
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,190
If you divide this
by 4, you get 2.

172
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,450
Let's see, I don't want to do
too many steps all at once.

173
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:51,480
You get 5x to the minus fourth
times 5y to the minus fifth,

174
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,040
all of that over 9y squared
times 2x to the minus 3.

175
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,290
So let's see.

176
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,420
Let's get all the numbers out.

177
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:09,220
So that is equal to 5 times 5
is 25 over 9 times 2 is 18

178
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:15,590
times x-- let's do the x-- x to
the minus 4-- minus because

179
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,950
we're dividing-- minus 3.

180
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:29,050
Minus minus 3 times y to the
minus 5 minus 2, because we're

181
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,420
dividing by that one.

182
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,850
And that is equal to 25/18.

183
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,010
Let's see, a minus minus,
so that becomes a plus.

184
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:44,010
Minus 4 plus 3, x to the
negative 1, and then minus 5

185
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,170
minus 2, y to the minus 7.

186
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,600
   

187
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,270
This is the same thing
as 1 over x to the 1.

188
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,830
This is the same thing
is 1 over y to the 7.

189
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:01,006
So this is equal to
25 over 18x, 1

190
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:04,460
over x, y to the seventh.

191
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,050
y to the seventh in the
denominator is the same thing

192
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,300
as y to the minus seventh
in the numerator.

193
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,390
Anyway, that is choice--
let's see, 25 over 18--

194
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,630
that is choice D.

195
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,020
Choice D.

196
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,080
And I'm out of time.

197
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,800
See you in the next video.

198
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,500
