00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:04,735
Find the range and the midrange of the following sets of numbers

2
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:06,923
So what the range tells us is essentially

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,738
how spread apart these numbers are

4
00:00:08,738 --> 00:00:10,258
And the way that you calculate it is

5
00:00:10,258 --> 00:00:12,044
You just take the difference between the

6
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:14,506
the largest of these numbers and the smallest

7
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:15,833
of these numbers

8
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,187
And so if we look at the largest

9
00:00:17,187 --> 00:00:18,055
of these numbers

10
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:20,562
I'll circle it in magenta, it looks like it is 94

11
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,191
94 is larger than every other number here

12
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,418
So that's the largest of the numbers

13
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:27,481
And from that we want to subtract

14
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:29,466
the smallest of the numbers

15
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:31,131
And the smallest of the numbers in our set

16
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,320
right over here is 65

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,959
(Circled in green)

18
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,408
So you want to subtract 65 from 94

19
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:38,133
and this is equal to...

20
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,822
if this was 95 minus 65, it would be 30

21
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:42,562
94 is one less than 95

22
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:44,426
so it is 29

23
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:48,165
So the larger this number is that means the more spread out the larger the

24
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:50,969
difference between the largest and the smallest number

25
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,194
the smaller this is, that means, the [tighter?]

26
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:58,557
the range [just to use the word itself?] of the numbers actually are, so that's the range

27
00:00:58,557 --> 00:01:01,552
the midrange is one way of thinking

28
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:05,297
to some degree of kind of central tendency, so midrange,

29
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:09,744
midrange, and would you do with the midrange is to take the average

30
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:12,987
of the largest number and the smallest number

31
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:17,786
so, here we took the difference that's the range. The midrange would be the average of this two numbers

32
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:27,272
so 94 plus 65 when we talk about average and [talk about] arithmetic mean over 2 so this is going to be what...

33
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:32,532
90 plus 60 is 150, 150 plus...

34
00:01:32,532 --> 00:01:39,697
4 plus 5 is 159, 159 divided by 2 is equal to

35
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:45,273
150 divided by 2, is 75, 9 divided by 2 is 4.5,

36
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:49,996
so this would be 79.5

37
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:52,810
so is one kind [of way?] of thinking about the middle of these numbers,

38
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,556
another way is obviously the arithmetical mean we [] to take []

39
00:01:57,556 --> 00:01:59,886
obviously you can also look at things as the median and the mode

40
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,600
so range and midrange
