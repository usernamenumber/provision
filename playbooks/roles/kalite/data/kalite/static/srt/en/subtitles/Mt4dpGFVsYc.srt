1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,210
   

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,500
Before I actually show you the
mechanics of what the curl of a

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,370
vector field really is, let's
try to get a little

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,600
bit of intuition.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,110
So here I've drawn, I'm going
to just draw a two-dimensional

6
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,760
vector field.

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,525
You can extrapolate to 3,
but when we're getting

8
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:15,770
the intuition, it's
good to do it in 2.

9
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,110
And so, let's see.

10
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,290
I didn't even label
the x and y axis.

11
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,720
This is x, this is y.

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,300
So when y is relatively low,
our magnitude vector goes in

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,830
the x direction, when it
increases a little bit, it

14
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,380
gets a little bit longer.

15
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,150
So as we can see, as our change
in the y-direction, as we go

16
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,200
in the y-direction, the
x-component of our vectors

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,020
get larger and larger.

18
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,130
And maybe in the x-direction
they're constant, regardless

19
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,980
of your level of x,
the magnitude stays.

20
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:53,230
So for given y, the magnitude
of your x-component vector

21
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:53,810
might stay the same.

22
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,700
So I mean, this vector field
might look something like this.

23
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,710
I'm just making up numbers.

24
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:02,870
Maybe it's just, I don't
know, y squared i.

25
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,860
So the magnitude of the
x-direction is just a

26
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,840
function of your y-value.

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,810
And as your y-values get bigger
and bigger, the magnitude in

28
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,660
your x-direction will get
bigger and bigger, proportional

29
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,870
to the square of the magnitude
of the y direction.

30
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,950
But for any given x, it's
always going to be the same.

31
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,920
It's only dependent on y.

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,100
So here, even if we make
x larger, we still get

33
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,750
the same magnitude.

34
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,390
   

35
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,640
And remember, these are
just sample points

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,250
on our vector field.

37
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:31,570
But anyway.

38
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,000
That's enough of just getting
the intuition behind

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,580
that vector field.

40
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,630
But let me ask you a question.

41
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,850
If I were to, let's say that
this vector field shows the

42
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,020
velocity of a fluid
at various points.

43
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,610
And so you can view this, we're
looking down on a river, maybe.

44
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,880
If I were to take a little twig
or something, and I were to

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,520
place it in this fluid, so let
me place the twig right here.

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Let me draw my twig.

47
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,480
So let's say I place a twig,
it's a funny-looking twig,

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,690
but that's good enough.

49
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,920
Let's say I place a
twig right there.

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,010
What's going to
happen to the twig?

51
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,230
Well, at this point on the
twig, the water's moving to the

52
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,260
right, so it'll push this part
of the twig to the right.

53
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,660
At the top of the twig, the
water is also moving to the

54
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,720
right, maybe with a faster
velocity, but it's also going

55
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,570
to push the top of the
twig to the right.

56
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,090
But the top of the twig is
going to be being pushed to

57
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,970
the right faster than the
bottom of the twig, right?

58
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,480
So what's going to happen?

59
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,190
The twig's going
to rotate, right?

60
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,680
After, I don't know, some
period of time, the

61
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,950
twig's going to look
something like this.

62
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,960
The bottom will move a little
bit to the right, but the

63
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,520
top will move a lot
more to the right.

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:44,810
Right?

65
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,650
And the whole thing would have
been shifted to the right.

66
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,650
But it's going to
rotate a little bit.

67
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,370
And maybe after a little bit
further, maybe it looks

68
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,940
something like this.

69
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:59,880
So you can see that because the
vectors increasing in a

70
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,650
direction that is perpendicular
to our direction

71
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,790
of motion, right?

72
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,560
This fairly simple example,
all of the vectors point

73
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,960
in the x-direction.

74
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,300
But the magnitude of the
vectors increase, they increase

75
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,160
perpendicular, they increase
in the y-dimension, right?

76
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,700
And when this happens, when the
flow is going in the same

77
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,700
direction, but it's going at a
different magnitude, you see

78
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,460
that any object in it
will rotate, right?

79
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,200
So let's think about that.

80
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,010
So if the derivative, the
partial derivative, of this

81
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,490
vector field with respect to y
is increasing or decreasing, if

82
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,230
it's just changing, that means
as we increase in y, or as we

83
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,460
decrease in y, the magnitude of
the x-component of our vectors,

84
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,860
right, the x-direction
of our vectors changes.

85
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,230
And so if you have a different
speed for different levels of

86
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,250
y, as something moves in the
x-direction, it's going

87
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,520
to be rotated, right?

88
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,920
You could almost view it as if
there's a net torque on an

89
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,700
object that sits in
the water here.

90
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,320
And the ultimate would be, let
me draw another vector field,

91
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,560
the ultimate would be if
I had this situation.

92
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,180
Let me draw another
vector field.

93
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,850
If I had this situation, where
maybe down here it's like this,

94
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,200
then maybe it's like this, and
then maybe it gets really

95
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,960
small, then maybe it switches
directions, up here, and then

96
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,570
the vector field
goes like this.

97
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,080
So you could imagine up here
that's going to the left, with

98
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,150
a fairly large magnitude.

99
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,440
So if you put a twig here, you
would definitely hopefully see

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,490
that the twig, not only will it
not be shifted to the right,

101
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,650
this side is going to be moved
to the left, this side is going

102
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,410
to be the right, it's
going to be rotated.

103
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,150
And you'll see that there's
a net torque on the twig.

104
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,950
So what's the intuition there?

105
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,810
All of a sudden, we care about
how much is the magnitude of a

106
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,505
vector changing, not in its
direction of motion, like in

107
00:04:56,505 --> 00:05:00,640
the divergence example, but we
care how much is the magnitude

108
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,040
of a vector changing as we go
perpendicular to its

109
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,570
direction of motion.

110
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,520
So when we learned about
dot and cross product,

111
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,070
what did we learn?

112
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,480
We learned that the dot product
of 2 vectors tells you how much

113
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,820
2 vectors move together, and
the cross product tells you how

114
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,300
much the perpendicular, it's
kind of the multiplication

115
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,260
of the perpendicular
components of a vector.

116
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,720
So this might give you a little
intuition of what is the curl.

117
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,510
Because the curl essentially
measures what is the rotational

118
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,800
effect, or I guess you could
say, what is the curl of a

119
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,240
vector field at a given point?

120
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,710
And you can you
can visualize it.

121
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,870
You put a twig there, what
would happen to the twig?

122
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,460
If the twig rotates and there's
some curl, if the magnitude

123
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,730
of the rotation is larger,
then the curl is larger.

124
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,640
If it rotates in the other
direction, you'll have the

125
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,300
negative direction of curl.

126
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,820
And so just like what we did
with torque, we now care

127
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,420
about the direction.

128
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,435
Because we care whether it's
going counterclockwise or

129
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:58,620
clockwise, so we're going to
end up with a vector

130
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,710
quantity, right?

131
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:05,270
So, and all of this should
hopefully start fitting

132
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,210
together at this point.

133
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,430
We've been dealing
with this Dell

134
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,830
vector or this, you know, we
could call this abusive

135
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,550
notation, but it kind of is
intuitive, although it really

136
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,690
doesn't have any meaning when
I describe it like this.

137
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,520
You can kind of write it as a
vector operator, and then it

138
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,140
has a little bit more meeting.

139
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,800
But this Dell

140
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,000
operator, we use it
a bunch of times.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,190
You know, if the partial
derivative of something in the

142
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,180
i-direction, plus the partial
derivative, something with

143
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,080
respect to y in the
j-direction, plus the partial

144
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,270
derivative, well, this is if we
do it in three dimensions

145
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,460
with respect to z
in the k-direction.

146
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,660
When we applied it to just a
scalar or vector field, you

147
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,670
know, like a three-dimensional
function, we just multiplied

148
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,430
this times that scalar
function, we got the gradient.

149
00:06:52,430 --> 00:07:00,890
When we took the dot product of
this with a vector field, we

150
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,710
got the divergence of
the vector field.

151
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,090
And this should be a
little bit intuitive

152
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,110
to you, at this point.

153
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,300
Because when we, you might want
to review our original videos

154
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,380
where we compared the dot
product to the cross product.

155
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,830
Because the dot product
was, how much do two

156
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,840
vectors move together?

157
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,070
So when you're taking this Dell
operator and dotting it with a

158
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,070
vector field, you're saying,
how much is the vector

159
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,840
field changing, right?

160
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,200
All a derivative is, a partial
derivative or a normal

161
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,020
derivative, it's just
a rate of change.

162
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,195
Partial derivative with respect
to x is rate of change

163
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,440
in the x-direction.

164
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,170
So all you're saying is, when
you're taking a dot product,

165
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,500
how much is my rate of
change increasing in my

166
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,890
direction of movement?

167
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,700
How much is my rate of change
in the y-direction increasing

168
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,755
in the y-direction?

169
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:52,410
And so it makes sense that it
helps us with divergence.

170
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,825
Because remember, if this is a
vector, and then as we increase

171
00:07:56,825 --> 00:08:00,480
this in the x-direction, the
vectors increase, we took a

172
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,280
little point, and we said, oh,
at this point we're going to

173
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,100
have more leaving than
entering, so we have a

174
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,840
positive divergence.

175
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,000
But that makes sense, also,
because as you go in the

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,790
x-direction, the magnitudes
of the vectors increase.

177
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,310
Anyway, I don't want to
confuse you too much.

178
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,380
So now, the intuition, because
now we don't care about the

179
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,270
rate of change along with the
direction of the vector.

180
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,420
We care about the rate of
change of the magnitudes of

181
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,560
the vectors perpendicular
the direction of the vector.

182
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:34,460
So the curl, you might guess,
is equal to the cross product

183
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,620
of our Dell operator
and the vector field.

184
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,210
And if that was where your
intuition led you, and that

185
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,780
is what your guess is,
you would be correct.

186
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,950
That is the curl of
the vector field.

187
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:56,490
And it is a measure of how much
is that field rotating, or

188
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,890
maybe if you imagine an object
in the field, how much is the

189
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,720
field causing something
to rotate because it's

190
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,220
exerting a net torque?

191
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,510
Because at different points
in the object, you have a

192
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:13,230
different magnitude of a
field in the same direction.

193
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,410
Anyway, I don't want to
confuse you too much.

194
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,910
Hopefully that example I
just showed you will make

195
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,700
a little bit of sense.

196
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,530
Anyway, I realize I've
already pushed 9 minutes.

197
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:24,970
In the next video, I'll
actually compute curl, and

198
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,840
maybe we'll try to draw
a couple more to hit

199
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,320
the intuition home.

200
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,380
See you in the next video.

201
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,900
