Lets say that I run some type of a pension fund and I have one billion dollars that I need to invest

2
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:14,867
some place. And I dig around little bit and there's this company A over here and it needs to borrow

3
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:21,133
a billion dollars and it's willing, it's willing to give 10% interest in exchange for borrowing that

4
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:26,467
billion dollars. So, if I give these characters over here - my billion dollars - if I lend it to

5
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:33,933
them; if I lend them the billion dollars on an annual basis they are going to give me 10% interest. There's

6
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:43,533
a problem here though. The rating agencies, the ones that in theory should be independent, they've only given

7
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:48,867
a company A a BB rating. This is a pension fund. I have to only invest in the safest of safest of

8
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:54,533
securities. I have to invest only in things that are AA. So, here I might enter a character like

9
00:00:54,533 --> 00:01:03,467
AIG. And obviously, things have changed since their heyday. But, AIG based on at least Moody's perspective

10
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:11,733
has a AA rating. So, AIG could say, "Hey! look pension fund why don't you lend them the money and what we are going to do is

11
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:19,333
enter into a Credit Default Swap and what that essentially is - is a form of insurance. Of that 10% every year,

12
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:26,600
why don't you give us 1% of that?" And in financial lingo, that is sometimes, referred to as a 100 bases

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:34,200
points in exchange for that 100 bases points you can view this as an insurance premium. We are going

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:51,467
to insure that if for whatever reason company A defaults on that debt you can give us that debt security

15
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:56,267
and we will just give you back the billion dollars. Now, from the pension's point of view, this looks pretty

16
00:01:56,267 --> 00:02:05,933
good. They are getting a net 9% of interest, 10% minus the 1% and they are essentially getting to lend to a BB company

17
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:15,800
but in effect like lending to a AA. Because as long as AIG is good for the money, the pension fund is going

18
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:23,200
to get their money back one way or the other. Now, where this gets a little bit shady is that AIG right

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,533
here didn't have to do anything. What's interesting about Credit Default Swaps sometimes referred

20
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:40,000
to as CDSes is that even though there are insurance for all purposes, they are not regulated like insurance. So, typically

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,533
an insurance company when they insure something will have to set aside some money in case that thing actually

22
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:51,467
happens and they have to work out the probabilities and all that. Now Credit Default Swaps were not

23
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:56,267
regulated in that way. So, AIG could do this without having to set aside any type of moeny. And, they

24
00:02:56,267 --> 00:03:02,600
could do this over and over and over again kind of snowballing all of their potential liabilities.

25
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,400
So, you can imagine it's really good money while noone is defaulting but all of a sudden when people

26
00:03:08,400 --> 99:59:59,999
start defaulting then all of a sudden AIG is gonna be in trouble and all of the people who thought they had in effect AA debt because AIG was insuring it might not
