1
00:00:01,744 --> 00:00:04,246
Bob discovered something very interesting

2
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:07,583
while making multi-coloured ear rings out of beads for his store.

3
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:09,376
Now his customers like variety

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:14,465
so he decides to make every possible style for each size.

5
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:16,300
Starting with size 3, he begins

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,185
by figuring out all possible styles.

7
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:25,059
Each earring begins as a string of beads

8
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:28,805
and then the ends are attached to form a ring.

9
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:33,025
So first, how many possible strings are there?

10
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:37,196
Well, with 2 colours and 3 beads, there are 3 choices,

11
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:38,989
each from two colours.

12
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:45,496
So, 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 possible unique strings.

13
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:48,749
Then he subtracts the strings which have only one colour.

14
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,412
or mono-coloured strings

15
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:54,046
since he is only building multi-coloured earrings.

16
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:57,258
Then he glues them all together to form rings.

17
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:00,304
He was assuming he would end up with six different earrings

18
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:01,845
but something happened:

19
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:05,391
he can no longer tell the difference between most of them.

20
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:08,811
It turns out he has only two styles

21
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:15,442
because each style is now part of a group with 2 identical partners!

22
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,569
Notice you can always match them up

23
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:19,989
based on rotations.

24
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:22,533
So the size of these groups must be based

25
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,994
on how many rotations it takes

26
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:26,745
to return to the original.

27
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:31,055
Or: how many rotations to complete a cycle.

28
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,003
So this means that the original set

29
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:35,879
of multi-coloured strings

30
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,790
divides evenly into groups of size 3.

31
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:48,434
Hm. Now, would this be true for other sizes?

32
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:49,643
That would be convenient,

33
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,313
since he always wants the same amount of each style.

34
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,648
So he tries this with four beads.

35
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,735
First, he builds all possible strings

36
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:01,613
and with 4 beads he can choose from 2 colours for each bead,

37
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:06,312
so 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16.

38
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:10,497
Then he removes the two mono-coloured necklaces,

39
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:14,626
and attaches all of the others to form rings.

40
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:18,453
Now, will they form equal-sized groups?

41
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:20,758
Apparently not!

42
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:22,384
What happened?

43
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:25,085
Notice how the initial set of strings

44
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:27,348
devides into styles.

45
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:28,932
If strings are of the same style,

46
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:30,768
it means that you can form one into the other

47
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:33,479
simply by grabbing beads from one end,

48
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,992
and sticking them onto the other end.

49
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:40,569
There is one style which has only two members.

50
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,821
This is because it is built out of

51
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:45,949
a repeating unit of length 2,

52
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:50,412
so only two rotations are required to complete a cycle

53
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:54,249
Therefore, this group only contains two.

54
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:58,921
He cannot split them into an equal number of styles.

55
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:00,839
What about size 5?

56
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:05,629
Will they break into an equal number of each style?

57
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:11,225
Wait! Suddenly he realises he does not need to build them

58
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:13,560
in order to find out! It must work,

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,273
since 5 cannot be made up of a repeating pattern,

60
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:21,318
because 5 cannot be broken into equal parts.

61
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,612
It's a prime number.

62
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:25,989
So, no matter what kind of multi-coloured string

63
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:27,574
you start with,

64
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,035
it will always take five rotations

65
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:33,271
or bead swaps, to return to itself.

66
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:37,626
The cycle length of every string must be five.

67
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:38,919
Well, let's check.

68
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,586
First, we'll build all possible strings,

69
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:46,176
and remove the two mono-coloured strings.

70
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,129
Then we separate the strings into groups

71
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,139
which belong to the same style

72
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,725
and build a single earring for each style.

73
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:56,895
Notic that each earring rotates exactly 5 times

74
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,440
to complete a cycle.

75
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,109
Therefore, if we glue all the strings into rings,

76
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:05,154
they must split into equal-sized groups

77
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:07,197
of five.

78
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,616
But then he goes a step further.

79
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,743
Currently he is only using two colours,

80
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:16,248
but he realises this must hold with any number of colours.

81
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:20,971
Because any multi-coloured ring with a prime number of beads P

82
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:23,922
must have a cycle lenght of P

83
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:28,849
since primes cannot be broken into equal-sized units.

84
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:33,223
But if a composite number of beads are used

85
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:36,101
such as 6, he will allways have certain strings

86
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,812
with shorter cycle lengths

87
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,690
since it is built out of a repeating unit

88
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,860
and therefore will form smaller groups.

89
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,198
And amazingly, he just stumbled on to Fermat's Little Theorem.

90
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:52,034
Given A colours

91
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:55,871
ands strings of length P which are prime

92
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:58,165
the number of possible strings

93
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,501
is a x a x a, p times, or

94
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,462
a to the power of p

95
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:06,340
And when he removed the mono-coloured strings

96
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,259
he subtracts exactly a strings

97
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:11,720
since there are one for each colour.

98
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,934
This leaves him with (a^p)-a strings

99
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:19,228
And when he glues these strings together

100
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:22,397
they will fall into groups of size p

101
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:26,385
since each ring must have a cycle length of p

102
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:32,282
Therefore, p divides a^p-a

103
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:34,493
And that's it!

104
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:37,955
We can express this statement in modular arithmetic too

105
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:42,668
Think of it, if you divide a^p by p

106
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:45,965
you will be left with a remainder a

107
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:48,356
So we can write this as

108
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,805
And here we have stumbled on to

109
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:57,266
one of the fundamental number results in number theory,

110
00:05:57,266 --> 00:06:01,653
merely by playing with beads.
