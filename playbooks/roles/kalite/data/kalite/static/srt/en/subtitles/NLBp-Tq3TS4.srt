1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,840
We're on Test 5, Section
9, on page 679.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,530
Let's do some problems.
Problem number 1.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,560
If 6 cars out of 10 on an
assembly line are red, what is

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,320
the probability that a car
selected at random from the

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,700
assembly line will be red?

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,390
Well, 6 out of 10 are red.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,640
So if I take a random one, I
have a 6 in 10 chance of

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
getting a red car.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,310
If you look at the choices,
there is no 6/10, but you can

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,080
see that this can be reduced.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,010
If you divide the top and the
bottom by 2, you get 3/5.

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,330
So this is really just an
exercise in reducing a

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,370
fraction to its lowest common
or simplified form, so the

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,930
answer is B.

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,965
Problem 2.

17
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,240
Let me draw that diagram.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,520
So I have a triangle.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,310
   

20
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,460
Let me try my best
to draw this.

21
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,500
   

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,830
There's an altitude that
comes down the center.

23
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,380
Let's put a 2.

24
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,000
And then what do they write?

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,090
They write this angle
right here is w.

26
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:20,320
This is x, y, z over here.

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,170
And they say, note: figure
not drawn to scale.

28
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,760
AB is equal to BC.

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,395
Oh, I didn't draw
the letters in.

30
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:32,740
So A, B, C, and then D.

31
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,330
So they say that AB
is equal to BC.

32
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,050
   

33
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,010
So immediately, a trigger should
go off in your head.

34
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,490
If two sides are equal, what
does it say about the base

35
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,180
angles or their corresponding
angles?

36
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,800
That means that those are
also going to be equal.

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,700
So if those two sides are equal,
then we also know that

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,410
these two angles are equal.

39
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,480
That should immediately be a
trigger in your head, that we

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,330
know that w is equal to z.

41
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,890
What's the next part
of the information?

42
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,900
And BD, this is BD,
bisects AC.

43
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,220
so bisects means it essentially
intersects it at

44
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,039
its midpoint.

45
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,380
So that also tells us that this
distance here from A to D

46
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,080
is the same as the distance
from D to C.

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,320
Which of the following
cannot be concluded?

48
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,050
That w is equal to x.

49
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,110
   

50
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,850
Actually, immediately, I
don't even know how I

51
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,470
can conclude that.

52
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,920
Let's look at the
other choices.

53
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,190
w is equal to z.

54
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,760
Well, w is equal to z can
definitely be concluded.

55
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,990
That's choice B.

56
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,410
So we know that choice
B is w is equal to z.

57
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,050
We know that this isn't it
because we concluded that

58
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,770
immediately.

59
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,020
Choice C is that x
is equal to y.

60
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,640
   

61
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,370
That actually can
be concluded.

62
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,090
How do we know that?

63
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,730
Well, since this bisects this
line and this is an isosceles

64
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,560
triangle, even though that's
not how I drew it.

65
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,390
This triangle is completely
symmetric.

66
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,930
Maybe I should draw a
little bit better.

67
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,240
How do I know it's completely
symmetric?

68
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,860
Because this side is equal to
this side, that is equal to

69
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,980
that, and this side is
equal to this side.

70
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,290
And of course, this side
is equal to that side.

71
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,930
And actually, we can also
conclude that this is a

72
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,970
90-degree angle, because if this
was anything other than a

73
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,870
90-degree angle, this wouldn't
be able to bisect at the base.

74
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,340
So choice C, we actually can
deduce that x is equal to y.

75
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,060
So that's not the answer.

76
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,880
Choice D is AD is equal to DC.

77
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,120
Well, they essentially
told us that one.

78
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,460
They said BD bisects AC, so
that's not our answer.

79
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,100
Choice E.

80
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,100
DB is perpendicular to AC.

81
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,130
And I just said the triangle
is completely symmetric.

82
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,620
And given that it's an isosceles
triangle, the only

83
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,410
way that BD can bisect this
bottom line is if it's

84
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,220
perpendicular.

85
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,570
So we can also rule out E.

86
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,380
So our answer really is A.

87
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,550
And really, there was no way
that we could figure out.

88
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,780
And a good way of thinking
about that is actually we

89
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,560
could make this point-- we could
make the length of this

90
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,339
line, this length BD,
arbitrarily high because they

91
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,670
gave us no information.

92
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,600
The triangle could
look like this.

93
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,792
It could look like that, or it
could look like this based on

94
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:27,270
the information they gave us.

95
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,610
So these angles could
change arbitrarily.

96
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,770
So we really don't know
what those angles are.

97
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,280
Next problem.

98
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,530
Problem 3.

99
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,844
   

100
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,420
Switch colors.

101
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,214
About to sneeze.

102
00:04:46,214 --> 00:04:47,060
[SNEEZES]

103
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,540
Excuse me.

104
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:59,550
If 30% of m is 40, so 0.3
m, what is 15% of m?

105
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,100
What is 0.15 of m?

106
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,070
You could solve this.

107
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,540
Divide both sides by 0.3,
et cetera, et cetera.

108
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,010
But the important thing to
recognize is that 15%, or

109
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,130
0.15, is half of 0.13.

110
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:20,160
So if 15% is half of 0.3, or
30%, then 15% m is going to be

111
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,460
half of whatever 30% m is, so
it's going to be equal to 20.

112
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,060
Another thing you could have
done, if that's not completely

113
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,770
obvious, take this
top equation and

114
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,760
multiply it by 1/2.

115
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,415
Then you'll get 0.15m
is equal to 20.

116
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:37,560
And that's choice B.

117
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,690
Problem 4.

118
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,940
If n is any negative number, so
n is less than 0, which of

119
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,390
the following must
be positive?

120
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,110
So I can already tell you that
the only way you can take a

121
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,120
negative number and make it
positive is either if you

122
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,160
square it or if you multiply it
by another negative number.

123
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,150
So let's see.

124
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,715
Or if you subtract it, actually,
now that I look at

125
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:02,670
the choices.

126
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,335
So I could tell you an/2, that's
definitely going to be

127
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:06,710
a negative number.

128
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,800
B is definitely going to
be a negative number.

129
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,890
You're multiplying
by a positive.

130
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,130
C, you're just adding something
to it, so it still

131
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,500
could be negative, if that's
like negative 10

132
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,820
or something, right?

133
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,350
D, you're just subtracting from
it, so you're just going

134
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,780
to make it more negative.

135
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,050
E.

136
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,540
2 minus n.

137
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,190
This will definitely result
in a positive number.

138
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,360
Why?

139
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,190
Because let's say that you could
express n as the product

140
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,960
of a negative number.

141
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,330
Let's say n is equal to
minus p, where p is

142
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,520
some positive number.

143
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,050
You can represent any negative
number like that.

144
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,430
Then 2 minus n is the same
thing as 2 minus minus p,

145
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,730
which is the same thing
as 2 plus p.

146
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,730
And we said p is a
positive number.

147
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,510
So there we go.

148
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,670
So choice number 4
is definitely E.

149
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,410
And you could try it
out with a number.

150
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,400
Try it out with the number n
equals negative 10, and I

151
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
think it should work out.

152
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,520
Next problem.

153
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,530
Problem number 5.

154
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:15,640
The ratio 1.2:1 is equal to
which of the following ratios?

155
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,990
So they give us a bunch
of choices.

156
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,390
1.2:1, so it's a little
bit more than 1:1.

157
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,610
So we could look at 1:2.

158
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,750
No, that makes no sense, because
1 is smaller than 2.

159
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,250
12:1.

160
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,910
12 is 12 times 1,
not 1.2 times 1.

161
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,585
So you're just looking for a
ratio where the first number

162
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:38,660
is 1.2 times the
second number.

163
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,450
5:6, that's choice C.

164
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,080
That doesn't work, because
5 is less than 6.

165
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,680
Choice D.

166
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
6:5.

167
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,170
I think we hit it because 6 is
just a little bit more than 5.

168
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,840
And actually, if you wanted to
confirm that, why don't you

169
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,630
divide the top and
the bottom by 5?

170
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,900
So 5 goes into 6
how many times?

171
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,490
5 goes into 6 one time.

172
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,530
How many times does
5 go into 10?

173
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,390
It's 2.

174
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,200
5 goes into 6 1.2 times.

175
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,280
So the answer is 6:5.

176
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,080
Next problem.

177
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,140
Let's see if I have
time to do this.

178
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,180
Clear image.

179
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,680
Invert colors.

180
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,750
The legend of a certain
pictograph shows that this

181
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,260
thing is equal to 5
million new homes.

182
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,750
Approximately how many
new homes are

183
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,360
represented by the symbols?

184
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,180
So they drew that
3 and 1/2 times.

185
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:40,110
One, two, three, and then
they draw half a house.

186
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,900
That's half a house.

187
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,270
So these three are
going to be what?

188
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:50,280
This is 3 times 5, which is
equal to 15 million homes.

189
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,560
And then this is half a house.

190
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,430
That's what I tried to draw what
they drew in the diagram.

191
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,290
So half a house is what?

192
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,620
2.5 million houses.

193
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,880
It's just half of
the 5 million.

194
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,850
So it's 15 million plus 2.5.

195
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,470
It equals 17.5 million homes.

196
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,330
And that is choice D.

197
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,950
   

198
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,380
You might be tempted to say that
this represents half a

199
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,840
million homes, but remember,
this represents half of one of

200
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,445
these pictures.

201
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:17,600
And one of these pictures
represents 5 million homes.

202
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,140
So this is 2 and 1/2 million.

203
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,040
This is 2 and 1/2, not 0.5.

204
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,810
See you in the next video.
