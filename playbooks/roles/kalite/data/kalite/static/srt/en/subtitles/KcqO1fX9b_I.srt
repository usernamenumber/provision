1
00:00:00,518 --> 00:00:02,439
Let's do a few more examples of finding

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:04,369
the limit of functions as x approaches

3
00:00:04,369 --> 00:00:06,670
infinity or negative infinity.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,770
So here I have this crazy function,

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:16,861
[reads function]

6
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:19,260
So what's going to happen as x

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,861
approaches infinity?

8
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:22,011
And the key here, like we've seen

9
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:24,091
in other examples, is just to realize

10
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,421
which terms will dominate.

11
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:28,041
So for example, in the numerator,

12
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,372
out of these three terms,

13
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:31,983
the 9x^7 is going to grow much faster

14
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:34,442
than any of these other terms,

15
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:37,643
so this is the dominating term

16
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:40,014
in the numerator, and in the denominator,

17
00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:43,277
3x^7 is going to grow much faster than an x^5 term,

18
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:44,771
and definitely much faster

19
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:47,174
than a log base 2 term.

20
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:49,914
So at infinity, as we get closer and closer to infinity,

21
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:53,388
this function is going to be roughly equal to

22
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:58,927
9x^7 over 3x^7, and so we can say,

23
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:01,199
especially since as we get larger and larger,

24
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:03,220
as we get closer and closer to infinity,

25
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,868
these two things are going to get

26
00:01:04,915 --> 00:01:06,346
closer and closer to each other,

27
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:07,851
we can say this limit is going to be

28
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:10,660
the same thing as this limit,

29
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,410
which is going to be equal to

30
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,372
the limit as x approaches infinity -

31
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:17,501
well, we can just cancel out the x^7's,

32
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:20,441
so it's going to be 9/3, or just 3,

33
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:22,251
which is just going to be 3.

34
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:24,913
So that is our limit as x approaches infinity

35
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:26,911
of all of this craziness.

36
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:28,332
Now let's do the same with this function

37
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:30,253
over here. Once again crazy function,

38
00:01:30,253 --> 00:01:31,503
we're going to negative infinity,

39
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:33,083
but the same principles apply.

40
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:36,413
Which terms dominate as the absolute value

41
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:37,944
of x gets larger and larger and larger,

42
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:40,117
as x gets larger in magnitude.

43
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:40,837
Well in the numerator, it's the 3x^3 term,

44
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:43,443
in the denominator it's the 6x^4 term,

45
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:49,630
so this is going to be the same thing as

46
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:49,631
the limit of 3x^3 over 6x^4

47
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:55,665
as x approaches negative infinity.

48
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:58,374
And if we simplify this, this is going to be equal to

49
00:01:58,374 --> 00:02:01,504
the limit as x approaches negative infinity

50
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:05,507
of 1 over 2x.

51
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:07,506
And what's this going to be?

52
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:09,917
Well if the denominator, even though it's

53
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:12,376
becoming a larger and larger negative number,

54
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:13,777
it becomes one over

55
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:16,417
a very, very large negative number,

56
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:18,057
which is going to get us pretty darn close

57
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:20,437
to zero, just as one over x as

58
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:23,439
x approaches negative infinity gets us close to zero.

59
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,908
So this right over here,

60
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:26,307
the horizontal asymptote in this case

61
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:28,857
is y is equal to 0,

62
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,998
and I encourage you to graph it,

63
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:32,709
or try it out with numbers to verify that for yourself.

64
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:34,768
The key realization here is to

65
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,079
simplify the problem by just thinking

66
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,439
about which terms are going to

67
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:42,109
dominate the rest.

68
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:43,450
Now let's think about this one.

69
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,171
What is the limit of this crazy function

70
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:47,501
as x approaches infinity?

71
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,851
Well once again, what are the dominating terms?

72
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:51,250
In the numerator it's 4x^4,

73
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,501
in the denominator it's 250x^3,

74
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:56,171
these are the highest degree terms.

75
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:57,850
So this is going to be the same thing

76
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,300
as the limit as x approaches infinity

77
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:09,052
of 4x^4 over 250x^3,

78
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:11,252
which is going to be the same thing as

79
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:13,002
the limit of - let's see -

80
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:15,102
4 - well I could just - this is

81
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:16,912
going to be the same thing as -

82
00:03:16,912 --> 00:03:18,504
well we could just divide 250 - well

83
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:20,104
I'll just leave it like this.

84
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:23,054
It's going to be the limit of 4 over 250

85
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:24,974
- x^4 divided by x^3 is just x -

86
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:26,913
times x, as x approaches infinity.

87
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:31,914
Or, we could even say this is going to be 4/250

88
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:40,175
times the limit as x approaches infinity of x.

89
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:41,306
Now what's this?

90
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,335
What's the limit of x as x approaches infinity?

91
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,705
Well it's just going to keep growing forever,

92
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:46,975
so this is just going to be -

93
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:47,915
this right over here is just going to be

94
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:49,915
infinity, and infinity times some number

95
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:51,577
right over here is going to be infinity,

96
00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:53,778
so the limit as x approaches infinity

97
00:03:53,778 --> 00:03:55,336
of all of this is actually unbounded.

98
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,707
It's infinity.

99
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:58,977
And a kind of obvious way

100
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,376
of seeing that right from the get-go

101
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:02,768
is to realize that the numerator

102
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:04,768
has a fourth degree term,

103
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:06,419
while the highest degree term in the denominator

104
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,918
is only a third degree term.

105
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:09,437
So the numerator is going to grow

106
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:11,338
far faster than the denominator.

107
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,368
So if the numerator is growing far faster

108
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:15,669
than the denomiator,

109
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:17,979
you're going to approach infinity in this case.

110
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:22,236
If the numerator is growing far slower

111
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:23,946
than the denominator,

112
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:25,617
if the denominator is growing far faster

113
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:27,237
than the numerator, like this case,

114
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:29,837
you are then approaching zero.

115
00:04:29,837 --> 99:59:59,999
So hopefully you find that a little bit useful.
