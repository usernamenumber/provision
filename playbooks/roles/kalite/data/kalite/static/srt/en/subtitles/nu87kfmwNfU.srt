1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,920
In the last video, we evaluated
this 4 by 4

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,400
determinant and we found out
that it was equal to 7.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,230
And the way we did it is we
went down this first row.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,870
We used the definition I gave
you in the last few where use

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,980
this first row.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,000
I could even write it here.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,890
We said this is equal
to 1 times the

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,660
determinant of 0, 2, 0.

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,520
1, 2, 3.

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,440
3, 0, 0.

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,950
Minus 2 times the determinant.

13
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,440
You cross these guys.

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,980
Cross that row and column out.

15
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,310
1, 0, 2.

16
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,970
1, 0, 2.

17
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,750
2, 2, 0.

18
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,770
0, 3, 0.

19
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,180
And then we went to the plus
the 3 times its sub matrix.

20
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,240
I don't have to figure
that out.

21
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,150
Just cross out that row
and that column.

22
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,950
And then minus 4-- just keep
switching the sign-- times the

23
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,570
determinant of its sub matrix.

24
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,410
So this one had a bunch of
terms. And this one's going to

25
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,710
have a bunch of terms. Cross
that row and that column out.

26
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,710
You get 1, 0, 2.

27
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,930
0, 1, 2.

28
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,000
2, 3, 0.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,710
I'll just write it here.

30
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,600
1, 0, 2.

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,130
0, 1, 2.

32
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,770
2, 3, 0.

33
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,610
And that is a completely
legitimate way to figure out a

34
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,110
determinant.

35
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,600
And that was our definition for
how to find a determinant.

36
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,890
But I want to show you in this
video that there's more than

37
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,970
one way to solve for
determinant.

38
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,550
What I'm going to show you this
way is the same thing

39
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,560
that we did down
this first row.

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
We can actually do down any
row or any column of this

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,610
determinant, or of
this matrix.

42
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,010
And the reason why that's useful
is because we can pick

43
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,040
rows or columns that
have a unusually

44
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,490
large number of zeros.

45
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,350
Because that tends to simplify
our computations.

46
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,100
So the first thing that you have
to do before you embark

47
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,070
on picking an arbitrary row or
a column, let's say, for

48
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,320
example, we want to pick this.

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,390
Let's do one row and one
column in this example.

50
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,580
So let's say we want to go down
that row instead because

51
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,150
we like the fact that has
a lot of zeros there.

52
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,620
The first thing you have to do
is remember the pattern.

53
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,210
Remember, you switch signs
on the coefficients.

54
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,350
You don't just switch signs
as you go down a row.

55
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,930
You also switch signs as
you go down a column.

56
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,710
So the general pattern for 4
by 4 will look like this.

57
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,450
It'll be plus, minus,
plus, minus, minus,

58
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,380
plus, minus, plus.

59
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,090
And then you get a plus, minus,
minus, plus, plus,

60
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,950
minus, minus, plus.

61
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,870
It's really this checker
board pattern.

62
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,200
If you wanted to figure out
the sign for any ij.

63
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,020
So let's say you wanted
to figure out the sign

64
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,170
for, this is 2, 2.

65
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,360
So if you want to find
the sign-- let me

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,370
write it this way.

67
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,670
Say we have a function, let
me define a function.

68
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,570
I think the checker board
pattern's pretty clear to you,

69
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,470
but I'll just write it down.

70
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,760
Let's say I wanted to figure
out the sign-- the sign not

71
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,280
the trig ratio.

72
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,820
I want to figure out the sign of
any entry where you give me

73
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,440
an i and a j.

74
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,620
What you could do is you
just take negative 1 to

75
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,070
the i plus j power.

76
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,190
So if you wanted to figure out
the sign for the, let's say,

77
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,720
you are in row 4, column 2.

78
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,040
Row 4, column 2.

79
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,890
So what will it be?

80
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,550
Do 4 plus 2.

81
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,990
Negative 1 to the sixth
power is equal to 1.

82
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,850
That's going to be
a positive 1.

83
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,650
   

84
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,840
Let's say you want
to take this guy.

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,860
So this is i is equal to 2.

86
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,350
j is equal to 3.

87
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,580
We're in the second
row, third column.

88
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,150
2 plus 3 is 5.

89
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,160
Minus 1 to the fifth
power is minus 1.

90
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,280
And you have a minus there.

91
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,290
So that's another way
to think about it.

92
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,640
But the checker board
pattern's pretty

93
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,650
straightforward.

94
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,530
So now that you have the checker
board pattern in your

95
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,860
mind, let's go down this row.

96
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,770
Let's go down this row.

97
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,260
So we start with the 2.

98
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,630
But notice that we have
to multiply by minus.

99
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,090
Because we go plus, minus,
plus, minus.

100
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,610
So you have a minus 2 times the

101
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,480
determinant of its sub matrix.

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,350
So you cross out this
row and that column.

103
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,530
And you're left with this
matrix up here.

104
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,490
So it's 2, 3, 4.

105
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,050
0, 2, 0.

106
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,650
1, 2, 3.

107
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,960
This is a minus and then
you have a plus.

108
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,880
So you have a plus 3 times--
get rid of this

109
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,370
guy's column and row.

110
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,750
And you have 1, 1, 0.

111
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,190
1, 1, 0.

112
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,360
That's that right there.

113
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,970
3, 2, 2.

114
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,850
3, 2, 2.

115
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,940
And you have 4, 0, 3.

116
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,020
4, 0, 3.

117
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,630
And then you would have a
minus a 0 times its sub

118
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,900
matrix plus a 0.

119
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,560
But we can ignore those
because 0 times

120
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,910
anything is a 0.

121
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,230
So already we've simplified our
determinant a good bit.

122
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,950
So let's see if we can
evaluate this and

123
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,170
get the same number.

124
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,810
Because only then will it be
reasonably satisfying.

125
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,410
So what's the determinant
of this guy?

126
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,360
Well we can do the exact
same principle.

127
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,810
We can go down any row or
column that seems to be

128
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,240
especially simple.

129
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,370
So let's go down that row.

130
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,230
Because that row seems
especially simple.

131
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,470
So this is going
to be minus 2.

132
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,010
That's this minus 2 right
here times the

133
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,330
determinant of this guy.

134
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,220
So the determinant of this guy,
we just have to go and

135
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,120
say OK we have a plus,
we have a minus, and

136
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,720
then we have a plus.

137
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,192
It's going to be minus 0 times
its sub determinant, I guess

138
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:13,740
we would call it.

139
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,240
Get rid of that row or that
column and that row.

140
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,910
So it'd be minus 0 times
anything, that's just going to

141
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,850
be 0 plus 2.

142
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,560
So plus 2 times the
determinant.

143
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,610
Get rid of its row
and its columns.

144
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,140
2, 4, 1, 2.

145
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,280
2, 4, 1, 3.

146
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,830
And then you have a minus
0 times this thing.

147
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,500
But who cares what that is
because you have a 0 times.

148
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,630
So that just simplified
to that which is nice.

149
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,000
Let me write it like that.

150
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,940
And then you have plus 3 times
this thing right here.

151
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,950
We don't want to do
the first row.

152
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,520
We have no non 0 terms here.

153
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,910
Let's at least do this
row right here for a

154
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,130
little bit of variety.

155
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,300
None of the columns actually
seem that interesting.

156
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,010
They all have, at most, one 0.

157
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,730
So if we do that one right here,
this is a plus, minus,

158
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,270
plus, minus, plus.

159
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,300
So we'll have a plus
0 times 3, 4, 2, 0.

160
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,420
We can ignore that.

161
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,900
Minus 2 times the determinant.

162
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,410
Get rid of this column,
that row.

163
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,420
I have to be very careful.

164
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,880
I put this minus there, but
there wasn't a minus 1 there.

165
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,240
Let me write it like-- I want to
make sure I don't make any

166
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,490
careless errors right here.

167
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,970
This is a plus 1.

168
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,070
I just drew a minus 1 there
to show you how

169
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,530
things switch signs.

170
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,070
So this is going to
be a 3 times.

171
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,060
So we're going to go down--
This is this 3 right here.

172
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,090
I lost my bearings with
that minus there.

173
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,950
We're trying to find the
determinant of this.

174
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,340
So it's 0 times this matrix.

175
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,650
We can ignore that.

176
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,320
Minus 2 times its sub matrix.

177
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,330
Which is that and that.

178
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,320
So it's 1, 1, 4, 0.

179
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,240
And then you have a plus
3 times its sub matrix.

180
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,630
1, 3, 1, 2.

181
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,070
1, 3, 1, 2.

182
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,020
Just like that.

183
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,130
Let's see if we can
simplify this.

184
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,040
2 times 3 is 6 minus
1 times 4.

185
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,220
So, this becomes 6 minus 4.

186
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,350
So that's 2.

187
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,780
So this whole thing simplifies
to 2 times 2 which is 4.

188
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,100
4 times minus 2.

189
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,470
The whole thing simplifies
to minus 8.

190
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,230
Now, this guy right here, we
have 1 times 0, which is 0,

191
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,730
minus 1 times 4.

192
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,610
This is minus 4 times minus 2.

193
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,870
This whole thing becomes
a positive 8.

194
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,840
You have 1 times 2, which
is 2, minus 1 times 3.

195
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,260
Which is minus 3.

196
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,140
So you get a minus 1.

197
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,220
So this becomes a minus--
I mean you get 2 minus 3

198
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,450
minus 1 times 3.

199
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,960
So this becomes a minus 3.

200
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,220
So you have an 8 minus a 3.

201
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,333
So this becomes a minus five.

202
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:01,930
   

203
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,050
You have a 3 times a minus
5 right there.

204
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:12,700
So 3 times minus 5 is going
to be equal to minus 15.

205
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,530
Let me make sure I got-- oh
I made a silly mistake.

206
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,730
If you have an 8 minus a 3, this
is 8, this is minus, this

207
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,340
is going to be 5.

208
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:21,900
Very easy.

209
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,760
Your brain starts to get fried
if you do this long enough.

210
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,510
And the you have a 3 times
a 5 and you get a 15.

211
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,650
You get a 15.

212
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,030
And then you have a 15.

213
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,169
This term plus this term is 15
minus 8 which is equal to 7.

214
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,500
Which, lucky for us, I barely
evaded making a careless

215
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,250
mistake there, we got
the right answer.

216
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,190
But this is a much simpler
computation than we did in the

217
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,140
last video.

218
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,450
And it was much simpler because
we picked the row that

219
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,880
happened to have a lot
of zeros on it.

220
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,590
So we only had two of these
terms instead of four terms

221
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,170
like we had in the last video.

222
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,770
And you could do the same, you
could pick columns that have a

223
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,590
lot of zeros.

224
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,020
You just have to make sure
that you always use this

225
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,900
checker board pattern.
