1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,364
Welcome to the greatest common divisor

2
00:00:03,364 --> 00:00:06,020
or greatest common factor video.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,548
So just to be clear, first of all, when someone asks you

4
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:16,520
what's the greatest common divisor of twelve and eight?

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,758
Or they ask you what's the greatest common factor of twelve and eight?

6
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:25,130
That's a c right there for common.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,590
I don't know why it came out like that.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,563
They're asking you the same thing.

9
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:31,014
I mean, really a divisor is just a number that can divide into something,

10
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:34,167
and a factor-- well, I think, that's also a number that can divide into something.

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,130
So a divisor and a factor are kind of the same thing.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,769
So with that out of the way, let's figure out,

13
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:41,620
what is the greatest common divisor

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,890
or the greatest common factor of twelve and eight?

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,960
Well, what we do is, it's pretty straightforward.

16
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,930
First we just figure out the factors of each of the numbers.

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,350
So first let's write all of the factors out of the number twelve.

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,250
Well, one is a factor. Two goes into twelve.

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,090
Three goes into twelve.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,770
Four goes into twelve.

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,950
Five does not to go into twelve.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,700
Six goes into twelve because two times six.

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,220
And then, twelve goes into twelve of course.

24
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,070
One times twelve.

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,920
So that's the factors of twelve.

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,430
Let's write the factors of eight.

27
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,600
Well, one goes into eight.

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,940
Two goes into eight.

29
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,630
Three does not go into eight.

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,930
Four does go into eight.

31
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,830
And then the last factor, pairing up with the one is eight.

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,090
So now we've written all the factors of twelve and eight.

33
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,570
So let's figure out what the common factors of twelve and eight are.

34
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, they both have the common factor of one.

35
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,380
And that's really not so special.

36
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,324
Pretty much every whole number

37
00:01:40,324 --> 00:01:43,490
or every integer has the common factor of one.

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,499
They both share the common factor two

39
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:51,070
and they both share the common factor four.

40
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,589
So we're not just interested in finding a common factor,

41
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:57,380
we're interested in finding the greatest common factor.

42
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,200
So all the common factors are one, two and four.

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,580
And what's the greatest of them?

44
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,820
Well, that's pretty easy.

45
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,890
It's four.

46
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,230
So the greatest common factor of twelve and eight is four.

47
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,520
Let me write that down just for emphasis.

48
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,650
Greatest common factor of twelve and eight equals four.

49
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,940
And of course, we could have just as easily had said,

50
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:23,500
the greatest common divisor of twelve and eight equals four.

51
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,718
Sometimes it does things a little funny.

52
00:02:27,718 --> 00:02:30,929
Let's do another problem.

53
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:41,891
What is the greatest common divisor of twenty-five and twenty?

54
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,170
Well, let's do it the same way.

55
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,050
The factors of twenty-five?

56
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,430
Well, it's one.

57
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,390
Two doesn't go into it.

58
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,150
Three doesn't go into it.

59
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,420
Four doesn't go into it.

60
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,352
Five does.

61
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:54,270
It's actually five times five.

62
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,130
And then twenty-five.

63
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,560
It's interesting that this only has three factors.

64
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,322
I'll leave you to think about why this number only has three factors

65
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:07,958
and other numbers tend to have an even number of factors.

66
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:12,782
And then now we do the factors of twenty.

67
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:21,025
Factors of twenty are one, two, four, five, ten, and twenty.

68
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:22,977
And if we just look at this by inspection we see,

69
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:25,050
well, they both share one, but that's nothing special.

70
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,110
But they both have the common factor of?

71
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,550
You got it-- five.

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,638
So the greatest common divisor or greatest common factor

73
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:41,030
of twenty-five and twenty, well, that equals five.

74
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,895
Let's do another problem.

75
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:54,687
What is the greatest common factor of five and twelve?

76
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,420
Well, factors of five?

77
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,330
Pretty easy.

78
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,340
One and five.

79
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,283
That's because it's a prime number.

80
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:03,378
It has no factors other than one and itself.

81
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:05,370
Then the factors of twelve?

82
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,170
Twelve has a lot of factors.

83
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:14,270
It's one, two, three, four, six, and twelve.

84
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:20,520
So it really looks like only common factor they share is one.

85
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,360
So that was, I guess, in some ways kind of disappointing.

86
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,750
So the greatest common factor of five and twelve is one.

87
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,500
And I'll throw out some terminology here for you.

88
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,476
When two numbers have a greatest common factor of only one,

89
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,292
they're called relatively prime.

90
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,992
And that kind of makes sense because a prime number

91
00:04:39,992 --> 00:04:42,880
is something that only has one and itself as a factor.

92
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,161
And two relatively prime numbers

93
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:50,190
are numbers that only have one as their greatest common factor.

94
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,680
Hope I didn't confuse you.

95
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,744
Let's do another problem.

96
00:04:56,744 --> 00:05:04,567
Let's do the greatest common divisor of six and twelve.

97
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,670
I know twelve's coming up a lot.

98
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,810
I'll try to be more creative when I think of my numbers.

99
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,040
Well, the greatest common divisor of six and twelve?

100
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,920
Well, it's the factors of six.

101
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,760
Are one, two, three, and six.

102
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,788
Factors of twelve: one, two, three--

103
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:24,384
we almost should have these memorized by now.

104
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:29,060
Three, four, six, and twelve.

105
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,935
Well, it turns out one is a common factor of both.

106
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:36,350
Two is also a common factor of both.

107
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,540
Three is a common factor of both.

108
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,100
And six is a common factor of both.

109
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,910
And of course, what's the greatest common factor?

110
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,048
Well, it's six.

111
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:46,770
And that's interesting.

112
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,518
So in this situation the greatest common divisor--

113
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:52,600
and I apologize that I keep switching between divisor and factor.

114
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,175
The mathematics community should settle on one of the two.

115
00:05:55,175 --> 00:06:00,210
The greatest common divisor of six and twelve equals six.

116
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,670
So it actually equals one of the numbers.

117
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,906
And that makes a lot of sense

118
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:07,710
because six actually is divisible into twelve.

119
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,930
Well, that's it for now.

120
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,630
Hopefully you're ready to do the greatest common divisor

121
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,810
or factor problems.

122
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,940
I think I might make another module in the near future

123
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,155
that'll give you more example problems.
