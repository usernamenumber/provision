1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
In this video, I want to do a
couple more word problems

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,060
dealing with graphs of lines.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,010
So here we have a
gym is offering

5
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,900
a deal to new members.

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,040
Customers can sign up by paying
a registration fee of

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:22,690
$200 and then a monthly
fee of $39.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,940
This is registration.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,570
   

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,120
How much will this membership
cost a member by

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,890
the end of the year?

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,710
So let's figure out an equation
that determines how

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,470
much total we will pay.

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,680
p is equal to the amount that
we're going to pay in total

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,230
for our membership.

16
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,300
So no matter how many months we
use the gym, just to start

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,020
using the gym, we have to pay
$200 in registration.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,100
I'll just write-- everything
we'll assume is in dollars

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,830
--so I'll write $200.

20
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,800
And then we're going to have
to pay $39 for every month

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,400
we're there.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,200
So then we're going to take
the number of months we're

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,430
there and multiply
that times 39.

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,130
Notice if we stay there 1 month,
we'll have to pay 1

25
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,550
month times $39.

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,230
And we would have already paid
the $200 registration fee.

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,310
So it'll be $239.

28
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,440
If we stay 2 months, we pay the
$200 registration fee and

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,110
then we pay 39 times 2 months,
which is what?

30
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,180
Like 78 or something.

31
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,600
So it would be $278.

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,630
So just to tie this altogether
with linear equations and

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,430
graphs of them, let's
graph this relation.

34
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,840
Remember the graph of
a line can be y is

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,700
equal to mx plus b.

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,500
That's one of the forms. So to
put this line in this form or

37
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,490
this equation in this form, we
can just rearrange the 39m and

38
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:55,210
the 200 and you get p is
equal to 39m plus 200.

39
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,300
So what's the slope and what's
the y-intercept?

40
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,360
You might get confused and say,
hey there's an x there

41
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,670
and a y, but now you're doing
it with p's and m's.

42
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:09,699
Just remember this is the
independent variable and this

43
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,780
is the dependent variable.

44
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,200
Here this is the independent
variable.

45
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,170
How many months?

46
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,210
You pick a number of months
and I'll tell you what the

47
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,490
total cost of your membership
is going to be.

48
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,250
It's the same thing.

49
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,280
This is like the
x right there.

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,790
This is like the y
just like that.

51
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,570
Just using our pattern match,
this right here is the-- we

52
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,810
could say it's the vertical
intercept or the p-intercept

53
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,030
or the-- I'm tempted to call
it the y-intercept.

54
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,970
But we're really intersecting
the p-axis instead of the

55
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,430
y-axis there.

56
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,210
This right here is our slope.

57
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,770
So let's graph this function.

58
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,710
I won't do it too accurately.

59
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,550
I just want to do a hand
drawn graph just

60
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,820
to give you an idea.

61
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,450
We could just stay in
the first quadrant.

62
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,860
We're not going to stay negative
months and the gym is

63
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,840
never going to pay us money.

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,852
So right off the bat,
we're going to have

65
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:05,610
to pay the gym $200.

66
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,040
$200 for 0 months.

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,380
Then for every month, we're
going to have to

68
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,450
spend an extra $39.

69
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,380
So the slope is 39.

70
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,800
Let's say this is 1
month right there.

71
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,050
This is in months.

72
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,250
   

73
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,380
And this axis is price,
the p-axis.

74
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,040
So this is like the
p-intercept or the

75
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,190
y-intercept.

76
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,940
So after 1 month, how much are
we going to have to pay?

77
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,000
Well our slope is 39, so if we
move 1 month forward, we're

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,730
going to go up by 39.

79
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,630
So this will, right here,
that will be 239.

80
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:44,880
If we go another month,
it'll be 278.

81
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,880
This is kind of a weird labeling
of an axis, but I

82
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,190
think you get the idea.

83
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,800
So the graph of how much it'll
cost us as per month will look

84
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,630
something like this.

85
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,510
So they say, how much will
a membership cost by

86
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,340
the end of the year?

87
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,060
12 months.

88
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,840
We would have to go 2, 3, all
the way out to 12 months,

89
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,750
which might be here.

90
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,565
So then our graph is going
to be out here someplace.

91
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,650
But we could just figure
it out algebraically.

92
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,830
At the end of the year,
m will be equal to 12.

93
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,090
When m is equal to 12, how
much is our membership?

94
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,870
The price of our membership
is going to be our $200

95
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,829
membership fee plus 39
times the number of

96
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,110
months, times 12.

97
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,760
What's 39 times 12?

98
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,500
2 times 9 is 18.

99
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,930
2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 70.

100
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,680
I have a 0.

101
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,630
1 times 9 is 9.

102
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,680
1 times 3-- we want
to ignore this.

103
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,910
1 times 3 is 3.

104
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,340
So we have 8.

105
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,720
7 plus 9 is 16.

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,370
1 plus 3 is 4.

107
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,230
So the price of our membership
is $200 plus 39 times 12,

108
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,120
which is $468.

109
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,240
So it's equal to $668 at
the end of our year.

110
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,200
So if you went all the way out
to 12, you would have to plot

111
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,360
668 someplace here on
our line, if we just

112
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,290
kept going out there.

113
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,310
Let's do one more of these.

114
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,070
Bobby and Petra are running a
lemonade stand and they charge

115
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,430
$0.45 for each glass
of lemonade.

116
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,780
   

117
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,650
In order to break even,
they must make $25.

118
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,410
How many glasses of lemonade
must they sell to break even?

119
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,980
So let me just do
it with y and x.

120
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,875
y is equal to the amount
they make.

121
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:42,290
   

122
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,460
Not max-- the amount
they make.

123
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:53,850
Let x is equal to the number
of glasses they sell.

124
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,810
   

125
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,180
What is y as a function of x?

126
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,040
So y is equal to-- well for
every glass they sell, they

127
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,090
get $0.45 --so it's equal
to $0.45 times

128
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,800
the number of glasses.

129
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,760
There's not any kind of minimum
fee that they need to

130
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,440
charge or they don't say any
kind of minimum cost that they

131
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,430
have to spend to
run this place.

132
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,480
How much in order to
break even for

133
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,170
each a glass of lemonade?

134
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,020
They need to make $25.

135
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,300
So in order to break even,
they must make $25.

136
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,570
So how many glasses of lemonade
do they need to sell?

137
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,360
y needs to be equal to $25.

138
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,530
How many glasses do
they need to sell?

139
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,230
Well you just set
this equation.

140
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:55,310
You say 0.45x has to
be equal to 25.

141
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:03,860
We can divide both
sides by 0.45.

142
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,440
On the left-hand side, you're
just left with an x.

143
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:14,875
You get x is equal to-- What
is 25 divided by 0.45?

144
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:21,050
It is equal to-- They would
have to sell exactly 55.55

145
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,150
glasses or 56 if I round.

146
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,310
55.5 repeating glasses.

147
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,520
But you can't sell half a glass
or we're assuming you

148
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,340
can't sell half a glass.

149
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,372
So the answer to that, they
must sell 56 glasses.

150
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,960
Because you can't sell half
a glass, I'm assuming.

151
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,250
So they need to sell 56
glasses to break even.

152
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,530
Just to graph this.

153
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,930
Once again, we'll hang out in
the first quadrant because

154
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,620
everything is going
to be positive.

155
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,750
Every glass they make $0.45.

156
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,570
Let's say that they sell--
So this is the

157
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,390
number of glasses, x.

158
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,010
This is how much they make.

159
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:04,500
Let me go by increments of 5.

160
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,730
5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

161
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,810
Actually I need to go by even
larger increments to get to

162
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,530
the point that we're
talking about.

163
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,520
Let me go increments of 10.

164
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,270
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.

165
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,320
So that's the number
of glasses.

166
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,700
When they sell 0 glasses,
they make $0.

167
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,940
That's their y-intercept.

168
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,740
y is equal to 0.

169
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,260
When they sell 10 glasses,
they make $4.50.

170
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,610
So this is 4.50.

171
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,640
This is 9.

172
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,230
Actually let me just
do it like this.

173
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:50,500
Let me just mark only
the multiples of 9.

174
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:59,610
Let's say 9, 18, 27, 35.

175
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,700
When they sell 10 glasses,
they're going to make $4.50.

176
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,170
10 times 0.45.

177
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,540
That's right there.

178
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,240
20 glasses, they're going
to make $9.00.

179
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,670
We can keep going there.

180
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,940
40 glasses, they're
going to make $18.

181
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,810
You see their slope.

182
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,220
When you move 10, you're going
to have to go up 4.50.

183
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,860
This graph is going to look
something like that.

184
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,520
Should be a straight line.

185
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,430
Then if you want to see their
break even, their break even

186
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,125
has to be $25, which is
right about here.

187
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,170
   

188
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,130
Their break even is $25
right around there.

189
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,220
   

190
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,600
Let me draw the line a little
bit better than that.

191
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,020
The line is going to
look like this.

192
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:52,240
If the break even is $25-- it
would be right there --you see

193
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,720
that they have to sell
about 56 glasses.

194
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,930
Obviously the way I drew this
isn't the super neatly drawn

195
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,010
graph, but hopefully it gives
you the general idea.

196
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,466
