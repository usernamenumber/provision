2
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:07,750
Even in the Renaissance,

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,277
drawings were sometimes works of art unto themselves.

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,068
They weren't always preparatory.

5
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:17,609
And we think that's the case with a large-scale drawing by Leonardo

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,573
that is usually given the title "The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John,"

7
00:00:22,573 --> 00:00:24,607
and that's because it's not perforated.

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,183
Right. Although it's unfinished,

9
00:00:26,183 --> 00:00:28,519
so its status is a little bit unclear,

10
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,304
and it would have had tiny dots, or perforations, in it,

11
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:35,650
so that that would have allowed Leonardo to trace the outlines of the figures.

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,779
so that he could transfer a drawing to a panel or a wall to paint on.

13
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:46,039
Although using Leonardo's technique is so different from traditional,

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,911
much more linear Renaissance painting

15
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:49,688
that that would be more problematic.

16
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:50,751
You could get the basic contours,

17
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:55,248
but his construction of a figure is so often simply using chiaroscuro,

18
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:56,755
using light and shadow -

19
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:57,347
- sfumato-

20
00:00:57,347 --> 00:01:00,113
-well, that's because it's so soft, and because it's so smoky.

21
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:06,205
The idea of the line that would be traced by the perforations seems sort of absurd.

22
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:07,929
Right. yeah. He's much more interested in

23
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:12,338
these very slow gradiations [sic] from dark into light

24
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,200
and then moving back into dark again,

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,301
so that there's such a sense of three-dimensionality

26
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:19,439
and monumentality to these figures.

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,749
And also an integration of the figures into a whole.

28
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,514
The figures form a kind of pyramid.

29
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:24,523
They're so stable.

30
00:01:24,523 --> 00:01:26,850
And that's one of the characteristics of the High Renaissance.

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,017
That stability that suggests a kind of eternity

32
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:33,444
that is appropriate for the subject of this divine figure.

33
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:34,755
So go ahead, do you want to say something?

34
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:37,341
Well, I just wanted to say that there's such an interesting contrast,

35
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:40,244
because on the one hand you've got this sense of an ideal perfection,

36
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:42,102
this sort of - this notion of the eternal and,

37
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,068
sort of, the eternally spiritual.

38
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:44,940
On the other hand,

39
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,644
there's such a kind of intimacy between the figures,

40
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:50,314
between Anne and Mary, and between John and Christ.

41
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:51,276
That's very human.

42
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:53,674
That's incredibly human, and seems incredibly precious,

43
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:57,525
and so sort of at odds with the notion of the eternal.

44
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:59,105
Mm-hmmm, yeah. It's both.

45
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:00,602
That's what Leonardo does, right?

46
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:03,161
He combines the human and t.he divine

47
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:08,405
That's the definition to me of what Leonardo accomplished in the High Renaissance.

48
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:11,448
There are all these marvelous passages here.

49
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:13,820
I mean, I just love the way that Anne turns to Mary

50
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,971
who sits on her lap.

51
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:18,527
There's this kind of rhythm of knees of the two women, right?

52
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:20,887
Down and up, and down and up again.

53
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:22,805
It's almost musical as it moves across.

54
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:27,198
It makes me feel that Leonardo was certainly looking at classical sculpture.

55
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:32,156
because that so much looks to me like drapery on ancient Greek and Roman figures.

56
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:36,025
There is a sense of the varied age of the figures,

57
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,594
and a real sense of Leonardo's process,

58
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:44,201
especially when you look at the contrast between Anne's face and her hand,

59
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:45,686
which is so much less finished,

60
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,135
and still so much more linear.

61
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:48,577
And Anne is pointing up,

62
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:52,257
to communicate this idea that this is part of God's plan,

63
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:57,846
that Christ and his future sacrifice is part of God's plan for the salvation of mankind.

64
00:02:57,846 --> 00:03:01,541
Look at the way in which Christ's arm bends around

65
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,317
and his fingers up in blessing John

66
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,610
actually is continued upward by Anne's fingers,

67
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,314
so that's one continuous movement.

68
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,835
In a sense, Christ is literally drawn up in Anne's gesture.

69
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:15,935
Well, and that begins with the line from Mary's shoulder up through Christ,

70
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:18,681
and then pointing up to God.

71
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:22,312
In fact, you could actually begin that movement with Anne's glance at Mary,

72
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:24,188
continuing down her shoulder, as you said,

73
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:26,758
around her elbow, and then up through Christ's arm.

74
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:29,437
And actually, what we just did is a really good example

75
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:31,104
of what was so important to Leonardo,

76
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:32,577
which is that unification.

77
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:34,694
Like, you can start linking things together

78
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:36,518
the longer you look at the image.

79
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:41,170
And we can look at St. John's glance up at Christ

80
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,445
and then move up there to Mary's looking at the Christ Child,

81
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:48,913
and then go back to Anne, who's looking at Mary . . .

82
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:52,021
That's right. And it really does create a pathway for our eyes,

83
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:54,138
but all of which lead toward heaven,

84
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:56,654
which is of course the very point of the drawing.

85
00:03:56,654 --> 99:59:59,999
