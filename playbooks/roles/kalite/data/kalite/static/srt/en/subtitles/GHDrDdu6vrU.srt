1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,680
We're on problem 32.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,650
What are the solutions to the
equation 1 plus 1 over x

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,080
squared is equal to 3 over x?

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,310
So at first. This looks like
a pretty daunting equation.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,340
You have these x's in the
denominator and x squared in

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,240
the denominator.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,020
But I think we can simplify it
if we can just get rid of

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,250
these x squares in
the denominator.

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,770
The easiest way to do
that is to multiply

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,530
everything by x squared.

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,050
So let's multiply both sides of
this equation by x squared.

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,340
Then we'll get x squared times
1 is x squared, x squared

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,780
times 1 over x squared,
that's just 1.

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,890
Then x squared times 3 over x,
that's 3x squared over x.

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,350
x squared divided by x is just
x, so that is equal to 3x.

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,700
We can subtract 3x from both
sides and you get x squared

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,450
minus 3x plus 1 is equal to 0.

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,810
This is a simple quadratic.

20
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,250
It's not obvious that
you can factor it.

21
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,690
In fact, two numbers when you
multiply them equal 1, and

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,040
then when you add them
equal minus 3.

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,670
I'm guessing it might
even be imaginary.

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,110
It will probably not be
imaginary, but it's just a

25
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:10,900
strange number.

26
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,230
So let's use the quadratic
equation.

27
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,260
When in doubt, use the
quadratic equation.

28
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,750
So minus B, this is B right?

29
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,900
B is this 3 right there,
negative 3.

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,690
B is negative 3.

31
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,480
So minus B is going to be plus
3, plus or minus the square

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,240
root of B squared.

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,940
Minus 3 squared is 9, minus 4
times A, which is 1, times C

34
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,480
which is 1.

35
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,060
So it's minus 4, all
of that over 2A.

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,740
A is 1 so it's just over 2.

37
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,080
That is equal to 3/2 plus
or minus the square

38
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,130
root of 5 over 2.

39
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,990
I just separated these out
because I'm looking at the

40
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,390
choices and it seems
like they did that.

41
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,770
So you could've said that's 3/2
plus square root of 5 over

42
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,390
2 or 3/2 minus the square
root of 5 over 2.

43
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,860
I just did that because
it seems like that's

44
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,250
how they write it.

45
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,840
That is choice A.

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,870
Next problem, 33.

47
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,840
I think this one actually might
be good to copy and

48
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,510
paste the problem.

49
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,230
Let me see if I can do this.

50
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,330
OK, there are two numbers with
the following properties.

51
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,450
Let me write down the properties
and let me copy and

52
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,720
paste it for you.

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,410
OK, I've copied it.

54
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,350
Let me go here.

55
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,010
Then I've pasted it for you.

56
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,260
All right.

57
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,950
   

58
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,370
So there's two numbers with
the following properties.

59
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,740
The second number is 3 more
than the first number.

60
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,180
So let's say S for second number
and F for first number.

61
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,490
So the second number is 3 more
than the first number.

62
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,680
So the second number is equal
to the first number plus 3.

63
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,570
That's from statement 1.

64
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,950
The product of the two numbers
is 9 more than the sum.

65
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:07,450
So the product of the two
numbers, that's S times F is 9

66
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:15,290
more, 9 plus their sum,
plus S plus F.

67
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,180
So let's see, we have two
equations and two unknowns.

68
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,380
This is nonlinear because I'm

69
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,000
multiplying these two variables.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,070
But I think we should be
able to solve them

71
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,690
one way or the other.

72
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,730
So let's see, we have
what S is equal to.

73
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,440
So let's just substitute that
back into this equation.

74
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,350
So let's say that S is
equal to F plus 3.

75
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:41,340
So if we substitute for these
S's, we get F plus 3 times F

76
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,990
is equal to 9 plus F plus 3,
right, instead of an S, F plus

77
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,772
3 and then plus F.

78
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,450
Let's see if we can
simplify this.

79
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:58,460
F times F is F squared plus
3F is equal to 9 plus

80
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:05,730
3 is 12 plus 2F.

81
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,740
Subtract 2F from both sides,
you get F squared plus F is

82
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,180
equal to 12.

83
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:18,000
Subtract 12, you get F squared
plus F minus 12 is equal to 0.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,380
This one looks factorable.

85
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,510
I don't have to take out
the quadratic equation.

86
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:30,170
Let's see, this is F plus 4
times F minus 3, right?

87
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,510
Because when you multiply those,
you get negative 12.

88
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,400
When you add those, you get plus
1, so that is equal to 0.

89
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,420
So in order for this to be true,
one or both of these

90
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,500
have to be equal to 0.

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,870
So if F plus 4 is equal to
0, that means F could be

92
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,520
equal to minus 4.

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,500
If F minus 3 is equal
to 0, then that says

94
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,690
that F could be 3.

95
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,810
So F could be minus 4 or 3.

96
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,710
Now, S is F plus 3, so if we're
dealing with the minus 4

97
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,730
scenario, if F is equal to
minus 4, then what is S?

98
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,940
Then S is going to be minus 4
plus 3, and S is going to be

99
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,390
equal to minus 1.

100
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,090
Then if F is equal to 3,
than S is equal to 6.

101
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,010
So let's see if we see either
of these combinations.

102
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,900
Minus 4, minus 1,
that's choice B.

103
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,040
Excellent.

104
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,890
All right, problem 34.

105
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,400
Let me see, maybe I should
copy and paste these word

106
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,460
problems so we can see how we
parse the problems. So I've

107
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,320
copied it, then I'll go here,
and then pasted it.

108
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,020
Jenny is solving the equation x
squared minus 8x equals 9 by

109
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,470
completing the square.

110
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,910
What number should be added to
both sides of the equation to

111
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,660
complete the square?

112
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,280
So x squared minus
8x is equal to 9.

113
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,600
I wrote it with space
for a reason.

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,420
When you're completing the
square, you're trying to turn

115
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,700
the left-hand side of this
equation into some type of a

116
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,650
perfect square.

117
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,590
So if it's a perfect square,
I have two numbers.

118
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,880
It's the same number that when
you add them together, you get

119
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,810
minus 8, and when you square
them, you should get something

120
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,470
else, right?

121
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,410
So what's half of minus 8?

122
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,270
Half of minus 8 is minus 4.

123
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,430
So minus 4 squared is 16.

124
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,830
So if I add 16 to both
sides, I'm all set.

125
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,470
Why did that work?

126
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,460
Well, now it's a
perfect square.

127
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,940
This is now x minus 4 squared
is equal to 9 plus 16 is 25.

128
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,400
They're not even asking
us to solve it.

129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,070
They just want to know what we
had to add to both sides.

130
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,990
So it's 16, D.

131
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,310
Remember the whole logic here,
and I've done a few videos on

132
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,030
completing the squares, is what
number do I add here to

133
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,980
make this a perfect square?

134
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,470
You say, OK, I have a minus
8x, so I take half of this

135
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,540
number, because the same number
added to itself twice

136
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,590
is going to become minus 8.

137
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,375
I take half of that number,
then I squared it.

138
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,120
So half of minus 8 is minus 4.

139
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,990
If you square it,
you get the 16.

140
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,420
So add 16 to both sides,
you get this.

141
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,420
You can actually
solve for this.

142
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,070
x minus 4 is plus or minus 5.

143
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,110
You keep going.

144
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,070
That's actually where the
quadratic equation comes from.

145
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,140
Anyway, next problem.

146
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:20,980
16 was choice number D.

147
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,950
I'm going to copy and paste
this entire problem here.

148
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,810
Let's go here and
paste it here.

149
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,660
OK, which of the following most
accurately describes the

150
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,810
translation of the graph y is
equal to x plus 3 squared

151
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,555
minus 2 to the graph y equals
x minus 2 squared plus 2?

152
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:44,070
   

153
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:50,090
So the y translation tends to be
pretty easy to figure out.

154
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,610
Let me just draw some
example graph.

155
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,650
   

156
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,190
So if I had the graph x squared,
the graph x squared

157
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,540
looks something like this.

158
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,840
Let's see if I can draw it.

159
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,980
The graph x squared looks
something like this, right?

160
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,790
And it intersects.

161
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,330
When x is equal to 0, we're
at our minimum point.

162
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,210
And any other value increases
in both directions.

163
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:16,150
The graph of x squared plus
2, you're shifting up.

164
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,870
This is the graph of
x squared plus 2.

165
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,030
You would shift it up by 2.

166
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,420
The graph of x squared minus 2,
you would shift down by 2.

167
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,210
This would be x squared
plus 2.

168
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,500
This would be x squared
minus 2.

169
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,110
So the shift in the y direction
is very easy to see.

170
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:44,760
So if we're going from something
minus 2 to plus 2

171
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,110
we're going to be shifting
it up 4, right?

172
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,710
So that's always the
easy one to just

173
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,120
eyeball and figure out.

174
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,920
So we're definitely going to be
shifting from minus 2 to 2.

175
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,860
So it's up 4.

176
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,520
It's either going to be
choice A or choice D.

177
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,270
The left/right shift is often
a little bit more hard for

178
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,400
people to visualize or to at
least internalize, but I'll

179
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,240
give you an attempt.

180
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,100
Let's just go back to this.

181
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,300
This is the graph of x squared,
this yellow line

182
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,920
right there.

183
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,280
That's the graph of x squared.

184
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,120
Let me ask you a question.

185
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,820
What is the graph of
x minus 3 squared?

186
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,040
So does this shift it down 3 to
the negative direction or 3

187
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,660
to the positive direction?

188
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,290
Your intuition might say,
oh, I'm subtracting 3.

189
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,130
When I did minus 2,
I shifted down.

190
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,840
But it's actually the
opposite here.

191
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,230
Because you have to think about
for what value of x am I

192
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,540
going to have a 0
squared here?

193
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,100
That happens with
x is equal to 3.

194
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,200
So you can think
of it this way.

195
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,190
Now, when we're at this point,
when x is equal to 3, it's the

196
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,650
same thing as this point when
we have just x squared.

197
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,480
When you put 3 in here, this
whole expression becomes zero.

198
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,610
As you get above 3, that's
like going above zero.

199
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,370
As you go below 3, that's
like going below zero.

200
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,090
So this graph will just get
shifted to the right by 3.

201
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,242
That's x minus 3 shifts
to the right by 3.

202
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:14,410
x plus three would go in the
other direction, because when

203
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,870
x is minus 3, that's when
it would equal to zero.

204
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,580
I haven't written that down.

205
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,400
So let's think about this.

206
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:25,640
We're going from x plus 3, so if
this is x squared, x plus 3

207
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,100
would look something-- let me do
it in a different color. x

208
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,410
plus 3 is actually shifted
to the left.

209
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,630
The way I always think about
it, there's two ways

210
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,990
to think about it.

211
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,390
The y shift is intuitive and
the x shift might not be.

212
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,510
If you have a plus 3 here,
you're actually shifting in

213
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,070
the downward direction.

214
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,430
The way to actually think about
the intuition is when

215
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,570
will this whole expression
equal 0?

216
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,740
This whole expression equals 0
when x is equal to minus 3.

217
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,630
So that's the point at which
you're getting 0 squared.

218
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,080
When I'm drawing these
graphs, I'm not

219
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,770
doing the y shift here.

220
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,350
So this is going to be shifted
to the left 3.

221
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,250
This is going to be shifted
to the right by 2.

222
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,810
So if this is shifted to the
left 3 and this is shifted to

223
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,700
the right by 2, to go from this
to this, you're shifting

224
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,950
to the right by 5.

225
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,180
   

226
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,000
So the actual graph x plus
3 squared minus 2

227
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,500
is going to be here.

228
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,710
Then to go here, you have a plus
2, so you're shifting the

229
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,970
graph up by 4, and then you're
going to x minus 2.

230
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,100
So this graph right here
is going to be up here.

231
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,550
So you're shifting up by 4 and
then you're shifting to the

232
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,640
right by 5.

233
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,180
Actually, even if you're
confused with your shifting

234
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,740
left or right, you can just
say the difference between

235
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,110
plus 3 and minus 2 is 5,
and 5 is only there.

236
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,440
But you should hopefully
understand the problems a

237
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,800
little bit deeper than that.

238
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,400
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

239
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,000
