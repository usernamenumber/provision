1
00:00:00,505 --> 00:00:02,848
We've already seen that by 1925,

2
00:00:02,848 --> 00:00:06,187
Benito Mussolini was the absolute dictator of Italy.

3
00:00:06,187 --> 00:00:09,670
He was now ‘Il Duce‘ – or ‘the Leader.’

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,623
And he and the Fascists would then proceed

5
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:15,272
to consolidate more and more power.

6
00:00:15,272 --> 00:00:16,866
And they would use the threat of force –

7
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:19,410
They did use the state security apparatus

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,107
to enforce their will.

9
00:00:22,107 --> 00:00:23,578
They took over the press.

10
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:25,542
They banned all other parties.

11
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:27,952
But there was also a [segment of the populous]

12
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:29,487
that was supporting them.

13
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,405
People wanted a strong – or –

14
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:32,328
There were elements in Italy

15
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:34,892
that were in favor of a strong leader –

16
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:37,781
a charismatic leader, like Mussolini.

17
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:39,051
But then as we get into the 1930s –

18
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:41,247
in particular, the mid-1930s –

19
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:43,799
Mussolini starts to become more aggressive

20
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,000
in terms of foreign policy.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,612
And this eventually leads to him

22
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:48,329
becoming less and less popular.

23
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,760
It also leads him to getting

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,197
more and more aligned with the Germans.

25
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:53,903
You might remember, going into World War I,

26
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:55,837
he actually wanted to fight in World War I

27
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:57,574
on the side of the Entente –

28
00:00:57,574 --> 00:00:59,586
which Italy eventually does do.

29
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:01,454
And throughout this entire period,

30
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:03,608
he does not want to rock the boat

31
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:06,400
with Great Britain or France.

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,771
But as his imperial ambitions grow,

33
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:11,115
he'll find that he has more in common

34
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:13,563
with Nazi Germany than –

35
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:15,963
or he's finding more sympathy with Nazi Germany

36
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:18,202
than he is with the British [or] French.

37
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:20,669
And so we go to 1935 –

38
00:01:20,669 --> 00:01:21,862
(So we're obviously skipping

39
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:24,620
a huge [period] right over here.)

40
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,574
But as we get into 1935,

41
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:29,619
Mussolini feels that it's time

42
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:32,796
to really exercise his imperial ambitions.

43
00:01:32,796 --> 00:01:36,718
Italy already had holdings in northeast Africa.

44
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:37,570
It had control –

45
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,868
It had colonies in Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland.

46
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:44,328
And he had aspirations to take over Ethiopia.

47
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:45,982
Ethiopia, at this point in time,

48
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:47,752
was one of the few African nations

49
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:49,830
that was not essentially colonized –

50
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,167
or not being controlled by a European power.

51
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:56,459
It was at the time that Ethiopia was called 'Abyssinia.'

52
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:02,696
And so in 1935, the Italians invade Abyssinia –

53
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:04,459
invade Ethiopia –

54
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,127
And it's actually –

55
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:07,795
Not only is it a very aggressive invasion,

56
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,757
it’s also a very cruel –

57
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:12,155
WRITING: Abyssinia.

58
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:13,889
It's also very cruel invasion.

59
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,758
They use chemical warfare.

60
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:16,581
It's very ugly.

61
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:19,265
Many, many, many civilians die.

62
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,377
And this isn't taken well

63
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:22,876
by the other powers of Europe –

64
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,005
in particular, Great Britain and France.

65
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:26,086
But you might remember –

66
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:27,974
based on what we learned about in [our videos on]

67
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:28,889
Nazi Germany – that [the British and the French]

68
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,727
they were in no mood to start wars –

69
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:33,590
they were kind of in an appeasement mode.

70
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,630
And even with Italy,

71
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,378
they were willing to make a secret agreement –

72
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:44,929
the Hoare-Laval [Pact]. [WRITING]

73
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,459
And this was a secret agreement

74
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,424
that actually would have allowed Italy

75
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:52,759
to maintain control over significant chunks of Ethiopia.

76
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,984
But this was eventually leaked to the public.

77
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:58,419
And the British and French public at this time

78
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,945
did not [take well to] this.

79
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:02,152
And so, this actually – this whole incident –

80
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:05,352
the Italians invading Ethiopia –

81
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,368
the unpopularity of this amongst the civilians

82
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:10,443
in Great Britain and in France,

83
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:13,324
this further distanced those countries from Italy.

84
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:18,235
And the only country or major nation that was not

85
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:23,184
opposed to Italy's invasion of Ethiopia was Germany.

86
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:26,313
And so this started to bring Mussolini –

87
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:29,694
who, in the 1920s, did not think much of Hitler –

88
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:33,535
this started to bring him closer and closer to Hitler.

89
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:37,444
And their invasion of Ethiopia would continue

90
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:41,916
into the start of, and through, World War II.

91
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:48,207
It's a famously cruel attempted colonization or invasion.

92
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,531
But these trends continue –

93
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:53,985
his imperialistic tendencies – his alignment

94
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:58,555
with the more nationalistic nations in Europe.

95
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:02,923
In 1936, you have the Spanish Civil War breaking out.

96
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:06,681
And Mussolini decides to support the Nationalists. –

97
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:11,920
led by Francisco Franco –

98
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,514
who eventually comes to power.

99
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:15,201
And Mussolini decides to support him.

100
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:17,797
And this isn't a super popular thing

101
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:19,240
amongst the Italians, who are like,

102
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,987
"What are we doing in these other countries,

103
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:22,520
trying to fight other people's wars?”

104
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,277
But he decides to support the Nationalists.

105
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:27,371
And once again, this brings him closer the Germans,

106
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:31,040
and further away from Great Britain and the French,

107
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,769
who were not supportive of Francisco Franco.

108
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:38,268
Then you forward to 1937.

109
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:39,414
Because you remember,

110
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:42,887
Mussolini was vehemently anti-communist,

111
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:45,255
vehemently anti-socialist.

112
00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:46,493
So were the Nazis.

113
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:48,326
So were the Japanese.

114
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:54,358
And so in 1937, Italy joins the ‘Anti-Comintern Pact’ –

115
00:04:54,358 --> 00:05:06,461
[WRITING] – with Germany and Japan.

116
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:09,474
And this is essentially the nascent Axis powers.

117
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:10,912
And this literally stands for

118
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:13,089
‘anti-International Communism.’

119
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,510
So they're going to join together,

120
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,008
and aggressively fight Communism

121
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:19,610
wherever it might show [up] – International Communism.

122
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,708
And this would eventually be the basis

123
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:27,308
of the Axis Powers as we go into World War II.

124
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:31,763
And so then we get into 1939.

125
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:34,509
And by 1939, Germany is already

126
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:37,230
aggressively expanding its territory.

127
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,119
It had already executed on the 'Anschluss.'

128
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,721
It had merged with Austria – or, you could say,

129
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:46,691
it had unified with Austria.

130
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,206
It had already taken over the Sudentland.

131
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:52,816
It was in process of taking over

132
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:55,464
a significant part of Czechoslovakia.

133
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:58,358
And Mussolini wanted in on the action, as well.

134
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:06,688
So in 1939, he decides to invade Albania – [WRITING[

135
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:08,228
And this right over here,

136
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:10,438
in case you don't know where Albania is,

137
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:11,953
this is a map of Europe at the time.

138
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:13,352
And Albania's right over here

139
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:16,448
They’re able to overrun Albania very quickly

140
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:19,906
[and] depose the king.

141
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:21,705
And so Mussolini is exercising –

142
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:23,710
once again – his imperial ambitions –

143
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,195
getting closer and closer to the Nazis

144
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:27,599
who are, frankly, the main sympathizers

145
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,074
with what Mussolini is trying to do.

146
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:31,420
And so by May of that year –

147
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,590
(The invasion of Albania's in April.)

148
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,366
But by May of that year you have

149
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:42,261
a final formal military alliance with the Nazis,

150
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:46,117
called the 'Pact of Steel.'

151
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:47,285
And as you might remember,

152
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:48,388
this is only a few months –

153
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:50,137
So this is in May.

154
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:52,493
This is only a few a few months before

155
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:55,133
the Nazi invasion of Poland, –

156
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:56,458
which is kind of the catalyst for

157
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,567
the beginning of World War II in in Europe.

158
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:03,969
Italy didn't immediately enter World War II in 1939 –

159
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:05,607
in September of 1939 –

160
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:07,366
when the Nazis invade Poland.

161
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:12,950
But by 1940 – similar to what Italy did in World War I –

162
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,018
(It was kind of waiting to see

163
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:17,493
which side seemed to be in a better position [to prevail].)

164
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:21,502
By 1940, it felt that a Nazi victory was imminent.

165
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:24,922
And it decides to declare war on Britain and France.
