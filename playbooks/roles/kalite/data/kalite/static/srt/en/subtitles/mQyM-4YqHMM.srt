1
00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:05,403
In the last video, we saw that despite the fact that Italy was an original member of the Tripple Alliance

2
00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:08,217
It was a very awkward relationship. You fast forward

3
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:11,669
to the beginning of WW1, Italy tried to stay neutral

4
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:14,882
arguing that the Triple Alliance was being on the offensive

5
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,548
as opposed to the defense.

6
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:21,404
And then as we mentioned in early 1915, in the Spring to 1915, it signs

7
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:23,803
the secret Treaty of London with the Allies.

8
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:27,470
Then in May, it actually declares war on Austria-Hungary.

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,003
It actually wouldn't formally declare war on

10
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:33,803
Germany until 1916. So that lays the setting for the

11
00:00:33,803 --> 00:00:38,404
actual combat along the Italian/ Austro-Hungarian border

12
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:41,631
that they share right over here. So this next map

13
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:46,298
that I'm going to show you is essentially a zoom in of this part of this map.

14
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:50,671
So that's this map, right over here.

15
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,029
So we can start in 1915

16
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:00,137
we already saw that in May, Italy declares war.

17
00:01:00,137 --> 00:01:04,215
Italy declares war on Austria. They don't declare on Germany until the next year.

18
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:08,736
1915- Declares war on Austria

19
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,810
The first combat happens in June, happens in June

20
00:01:12,902 --> 00:01:19,671
With the first battle on the Isonzo river. I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.

21
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:23,965
The Isonzo River contours the then border between

22
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:26,069
Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

23
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:30,069
So it goes right along, right along this area right over here.

24
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:33,381
It's actually a very mountainous region, and as we'll see

25
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:40,137
the Italian Front involved many, many battles along the Isonzo River, in fact 12 battles in all.

26
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:42,804
In June 1915 was the first battle.

27
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:48,471
First battle on the Isonzo river.

28
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:51,214
And these continue into 1916.

29
00:01:51,214 --> 00:01:57,269
These continue into 1916, we get all the way into the 5th Battle of the Isonzo River.

30
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:59,382
So let me draw that arrow a little bit longer.

31
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:02,381
So these continue all the way into 1916

32
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:06,881
And these essentially end up in a stalemate. A lot of people die in these battles,

33
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:11,297
it's incredibly difficult terrain, it favors the defending forces.

34
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:15,215
and so nothing really happens to the border here.

35
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:18,799
So far in all the offenses the Italians have taken

36
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:22,137
nothing really happened. Then as we get into

37
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:26,632
May of 16, So May of 1916

38
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:29,965
The Austro-Hungarians decided to go on the offensive.

39
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:33,471
and they go on the offensive in this part of the border, right over here.

40
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:37,215
And their offensive is called the Battle of Asiago.

41
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:46,471
They are able to get as far as Asiago, so battle of Asiago

42
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:49,471
But once again, even though they were able to claim some ground,

43
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:53,137
they weren't able to keep the ground, they were kind of spreading their troops out.

44
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:55,270
They weren't able to maintain their supply lines.

45
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,737
So by the end of that battle, the Italians had reclaimed that territory

46
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:03,803
and the actual front had not moved dramatically.

47
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:07,404
So really the first two years of the conflict ended up in a bit of a stalemate.

48
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:12,736
In fact it continues, we pick up in 1916 with the 6th Battle on the Isonzo River

49
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:16,736
and in these battles on the Isonzo River continue into 1917.

50
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:24,471
So let me show you, these are the battles on the Isonzo River, these continue all they way into 1917.

51
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,964
Now, as we enter into 1917, several interesting things are happening.

52
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:31,631
One as you might remember, on the eastern front,

53
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,381
in 1917, the Russians are starting to fall apart.

54
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:38,547
They are starting to have revolutions at home, they are losing on the Eastern front.

55
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:41,737
This allows the Germans to redeploy some troops

56
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:45,604
also at this point, Italy is formally at war with the Germans,

57
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:49,881
so as we get to October, October of 1917

58
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:54,381
The Austro-Hungarians are able to get reinforced by the Germans.

59
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:58,715
And it was just in time, because frankly by the 11th Battle of the Isonzo River,

60
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:02,549
so we get to the 11th battle, in kind of late 1917

61
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:08,803
11th or kind of the fall. 11th Isonzo Battle, the Austro-Hungarians aren't quite sure

62
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:11,737
wether they can handle a 12th battle on the Isonzo River

63
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:13,937
So the Germans show up essentially, just in time

64
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:22,070
And in October of 1917, along with the Austro-Hungarians, the Germans launch their own offensive

65
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,130
on the Isonzo River, and this one is actually the first dramatic

66
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,631
movement along the Italian front.

67
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,216
And this is often called the Battle of Caporetto.

68
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:37,403
Which is right over here, but as you can imagine

69
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:40,804
It is right along the border between these too, between these too

70
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:47,381
states, and its along the Isonzo river, so this is also referred to as the 12th Battle of the Isonzo River.

71
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:55,338
12th Battle of the Isonzo River

72
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:58,471
And this one is a very successful offensive.

73
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:01,630
They focus their troops near Caporetto, at this point of the front

74
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,671
They are able to break the Italian Front and push deep into Italian Territory.

75
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:10,670
So through October and early November, they are able to over the next several weeks,

76
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:18,381
this is in October of 1917, they are able to push the Italians all the way back, all the way back

77
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:24,604
to behind the Piave River, you may not be able to read it, that says the Piave River.

78
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:29,882
So they are able to push the Italians back, roughly back to this boundary right over here.

79
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:33,004
And so this takes into 1918

80
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:41,630
1918, now at this point the Germans are planning their last ditch spring offensive

81
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,798
They say hey look Astro-Hungarians, it looks like this war is kind of taken

82
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:49,470
we are going to leave this front to you guys, you guys should be able to do the

83
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,299
knockout blow on the Italians right now.

84
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:56,602
We are going to go return to the Western Front, to take care of the Allies.

85
00:05:56,602 --> 00:06:03,603
Especially because if we don't do it sooner or later, the Americans will reinforce the Western Front.

86
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:05,881
So the Germans, the Germans

87
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:11,798
redeploy to the Western Front, redeploy

88
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:13,965
and essentially leave the Austro-Hungarians to

89
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:17,631
try to essentially take out the Italians. So in June of 1918

90
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:26,604
The Austro-Hungarians attempt their final, what they hope is their final offensive

91
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:30,204
and it is along this boundary along the Piave River.

92
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:34,964
Unfortunately for the Austro-Hungarians, and fortunately for the Italians.

93
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:37,470
The Austro-Hungarians did not plan that assault well.

94
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,381
Instead of doing a point offensive, like they did with the Germans in the Battle of Cappereto

95
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:45,738
where they were able to break the trenches, break the lines. Here was less planed

96
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,466
less coordinated, it was more spread out along the entire line.

97
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:55,670
On top of everything, the Italians got word of the exact time and date that the battle was going to start.

98
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,736
It was literally going to start at 3:00 AM on June 15.

99
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:02,965
The Italians decide that if the battle is going to start at 3:00 AM on June 15,

100
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:07,937
that means that all of their soldiers are going to be in the trenches, ready to assault, ready to attack

101
00:07:07,937 --> 00:07:16,381
at 3:00 AM on June 15, so they started lobbing artillery into these densely packed trenches, knowing that it was likely to hit a lot of people

102
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,670
because there were a lot of people waiting in the trenches for offensive.

103
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:26,670
So even before the battle began, they were able to inflict a lot of carnage on the soon to be invading Austro-Hungarians.

104
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:33,270
The invasion itself was a bit of a debacle, when they were able to get on top of the Piave River, it isolated their troops.

105
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:39,269
The Italians were able to take advantage of that, and kind of those troops that were isolated on the south bank of the Piave River

106
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:42,715
they were able to take care of them.

107
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:47,966
And they were able to push the Austro-Hungarians back and they suffered huge losses, the Austro-Hungarian army was incredibly weakened

108
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:53,936
And some people believe that the Italians could have done and immediate counter offensive and taken the Austro-Hungarians out.

109
00:07:53,936 --> 00:08:03,137
The Italians on the other hand, were still licking their wounds from the battle of Caperetto, and they decided to wait their chance and regroup a bit.

110
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:12,630
And so they wait, until October of 1918, you have a very weakened Austro-Hungarian army, and this is

111
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:18,337
when the Italians do their decisive offensive of the Italian Front.

112
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:23,215
The Battle of Vittorio Veneto. Vittorio Veneto is right over here

113
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:33,737
so Vittorio, Vittorio Veneto, and once again I apologize to all of the Italians out there for my mispronunciations.

114
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:40,047
But this is essentially able to break the back of the Austro-Hungarians, The Italians are able to pour through

115
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:48,965
They are able to take out the Austrians. The Austrians were already weakened. They are starting to have internal strife.

116
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:50,881
The empire is starting to fall apart.

117
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:57,005
And so by November, November, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, essentially surrenders.

118
00:08:57,005 --> 00:09:01,965
And not just with the Italians, but surrenders relative to the Allies.

119
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:05,965
Which is essentially the end of the Italian Front of WW1.
