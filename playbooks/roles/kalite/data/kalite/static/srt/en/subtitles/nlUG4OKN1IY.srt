1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,880
It's been over a year since I
last did a video with the

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,420
differential equations playlist,
and I thought I

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,370
would start kicking up, making
a couple of videos.

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,840
And I think where I left,
I said that I would do a

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,340
non-homogenous linear equation
using the Laplace Transform.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,040
So let's do one, as a bit of a
warm-up, now that we've had

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,050
a-- or at least I've had
a one-year hiatus.

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,660
Maybe you're watching these
continuously, so you're

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,040
probably more warmed
up than I am.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:31,500
So if we have the equation the
second derivative of y plus y

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,820
is equal to sine of 2t.

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,750
And we're given some initial
conditions here.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,190
The initial conditions are y
of 0 is equal to 2, and y

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,880
prime of 0 is equal to 1.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,250
And where we left off--
and now you

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,090
probably remember this.

18
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,570
You probably recently watched
the last video.

19
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,940
To solve these, we just
take the Laplace

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,480
Transforms of all the sides.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,540
We solve for the Laplace
Transform of the function.

22
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,990
Then we take the inverse
Laplace Transform.

23
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,530
If that doesn't make sense, then
let's just do it in this

24
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,390
video, and hopefully
the example

25
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,190
will clarify all confusion.

26
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,650
So in the last video-- it was
either the last one or the

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,460
previous one-- I showed you that
the Laplace Transform of

28
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,360
the second derivative of y is
equal to s squared times the

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,210
Laplace Transform of y-- and we
keep lowering the degree on

30
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,540
s-- so minus s times y of 0.

31
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,530
You can kind of think of it
as taking the derivative.

32
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,510
This is an integral.

33
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,260
It's not exactly the
anti-derivative of this.

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,330
But the Laplace Transform
it is an integral.

35
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,290
The Transform is an integral.

36
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,530
So y of 0 is kind of one
derivative away from that.

37
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,400
And then minus y prime of 0.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,940
And then we could also
rewrite this.

39
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,270
And this is just a purely
notational issue.

40
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,300
I could write this, instead of
writing the Laplace Transform

41
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,600
of y all the time, I could write
this as s squared times

42
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
capital Y of s-- because this
is going to be a function of

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,700
s, not a function of y-- minus
s times y of 0 minus

44
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,670
y prime y of 0.

45
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,510
These are going to be
numbers, right?

46
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,420
These aren't functions.

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,500
These are the function evaluated
at 0, or the

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,190
derivative of the function
evaluated at 0.

49
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,690
And we know what these
values are.

50
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,910
y of 0, right here, is 2,
and y prime of 0 is 1.

51
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,340
It was given to us.

52
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,740
So if we take the Laplace
Transforms of both sides of

53
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,940
this equation, first we're
going to want to take the

54
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,950
Laplace Transform of this term
right there, which we've

55
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,700
really just done.

56
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,960
The Laplace Transform of the
second derivative is s squared

57
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,620
times the Laplace Transform of
the function, which we write

58
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,690
as capital Y of s, minus this,
minus 2s-- they gave us that

59
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,900
initial condition--
and then minus 1.

60
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,660
Right?

61
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,770
This term right here is
just 1, so minus 1.

62
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,560
So that's term right there.

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,490
Then we want to take
the Laplace

64
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,380
Transform of y by itself.

65
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,100
So this is just plus Y of
s, right, the Laplace

66
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,150
Transform of y.

67
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,110
So I'll just rewrite Laplace
Transform of y.

68
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm just rewriting it
in this notation.

69
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,200
Y of S.

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,230
It's good to get used
to either one.

71
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,060
This is going to be equal
to the Laplace

72
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,470
Transform of sine of 2t.

73
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,930
And I showed you in a video last
year that we showed what

74
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,740
the Laplace Transform of sine
of at is, but I'll write it

75
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,690
down here just so
you remember it.

76
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:49,170
Laplace Transform of the sine
of at is equal to a over s

77
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,325
squared plus a squared.

78
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:56,040
   

79
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,220
So the Laplace Transform
of sine of 2t.

80
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,380
Here, a is 2.

81
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,140
This is going to be 2 over
s squared plus 4.

82
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,080
So if we take the Laplace
Transform of both sides of

83
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,630
this, the right-hand side
is going to be 2 over s

84
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,589
squared plus 4.

85
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,390
Now what we can do is we can
separate out all the Y of s

86
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,240
terms. And so we can factor,
well I guess we could say,

87
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,270
factor out their coefficients,
so that's a Y of s term,

88
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,920
that's a Y of s term.

89
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,170
And so we could write the
left-hand side here as s

90
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,610
squared-- that's that term--
plus 1-- the coefficient on

91
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,685
that term-- s squared plus
1, times Y of s.

92
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:41,600
Let me do it in green.

93
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,450
So this is Y of s, and this Y
of s, times Y of s, and then

94
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,900
we have the non-Y of s terms.
These two right here.

95
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,770
So minus 2s, minus 1, is equal
to 2 over s squared plus 4.

96
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,490
We can add 2s plus 1 to both
sides, to essentially move

97
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:08,320
this to the right-hand side, and
we're left with s squared

98
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:20,390
plus 1, times Y of s, is equal
to 2 over s squared plus 4,

99
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,750
plus 2s, plus 1.

100
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,010
Now we can divide both sides of
this equation by s squared

101
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,630
plus 1, and we get the Laplace
Transform of Y.

102
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:39,130
Y of s is equal to-- let me
switch colors-- it's equal to

103
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:45,880
2 over s squared plus 4 times
this thing right here.

104
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,890
I'm dividing both sides of this
equation by this term

105
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,540
right there.

106
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,160
So times s squared plus 1-- it's
in the denominator so I'm

107
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,530
dividing by it-- plus 2s plus
1-- I have to divide both of

108
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,810
those terms by the s squared
plus 1-- divided by s squared

109
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,290
plus 1, divided by
s squared plus 1.

110
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,830
Now, in order to be able to
take the inverse Laplace

111
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,350
Transform of this, I need to get
it in some type of simple

112
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,310
fraction form.

113
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,070
These are actually easier to
do, but this was one's a

114
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,810
little bit difficult.

115
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,790
I want to do some partial
fraction decomposition to

116
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,380
break this up into maybe
simpler fractions.

117
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,120
So what I want to do, I'm going
to do a little bit of an

118
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,100
aside here.

119
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,890
And this really is the hardest
part of these problems. The

120
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,140
algebra, breaking
this thing up.

121
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,780
So I'm going to break this up.

122
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,940
So let me write this this way.

123
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:45,080
2 over s squared plus 4 times
s squared plus 1.

124
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,660
I'm going to break this
up into two fractions.

125
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,410
This is the partial fraction
decomposition.

126
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,660
One fraction is s
squared plus 4.

127
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,420
And the other fraction
is s squared plus 1.

128
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:02,110
And since both of these
denominators are of degree 2,

129
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,080
the numerators are going
to be of degree 1.

130
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,690
So they're going to be some--
let me write it this way--

131
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,630
this one will be As plus B.

132
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,520
And then this one will
be Cs plus D.

133
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,970
This is just pure algebra.

134
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,130
This is just partial fraction
decomposition.

135
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,320
I've made a couple
of videos on it.

136
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,760
And I'm saying that I'm assuming
that this expression

137
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,330
right here can be broken
up into two

138
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,790
expressions of this form.

139
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,860
And I need to solve for
A, B, C, and D.

140
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,940
So let's see how
we can do that.

141
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,310
So if I were to start with these
two and add them up,

142
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,470
what do I get?

143
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,820
I would have to multiply these
times-- so my denominator, my

144
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,040
common denominator, would be
this thing again-- it would be

145
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:53,530
s squared plus 4 times
s squared plus 1.

146
00:07:53,530 --> 00:08:00,180
And now I'm going to have to
multiply the As plus B times

147
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,623
this s squared plus 1.

148
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:05,040
   

149
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,870
This, as it is right now,
these two terms

150
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,420
would cancel out.

151
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,070
You'll just get this term,
but I need to add it

152
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,940
to this right here.

153
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:24,970
So you get plus Cs plus D
times s squared plus 4.

154
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,660
And now let's see what we could
do to match up the terms

155
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,810
here with this number
2 right here.

156
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,650
So let's multiply
all of this out.

157
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:39,780
So As times s squared
is As to the 3rd.

158
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,630
As times 1 is plus As.

159
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,620
B times s squared, so plus Bs
squared, and then you have B

160
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,690
times 1 is plus B.

161
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,525
And then you have Cs times s
squared, that's Cs to the 3rd.

162
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:58,130
   

163
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,025
And then Cs times 4,
so it's plus 4Cs.

164
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:05,130
   

165
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,240
These problems are tiring.

166
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,560
And I also have a cold, so this
is especially tiring, but

167
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,410
I'll soldier forward.

168
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,150
Where was I?

169
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,200
So I multiplied the C's times
each of these, now I have to

170
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,040
multiply the D's.

171
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,210
So plus Ds squared-- that's D
times that one-- plus D times

172
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,910
4, so plus 4D.

173
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,950
So that's all of them.

174
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,600
And I just wrote it this way
so I have the common degree

175
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,460
terms under each other.

176
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,140
So if I were to add the entire
numerator, I get-- and I'll

177
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:42,100
just switch colors, somewhat
arbitrarily-- I get A plus C

178
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,580
times s to the 3rd plus-- let
me write the s squared term

179
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,510
next-- plus B plus D times s
squared-- now I'll write this

180
00:09:51,510 --> 00:10:01,760
s term-- plus A plus 4C times
s plus B plus 4D.

181
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,870
This is just the numerator.

182
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,710
This is when I just added
these two things up.

183
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:10,300
This whole thing up here
simplifies to this.

184
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,030
I don't know if the word
simplify is appropriate.

185
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,730
But it becomes this expression
right here.

186
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,960
And that's just the numerator.

187
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,880
The denominator is still what
we had written before.

188
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,240
The denominator is still the s
squared plus 4, times the s

189
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,130
squared plus 1.

190
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,720
Of course, I have to show
that this is a fraction.

191
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,100
And this is going to be equal
to this thing over here.

192
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:39,030
2 over s squared plus 4 times
s squared plus 1.

193
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,380
Now, why did I go through this
whole mess right here?

194
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,110
Well, the reason why I went
through it is because we

195
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,100
should be able to solve
for A, B, C, and D.

196
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,600
So let's see, A plus C.

197
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,490
This is the coefficient
on the s cubed term.

198
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,850
Do we see any s cubed
terms here?

199
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,820
No, we see no s cubed
terms here.

200
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:02,180
So A plus C-- let me write this
down-- A plus C must be

201
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,900
equal to 0, because we
see nothing here that

202
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,990
has an s to the third.

203
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,690
B plus D is a coefficient
on the s squared term.

204
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,720
Do we see any s squared
terms here?

205
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,120
No, so B plus D must
be equal to 0.

206
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,350
   

207
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:23,260
A plus 4C are the coefficient
of the s term.

208
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,500
I see no s term over here.

209
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:35,310
So A plus 4C must also
be equal to 0.

210
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,000
And then finally, we look at
just the constant terms. And

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,930
we do have a constant term
on the left-hand

212
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,890
side of this equation.

213
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,040
We have 2.

214
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,700
so B plus 4D-- I didn't want to
make it that thick-- B plus

215
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,295
4D must be equal to 2.

216
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:58,380
   

217
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,420
This just seems like these
linear equations are pretty

218
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,720
easy to solve for.

219
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,150
Let's subtract this from this.

220
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,780
So A-- or let me subtract the
bottom one from the top one--

221
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,700
so A minus A, that's 0A.

222
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,290
And then C minus 4C minus
3C is equal to 0.

223
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,210
And so you get C
is equal to 0.

224
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,130
If C is equal to 0, A plus C
is equals to 0, A must be

225
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,810
equal to 0.

226
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,460
And let's do the same
thing here.

227
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,890
Let's subtract this from that.

228
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:35,610
So you get B minus B is 0, and
then minus 3D-- that's just D

229
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,900
minus 4D-- and then 0 minus
2 is equal to minus 2.

230
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:48,080
And then you get D is equal to--
what do we get?-- D is

231
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,080
equal to 2/3.

232
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,190
   

233
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,670
Minus 2 divided by minus 3 is
2/3, and then-- this isn't a

234
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,100
minus here, I wrote that there
later-- we said B plus D is

235
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,900
equal to 0.

236
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,370
So B must be the opposite
of D, right?

237
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,580
We could write B is equal
to minus D, or B is

238
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,150
equal to minus 2/3.

239
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,510
Let's remember all of this and
go back to our original

240
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,510
problem, because we've
kind of-- actually

241
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,660
let me just be clear.

242
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:26,110
We can rewrite 2 over s
squared plus 4 times s

243
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,150
squared plus 1.

244
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,750
We can rewrite this as, well,
A is 0, B is minus 2/3.

245
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:39,710
So this is equal to minus 2/3
over s squared plus 4.

246
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,450
And then C is 0, we
figured that out.

247
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,590
And then D is 2/3.

248
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:51,530
So plus 2/3 over s
squared plus 1.

249
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,300
So all of that work that I just
did, that was just to

250
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,890
break up this piece
right here.

251
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,640
That was just to break up
that piece right there.

252
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,320
And then, of course, we have
these other two pieces here

253
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,820
that we can't forget about.

254
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,550
So after all of this work,
what do we have?

255
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,470
And I'm going to make
sure I don't make a

256
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,390
careless mistake here.

257
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:14,390
We get the Laplace Transform
of Y-- as you can see, the

258
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:20,670
algebra is the hardest part
here-- is equal to this first

259
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,930
term-- I'm just going back--
this first term, which I've

260
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,880
now decomposed into this.

261
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,850
So it's minus-- let me write it
this way-- minus 1/3-- and

262
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,820
I think you're going to see in
a second why I'm writing this

263
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:45,270
way-- minus 1/3 times 2 over s
squared plus 4, and then plus

264
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:51,600
2/3 times 1 over s
squared plus 1.

265
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,400
And you're probably saying,
Sal, why are you

266
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,470
writing it this way?

267
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,250
Well you can already immediately
see that this is

268
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,030
the Laplace Transform
of sine of 2t.

269
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,530
This is the Laplace Transform
of sine of t.

270
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,750
So I wanted to write this 2
here, because this is 2, this

271
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,370
is 2 squared.

272
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,860
This is 1, this is 1 squared.

273
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,760
So I wanted to write
it in this form.

274
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,910
This was just the first term.

275
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,400
We have two more terms
to worry about.

276
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,770
I don't want to make
a careless mistake.

277
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,710
I have 2s over s
squared plus 1.

278
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,420
So let me write that down.

279
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:31,350
So plus 2 times s over s squared
plus 1, plus-- last

280
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,730
one-- plus 1 over s
squared plus 1.

281
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:42,050
   

282
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,670
Now we just take the inverse
Laplace Transform of the whole

283
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,330
thing, and then we'll
know what Y is.

284
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,810
   

285
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,080
So, you know, just to remember
the Laplace Transform.

286
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,345
So this is going to be
a little inverse.

287
00:15:57,345 --> 00:15:59,210
This is going to
be sine of 2t.

288
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,410
Let me just write, just so we
have it here, so you know I'm

289
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,090
not doing some type of voodoo.

290
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:09,210
The Laplace Transform of sine
of at is equal to a over s

291
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,220
squared plus a squared.

292
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,910
And the Laplace Transform of
cosine of at is equal to s

293
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,720
over s squared plus a squared.

294
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,540
Let's just remember those two
things when we take the

295
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,680
inverse Laplace Transform of
both sides of this equation.

296
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,140
The inverse Laplace Transform of
the Laplace Transform of y,

297
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,540
well that's just y.

298
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,010
y-- maybe I'll write it as a
function of t-- is equal to--

299
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,210
well this is the Laplace
Transform of sine of 2t.

300
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,730
You can just do some pattern
matching right here.

301
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,450
If a is equal to 2, then this
would be the Laplace Transform

302
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,520
of sine of 2t.

303
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:55,800
So it's minus 1/3 times sine of
2t plus 2/3 times-- this is

304
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,310
the Laplace Transform
of sine of t.

305
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,100
If you just make a is equal
to 1, sine of t's Laplace

306
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,440
Transform is 1 over
s squared plus 1.

307
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,140
So plus 2/3 times the sine of
t-- let me do the next one in

308
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,430
blue, just because it was
already written in blue-- plus

309
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,780
2 times-- this is the Laplace
Transform of cosine of t.

310
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,079
If you make a is equal to 1,
then the cosine t Laplace

311
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,140
Transform is s over
s squared plus 1.

312
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:27,980
So 2 times cosine of t-- and
then one last term-- plus--

313
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,150
this is just like this one over
here, this is just the

314
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,470
Laplace Transform of sine
of t-- plus sine of t.

315
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,570
And we're almost done.

316
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,270
We're essentially done, but
there's a little bit more

317
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,290
simplification we can do.

318
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,820
I have 2/3 times the sign of t
here, and then I have another

319
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,810
1 sine of t here, so I can
add the 2/3 to the 1.

320
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,610
What's 2/3 plus 1, or 3/3?

321
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,610
It's 5/3.

322
00:17:52,610 --> 00:18:01,270
So I can write y of t is equal
to minus 1/3 sine of 2t plus--

323
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,430
these two terms I'm just
going to add up--

324
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,720
plus 5/3 sine of t.

325
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,350
And then I have this last term
here, plus 2cosine of t.

326
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,950
So this was a hairy problem,
a lot of work.

327
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,340
And we saw that the hardest
part really was just the

328
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,700
partial fraction decomposition
that we did up here, not

329
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,110
making any careless mistakes.

330
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,900
But at the end, we got a pretty
neat answer that's not

331
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:33,060
too complicated, that satisfies
this non-homogenous

332
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,420
differential equation.

333
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,540
We were able to incorporate
the boundary

334
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,450
conditions as we did it.

335
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,185
Anyway, hopefully you found
that vaguely satisfying.

336
00:18:43,185 --> 00:18:45,770
This is a good warm-up
after a year of no

337
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,020
differential equations.

338
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,827
