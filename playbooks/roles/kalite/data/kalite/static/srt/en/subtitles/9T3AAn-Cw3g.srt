00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:08,063
Let's try to subtract 659 from 971. And as soon as you start trying to do it, you face a problem.

2
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:12,996
You go to the "ones" place, and you say "how am I going to subtract a 9 from a 1?

3
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:19,943
And the answer lies in regrouping! Taking value from one of the other places here, and giving it to the ones place.

4
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:25,262
And to understand that a little bit better, let me rewrite these two numbers... let me expand it out.

5
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:38,796
So this 9 is in the hundreds place, so it represents 900. The 7 is in the tens place, so it represents 7 tens, and this 1 is in the ones place, so it just represents 1.

6
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:54,129
And down here, this 6 represents 600. This 5 represents 5 tens, or 50, and this 9... well, still just represents 9 ones, or 9.

7
00:00:54,129 --> 00:01:00,026
And we're subtracting this. We are subtracting 600 plus 50 plus 9. Or another way of thinking about it...

8
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:05,725
We're subtracting 600, we're subtracting 50, we're subtracting 9.

9
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:10,330
So let's work it out over here. This is the exact same problem, just written a little bit differently.

10
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,965
And we still have the same issue. How do we subtract a larger number from a smaller number?

11
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:19,595
And the solution lies in trying to take value from one of the other places! And the easiest place to go is...

12
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:26,944
Look, we have 70 here, why don't we take 10 from here, (and we'll be left with 60) and give that 10 to the ones place.

13
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:30,193
So if you add 10 to 1, what do we have?

14
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:36,796
Well, then we're going to have 11. Notice, I have not changed the value of the number.

15
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:44,526
971 is the same thing as 900 plus 60 plus 11. It's still 971.

16
00:01:44,526 --> 00:02:01,067
And now we can actually subtract. 11 minus 9 is 2. 60 minus 50 is 10. And 900 minus 600 is 300.

17
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:07,730
So this subtraction should result in 300 plus 10 plus 2 which is 312.

18
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:13,026
Now, let's do the exact same thing here. But we're going to do it without expanding it out.

19
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:16,396
So... same issue. How do we subtract a 9 from a 1?

20
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:24,193
Well let's take a 10 from the tens place... we're going to regroup. So we're going to get rid of one of these 10s. We're going to only have 6 tens in the tens place...

21
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:28,730
And we're going to give that 10 to the ones place. So... 10 plus 1 is...

22
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:40,128
11. Now we are ready to subtract. 11 minus 9 is 2. 6 minus 5 is 1, 9 minus 6 is 3.

23
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:44,128
We get (let me do that same color), we get 312.
