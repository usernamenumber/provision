1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,440
We're now ready to solve
non-homogeneous second-order

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,440
linear differential equations
with constant coefficients.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,870
So what does all that mean?

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,870
Well, it means an equation
that looks like this.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,760
A times the second derivative
plus B times the first

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,990
derivative plus C times the
function is equal to g of x.

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,390
Before I show you an actual
example, I want to show you

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,310
something interesting.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,630
That the general solution of
this non-homogeneous equation

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,770
is actually the general solution
of the homogeneous

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,030
equation plus a particular
solution.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,920
I'll explain what that
means in a second.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,340
So let's say that h
is a solution of

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,425
the homogeneous equation.

16
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:47,950
   

17
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,790
And that worked out well,
because, h for homogeneous.

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,593
h is solution for homogeneous.

19
00:00:53,593 --> 00:00:59,370
   

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,320
There should be some shorthand
notation for homogeneous.

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,129
   

22
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,880
So what does that mean?

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,700
That means that A times the
second derivative of h plus B

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,670
times h prime plus C times
h is equal to 0.

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,980
That's what I mean when I say
that h is a solution-- and

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,570
actually, let's just say that h
is the general solution for

27
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,190
this homogeneous equation.

28
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,790
And we know how to solve that.

29
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,000
Take the characteristic equation
depending on how many

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,030
roots it has and whether they're
real or complex.

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,310
You can figure out a
general solution.

32
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,190
And then if you have initial
conditions, you can substitute

33
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,940
them and get the values
of the constants.

34
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,970
Fair enough.

35
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,060
Now let's say that I were to
say that g is a solution.

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,450
Well no, I already
used g up here.

37
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,770
Well, I don't like
using vowels.

38
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,930
Let's say j.

39
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,860
Let's say j is a particular
solution to this

40
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,790
differential equation.

41
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,520
So what does that mean?

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,585
That means that A times j prime
prime plus B times j

43
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:09,410
prime plus C times j
is equal to g of x.

44
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:09,789
Right?

45
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:20,150
So we're just defining j of x
to be a particular solution.

46
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,180
   

47
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:32,150
Now what I want to show you is
that j of x plus h of x is

48
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,820
also going to be a solution
to this original equation.

49
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,730
And that it's the general
solution for this

50
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,040
non-homogeneous equation.

51
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,800
And before I just do it

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,380
mathematically, what's the intuition?

53
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,200
Well, when you substitute
h here, you get 0.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,340
When you substitute j here,
you get g of x.

55
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,300
So when you add them together,
you're going to get

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,950
0 plus g of x here.

57
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,930
So you're going to
get g of x here.

58
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,120
And I'll show you
that right now.

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,350
So let's say I wanted to
substitute h plus j here.

60
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,985
And I'll do it in a
different color.

61
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:06,460
A-- so the second derivative
of the sum of those two

62
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,520
functions is going to be the
second derivative of both of

63
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:16,090
them summed up-- plus B times
the first derivative of the

64
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,490
sum plus C times the sum
of the functions.

65
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,510
   

66
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,970
And my goal is to show that
this is equal to g of x.

67
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,600
So what is this simplified to?

68
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,990
Well if we take all the h terms,
we get Ah prime prime

69
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:39,978
plus Bh prime plus Ch plus,
let's do all the j terms. Aj

70
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:48,800
prime prime plus Bj
prime plus Cj.

71
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,710
Well by definition of how
we defined h and j, what

72
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,260
is this equal to?

73
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,360
We said that h is a solution for
the homogeneous equation,

74
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,610
or that this expression
is equal to 0.

75
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,820
So that equals 0.

76
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,910
And by our definition for
j, what does this equal?

77
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,210
We said j is a particular
solution for the

78
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,830
non-homogeneous equation, or
that this expression is

79
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,080
equal to g of x.

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,010
   

81
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,680
So when you substitute h plus
j into this differential

82
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,600
equation on the left-hand
side.

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,740
On the right-hand side, true
enough, you get g of x.

84
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,190
So we've just shown that if you
define h and j this way,

85
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:38,380
that the function, we'll call
it k of x is equal to h of x

86
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,490
plus j of x.

87
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,390
I'm running out of space.

88
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,290
That is the general solution.

89
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,830
I haven't proven that is the
most general solution, but I

90
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,630
think you have the
intuition, right?

91
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,150
Because the general solution
on the homogeneous one that

92
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,950
was the most general solution,
and now we're adding a

93
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,240
particular solution that gets
you the g of x on the

94
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,620
right-hand side.

95
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,830
That might be very confusing to
you, so let's actually try

96
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,470
to do it with some
real numbers.

97
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,190
And I think it'll make
a lot more sense.

98
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,100
Let's say we have the
differential equations-- and

99
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,970
I'm going to teach you a
technique now for figuring out

100
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,690
that j in that last example.

101
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,500
So how do you figure out that
particular solution?

102
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,840
Let's say I have the
differential equation the

103
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,910
second derivative of y minus 3
times the first derivative

104
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,860
minus 4 times y is equal
to 3e to the 2x.

105
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,680
   

106
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,260
So, the first step is we want
the general solution of the

107
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,660
homogeneous equation.

108
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,620
And in that example I just
did, that would have

109
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,250
been our h of x.

110
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,310
So we want the solution of y
prime prime minus 3y prime

111
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,850
minus 4y is equal to 0.

112
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,060
Take the characteristic
equation.

113
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,030
This 4 is equal to 0.

114
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:02,950
r minus 4 times r plus
1 is equal to 0.

115
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:08,760
2 roots, r could be
4 or negative 1.

116
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,610
And so our general solution--
I'll call that h.

117
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,520
Well, let's call
that y general.

118
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,060
y sub g.

119
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,440
So our general solution is equal
to-- and we've done this

120
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,810
many times-- C1 e to the 4x
plus C2 e to the minus

121
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,660
1x, or minus x.

122
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,640
Fair enough.

123
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,210
So we solved the homogeneous
equation.

124
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,260
So how do we get, in that last
example, a j of x that will

125
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,820
give us a particular
solution, so on the

126
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,030
right-hand side we get this.

127
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,370
Well here we just have to
think a little bit.

128
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,320
And this method is called The
Method of Undetermined

129
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,900
Coefficients.

130
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,260
And you have to say, well, if
I want some function where I

131
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,510
take a second derivative and
add that or subtracted some

132
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,610
multiple of its first derivative
minus some multiple

133
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,670
of the function, I
get e to the 2x.

134
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,890
That function and its
derivatives and its second

135
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,860
derivatives must be something
of the form, something

136
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,550
times e to the 2x.

137
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,840
So essentially we
take a guess.

138
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,770
We say well what does it look
like when we take the various

139
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,270
derivatives and the functions
and we multiply multiples of

140
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,410
it plus each other?

141
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,170
And all of that.

142
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,230
We would get e the to 2x or some
multiple of e to the 2x.

143
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,970
Well, a good guess could just be
that j-- well I'll call it

144
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,460
y particular.

145
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,100
Our particular solution here
could be that-- and particular

146
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,170
solution I'm using a little
different than the particular

147
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,510
solution when we had
initial conditions.

148
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,400
Here we can view this as
a particular solution.

149
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,680
A solution that gives us this
on the right-hand side.

150
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,450
So let's say that the one I pick
is some constant A times

151
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,526
e to the 2x.

152
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:56,100
If that's my guess, then the
derivative of that is equal to

153
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,450
2Ae the to 2x.

154
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,490
And the second derivative of
that, of my particular

155
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,310
solution, is equal
to 4Ae to the 2x.

156
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,440
And now I can substitute in
here, and let's see if I can

157
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,740
solve for A, and then I'll have
my particular solution.

158
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,030
So the second derivitive,
that's this.

159
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:21,660
So I get 4Ae to the 2x minus 3
times the first derivitive.

160
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,760
So minus 3 times this.

161
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:30,550
So that's minus 6Ae to the 2x
minus 4 times the function.

162
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,750
So minus 4Ae to the 2x, and
all of that is going to be

163
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,929
equal to 3e to the 2x.

164
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,140
Well we know e to the 2x equal
0, so we can divide

165
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,150
both sides by that.

166
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,120
Just factor it out, really.

167
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,970
Get rid of all of the
e's to the 2x.

168
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,340
On the left-hand side, we
have 4A and a minus 4A.

169
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,300
Well, those cancel out.

170
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,540
And then lo and behold, we have
minus 6A is equal to 3.

171
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,400
Divide both sides by 6 and get
A is equal to minus 1/2.

172
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,940
So there.

173
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,330
We have our particular
solution.

174
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:11,710
It is equal to minus
1/2 e to the 2x.

175
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,640
And now, like I just showed
you before I cleared the

176
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,390
screen, our general solution
of this non-homogeneous

177
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,650
equation is going to be our
particular solution plus the

178
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,790
general solution to the
homogeneous equation.

179
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,170
So we can call this
the most general

180
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,770
solution-- I don't know.

181
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,360
I'll just call it y.

182
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:41,230
It is our general solution C1e
to the 4x plus C2e to the

183
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,300
minus x plus our particular
solution we found.

184
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:51,840
So that's minus 1/2e
to the 2x.

185
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,300
Pretty neat.

186
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,780
Anyway, I'll do a couple
more examples of this.

187
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,790
And I think you'll get
the hang of it.

188
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,560
In the next examples, we'll do
something other than an e to

189
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,260
the 2x or an e function here.

190
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,750
We'll try to do stuff with
polynomials and trig

191
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,860
functions as well.

192
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,440
I'll see you in the
next video.

193
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,400
