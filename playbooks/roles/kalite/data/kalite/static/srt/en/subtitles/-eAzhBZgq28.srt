1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,650
Let's say we have some function,
f, and it's a

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,015
mapping from the set X to Y.

4
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:14,520
So if I were to draw the set X
right there, that's my set X.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,640
If I were to draw the set
Y, just like that.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,740
We know, and I've done this
several videos ago, that a

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,400
function just associates any
member of our set X-- so I

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,960
have some member of my set
X there-- if I apply the

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,240
function to it, or if we're
dealing with vectors, we can

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,620
imagine instead of using the
word function, we would use

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,730
the word transformation.

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,880
But it's the same thing.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,550
We would associate with this
element, or this member of X,

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,040
a member of Y.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,120
So that's why we call
it a mapping.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,010
When I apply this function--
I'll do it in a different

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:57,850
color-- this little member of
X is associated with this

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,720
member of Y.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,790
If this is right here,
this is a capital X.

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,360
   

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,370
Let's say we call this a,
and let's call that b.

22
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:15,840
We would say that the function
where a is a member of X and b

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,860
is a member of Y, we would say
that f of a is equal to b.

24
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,170
This is all a review of
everything that we've learned

25
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,870
already about functions.

26
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,580
Now I'm going to
define a couple

27
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,610
of interesting functions.

28
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,650
The first one-- I guess it's
really just one function, I

29
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,030
said it's a couple-- but I'll
call it the identity function.

30
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:42,330
   

31
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,150
This is a function.

32
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,960
I'll just call it
a big capital I.

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,150
This identity function
operates on some set.

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,490
So let's say this is the
identity function on set X,

35
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,150
and it's a mapping
from X to X.

36
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,840
What's interesting about the
identity function is that if

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,286
you give it some a that is a
member of X-- so lets say you

38
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:05,980
give it that a-- the identity
function applied to that

39
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,110
member of X, the identity
function of a, is going to be

40
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,090
equal to a.

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,760
So it literally just maps
things back to itself.

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,430
So the identity function, if I
were draw it on this diagram

43
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,500
right here, would
look like this.

44
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,440
It would look like-- we pick a
nice suitable color-- it would

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,090
look like this.

46
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,910
It would just kind
of be a circle.

47
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,500
It just points back
at the point that

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,290
you started off with.

49
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,150
It associates all points
with themselves.

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,150
That's the identity function on
X, especially as it applies

51
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,790
to the point a.

52
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,300
If you apply it to some other
point in X, it would just

53
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,940
refer back to itself.

54
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,590
That's the identity
function on X.

55
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,590
You could also have an identity
function on Y.

56
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,180
So let's say that b
is a member of Y.

57
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,340
So I drew b right there.

58
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,300
Then the Y identity function--
so this would be that identity

59
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,600
function on Y applied
to b-- would just

60
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,855
refer back to itself.

61
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:05,450
   

62
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,850
So that would be equal to b.

63
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,600
This is the identity
function on Y.

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,150
So you might say, hey
Sal, these are

65
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,080
kind of silly functions.

66
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,910
But we'll use them.

67
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,010
They're actually at least a
useful notation to use as we

68
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,080
progress through our

69
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,570
explorations of linear algebra.

70
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,440
But I'm going to make
a new definition.

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,150
I'm going to say that a
function-- let me pick a nice

72
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,650
color, pink-- I'm going to say
that a function, let me say f

73
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,800
since we already established
it right over here.

74
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:45,360
I'm going to say that f is
invertible, introducing some

75
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,270
new terminology.

76
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,883
f is invertible if and only
if the following is true.

77
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:54,100
   

78
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,950
I could either write it with
these two-way arrows like

79
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,890
that, or I could write it
as iff with two f's.

80
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,770
That means that if this is true,
then this is true, and

81
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,080
only if this is true.

82
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,560
So this implies that, and
that implies this.

83
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,290
So f is invertible-- I'm kind
of making a definition right

84
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:23,080
here-- if and only if there
exists a function, I'll call

85
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,650
it nothing just yet.

86
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,710
I'll call it something
in a second.

87
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,420
I'll write it as this f
with this negative 1

88
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,020
superscript on it.

89
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,000
So f is invertible if and only
if there exists a function f

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,430
inverse-- well I guess I just
called it something.

91
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,750
   

92
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,000
Let me do that in purple.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,700
   

94
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,860
Remember f is just a mapping
from X to Y.

95
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,480
So this function, f inverse,
is going to be a

96
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,760
mapping from Y to X.

97
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,560
So I'm saying that f is
invertible if there exists a

98
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,870
function, f inverse, that's a
mapping from Y to X such that

99
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:18,860
if I take the composition of f
inverse with f, this is equal

100
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:25,080
to the identity function
over X.

101
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,730
So let's think about
what's happening.

102
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,720
This is just part
of it actually.

103
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,690
Let me just complete the
whole definition.

104
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:41,950
This is true, this has to be
true, and the composition of f

105
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,400
with the inverse function has
to be equal to the identity

106
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,300
function over Y.

107
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,270
So let's just think about
what's this saying.

108
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,060
There's some function-- I'll
call it right now, this called

109
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:06,500
the inverse of f-- and it's
a mapping from Y to X.

110
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,850
Let me draw it up here.

111
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,680
So f is a mapping from X to Y.

112
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,260
We showed that.

113
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,570
This is the mapping
of f right there.

114
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,020
It goes in that direction.

115
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,650
We're saying there has be some
other function, f inverse,

116
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,390
that's a mapping from Y to X.

117
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,370
So let's write it here.

118
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:28,150
So f inverse is a mapping from Y
to X. f inverse, if you give

119
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,340
me some value in set
Y, I go to set X.

120
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,660
So this guy's domain is this
guy's codomain, and this guy's

121
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,970
codomain is this guy's domain.

122
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,480
Fair enough.

123
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,770
But let's see what
it's saying.

124
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,040
It's saying that the composition
of f inverse with

125
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,510
f, has to be equal to
the identity matrix.

126
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:52,490
So essentially it's saying if I
apply f to some value in X--

127
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,050
right, if you think about
what's this composition

128
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,130
doing-- this guy's going
from X to Y.

129
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,050
This guy goes from Y to X.

130
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,690
So let's think about what's
happening here.

131
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,266
   

132
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:10,340
f is going from X to Y.

133
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,090
Then f inverse is going
from Y to X.

134
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,770
So this composition is going to
be a mapping from X to X,

135
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,660
which the identity function
needs to do.

136
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,730
It needs to go from X to X.

137
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,220
They're saying this equals
the identity function.

138
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,670
So that means when you apply f
on some value in our domain,

139
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,750
so you go here, and then you
apply f inverse to that point

140
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,160
over there, you go back to
this original point.

141
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,700
So another way of saying this
is that f-- let me do it in

142
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,980
another color-- the composition
of f inverse with

143
00:07:50,980 --> 00:08:01,650
f of some member of the set
X is equal to the identity

144
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,050
function applied on that item.

145
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,220
These two statements
are equivalent.

146
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,920
So by definition, this
thing is going to be

147
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,310
your original thing.

148
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,380
Or another way of writing this
is that f inverse applied to f

149
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,370
of a is going to
be equal to a.

150
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,050
That's what this first
statement tells us.

151
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,680
If you think of it visually,
it's saying you start with an

152
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,050
a, you apply f to it, and you
get this value right here.

153
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,520
That is f of a.

154
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,620
I'm saying it equals b, or I
said it equalled b earlier on.

155
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,130
Then if you apply this f
inverse-- and it doesn't

156
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,640
always exist-- but if you apply
that f inverse to this

157
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,179
function, it needs to
go back to this.

158
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:46,755
By definition it needs to go
back to your original a.

159
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:49,650
It has to be equivalent to just
doing this little closed

160
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,800
loop right when I introduce you
to the identity function.

161
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,080
Now that's what this statement
is telling us right here.

162
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,940
The second statement is saying
look, if I apply f to f

163
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,640
inverse, I'm getting the
identity function on Y.

164
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:10,140
So if I start at some point in
Y right there, and I apply f

165
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:16,880
inverse first, maybe
I go right here.

166
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,400
Let's call that lowercase y So
this would be f inverse of

167
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,910
lowercase y.

168
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,380
Then if I were to apply f to
that-- I know this chart is

169
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,690
getting very confusing-- if I
apply f to this right here, I

170
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,870
need to go right back
to my original Y.

171
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,010
So when I apply f to f inverse
of Y this has to be equivalent

172
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,900
of just doing the identity
function on y.

173
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,490
So that's what the second
statement is saying.

174
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:51,130
Or another way to write it is
that f of f inverse of y,

175
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,400
where y is a member of the
set capital Y, it has

176
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,750
to be equal to Y.

177
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,790
You've been exposed to the idea
of an inverse before.

178
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,150
We're just doing it a little
bit more precisely because

179
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,200
we're going to start dealing
with these notions with

180
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,380
transformations and matrices
in the very near future.

181
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,670
So it's good to be exposed to it
in this more precise form.

182
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:18,230
Now the first thing you might
ask is let's say that I have a

183
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:25,450
function f, and there does exist
a function f inverse

184
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,850
that satisfies these
two requirements.

185
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,100
So f is invertible.

186
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,040
   

187
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,300
The obvious question, or maybe
it's not an obvious question

188
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:45,100
is, is f inverse unique?

189
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,790
Actually probably the obvious
question is how do you know

190
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,780
when something's invertible.

191
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,600
We're going to talk a
lot about that in

192
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,530
the very near future.

193
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,460
But let's say we know that
f is invertible.

194
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,080
How do we know, or do we know
whether f inverse is unique?

195
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,960
To answer that question, let's
assume it's not unique.

196
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,500
So if it's not unique, let's say
that there's two functions

197
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,930
that satisfy our two constraints
that can act as

198
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,850
inverse functions of f.

199
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,130
Let's say that g
is one of them.

200
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,430
So let's say g is a mapping.

201
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,330
Remember f is a mapping
from X to Y.

202
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:27,850
Let's say that g is a mapping
from Y to X such that if I

203
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:36,230
apply f to something and then
apply g to it-- so this gets

204
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,850
me from X to Y.

205
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,980
Then when I do the composition
with g, that gets

206
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,480
me back into X.

207
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,560
This is equivalent to the
identity function.

208
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,430
This was part of the definition
of what it means to

209
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,680
be an inverse.

210
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,810
   

211
00:11:53,810 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm assuming that g is
an inverse of f.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,370
This assumption implies
these two things.

213
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,010
   

214
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:15,370
Now let's say that h is
another inverse of f.

215
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:21,560
   

216
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,160
By definition, by what I just
called an inverse, h has to

217
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,285
satisfy two requirements.

218
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:28,760
It has to be a mapping
from Y to X.

219
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,730
Then if I take the composition
of h with f, I have to get the

220
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,940
identity matrix on the set X.

221
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,510
Now that wasn't just part
of the definition.

222
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,160
It implies even more
than that.

223
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,490
If something is an inverse, it
has to satisfy both of these.

224
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,430
The composition of the inverse
with the function has to

225
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,610
become the identity
matrix on x.

226
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,610
Then the composition of the
function with the inverse has

227
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,610
to be the identity
function on Y.

228
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,050
Let's write that.

229
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,240
So g is an inverse of f.

230
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,340
It implies this.

231
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,670
It also implies-- I'll do
it in yellow-- that the

232
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,470
composition of f with
g is equal to the

233
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,630
identity function on y.

234
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,560
Then if we do it with h, the
fact that h is an inverse of f

235
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,180
implies that the composition
of f with h is equal to the

236
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,210
identity function
on y as well.

237
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,490
Let me redraw what I drew in the
beginning just so we know

238
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,070
what we're doing.

239
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,890
So if this is a set X right
here-- let me do it in a

240
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:36,780
different color-- let's say this
right here is the set Y.

241
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,640
We know that f is a
mapping X to Y.

242
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,130
   

243
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,390
What we're trying to determine
is is f's inverse unique.

244
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,440
So any inverse, so we're saying
that g is a situation

245
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,960
that if you take the composition
of g with f, you

246
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,130
get the identity matrix.

247
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,530
So f does that.

248
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,750
If you could take g
you're going to go

249
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,020
back to the same point.

250
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,450
So it's equivalent.

251
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,830
So taking the composition of g
with f-- that means doing f

252
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:10,670
first then g-- this is the
equivalent of just taking the

253
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,430
identity function in X, so just
taking an X and going

254
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,360
back to an X.

255
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,210
It's equivalent to that.

256
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,250
So this is g right here.

257
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,430
The same thing is true with h.

258
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,960
h should also be.

259
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,590
If I start with some element in
X and go into Y, and then

260
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:31,660
apply h, it should also be
equivalent to the identity

261
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,400
transformation.

262
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,000
That's what this statement and
this statement are saying.

263
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,580
Now this statement is saying
that if I start with some

264
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,620
entry in Y here and I apply g,
which is the inverse of f, I'm

265
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,210
going to go here.

266
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,340
So g will take me there.

267
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:57,700
When I apply f then to that, I'm
going to go back to that

268
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,560
same element of Y.

269
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,970
That's equivalent to
just doing the

270
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,930
identity function on Y.

271
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,520
That's the same thing as the
identity function of Y.

272
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,140
I could do the same
thing here with h.

273
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,410
I just take a point here, apply
h, then apply f back.

274
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,360
I should just go back
to that point.

275
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,980
That's all of what
this is saying.

276
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,570
So let's go back to
the question of

277
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,330
whether g is unique.

278
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,680
Can we have two different
inverse functions g and h?

279
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,660
So let's start with g.

280
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,240
Remember g is just a mapping
from Y to X.

281
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,130
So this is going to be equal to,
this is the same thing as

282
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,460
the composition of the identity

283
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,220
function over x with g.

284
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,180
To show you why that's the case,
remember g just goes

285
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,130
from-- these diagrams get me
confused very quickly-- so

286
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,670
let's say this is
x and this is y.

287
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,130
Remember g is a mapping
from y to x.

288
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,220
So g will take us there.

289
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,090
There's a mapping from y to x.

290
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,060
I'm saying that this g is
equivalent to the identity

291
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,540
mapping, or the identity
function in

292
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,420
composition with this.

293
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,020
Because all this is saying is
you apply g, and then you

294
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,440
apply the identity
mapping on x.

295
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,270
So obviously you're going to get
to the exact same mapping

296
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,920
or the exact same point.

297
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,390
So these are equivalent.

298
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,020
But what is another
way of writing the

299
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,840
identity mapping on x?

300
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,010
What's another way
of writing that?

301
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,310
Well by definition, if
h is another inverse

302
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,440
of f, this is true.

303
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,010
So I can replace this in this
expression with a composition

304
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,500
of h with f.

305
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,680
So this is going to be equal to
the composition of h with

306
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,770
f, and the composition
of that with g.

307
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,850
You might want to put
parentheses here.

308
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,490
I'll do it very lightly.

309
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,110
You might want to put
parentheses there.

310
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,450
But I showed you a couple
of videos ago that the

311
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,610
composition of functions, or
of transformations, is

312
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,330
associative.

313
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,430
It doesn't matter if you put
the parentheses there or if

314
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,250
you put the parentheses there.

315
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,070
Actually I'll do that.

316
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,160
I'll put the parentheses there
at first just so you can

317
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,990
understand that this
is the same thing

318
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,190
as that right there.

319
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,440
But we know that composition
is associative.

320
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,849
So this is equal to the
composition of h with the

321
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,920
composition of f and g.

322
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,470
Now what is this equal to, the
composition of f and g?

323
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,109
Well it's equal to, by
definition, it's equal to the

324
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,695
identity transformation
over y.

325
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:31,500
So this is equal to h composed
with, or the composition of h

326
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,260
with, the identity function over
y with this right here.

327
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,020
Now what is this going to be?

328
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,010
Remember h is a mapping
from y to x.

329
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,830
Let me redraw it.

330
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,505
So that's my x and
that is my y.

331
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:50,680
h could take some element
in y and gives me

332
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,930
some element in x.

333
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,450
   

334
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,400
If I take the composition of the
identity in y-- so that's

335
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,270
essentially I take some element,
let me do it this

336
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,410
way-- I take some element in
y, I apply the identity

337
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,930
function, which essentially
just gives me that element

338
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,940
again, and then I
apply h to that.

339
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,720
That's the same thing as just
applying h to the function to

340
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,690
begin with.

341
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,360
So just going through this
little exercise we've shown,

342
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,510
even though we started off
saying I have these two

343
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,690
different inverses, we've
just shown that g

344
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,970
must be equal to h.

345
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,770
So any function has
a unique inverse.

346
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,030
You can't set up two
different inverses.

347
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,180
If you do you'll find that
they're always going to be

348
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,170
equal to each other.

349
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,310
So far we know what
an inverse is.

350
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,350
We don't know what causes
someone to be able to have an

351
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,660
inverse or not, but we know if
they have an inverse, how to

352
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,910
think about it.

353
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,010
   

354
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,730
We also know that that
inverse is unique.

355
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:52,991
