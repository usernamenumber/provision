1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,450
All right.

3
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,730
We're now on problem number
5, on page 408.

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,440
And they have this little
drawing here, and it says, on

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,350
the disk shown above, a player
spins the arrow, this little

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,660
blue arrow.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,430
A player spins the
arrow twice.

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:25,010
The fraction a/b is formed,
where a is the number of the

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:34,760
sector where the arrow stopped
after the first spin, and b is

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,600
a number of the sector where
the arrow stopped after the

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,850
second spin.

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,750
   

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,070
On every spin, each of the
numbered sectors has an equal

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,010
probability of being
the sector on

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,350
which the arrow stops.

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,780
What is the probability that
the fraction a/b is

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,410
greater than 1?

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,330
So they want to know the
probability that a/b is

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,850
greater than 1.

20
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,420
Well, the first thing you need
to realize is, this is just a

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,020
random number generator.

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,720
The probability that any number
between 1 and 6 is

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,820
equal, so this could just be
a roll of a six sided die.

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,820
And saying well, if I roll a
six sided die twice, what's

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,110
the probability that the first
roll is going to be larger

26
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,150
than the second roll, right?

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,060
Because in order for this
fraction to be greater than 1,

28
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,820
the numerator has to
be greater than the

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,510
denominator, right?

30
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,700
Or, you could just take a/b is
greater than 1, and multiply

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,626
both sides by b.

32
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:38,650
And that's the same thing as
the probability that a is

33
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,460
greater than b.

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,120
So we can set up a little table
and we could say, well,

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,800
what's the probability of
getting each of these numbers

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,840
on the first roll?

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,160
And then given that probability,
or given that you

38
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,640
got, let's say, a 2 on the first
roll, what are the odds

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,090
that the second roll is going
to be less than the first

40
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,190
roll, right?

41
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:12,610
So let's say spin, call this
a spin, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

42
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,525
What's the probability of
getting each of these spins?

43
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:25,610
   

44
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,210
I'm just making up
notation as I go.

45
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,390
But, hopefully this is
making sense to you.

46
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,550
So the probability of
getting any one of

47
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,890
these is 1/6, right?

48
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,700
   

49
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,810
They all have an equal
probability of happening.

50
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,560
1/6.

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:52,876
Now, given each of these, what's
the probability that

52
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:59,170
soon. your second spin is going
to be less than the

53
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,500
first spin?

54
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,830
This is the second spin, b.

55
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,290
Actually let's put an a here.

56
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,000
The probability of a.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,720
That'll probably make
more sense to you.

58
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,990
And then we want to know the
probably that the second spin,

59
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,080
b, is less than a.

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,690
Well, if I got a 1 the first
time, what's the probability

61
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,980
that I get a number less
than 1 out of these?

62
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,310
Well, is there any number
less than 1?

63
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,650
There's 1, but that's not
even less than 1.

64
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,700
That's equal to 1, so there's a
0 chance that I get a number

65
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,610
less than 1, right?

66
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,670
Because there is no number less
than 1 that I can get.

67
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,320
If I got a 2, well there's only
one number less than 1

68
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,310
out of the six, right?

69
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,470
That's 1.

70
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,720
So there's a 1/6 chance.

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,190
   

72
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,110
A 3.

73
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,610
If I got a 3 on the first spin,
I can only get a 1 or 2

74
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,200
on the second spin, right?

75
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,470
So that's a 2/6 chance.

76
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,440
2/6.

77
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,600
If I got a 4, I could
get a 1, 2, or 3.

78
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,530
That's a 3/6.

79
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,500
I think you see the
pattern here.

80
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,360
There's a 4/6 chance of getting
something less than 5.

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,570
And there's a 5/6 chance of
getting something less than 6.

82
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:13,230
And so, what's the combined
probability now for each of

83
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:13,860
the scenarios?

84
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,410
So what is the probability that
I get a 1, and then I get

85
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,950
something less than 1?

86
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,220
Well, you just have to multiply
these probabilities.

87
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,530
So that's a 0.

88
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,590
What's the probability that I
get a 2, and then something

89
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,170
less than 2?

90
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:33,045
It's 1/6 times 1/6
which is 1/36.

91
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:34,960
The probability that
I get a 3, and then

92
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,760
something less than 3?

93
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Multiply them.

94
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,350
It's 2/36.

95
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,230
I think you see the pattern
here again.

96
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:48,210
3/36, 4/36, and then 5/36.

97
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,670
5/36 is the probability
to get a 6, and then

98
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,450
something less than a 6.

99
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,760
So in general, the probability
that I get my first spin is

100
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,990
greater than my second spin is
going to be the sum of these

101
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,910
probabilities, right?

102
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,610
Because any one of these
scenarios would satisfy a

103
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,500
being greater than b.

104
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,830
So I just add up these
probabilities.

105
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,780
So the denominator for
all of them is 36.

106
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,220
It says 0/36, right?

107
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:25,620
So it's essentially 1 plus
2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5.

108
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,530
Now let me add carefully
because this is where I

109
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,460
historically mess up my
problems. 1 plus 2 is 3.

110
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,770
3 plus 3 is 6.

111
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,990
6 plus 4 is 10.

112
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,510
10 plus 5 is 15.

113
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,990
So that equals 15/36.

114
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,360
And that is choice you a.

115
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,890
   

116
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,440
Move on to the next problem.

117
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,900
   

118
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,160
We're on problem number 6.

119
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,670
Which of the following tables
shows a relationship in which

120
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,350
w is proportional to x?

121
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,190
All right, so let's just
write them all out.

122
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:22,180
So choice a, if we have wx, so
they have 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5.

123
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,250
So w is proportional to x.

124
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,190
Well, that also means that
x is going to be

125
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,200
proportional to w, right?

126
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,400
So in this case x is 3 times.

127
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,750
So here we have times 3.

128
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,350
0, 3.

129
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,950
Here we have times 2 and
here we have times 5/3.

130
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,000
So we're multiplying by a
different factor every time.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,960
So w is not proportional
to x and x is not

132
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,630
proportional to w.

133
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,020
I'm just trying to figure out
what do I have to multiply w

134
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,920
by to get x?

135
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,810
What would I have to multiply
x by to get w?

136
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,730
They all have to be the same
in order for these two

137
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,810
variables to be proportional.

138
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,450
So choice a is not right.

139
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,450
Choice b.

140
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,710
w, x, 3/9.

141
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,270
   

142
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:14,120
Let's see what I'm doing,
3, 9, 4, 16, 5, 25.

143
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,130
It looks like, in every scenario
here, we squared w to

144
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,430
get x or w is the square
root of x.

145
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,720
But they're not proportional
because here we

146
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,610
multiplied by 3.

147
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,500
Here we multiplied by 4, and
here we multiplied by 5.

148
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,400
So once again, it's not
going to be choice b.

149
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:30,840
c.

150
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,910
I will change colors
for variety.

151
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,060
I changed it to brown.

152
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:46,150
C w, x, 5, 10, so I
multiplied by 2.

153
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,740
This is what I'm
multiplying by.

154
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,080
It's not 10 times 2.

155
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,120
6 to 18, I multiplied by 3.

156
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,290
I already know this
is wrong, right?

157
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,190
I multiplied by two
different factors.

158
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,570
It's not choice c.

159
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,300
Choice d.

160
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,080
w.

161
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,030
I did one of the later choices,
just to make sure we

162
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,280
do a lot of work.

163
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,510
Choice d is 7 to 21.

164
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,480
I multiplied by 3 to do that.

165
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,030
8 to 24, times 3.

166
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,350
Looks good so far.

167
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,860
9 to 27, multiplied by 3

168
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,500
So, in every case, I multiplied
by the same factor.

169
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,290
So w is proportionate to x and
x is proportionate to w.

170
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,340
So d is our choice.

171
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,409
I will see you in
the next video.

172
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,763
And we don't have to worry about
e because we know that d

173
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:36,659
is our choice.

174
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,080
I'll see

175
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,333
