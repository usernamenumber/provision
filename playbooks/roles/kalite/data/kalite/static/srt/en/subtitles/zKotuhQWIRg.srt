1
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:04,644
Solve for x: we 8 time the quantity 3x + 10

2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:08,959
is equal to 28x - 14 - 4x

3
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:11,041
Like every equation we've done so far,

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,164
we just want to isolate all the x's on one side of this equation.

5
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:17,355
But before we do that, we can actually simplify each of these sides.

6
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:21,246
The left hand side: we can multiply the quantity 3x + 10 times 8

7
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:24,305
so we're essentially just distributing the 8

8
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:25,533
(distributive property right here)

9
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:29,718
So this is the same thing as 8 times 3x which is 24x

10
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:34,625
plus 8 times 10 which is 80 is equal to

11
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,075
and over here we have 28x - 14 - 4x

12
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:41,575
so we can combine the 28x and the -4x

13
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:45,271
28x - 4x that is 24x

14
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:49,185
and then you have the -14 right over here.

15
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:50,154
Now the next thing we can do

16
00:00:50,154 --> 00:00:52,046
and it's already looking a little bit suspiscious

17
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:54,815
but just to confirm that it's as suspicious as it looks,

18
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:58,710
let's try to subtract 24x from both sides of this equation.

19
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,385
And if we do that, we see that we actually remove the x's from both sides of the equation

20
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:05,887
because we have 24x there and we have a 24x there.

21
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:08,231
You might say, "Hey, let's put all the x's on the left hand side

22
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:12,216
so let's get rid of this 24x" so you subtract 24x right over there

23
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:15,087
but have to do it to the left hand side as well.

24
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:18,548
And then we're left with: on the left hand side these guys cancel out

25
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:22,733
you're left with just 80 is equal to

26
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,390
is equal to – these guys cancel out as well –

27
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,769
is equal to -14

28
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:29,161
Now this looks very bizarre.

29
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:32,985
So we're making a statement that 80 is equal to -14

30
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:35,898
which we know is not true. This does not happen

31
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:40,243
80 is never equal to -14, they're just inherently inequal.

32
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:45,336
So this equation right here actually has no solution.

33
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:48,564
This has no solution.

34
00:01:48,564 --> 00:01:53,801
There is no x value that will make 80 equal to -14
