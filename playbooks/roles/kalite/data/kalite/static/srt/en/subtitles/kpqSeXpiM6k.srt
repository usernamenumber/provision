1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870
   

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,020
In the last couple of videos,
I've been dumping on the

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,700
Geithner Plan.

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,710
Arguably showing that if right
now the market is willing to

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,080
rationally pay $30 for a
security, even with the free

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,670
put option that the government's
willing to give,

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,900
at most a rational investor who
was willing to pay $30 is

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,400
now maybe willing to
pay $40 to $50.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,960
And that still won't meet the
hurdle that the banks need in

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,650
order to clear these assets
off their books.

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,820
Because, we've done it in a
bunch of videos even when I

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,555
did the videos on the first
bailout, the TARP plan, that

13
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:35,100
if they sell them for less than
$60, that's the number

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,020
you hear in a lot of the popular
press, that the banks

15
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,100
will essentially be insolvent.

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,470
So they're not even willing
to sell for less than $60.

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,770
So if this is the case then
the plan won't work.

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,270
Right.

19
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,116
It just won't work.

20
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:50,260
It won't work.

21
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,280
Now, there's the other scenario
where, let's say we

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,470
do see a bunch of trades
where they are going

23
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,300
for $60, $70, $80.

24
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,730
And based on some of the
arguments I've given in the

25
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,590
previous video, I'd say well,
the only rational person

26
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,780
willing to pay $60-plus would
be the banks themselves by

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,320
creating some type of off
balance sheet investor.

28
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,730
There's tons of ways
they've done this.

29
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,960
I've gotten some letters where
people said how can a bank

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,930
sell to themselves?

31
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,190
Well, you can give a
non-recourse loan to a hedge

32
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,280
fund that you just created
and that hedge fund

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,450
then invests in them.

34
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,200
And to somehow have an audit
trail, almost every hedge fund

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
in the world has some
relationship with one of these

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,470
major banks.

37
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,920
So it would be almost impossible
to disassociate the

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,730
private investors from the major
banks that are trying to

39
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,890
offload these assets.

40
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,840
So I would argue that this
probably is the case.

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,300
But in this video I like to give
Geithner and maybe even

42
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,850
the plan a bit of a break, and
give some credence to one of

43
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,140
the arguments that they make.

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,800
Right now, because of all of
these assets going sour all at

45
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,150
once, you have all of these
forced sellers, right?

46
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,350
You have all of these banks and
they're all facing these

47
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,000
liquidity issues.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,290
So you have this huge amount of
supply of these securities.

49
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,110
And right now since all of the
natural buyers are distressed,

50
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,590
all of these banks are forcing
to sell, all the hedge funds

51
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,480
who used to own these things,
they're all going bust. And

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,640
they're facing redemptions.

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,260
And their investors want
their money back.

54
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,090
So the actual demand for these
securities, the actual pool of

55
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,890
money going after
is very small.

56
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,240
So the demand is very small.

57
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,820
And they're saying this is the
reason why you have this

58
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,780
market disconnect.

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,970
This is the reason why people
are only willing to pay $30,

60
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,990
because you have this
illiquidity.

61
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,850
You have all of these forced
sellers and you have very few

62
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,660
buyers left in the market.

63
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,850
And the few buyers that are left
in the market are able to

64
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,290
get things at fire
sale prices.

65
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,480
That's the argument that we've
heard time and time again

66
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,530
about how $30 isn't
the real price.

67
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,780
That anyone who actually looked
at what's in these,

68
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,820
what have unfortunately been
called toxic securities,

69
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,870
probably because that's
what they are.

70
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,450
But anyone who looks at one of
these securities and really

71
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,370
looks inside of them will
realize that these are worth

72
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,630
way more than $30.

73
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,250
That they're yielding a lot.

74
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,080
That there will be some defaults
but maybe they're

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,120
really only worth $80 or $70
or $0.70 on the dollar.

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,140
My argument, if is really the
case, what the government

77
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,350
should do instead of giving
free put options to hedge

78
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,220
funds to essentially subsidize
the assets from banks.

79
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,590
Or, even worse, allowing the
banks to do kind of that

80
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,550
scheme that I talk about in the
second video where they

81
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,470
can buy things from themselves
and offload

82
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,670
things on the taxpayer.

83
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,350
What the government should
do is really increase the

84
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,290
transparency on these securities
so that this pool

85
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,710
of buyers becomes larger.

86
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,610
Right now these securities,
these are either

87
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,190
collateralized debt obligations
or mortgage backed

88
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,860
securities.

89
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,830
They're bonds of some kind.

90
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,820
And the pool of people who can
buy bonds is not a large one.

91
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,100
It's essentially a bunch of
professional investors, most

92
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,510
of whom have blown up in
this credit debacle.

93
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,790
   

94
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,780
Let me draw a little
balance sheet.

95
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,430
You take those toxic assets,
let's say this is a random

96
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,920
bank's balance sheet.

97
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,090
That's its assets, liabilities,
equity.

98
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,080
And it has one of these toxic
assets sitting on it.

99
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,320
Right.

100
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,910
This is a toxic asset.

101
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,570
What you do is you take the
toxic assets, stick them in a

102
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:18,180
company-- this is some
corporation-- so then the

103
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,440
toxic assets go there.

104
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,280
That's the assets.

105
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,670
And the corporation will just
have a bunch of shares.

106
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,370
If all the toxic assets came
from this bank, give these

107
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,300
shares back to the bank.

108
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,610
And notice this isn't any
sketchy accounting.

109
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,370
The banks still have the assets
on their balance sheet,

110
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,300
but instead of having the assets
directly they have the

111
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,030
shares in this company.

112
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,510
And the whole reason I'm doing
this is and you can then take

113
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,660
this company and float it on
a traditional exchange.

114
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,790
I mean we're talking about the
government, The U.S. Treasury.

115
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,680
They could force this thing to
be listed on the New York

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,790
Stock Exchange.

117
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,400
So just by doing that, that
significantly increases the

118
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,610
pool of investors who could
invest in it, right?

119
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,510
Right now the only people who
could invest in it are people

120
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,350
who are essentially
bond investors.

121
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,980
And it's not a trivial matter
to start investing in bonds.

122
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,610
You have to invest in $1,000
increments at minimum.

123
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,790
Usually it's much larger
block sizes.

124
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,520
And some of these are
collateralized debt

125
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,230
obligations.

126
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,660
They're just hard to invest
in even if you wanted to.

127
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,860
Now, the second problem.

128
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,450
That would solve just the pool
of people who could invest. So

129
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,190
that'll make it a
little larger.

130
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,600
But the second problem, this is
frankly the bigger problem

131
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,490
with these assets, is that
there's no transparency.

132
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,630
No-one knows what's in
these toxic assets.

133
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,350
Right?

134
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,710
The problem that happened over
this last real estate boom is,

135
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,430
not only did they give loans to
people that they shouldn't

136
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,960
have given loans to, but they
sliced and diced them.

137
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,540
And I've done this in a bunch
of the videos in the past.

138
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,090
They'll take a bunch of
mortgages, they'll take

139
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,170
millions of mortgages, put them
in a corporate structure.

140
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,680
And then they slice and dice
them into different tranches.

141
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,220
And I explained this in the
collateralized debt

142
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,700
obligations.

143
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,520
Where this tranche gets paid off
first, this tranche gets

144
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,580
paid off second, and this
tranche gets paid off last. So

145
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,830
any losses on this, this group
takes it first. And for the

146
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,200
most part these are the
toxic securities.

147
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,570
But some of these have
also gone toxic.

148
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,570
The problem with these things is
that the way that they sold

149
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,110
them is that they went to
Moody's or S&P and they said,

150
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,920
hey, Moody's, give us
a rating on these

151
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,910
securities right here.

152
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,080
And Moody's would say oh that's
a AAA-- and, well they

153
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,250
wouldn't call that AAA,
but they would

154
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,900
say that's a B security.

155
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,750
And we just took Moody's
word for it

156
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,800
that that's a B security.

157
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,550
Or that this right here
is a AAA security.

158
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,280
And everyone now knows that the
only reason why Moody's

159
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,660
gave the rubber stamp on it is
because the same people who

160
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,400
were structuring these things
and making all the money off

161
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,500
of these things were
the same people

162
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,860
who were paying Moody's.

163
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,970
So what we need to do is

164
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,480
disintermediate the rating agencies.

165
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,130
So the government, not only
should it create these

166
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,210
corporations so that you could
essentially buy these assets

167
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,570
without being a bond trader, you
can just buy them on any

168
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,260
exchange, what the government
should do is hire a big team.

169
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,980
And we're talking about billions
or trillions of

170
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,300
dollars here, so to hire a team
that essentially puts up

171
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,900
a website and lets us know
what's in each of these

172
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,390
securities.

173
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,760
So let's say that this company
that I just created, its

174
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,590
sticker symbol is ABCD.

175
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,880
So what we can do is we can go
to a website, type in ABCD,

176
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,470
and it'll tell me exactly what
is in that toxic security.

177
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,450
I know a lot of people who are
professional investors who are

178
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,320
in a position, if they wanted
to, to pull the trigger and

179
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,980
even buy them in their
current form.

180
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,930
And they're afraid to because
they don't know what's in

181
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,850
these toxic securities.

182
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,700
They don't know whether they're
completely fraudulent,

183
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,180
only somewhat fraudulent.

184
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,180
To some degree it's even hard
to tell where a lot of the

185
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,980
assets are sitting, in which
of the tranches.

186
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,270
So what the government should
do is just make these as

187
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,730
transparent as possible.

188
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,510
They should have a map of the
United States and they should

189
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,280
say this security is for houses
that are in upstate New

190
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,190
York and in Florida,
and its 30% upstate

191
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,790
New York and X% Florida.

192
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,510
It should have charts that tell
me what percentage is

193
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,340
defaulting.

194
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,020
So I as an investor maybe
I can extrapolate

195
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,440
things, I can do models.

196
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,530
But the crux of the issue here
is that instead of having some

197
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,030
opaque 800-page document that
only a few people have access

198
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,300
to and once they decide to parse
through that thing they

199
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,790
have to go to their local bond
trader and invest in it that

200
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,610
way, what you do is you put it
into a company, list that

201
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,740
company on the NYSE, and then
make it completely transparent

202
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,890
what's in that toxic security so
that anybody watching this

203
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,200
video can say, you know what, I
think this thing is actually

204
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,880
worth $0.40 on the dollar,
not $0.30 on the dollar.

205
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,610
And you won't have to commit
millions of dollars.

206
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,570
You could just go buy 1,000
shares for $400.

207
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,000
It wouldn't be a major
up-front investment.

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,960
And if they did this,
this would solve

209
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,670
the liquidity problem.

210
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,210
This would solve the
liquidity problem.

211
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,310
This pool of buyers would then
become much, much larger.

212
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,130
And then the government wouldn't
be able to make this

213
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,690
argument, and the banks wouldn't
be able to make this

214
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,220
argument that somehow that these
are distressed sales.

215
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,240
That these $30 sales are way
below the actual value.

216
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,630
Because you would have a
lot of people with real

217
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,670
information, with real access
to actually trading them,

218
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,500
being able to price
these securities.

219
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,220
And then when you're forced to
do a mark to market -- First

220
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,060
of all since each of these
shares in this security will

221
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,760
be trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, you'll much

222
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,990
more volume of the
transactions.

223
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,750
You'll have continuous
trading.

224
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,200
And then the mark to market that
you'll be forced to do on

225
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,110
these, essentially shares now,
but it's the same thing right?

226
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,180
It's shares in your
toxic asset.

227
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,100
But the mark to market on
those will be much more

228
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,250
accurate because you'll have
much more volumne.

229
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,630
You'll have much better market
information as far as what

230
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,180
they're worth.

231
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,670
And then frankly if it turns out
that these things really

232
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,230
are worth $30, then we can let
the banks fail and move on

233
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,750
with our lives.

234
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,360
And I've argued you could
arguably start new banks or do

235
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,270
something else.

236
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,450
But we won't be kind of playing
this charade of what

237
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,490
are these assets worth?

238
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,550
Wait, maybe we should
subsidize the banks.

239
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,450
Maybe we should be writing
free put options to hedge

240
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,320
funds and making
it all opaque.

241
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,790
The solution is just expose
everything to sunshine.

242
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,730
And then let the market price
really reflect a true reality.

243
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,500
And if that reality is that
these banks are bankrupt, well

244
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,410
then, you let them
go bankrupt.

245
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:17,833
