1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:08,400
Solve for x, and we have the absolute value of 2x minus 5 is equal to 11.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,067
Now, the big insight you need to have whenever you have an absolute value equation like this

3
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:19,867
is to remember, if I have the absolute value of a is equal to 11

4
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:21,733
what do we know about a?

5
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,867
That means that a is either equal to 11

6
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:27,231
OR, what else could a be?

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,267
It could be negative 11.

8
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:35,600
Because there are two possible a's that are exactly 11 away from zero.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,000
It could be positive 11, or it could be negative 11.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,200
That's the exact same logic you apply to an equation like this.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,733
If the absoulte value of 2x minus 5 is equal to 11

12
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:51,800
that means that the stuff inside the absolute value sign either equals 11

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,333
or the stuff inside the absolute value sign is equal to NEGATIVE 11.

14
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,533
Because if this is equal to 11, the absolute value of 11 is 11,

15
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:03,733
If this thing over here is equal to negative 11, when you take its absolute value

16
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:06,000
it'll still be equal to 11.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,067
So, let's write that down - so 2x minus 5 could be equal to 11,

18
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:19,067
or 2x minus 5 could be equal to negative 11.

19
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:22,733
In either case its absolute value is 11.

20
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,267
Now, let's just solve each of these equations.

21
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:28,600
Over here we can add 5 to both sides

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:37,067
of this equation - we get 11 plus 5 is 16, 2x minus 5 plus 5 is just 2x.

23
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:45,333
2x is equal to 16, divide both sides by 2, we get x is equal to 8.

24
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,067
Now let's do this situation.

25
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:53,533
2x minus 5 is equal negative 11 - let's add 5 to both sides of this equiation.

26
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:57,067
On the left hand side we just get 2x because the 5's cancel out.

27
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:02,067
2x is equal to negative 11 plus 5, that's negative 6.

28
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:06,067
And we can divide both sides by 2

29
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:12,867
and we get x is equal to negative 3.

30
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:18,000
So we've got two solutions, depending on whether this thing in here is equal to 11 or negative 11.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We got x to be equal to 8, in which case 2x minus 5 would be 11,

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,502
or we have x is equal to negative 3, in which case 2x minus 5 is equal to negative 11.

33
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:29,133
Let's verify it.

34
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:32,667
So, if x is equal to 8, let's show that it satisfies this equation.

35
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:39,000
So we'd get 2 times 8, minus 5. The absolute value of 2 times 8, minus 5 should be 11.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,400
2 times 8 is 16, minus 5 gives 11.

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,467
So the absolute value of 11 is 11, we know that's true.

38
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:50,067
It all works out.

39
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:52,733
Now let's try when x is equal to negative 3.

40
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:57,467
We get the absolute value of 2 times negative 3, minus 5.

41
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:02,400
should be equal to 11. So what's 2 times negative 3?

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,400
2 times negative 3 is negative 6, minus 5 gives negative 11.

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:19,733
The absolute value of negative 11 is 11, so we get 11 is equal to 11,

44
00:03:19,733 --> 99:59:59,999
so they BOTH work.
