1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,230
In the last video, we learned
how myosin-- and myosin II in

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,370
particular-- when we say myosin
II it actually has two

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,460
of these myosin heads and their
tails are inter-wound

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,040
with each other-- how myosin
II can use ATP to

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,550
essentially-- you can almost
imagine either pulling an

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,385
actin filament or walking
up an actin filament.

7
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,930
It starts attached.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,080
ATP comes and bonds onto it.

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,370
That causes it to be released.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,650
Then the ATP hydrolyzes into
ADP and a phosphate group.

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,795
And when that happens, that
energy's released.

12
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:35,620
It puts this into a higher
energy state.

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,910
It kind of spring-loads the
protein and then it attaches

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,070
up another notch on the actual
actin filament and then the

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,290
phosphate group leaves and
that's where the conformation

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,760
change in this protein
is enough.

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,660
It generates the power stroke to
actually push on the actin

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,480
filament-- and you could
imagine, either move the

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,240
myosin-- whatever the myosin is
connected to-- to the left

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,610
or whatever the actin is
connected to to the right.

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,010
We're going to talk a lot more
about what they're connected

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,460
to in future videos.

23
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,130
Now, a couple of questions
might have been

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,800
raising in your head.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,630
This guy had so much effort to
pull on this thing, right?

26
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,870
There's some tension pulling in
the other direction, right?

27
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,870
I said this is what happens in
muscles, so there must be some

28
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,760
weight or some other
resistance.

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,200
So what happens when
this releases?

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,990
At the first step when ATP
joined and this released,

31
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,440
wouldn't the actin filament
just go back to

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,370
where it was before?

33
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,180
Especially if there's
some tension on it

34
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,520
going in that direction.

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,150
And the simple answer to that
is, this isn't the only myosin

36
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,140
protein that's acting
on this actin.

37
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,380
You have others all
along the chain.

38
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,740
Maybe you have one
right there.

39
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,640
Maybe you have one
right there.

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,150
They're all working at their own
pace at different times.

41
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,550
So you have so many of these
that when one of them is

42
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,840
disengaged, another one of them
might be in their power

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,980
stroke or another one
might be engaged.

44
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,750
So it's not like you have this
notion of, if all of a sudden

45
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,240
one lets go, that the actin
filament will recoil back to

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,210
where it was.

47
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,600
Now the next question that you
might be thinking is, how do I

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,990
turn on and off this
situation?

49
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,590
We have command over
our muscles.

50
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,490
What can turn on or off this
system of the myosin

51
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,690
essentially crawling
up the actin?

52
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,460
And to understand that, there's
two other proteins

53
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,900
that come into effect.

54
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,880
That's tropomyosin
and troponin.

55
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,760
And so I'm going to redraw the
actin-- I'll do a very rough

56
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,910
drawing of the actin filament.

57
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,190
Let's say that that's my actin
filament right there with its

58
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,790
little grooves.

59
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,040
It's actually a helical
structure.

60
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,080
And actually, these grooves--
it's kind of a helical-- but

61
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,010
we won't worry too
much about that.

62
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,550
What we drew so far, at least
in the last video, you had

63
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,490
these little myosin.

64
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,860
You can view them as feet or
head or whatever that keep

65
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,490
attaching to it and then based
on where they are in that ATP

66
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,700
cycle, they can keep getting
cranked back up or

67
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,650
sprinr-loaded and go to the
next one and push back.

68
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,650
Now, on top of this actin,
you actually have

69
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,160
this tropomyosin protein.

70
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:38,030
And this tropomyosin protein,
it coils around the actin.

71
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,270
So this is our actin
right here.

72
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,760
This is one of the two heads
of the myosin II.

73
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,990
And then we have our
tropomyosin.

74
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,972
Tropomyosin is coiled around.

75
00:03:51,972 --> 00:03:55,260
It's a very rough sketch, but
you can imagine it's coiled

76
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,000
around and it goes back behind
it, then it goes like that,

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,400
and then it goes back behind
it, then it goes like that.

78
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,040
So it's coiled around it and the
important thing about it

79
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,210
is, if there's-- let me
take a step back.

80
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,860
It's coiled around and it's
attached to the actin by

81
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,260
another protein called
troponin.

82
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,860
Let's say it's attached there
and-- this isn't exact, but

83
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,270
let's say it's attached there,
and there, and there, and

84
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,610
there, and there by
the troponin.

85
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,860
So let me write this down.

86
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,540
So you can imagine, the troponin
is kind of like the

87
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,790
nails into the actin.

88
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,050
So it dictates where
the tropomyosin is.

89
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:54,040
So when a muscle is not
contracting, it turns out that

90
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,970
the tropomyosin is blocking
the myosin from being able

91
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,690
to-- and I've read a bunch of
accounts on this and I think

92
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,490
this is still an area
of research.

93
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,690
It's not 100% clear one
way or the other.

94
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,850
Tropomyosin is-- or maybe both--
blocking the myosin

95
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,880
from being able to attach to
the actin where it normally

96
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,630
attaches so it won't be able
to crawl up the actin-- or

97
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,090
sometimes the myosin is attached
to the actin, but it

98
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,840
keeps it from releasing and
sliding up the actin to keep

99
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
that walking procedure.

100
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,500
So the bottom line is that
this tropomyosin kind of

101
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:42,940
blocks the myosin head-- this
is the myosin head right

102
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:55,770
there-- from crawling up the
actin, either by physically

103
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,740
blocking its actual binding site
or if it's already bound,

104
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,480
keeping it from being able to
keep sliding up the actin.

105
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,310
Either way, it's blocking it
and the only way to make it

106
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,240
unblocked is for the troponins
to actually change their

107
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,570
conformation, for them to
change their shape.

108
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,330
And the only way for them to
change their shape is if we

109
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,380
have a high calcium
ion concentration.

110
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,300
So if you have a bunch of
calcium ions, if you have a

111
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,350
high enough concentration, these
calcium ions are going

112
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,750
to bond to the troponin and
then that changes the

113
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,970
conformation of the troponin
enough to move the

114
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,350
configuration of the
tropomyosin.

115
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,260
So let me write this down.

116
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,130
So normally, tropomyosin blocks,
but then when you have

117
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:52,070
a high calcium ion
concentration, they bind to

118
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:59,840
troponin and then the troponin,
they change their

119
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,850
conformation so it moves the
tropomyosin out of the way.

120
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,690
So when it moves out of the way,
you have a high calcium

121
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,360
concentration, bonds troponin,
moves tropomyosin out of the

122
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,770
way, then all of a sudden what
we talked about in the last

123
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,860
video-- these guys can start
walking up the actin or

124
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,180
pushing the actin to the
right, however you

125
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,210
want to view it.

126
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:38,300
But then if the calcium
concentration goes low, then

127
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,620
the calciums get released
from the troponin.

128
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,380
You need to have enough to
always hang around here.

129
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,620
If the concentration becomes
really low here, these guys

130
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:52,210
will start to leave. So then the
troponin goes back to, I

131
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,460
guess, standard conformation.

132
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:05,530
That makes the tropomyosin
block the myosin again.

133
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,770
So it's actually-- I
mean, I can't say

134
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,780
anything here is simple.

135
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,820
This was only discovered maybe
50 or 60 years ago and you can

136
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,210
imagine to actually observe
these things or to create

137
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,840
experiments to definitively
know what's happening--

138
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,560
nothing is simple, but
the idea is simple.

139
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,490
Without calcium, the tropomyosin
is blocking the

140
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,549
ability of the myosin to attach
where it needs to

141
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:38,559
attach or slide up the actin so
it can keep pushing on it.

142
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,049
But if the calcium concentration
is high enough,

143
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,610
they will bond to the troponin--
which essentially

144
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,970
nails down the tropomyosin
that's wound around the actin

145
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,630
and when they change their
conformation with the calcium

146
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,470
ions, it moves the tropomyosin
out of the way so that the

147
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,590
myosin can do what it does.

148
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,430
So you can imagine already,
we're building up a way for--

149
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,830
one, for muscles to contract,
but even better, for us to

150
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,570
control muscles to contract.

151
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,540
So if we have a high calcium
concentration within the cell,

152
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,050
the muscle will contract.

153
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,060
If we have a low calcium
concentration again, then all

154
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,700
of a sudden, these
