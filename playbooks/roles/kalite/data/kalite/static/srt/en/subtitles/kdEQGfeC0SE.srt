1
00:00:00,837 --> 00:00:05,236
What I want to do in this video is talk about continuity.

2
00:00:05,236 --> 00:00:10,302
Continuity of a function is something that is pretty easy to recognize when you see it.

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:15,126
But we'll also talk about how we can more rigorously define it.

4
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:18,508
So when I talk about it being "pretty easy to identify" is

5
00:00:18,508 --> 00:00:24,302
Let me draw the y-axis, that is the x-axis.

6
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:34,371
...and if I were to draw a function, let's say f(x) looks something like this.

7
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:36,717
And I would say over the interval that I've drawn it...

8
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:40,568
so it looks like from x=0 to that point right over there.

9
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:44,233
Is this function continuous? Well, you would say "No it isn't".

10
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:47,626
Look, over here we see the function just jumps all of a sudden.

11
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:49,969
From this point to this point right over here.

12
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:54,199
This is NOT continuous.

13
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:00,969
You might even say we have a discontinuity at this value of x right over here.

14
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,956
We would call this a discontinuity.

15
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:08,696
And this type of discontinuity is called a "Jump" discontinuity.

16
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:13,302
So you would say this is not continuous. It is obvious these two things do not connect.

17
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:15,032
They don't touch each other.

18
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:19,289
Similarly, if you were to look at a function that looked like - let me draw another one

19
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:26,207
y and x. And let's say the function looks something like this... maybe

20
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:31,235
right over here, it looks like this. And then the function is defined to be this point.

21
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:32,454
Right over there.

22
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:37,202
Is the function continuous over the interval that I've depicted right over here.

23
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:43,237
And you would immediately say "no it isn't" because right over at this point the function goes up to this point.

24
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:48,673
Just like this. And this kind of discontinuity

25
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:54,109
...is called a "Removeable" discontinuity.

26
00:01:54,109 --> 00:02:02,037
One could make a reasonable argument that this also looks like a Jump. But this is typically categorized as Removeable.

27
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:06,302
...because if you just redefine the function so it wasn't up here...

28
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:10,641
...but it was right over here, then the function is continuous. So you can kind of...

29
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:14,169
...remove the discontinuity.

30
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:17,651
And finally if I were to draw another function.

31
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:22,270
So let me draw another one right over here. X, Y.

32
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:27,036
And ask you "is this one continuous over the interval I've depicted".

33
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:31,570
And you'd say "Well, yeah, it looks connected all the way. There aren't any jumps over here...

34
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,302
...or Reomveable discontinuities over here. This one looks continuous."

35
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:38,585
Continuous. And you'd be right.

36
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,759
So that's the general sense of continuity.

37
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:43,043
And you can kind of spot it when you see it.

38
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:46,302
But let's think about a more rigourous definition of one.

39
00:02:46,302 --> 00:02:49,302
And since we already have a definition of limits...

40
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:59,908
epsilon-delta definition, gives us a rigorous definition for limits.

41
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:03,871
So we can prove when a limit exists and what the value of that limit is.

42
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:08,959
Let's use that to create a rigorous definition of continuity.

43
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,903
So let's think about a function over some type of an interval.

44
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,907
So let's say that we have... so let me draw another function.

45
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,787
Let me draw some type of a function.

46
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:29,644
And then we'll see whether our more rigorous definition of continuity passes muster when we look at all of these things up here.

47
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:32,635
Let me draw an interval. Right over here.

48
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:37,636
So it's between this x-value and that x-value. This is the x-axis and this is the y-axis.

49
00:03:37,636 --> 00:03:40,705
And let me draw my function over that interval.

50
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:44,303
It looks something like this.

51
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:49,117
So we say that a function is continuous at an interior point.

52
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:55,367
So an "interior point" is a point that is not at the edge of my boundary.

53
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:58,041
So this is an interior point for my interval.

54
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,169
This would be an endpoint and this would also be an endpoint.

55
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:07,666
We say it's continuous at an interior point

56
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,085
interior to my interval, means

57
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:16,704
that the limit at interior point c.

58
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:19,243
So this is the point x=c.

59
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:25,619
We can say it is continuous at the interior point c if the limit of our...

60
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:29,619
function - this is our function right over here - as x...

61
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:34,900
approaches c is equal to the value of our function.

62
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,453
Now, does this make sense?

63
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:40,596
Well, what we're saying is that that point - well this is f(c) right over there -

64
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:44,998
and the limit as we approach that is the same thing as the value of the function.

65
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:46,502
Which makes a lot of sense.

66
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:53,042
Now let's think about it if these would have somehow been able to pass for continuous, in that context.

67
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:57,701
Well, over here, let's say that this is our point c.

68
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:00,283
f(c) is right over there.

69
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:04,977
That is f(c). Now is it the case that the limit

70
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:10,201
of f(x), as x approaches c, is equal to f(c).

71
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:16,906
Well, if we take the limit of f(x), as x approaches c from the positive direction

72
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:22,789
it does look like it is f(c).

73
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:28,637
But if we take the limit, this does not equal, does NOT equal, the limit

74
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:35,102
of f(x) as x approaches c from the negative direction.

75
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,842
As we go from the negative direction, we're not approaching f(c).

76
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:40,975
So therefore, this does not hold up.

77
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:44,125
In order for the limit to be equal to f(c), the limit from both

78
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,242
directions needs to be equal to it. And this is not the case.

79
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:50,969
So this would not pass muster by our formal definition.

80
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:54,968
Which is good, because we see visually that this one is not continuous.

81
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,087
What about this one right over here.

82
00:05:57,102 --> 00:06:01,970
And let me re-set it up. Let me make sure that looks like a hole over there.

83
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:09,128
So we see here... what is the limit - and this is our c, right over here - the limit...

84
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:11,369
of f(x) as x approaches c.

85
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:13,297
Let's say that is equal to L.

86
00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:17,033
So that, we've seen many limits like this before.

87
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,302
That's L right over there.

88
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:23,909
And it's pretty clear just looking at this that L does not equal f(c).

89
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:26,450
This right over here.

90
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,502
...is f(c).

91
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:29,541
So once again, this would not pass our test.

92
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:33,209
The limit of f(x), as x approaches c, which is this right over here,

93
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:38,164
is not equal to f(c). So this would not pass our test.

94
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,037
And here, any of the interior points would pass our test.

95
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:52,450
The limit, as x approaches this value, is indeed equal to the function evaluated at that point.

96
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,457
So it seems to be good for all of those.

97
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:57,902
Now let's give a definition for when we're talking about boundary points.

98
00:06:57,902 --> 00:07:00,568
So this is continuity for an interior point.

99
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:19,261
And let's think about continuity - I'll do it right over here - at end point c.

100
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:24,829
So let's first consider the left endpoint.

101
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:31,782
If left endpoint - so what am I talking about, a "left endpoint"?

102
00:07:31,782 --> 00:07:39,368
Let me draw my axes. X-axis. Y-axis.

103
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:42,125
And let me draw my interval.

104
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:47,569
So this is the left endpoint of my interval. This is the right end point of my interval.

105
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:50,954
And let me draw my function over that interval.

106
00:07:50,954 --> 00:07:54,302
Looks something like this.

107
00:07:54,302 --> 00:08:00,569
So we're talking about a left endpoint, we're talking about our c being right over here.

108
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:02,707
It is the left endpoint.

109
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:09,455
So if we're talking about a left endpoint, we are continuous at c means...

110
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:14,637
or to say that we're continuous at this left endpoing c, that means...

111
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:20,533
that the limit of f(x) as x approaches c -

112
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:26,794
well we can't even approach c from the left hand side, we have to approach from the right.

113
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:29,599
is equal to f(c).

114
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:33,233
And so this is really kind of a - we can only approach from one direction.

115
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:36,169
So we can't really say the limit in general, but we can take the limit from one side.

116
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,122
So it's very similar to what we just said for an interior point.

117
00:08:39,122 --> 00:08:42,835
And we see over here, it is indeed the case as x approaches c

118
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:46,302
...our function is approaching this point over here

119
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:48,873
...which is the exact same thing as f(c).

120
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:50,043
So we are continuous at that point.

121
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:55,118
What's an example of an endpoint where we would not be continuous at an endpoint?

122
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:59,836
Well, I can imagine a graph that looks something like this.

123
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:05,046
So here's our interval.

124
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:10,902
And maybe our function. So at c it looks like that. There's a little hole right here.

125
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:15,903
Or there's no hole, the function just has a removeable discontinuity over there.

126
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:17,456
Or at least visually it looks like that.

127
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:20,981
And you can see visually, this would not pass the test.

128
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:23,676
Because the limit, as we approach c from the positive direction.

129
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:25,063
is right over here.

130
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:26,471
That's the limit.

131
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:28,711
But f(c) is up here.

132
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:33,169
So f(c) does not equal the limit as x approaches c from the positive direction.

133
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:38,459
So this would not be continuous.

134
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,284
And you could imagine what we do if we're dealing with the right endpoing.

135
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:51,522
So, we say we're continuous at right endpoint c if

136
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:55,959
so let me draw that.

137
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:58,789
I'll do my best attempt to draw it.

138
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:01,716
So this is my x-axis. This is my y-axis.

139
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:04,303
Let me draw my interval.

140
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,908
So that I care about.

141
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:12,569
A right endpoint means that c is right over there.

142
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:18,707
And we can say that we're continuous at... the function is continuous at...

143
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:23,908
x equals c means that the limit of f(x)...

144
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:27,038
as x approaches c - now we can't approach it from both sides.

145
00:10:27,038 --> 00:10:31,302
We can only approach it from the left hand side.

146
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:35,100
As x approaches c from the negative direction.

147
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,540
We could say that, if this is true, then this implies

148
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,110
that we're continuous at that right endpoing c.

149
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,036
And vice versa.

150
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:45,503
And a situation where we're not?

151
00:10:45,503 --> 00:10:46,836
Well, we could imagine this being defined right at that point

152
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:50,456
you could say the function jumps up.

153
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:52,507
Jus tlike we did right over there.

154
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:56,700
So once again, continuity - not a really hard to fathom idea.

155
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,640
Whenever you see the function just all of a sudden jumping.

156
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,038
Or there is a gap in it, it's a pretty good sense that

157
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,034
the function is not connected there.

158
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:06,374
It's not continuous.

159
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,623
But what we did in this video is we used limits

160
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:13,623
to define a more rigorous definition of continuity.
