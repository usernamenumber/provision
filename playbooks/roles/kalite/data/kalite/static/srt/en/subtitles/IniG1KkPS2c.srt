1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,460
So far we've talked about how
the Fed can control the money

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,770
supply by performing these open
market transactions where

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,195
they're buying and selling
Treasury securities.

5
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:13,480
But you're probably asking,
when I read the newspaper

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,960
headlines about all of this,
I don't hear about the open

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,890
market transactions so much and
I don't hear about them

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,880
buying treasuries so much.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,030
I always hear them setting the
Federal funds rate, or the

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,980
discount rate, or
the target rate.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,110
And what do these words mean
and how do these relate to

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,520
open market transactions?

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,260
So that's what we'll try
to go over right now.

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,870
So what we're going to focus
on is the target rate-- and

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,790
then probably in the next video
or in a couple more

16
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,070
videos, we'll focus more
on the discount rate.

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,190
And they're two different
things, although they're often

18
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,080
used in conjunction with each
other and they move in tandem,

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,150
but let's focus on the target
rate because this is how the

20
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,510
Fed, under normal conditions,
normally sets

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,340
its monetary policy.

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,010
So, the target rate.

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,860
So just so you know the
definition, this is the rate

24
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,640
that the Fed wants banks to lend
reserves to each other on

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,830
a very short term basis--
so, overnight.

26
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,810
What does that mean?

27
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,960
So I drew two banks here-- and
I drew a little bit different

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,820
than I normally do.

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,740
The left-hand side
is the assets.

30
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,860
The red box is the liabilities
and this blue over here, this

31
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,800
is the equity.

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,960
And the thing that I did
different is, every video so

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,520
far, I've been drawing
the reserves on the

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,220
bottom of the assets.

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,770
And that actually made it a
little confusing when you

36
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,510
compare the reserves to
the demand deposits.

37
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,150
I'm assuming all the liabilities
are demand

38
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,020
deposits-- that they're not
taking other types of loans.

39
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,610
So these are all checking
accounts, all of this red area

40
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,780
right here.

41
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,080
So I actually finally figured
out that it would be easier to

42
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,480
compare the reserve ratios if
I had it drawn side by side.

43
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,710
So let's say this bank right
here-- these are its reserves

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,930
in green-- and these could be
actual dollars, this could be

45
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,130
actual cash that's sitting in
there in their vault, or it

46
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,710
could be reserve deposits with
the Federal Reserve.

47
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,810
They're really the same
thing and they

48
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,750
can go back and forth.

49
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,440
And I think that's kind of--
you understand that now.

50
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,510
And just so you understand, this
asset is a liability of

51
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,390
the Federal Reserve.

52
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,550
It's roughly that much of it.

53
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,340
So that's that.

54
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,100
An asset for the bank, liability
for the Federal

55
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,000
Reserve-- and this reserve for
this bank is a liability to

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,830
the Federal Reserve.

57
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,490
And if these were actually
cash-- if this was actually

58
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,120
dollar bills and this would say,
notes outstanding-- if

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,840
this asset is a demand deposit
account or reserve deposit

60
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,500
account with the Federal
Reserve, then this would just

61
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,170
say, reserve account
for bank B.

62
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,440
With that said, so this bank,
just visually the way I've

63
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,200
drawn it-- let me just
fill this in.

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,680
I think looks nice when I
color in the squares.

65
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,820
This bank-- its reserves just
the way I've drawn it are

66
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,980
clearly-- its reserve ratio is
clearly lower than this bank

67
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,150
because this is its demand

68
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,750
deposits, this is its reserves.

69
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,240
Let's say that this bank has
reserves-- I'm just eyeballing

70
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,670
it-- looks like about if you
take the ratio of this height

71
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,486
to this height, it looks like it
has reserves of maybe-- I'm

72
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:10,800
just going to say 10%, while
this one looks more like it

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,000
has-- I don't know-- closer
to 20% reserves.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,840
And now remember, banks-- we
talked about regulations, so

75
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,090
there is some minimum reserves
that a bank needs to keep.

76
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,470
And then, of course, even if
there were no regulation, a

77
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,110
bank would want to keep some
reserves just in case some of

78
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,520
these demand deposits-- people
want their cash, so you always

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,060
want to keep some reserves, but
you don't want to keep too

80
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,780
much reserves.

81
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,210
Because what happens with
too much reserves?

82
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,440
Reserves-- you don't get any
interest on a reserve account

83
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,300
or on cash.

84
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,630
And that's actually how the--
if you were curious how the

85
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,020
Fed actually supports itself--
well, it gives these banks

86
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,120
reserve accounts, which are
essentially checking accounts

87
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,870
at the Fed-- and it gives
them no interest on it.

88
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,580
It gives them no interest so
it has no interest on the

89
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,810
right-hand side of their
balance sheets.

90
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,320
So it pays no interest
on its liabilities.

91
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,690
And its liabilities are these
things right here.

92
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,680
It pays no interest on these
things, but it gets interest

93
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,670
on some of its assets.

94
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,480
So here I drew a little
bit of gold.

95
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,620
This yellow part is
gold right here.

96
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,530
Let me write that-- gold.

97
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,440
This right here is gold and then
this brown color-- we'll

98
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,910
assume that these are
treasuries, right?

99
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,870
So if I have a government
treasury, it gives me some

100
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,420
interest. So I'm paying no
interest if I'm the Fed.

101
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,070
I'm paying no interest on these
reserve deposits or on

102
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,360
these notes outstanding.

103
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,490
And I get interest
on my assets.

104
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,630
So that's easy money and it
actually turns out that what

105
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,720
the Fed does-- and this is why
it's very ambiguous whether

106
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,170
it's really independent of
the government or not.

107
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,260
It is officially a private
institution, but it's a board

108
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,570
of directors that's appointed
by the government and even

109
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,440
more, this money that it makes,
any surplus money that

110
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,690
it has after paying all of the
expenses of the Federal

111
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,240
Reserve, it actually goes
back to Congress.

112
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,980
So don't think that somehow
there's this private bank with

113
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,560
this great money making scheme
because all the money goes

114
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,250
back to Congress.

115
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,250
Although that goes both ways.

116
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,410
If for whatever reason, the Fed
were to do really stupid

117
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,650
things and it were to become
insolvent, Congress is

118
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,900
obligated-- we learned before
that these treasury notes are

119
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,550
obligations of the
U.S. government.

120
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,500
So it goes both ways.

121
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,730
So even though it's officially
independent, it really isn't.

122
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,760
It really is almost a part of
Congress-- or at least a part

123
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,220
of the government.

124
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,770
But with that said-- actually,
I should say part of the

125
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,090
Treasury, not so much
part of Congress.

126
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,040
I don't want to be technically
incorrect.

127
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,250
But with that said, let's go
back to this example with

128
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,300
these two banks.

129
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,380
So this guy, he probably has
more reserves than he needs.

130
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,500
And he doesn't like having too
much reserves because you

131
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
don't get any interest on it.

132
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,940
Let's say that this guy--
he wants 15% reserves.

133
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,220
He figures that that's more
than enough that he needs.

134
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,935
And this guy, he feels like he's
getting a little bit low

135
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,620
on reserves.

136
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,010
He would also like
to get to 15%.

137
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,610
So this guy would like to
borrow this much money.

138
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,160
   

139
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,270
Reserves would actually be
physical cash or reserve

140
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,570
deposits with the Fed.

141
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,310
And this guy, he has about
this much to lend.

142
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,090
   

143
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,700
He has roughly about this much
right here to lend-- and so

144
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,620
the obvious thing, since there's
only two banks in this

145
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,470
universe, is that this guy
would lend to that guy,

146
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,570
probably overnight because you
don't know what's going to

147
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,160
happen tomorrow.

148
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,320
Maybe some people are
going to want their

149
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,140
money back, et cetera.

150
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,120
So we're just lending
overnight.

151
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,053
And if this guy still feels
comfortable with the

152
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:32,860
situation, he can continue
that lending.

153
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,490
This guy can renew his
lending and this guy

154
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,200
will renew it-- whatever.

155
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,470
You get the idea.

156
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,670
So the question is, what
interest rate does this guy

157
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,350
charge to that guy for lending
this little chunk of money?

158
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:53,830
   

159
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,520
Let's just say right now, this
bank says, well, I'll charge

160
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:06,650
you-- I don't know-- I'll charge
you 10% overnight.

161
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,480
So it's not like you're paying
10% just for a one night loan.

162
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,300
It's an annual rate of 10%.

163
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,110
So overnight, you're paying
this to the 1/365 power or

164
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,350
however many business
days there are.

165
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,770
So it's actually a very small
amount of interest. These are

166
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,840
kind of the annual rates if
this guy were to continue

167
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,510
borrowing it overnight and
overnight for a whole year.

168
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,280
With that said, let's say that
the Fed decides the money

169
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,440
supply isn't big enough.

170
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,360
That the Fed wants to expand
the money supply.

171
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,170
So let's see what happens
in that situation.

172
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,175
So what was that mechanism?

173
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:43,495
So what the Fed does is,
it can print notes.

174
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:46,770
   

175
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,280
Let's just say it's actual
physical cash.

176
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,140
   

177
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,480
That's an asset that the
Fed is holding now.

178
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,290
And of course it has an
offsetting liability now,

179
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,980
which is notes outstanding,
right?

180
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,030
And then what the Fed does is,
it uses these notes and it can

181
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,340
buy treasuries, it
can buy risk free

182
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,780
government debt, right?

183
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,260
And it buys them in
the open market.

184
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,560
That debt might be being
held by China.

185
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,960
It might be being held
by your grandmother.

186
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,880
It could be being
held by anyone.

187
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,100
It might even be being held by
some of these banks, but

188
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,330
needless to say, they take
this and they buy

189
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,730
treasuries with it.

190
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,909
So then that asset then turns
to treasuries on the Fed's

191
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,350
balance sheet.

192
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,860
But where did all that
cash go, right?

193
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,470
Well, that cash will then go
to your grandmother who was

194
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,690
holding the treasuries.

195
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,340
And what is your grandmother
going to do with that cash?

196
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,020
Well, your grandmother is going
to put that cash in

197
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,590
their bank, right?

198
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,280
And maybe they're buying it
from a lot of people's

199
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,620
grandmothers.

200
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,090
And so let's say some of the
grandmothers put the

201
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:03,860
money in this bank.

202
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,670
I'm trying to draw it.

203
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,240
So this bank gets a little
bit more reserves.

204
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,160
And then some of the
grandmothers put it in this

205
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,280
bank over here, right?

206
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,530
And so what happened?

207
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,390
What was the net
effect of that?

208
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,790
The government's balance sheet
increased a little bit.

209
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,100
If you look at its total
assets, it's

210
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,980
expanded a little bit.

211
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,170
Or if you actually just look
at its total liabilities.

212
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,330
Its balance sheet grew.

213
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,390
It took on some treasuries-- and
we'll have a whole video

214
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,970
on what the impact on treasury
interest rates that does.

215
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,550
But in the process, when it
bought those treasuries on the

216
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,070
open market, more cash
got deposited

217
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,630
into the banking system.

218
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,970
And this could be cash or it
could be reserves with the

219
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,960
central bank.

220
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,770
But now let's think about
this situation

221
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,270
between these two banks.

222
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,910
Now all of a sudden this bank
here needs less money, right,

223
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,210
because he got some reserve
deposits from our

224
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,460
grandmothers.

225
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,930
And also, this bank-- maybe now
this guy went from 10%--

226
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,730
maybe now he has a 12% reserve
ratio because he got some

227
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,250
deposits of actual cash.

228
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:14,160
And maybe this guy went from 20%
to-- I don't know-- 22%.

229
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,720
So now this guy needs
less money, right?

230
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,686
His demand for money has been
lowered, or for cash has been

231
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:24,440
lowered, or his demand for
reserves has been lowered.

232
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,200
And this guy has even
more to lend, right?

233
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,340
He already had a surplus and
now he has an even bigger

234
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,650
surplus, right?

235
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,790
So the supply of reserves
has increased

236
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,460
in the banking system.

237
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,720
The supply his increased from
the lending bank and the

238
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,310
demand from the borrowing
bank has lowered.

239
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,130
So now for this transaction to
occur, the demand has gone

240
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,180
down, the supply has gone up.

241
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,180
The price has got
to go down for a

242
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,600
little borrowing overnight.

243
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,140
And what is the price
of borrowing?

244
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,510
Well, that's interest rates.

245
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,780
So now for this transaction to
occur, all of a sudden maybe

246
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,160
this guy needs it less, this
guy wants to lend even more

247
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,850
because he has more.

248
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,530
So now maybe this transaction
will occur at

249
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,280
an 8% interest rate.

250
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,080
And maybe the Fed has
a target rate of 5%.

251
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,510
They want to see a reality where
this bank is lending to

252
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,880
that bank at a 5% rate.

253
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,820
So what would they do?

254
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,940
Well, they would just keep
doing this process.

255
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,760
They would issue a
little bit more.

256
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,720
I realize I'm not going
to have time.

257
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,580
But you see the process.

258
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,450
They'd issue some more notes,
buy some more treasuries.

259
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,430
Those notes would end up in
the banking system so the

260
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,730
demand for overnight lending
will go down and there'll be

261
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,220
more of those reserves
out there.

262
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,430
So the rate at which
people lend to each

263
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,740
other will go down.

264
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,570
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
