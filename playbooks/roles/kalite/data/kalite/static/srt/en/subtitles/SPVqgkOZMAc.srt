1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,190
I've spoken a lot about second
order linear homogeneous

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,376
differential equations in
abstract terms, and how if g

4
00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:09,320
is a solution, then
some constant

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,740
times g is also a solution.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,770
Or if g and h are solutions,
then g

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,200
plus h is also a solution.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,900
Let's actually do problems,
because I think that will

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,860
actually help you learn,
as opposed to

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,120
help you get confused.

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,210
So let's say I have this
differential equation, the

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:31,840
second derivative of y, with
respect to x, plus 5 times the

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,080
first derivative of y, with
respect to x, plus 6 times y

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,160
is equal to 0.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,570
So we need to find a y where 1
times its second derivative,

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,890
plus 5 times its first
derivative, plus 6 times

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,760
itself, is equal to 0.

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,680
And now, let's just do a little
bit of-- take a step

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,100
back and think about what kind
of function-- if I have the

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,010
function and I take its
derivative and then I take its

21
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,410
second derivative,
most times I get

22
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,760
something completely different.

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:14,770
Like, if y was x squared, then
y prime would be 2x, and y

24
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,200
prime prime would be 2.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,500
And then to add them together
you'd say, well, how would my

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,770
x terms cancel out so that
you get 0 in the end?

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,140
So draw back into your brain
and think, is there some

28
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,470
function that when I take its
first and second derivatives,

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,630
and third and fourth
derivatives, it essentially

30
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,730
becomes the same function?

31
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,010
Maybe the constant in front of
the function changes as I take

32
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,080
the derivative.

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,970
And if you've listened to a
lot of my videos, you'd

34
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,970
realize that it probably is what
I consider to be the most

35
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,290
amazing function
in mathematics.

36
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,230
And that is the function
e to the x.

37
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,770
And in particular, maybe e to
the x won't work here-- or you

38
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,010
can even try it out, right?

39
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,550
If you did e to the x,
it won't satisfy

40
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,850
this equation, right?

41
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,490
You would get e to the x, plus
5e to the x, plus 6e to the x.

42
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,030
That would not equal to 0.

43
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:25,440
But maybe y is equal to e to
some constant r, times x.

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,640
Let's just make the assumption
that y is equal to some

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,510
constant r times x, substitute
it back into this, and then

46
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,640
see if we can actually solve
for an r that makes this

47
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,140
equation true.

48
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,730
And if we can, we've found the
solution, or maybe we've found

49
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,580
several solutions.

50
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,360
So let's try it out.

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,680
Let's try y is equal to
e to the rx into this

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
differential equation.

53
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,260
So what is the first
derivative of

54
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,600
it, first of all.

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,830
So y soon. prime is
equal to what?

56
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,840
Derivative chain rule.

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,846
Derivative of the inside is r.

58
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:56,390
And then derivative of
the outside is still

59
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,660
just e to the rx.

60
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,490
And what's the second
derivative?

61
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,530
y prime prime is equal to
derivative-- r is just a

62
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,370
constant-- so derivative of the
inside is r, times r on

63
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,140
the outside, that's r squared,
times e to the rx.

64
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,610
And now we're ready to
substitute back in.

65
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,760
And I will switch colors.

66
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,570
So the second derivative, that's
r squared times e to

67
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:31,970
the rx, plus 5 times the first
derivative, so that's 5re to

68
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:40,310
the rx, plus 6 times our
function-- 6 times e to the rx

69
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,600
is equal to 0.

70
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,760
And something might already be
surfacing to you as something

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,700
we can do this equation
to solve for r.

72
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,820
All of these terms on the left
all have an e to the rx, so

73
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,840
let's factor that out.

74
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:04,360
So this is equal to e to the rx
times r squared, plus 5r,

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,420
plus 6 is equal to 0.

76
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,370
And our goal, remember, was to
solve for the r, or the r's,

77
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,440
that will make this true.

78
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,850
And in order for this side
of the equation to be

79
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,740
0, what do we know?

80
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,570
Can e to the rx ever equal 0?

81
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,010
Can you ever get something to
some exponent and get 0?

82
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,610
Well, no.

83
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,150
So this cannot equal 0.

84
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,290
So in order for this left-hand
side of the equation to be 0,

85
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,480
this term, this expression
right here, has to be 0.

86
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,980
And I'll do that in
a different color.

87
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,810
So we know, if we want to solve
for r, that this, r

88
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,110
squared plus 5r, plus
6, that has to be 0.

89
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,630
And this is called the
characteristic equation.

90
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,120
This, the r squared plus 5r,
plus 6, is called the

91
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,135
characteristic equation.

92
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:58,490
And it should be obvious
to you that now this

93
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,830
is no longer calculus.

94
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,050
This is just factoring
a quadratic.

95
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,480
And this one actually is fairly

96
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,200
straightforward to factor.

97
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,740
So what is this?

98
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:17,930
This is r plus 2, times r
plus 3 is equal to 0.

99
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,070
And so the solutions of the
characteristic equation-- or

100
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,180
actually, the solutions to this
original equation-- are r

101
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:34,050
is equal to negative 2 and
r is equal to minus 3.

102
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,000
So you say, hey, we found two
solutions, because we found

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,520
two you suitable r's
that make this

104
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,610
differential equation true.

105
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,770
And what are those?

106
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,190
Well, the first one is
y is equal to e to

107
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,460
the minus 2x, right?

108
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,090
We can call that y1.

109
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:58,560
And then the second solution
we found, y2 is e to the--

110
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,640
what is this?-- r is minus 3x.

111
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,150
   

112
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,980
Now my question to you
is, is this the

113
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,060
most general solution?

114
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,080
Well, in the last video, in
kind of our introductory

115
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,710
video, we learned that a
constant times a solution is

116
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,170
still a solution.

117
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,050
So, if y1 is a solution, we also
know that we can multiply

118
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,515
y1 times any constant.

119
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:20,300
So let's do that.

120
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,340
Let's multiply it by c1.

121
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,750
That's a c1 there.

122
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,120
This is also going
to be a solution.

123
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,180
And now it's a little bit
more general, right?

124
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,360
It's a whole class
of functions.

125
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,590
The c doesn't have to just be
1, it can be any constant.

126
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,210
And then when you use your
initial values, you actually

127
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,110
can figure out what
that constant is.

128
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,330
And same for y2.

129
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,160
y2 doesn't have to be 1 times
e to the minus 3x, it has to

130
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,640
be any constant.

131
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,340
And we learned that in the
last video, that if

132
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,410
something's a solution,
some constant times

133
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,700
that is also a solution.

134
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,480
And we also learned that if we
have two different solutions,

135
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,630
that if you add them together,
you also get a solution.

136
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,600
So the most general solution to
this differential equation

137
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,310
is y-- we could say y of x, just
to hit it home that this

138
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,930
is definitely a function of x--
y of x is equal to c1e to

139
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:19,190
the minus 2x, plus c2e
to the minus 3x.

140
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,040
And this is the general
solution of this

141
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,860
differential equation.

142
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,370
And I won't prove it because the
proof is fairly involved.

143
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,210
I mean, we just tried
out e to the rx.

144
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,380
Maybe there's some other wacko
function that would have

145
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,150
worked here.

146
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,180
But I'll tell you now, and you
kind of have to take it as a

147
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,670
leap of faith, that this is
the only general solution.

148
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,990
There isn't some crazy outside
function there that would have

149
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,210
also worked.

150
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,050
And so the other question that
might be popping in your brain

151
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,170
is, Sal, when we did first order
differential equations,

152
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,460
we only had one constant.

153
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,170
And that was OK, because we
had one set of initial

154
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,410
conditions and we solved
for our constants.

155
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,910
But here, I have
two constants.

156
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,710
So if I wanted a particular
solution, how can I solve for

157
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,350
two variables if I'm only given
one initial condition?

158
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,990
And if that's what you actually
thought, your

159
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,270
intuition would be correct.

160
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,450
You actually need two initial
conditions to solve this

161
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,840
differential equation.

162
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,070
You would need to know,
at a given value of x,

163
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,560
what y is equal to.

164
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,960
And, maybe at a given
value of x, what the

165
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
first derivative is.

166
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,260
And that is what we will
do in the next video.

167
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,510
See

168
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,400
