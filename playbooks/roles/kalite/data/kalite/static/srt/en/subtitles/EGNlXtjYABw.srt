1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,690
In the last video, I started
with this matrix right here,

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,980
and right from the get go, we
said the span of this matrix

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,530
is just the span of the column
vectors of it, and I just

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,240
wrote it right there.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,740
But we weren't clear whether
this was linearly independent,

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,760
and if it's not linearly
independent, it won't be a

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,050
sufficient basis.

9
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,880
And then we go off and
we figure out the

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,360
null space of A.

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,140
We find out that the null space
of A contains more than

12
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,860
just the zero vector.

13
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,870
It's just the span of these two
vectors here, which means

14
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,150
that these columns are not
linearly independent.

15
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,180
We saw that several
videos ago.

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,140
And we used that information
that they're not linearly

17
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,370
independent to try to make them
linearly independent by

18
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,830
getting rid of the
redundant ones.

19
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,610
So we were able to get rid of
this guy and this guy, because

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,140
these were essentially the
columns associated with the

21
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,990
free variables.

22
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,500
And we were able to do it using
this little technique

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,370
down here, where we set one of
these equal to 0, the other

24
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,830
one equal to negative
1 and then solved

25
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,140
for the pivot variables.

26
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,890
And then we set the other one
equal to 0 and the other one

27
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,700
equal to negative 1 and solved
for the pivot variables.

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,470
And you could imagine
that this is a

29
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,390
generalizable process.

30
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,890
If you have a bunch of free
variables, you can set all of

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,210
them but one to equal 0, and
then that one that you didn't

32
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,090
set to 0, you set it to
equal negative 1.

33
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,960
And you can express it as a sum
of the pivot variables,

34
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,280
where the pivot variables are a

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,660
function of the free variables.

36
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,700
In general, this would be
a quick way of doing it.

37
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,910
We had to do it more
slowly over here.

38
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,590
If I have some matrix A, and I
want to figure out the basis

39
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,220
for the column space, the column
space is just the span

40
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,960
of these, but if I wanted a
linearly independent basis, I

41
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,920
need to figure out some set
of these that are linearly

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,880
independent.

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,010
What I can do is put this guy
into reduced row echelon form.

44
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,500
When I put them in reduced row
echelon form, and I did that

45
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,700
over here, this is the reduced
row echelon form of A, I can

46
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,280
look at the variables
that are associated

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,380
with the pivot entries.

48
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,360
So this is x1.

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,320
Let me scroll up a little bit.

50
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,479
This is associated
with x1, right?

51
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,160
When you multiply this times x1,
you get this column times

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,580
x1, this column times x2, this
column times x3, this column

53
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,950
times x4 like that.

54
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,570
When you look at just regular A,
when you look at just your

55
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,990
matrix A, it's the same thing.

56
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,100
If you were to write Ax equal
to 0, this column would be

57
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,380
associated with x1, this column
would be associated

58
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,350
with x2, x3 and x4 like that.

59
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,290
What you can do is you put it
in reduced row echelon form.

60
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,390
You say which columns have
my pivot entries or are

61
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,765
associated with pivot
variables?

62
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:43,830
You say, OK, x1 and x2 are
associated with pivot

63
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,730
variables, or they are the pivot
variables, and they're

64
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,930
associated with these first
two columns, and so those

65
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,640
first two columns would be a
basis for the column space.

66
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,810
How did I get this?

67
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,660
Am I just making up
things on the fly?

68
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,630
Well, no!

69
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,650
It all comes from the reality
that you can always construct

70
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,100
a situation where the vectors
associated with the free

71
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,830
variables you can write them as
linear combinations of the

72
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,640
vectors associated with the
pivot variables, and we did a

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,630
special case of that
last time.

74
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,540
But a very quick and dirty way
of doing it, and I don't know

75
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,260
if it's actually dirty, is just
take your matrix, put it

76
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,050
in it reduced row echelon form,
and you say, look, this

77
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,920
column and this column
are associated

78
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,310
with my free variables.

79
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,200
Therefore, this column and this
column must be associated

80
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,610
with my free variables.

81
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,910
The solution sets are the same
to Ax equal to 0 or the

82
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,330
reduced row echelon form
of Ax is equal to 0.

83
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,040
So they're the same.

84
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,810
So if this column and this
column are associated with

85
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,970
free variables, so are this
column and this column, which

86
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,590
means that they can be expressed
just by judiciously

87
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,930
selecting your values of your
free variables as linear

88
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,730
combinations of the columns
associated with the pivot

89
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,470
variables, with the pivot
entries, which are that column

90
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,140
and that column.

91
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,070
So this column and this column
would be a basis for

92
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,500
A, and we see that.

93
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,959
We see that all the
way down here.

94
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,860
1, 2, 3 and 1, 1, 4, We did a
lot of work and we got all the

95
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,170
way there, and we said this
is a basis for the

96
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,860
column span of A.

97
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,180
Now, doing all of that work,
let's see if we can actually

98
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,630
visualize what the column
space of A looks like.

99
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,840
I have a strange feeling I might
have said column span a

100
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,800
couple of times, but the
column space, what

101
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,310
does it look like?

102
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,800
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about

103
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,480
what it looks like.

104
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,990
One way is we can say, look,
this span this is 2-- that's a

105
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,720
member of R3.

106
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,800
That's a vector in R3 and
this is a vector in R3.

107
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,700
   

108
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:07,070
Let me draw my x, z and-- well,
normally it's drawn--

109
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,920
this is normally y, x, and
z-axes in R3, if I'm want to

110
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,270
represent them as
three-dimensional space.

111
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,050
Then the vector 1, 2, 3 might
look like this where it's one,

112
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,980
one, two, one, two, three,
so we go out one down

113
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,930
here, then up three.

114
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,900
So the vector will look like
that in its standard form.

115
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,340
That's that one right there.

116
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,670
And the vector 1, 1, 4 would be
one, one and go up four, so

117
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,710
it might look something
like this.

118
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,600
It's hard to actually draw
them very well in three

119
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,230
dimensions, but you
get the idea.

120
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,690
But the column space is the span
of these, so all of the

121
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,630
linear combinations
of these two guys.

122
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,860
So all of the linear
combinations of these two guys

123
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,380
are going to create
a plane that

124
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,140
contains these two vectors.

125
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,670
If you just sum these guys up in
multiple combinations, you

126
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,000
can get any vector up there.

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,280
If you just add them
up, you'll get that

128
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,100
vector right there.

129
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,480
If you add this guy plus 2 times
that, you'll get some

130
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,550
vector up here.

131
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,890
So if you view them as position
vectors, they'll

132
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,490
essentially form
a plane in R3.

133
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,220
But let's see if we can get the
equation for that plane.

134
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,700
Well, how can we do that?

135
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,990
Well, we know that we can figure
out the equation of a

136
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,080
plane based on the fact that
a normal vector dotted with

137
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,490
any-- let me write my normal
vector like this.

138
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,440
The normal vector dotted with
any position vector specifying

139
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,870
a position on the plane.

140
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:37,800
So let me call that x minus any
point on the plane or any

141
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,020
vector position on the plane.

142
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,720
So I could do that minus
the vector 1, 2, 3 has

143
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,000
to be equal to 0.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,140
And we can use this information
to figure out the

145
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,270
equation for this plane.

146
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,670
But what is a normal vector?

147
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,660
How can we find a normal
vector to this plane?

148
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,930
So this would be a vector.

149
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,590
Let me see if I can draw
this in a way that

150
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,350
doesn't confuse the issue.

151
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,050
If the plane is like that,
the normal vector would

152
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,890
come out like that.

153
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,450
So how can I create
a normal vector?

154
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,690
Well, we learned that you take
the cross product of any two

155
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,960
vectors in R3, and the cross
product I've only defined so

156
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,020
far in R3, and I will get a
vector that's normal to both

157
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,680
of those vectors.

158
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,830
So let's take the
cross product.

159
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,030
This is a nice way of thinking
about it, because it's really

160
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,960
integrating everything that
we've covered so far.

161
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,700
So let me define my normal
vector to be equal to 1, 2, 3

162
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,795
cross 1, 1, 4.

163
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:38,045
And what does this equal?

164
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:41,600
   

165
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,450
So my first term,
I ignore that.

166
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,850
I get 2 times 4 minus
3 times 1.

167
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,940
2 times 4 is 8.

168
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,100
2 times 4 minus 3 times 1.

169
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,960
8 minus 3.

170
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,920
Then for my second row, I have
1 times 4, and my temptation

171
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,150
is do 1 times 4 minus
3 times 1.

172
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,260
But you reverse it.

173
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,585
You do 3 times 1, so it's
3, minus 1 times 4.

174
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,860
   

175
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,090
We've done that multiple
times.

176
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,030
You might want to review the
cross product video if that

177
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,740
seems strange.

178
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,250
You ignore the middle row, and
you normally do 1 times 4

179
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,940
minus 3 times 1, but the
middle row you switch.

180
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,850
We're only defining it for R3,
so instead, we do 3 times 1

181
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,150
minus 1 times 4.

182
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,210
And then finally for the last
row, we ignore it, and we say

183
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,400
1 times 1, which is 1, minus 2
times 1, which is minus 2.

184
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,970
And this is equal to the vector
5, minus 1, minus 1,

185
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,059
which by definition of the cross
product, and I've shown

186
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,950
this to you multiple times,
is normal to both of these

187
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,280
vectors, and so it'll be
normal to any linear

188
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,370
combination of these
two vectors.

189
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:56,280
So now that we have our normal
vector, we can define the

190
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,630
traditional equation
for the plane.

191
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,470
So we now know that our normal
vector 5, minus 1, minus 1,

192
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,880
that I got by taking the cross
product of our basis vectors

193
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,450
dot any vector in our plane.

194
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,665
So let me just write
any vector.

195
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:16,080
Let me just write it x, y, z.

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,840
So x, y, z since that's how
I defined my axes up here.

197
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,920
This was the x-axis.

198
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,530
x, y and z.

199
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,040
x, y, z minus-- I just
picked one of these.

200
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,100
I could have picked either of
them-- minus 1, 2, 3 has got

201
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,840
to be equal to 0.

202
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,510
So what's this?

203
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,100
This is going to be equal to--
let me write it a little

204
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:45,920
smaller, a little neater-- 5,
minus 1, minus 1 dot-- what's

205
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
this guy going to be?

206
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,780
x minus 1, y minus 2, and
z minus 3 has got

207
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,840
to be equal to 0.

208
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,050
And what's the dot product?

209
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:03,890
It's 5 times x minus 1 plus-- or
maybe I should say minus 1,

210
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:10,340
so it's plus minus 1 times y
minus 2 plus minus 1 times z

211
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,410
minus 3 is equal to 0.

212
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,860
That's just the definition
of our dot product.

213
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:27,360
If I simplify this, I get 5x
minus 5 minus y plus 2 minus z

214
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,660
plus 3 is equal to 0.

215
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,850
You have 2 plus 3 is 5 minus
5, so those all cancel out.

216
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,070
Those will equal 0.

217
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:44,600
And we get 5x minus y minus
z is equal to 0.

218
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,270
This plane in R3 is the
column space of A.

219
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,250
So we've now shown you that
it's truly a plane in A.

220
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,620
And actually, it makes
sense that this plane

221
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,890
intersects the origin.

222
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,740
If you set x, y, and
z equal to 0, it

223
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,220
satisfies this equation.

224
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,480
And that makes sense, because we
said that a column space of

225
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,850
a matrix has to be a valid
subspace, and a valid subspace

226
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,470
has to contain the
zero vector.

227
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,320
And in R3 that's the
coordinate 0, 0, 0.

228
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,810
Now, what I want to do now is
see if we can get at the same

229
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:27,400
answer going a completely
different way, or approaching

230
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,790
it in a completely
different way.

231
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,220
Let me get my original A,
which I've forgotten.

232
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,410
I've marked it up a good
bit, but let me just

233
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,460
copy and paste it.

234
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,020
So that's my original
A right there.

235
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,930
   

236
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,562
Let me copy it.

237
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:50,700
Let me paste it.

238
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,640
Nope.

239
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,900
That's not what I
wanted to do.

240
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,860
Let's see, so my original
A-- I copied and

241
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,110
pasted the wrong thing.

242
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,680
   

243
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,520
Let me do it a little-- don't
want to waste your time.

244
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,570
Edit, copy, edit, paste.

245
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,090
There you go and let me scroll
this down and get to a point

246
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,436
that's relatively clean.

247
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:15,130
Bring my A down.

248
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,430
I've used a lot of space.

249
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,250
So here you go.

250
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,030
This is my original
A right there.

251
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,030
And what I want to do is see
if I can get this result

252
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,700
completely different.

253
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,310
I got this result by figuring
out the basis of the column

254
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,875
span, finding a normal vector by
taking the cross product of

255
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:37,800
our two basis vectors, and then
using the dot product of

256
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,770
the normal vector with the
difference-- this vector right

257
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,730
here, where you take any vector
on our plane minus one

258
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,500
of our basis vectors,
that's to find some

259
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,380
vector in the plane.

260
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,780
This is some vector
in the plane.

261
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,200
So any vector in the plane
dotted with my normal vector

262
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,230
is going to be equal to 0.

263
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,260
And actually, I should probably
make a side note

264
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,490
here, that the only reason I
was able to say that the

265
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,990
normal vector is a cross
product of my two basis

266
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,850
vectors, is because I knew that
these two basis vectors,

267
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,980
not only do they specify some
point on the plane-- so let's

268
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,970
say that this guy right here
is this blue vector.

269
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,030
Not only does he specify some
point on the plane right

270
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:23,810
there, but the vector lies
completely on the plane.

271
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,860
How did I know that?

272
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,950
Because I knew from the get go
that the 0, 0 vector is in my

273
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,980
span, right?

274
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,000
I knew that if I draw this guy
in just standard position, the

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,265
point 0, 0, 0, is in my span,
and I know its end point is in

276
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:45,870
the span, so this whole vector
has to be in my plane, and

277
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,640
likewise, this whole vector
has to be in my plane.

278
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,260
So if I take the cross product,
anything normal to

279
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,340
these guys or any combination
of these guys is going be

280
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,130
normal to the plane, and we got
this result right here.

281
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,820
But let me take this right
here and use our other

282
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,250
definition of column span.

283
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,060
Our other definition, or it's
really an equivalent

284
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:13,110
definition, is all of the valid
solutions to Ax where x

285
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,460
is a member of Rn.

286
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,570
Or another way we could think of
it is, we could view it as

287
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:36,810
all of the valid b's where Ax
is equal to b, and x is a

288
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,840
member of Rn.

289
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,340
These are equivalent
statements.

290
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,940
I'm just defining b here to be
Ax, so these are equivalent

291
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,330
statements.

292
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,350
But let's run with this
a little bit.

293
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,840
So let's say that I define my
b, so b is going to be a

294
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,070
vector in R3, right?

295
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,580
We already have an intuition
like that.

296
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,030
   

297
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,360
When I take Ax, I get a b
that's equal to x, y, z.

298
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,600
And I want to figure out what x,
y's and z's can I get valid

299
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,880
solutions for?

300
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:16,780
So if I take my vector A and
then let me multiply it

301
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:28,290
times-- well, actually, the
best way to do it, I think

302
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,340
we're used to it right now.

303
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:37,110
If I'm solving the equation
Ax is equal to b, I can

304
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,290
essentially just create the
augmented matrix, where I have

305
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,690
the matrix A and I can augment
it with b, and put this in

306
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,420
reduced row echelon form, and
that'll essentially represent

307
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,500
the solution set.

308
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,420
So let me do that.

309
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,155
So if I just augment this matrix
right here with b, so I

310
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,790
write x, y, z.

311
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,030
So this is A augmented with b.

312
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,390
This is A, this is b.

313
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,190
let me put this in reduced row
echelon form and find the

314
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,440
solution set.

315
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,600
   

316
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
And these are x, y, and z's
that define a valid b.

317
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,400
So what do I get?

318
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,710
The first thing I want to do,
and we've done this exercise

319
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,160
before, let's keep my
first row the same.

320
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,720
1, 1, 1, 1, and I get an x.

321
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,560
And let's replace our second row
with the second row minus

322
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,810
the first row.

323
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:39,800
   

324
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,180
Actually let me do
it this way.

325
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,620
Let me replace the second row
with 2 times the first row

326
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,715
minus the second row.

327
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:46,770
So 2 times the first row minus
the second row, we're going to

328
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,550
get a 2x minus y up there.

329
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,100
And then 2 times
1 minus 2 is 0.

330
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,330
2 times 1 minus 1 is 1.

331
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,990
2 times 1 minus 4 is minus 2.

332
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,305
2 times 1 minus 3 is minus 1.

333
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:07,170
   

334
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,260
Fair enough.

335
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:17,930
And now let me replace my third
row with the third row

336
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,380
minus 3 times the first row.

337
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,690
So we're going to do the third
row minus-- no, let

338
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,240
me do it this way.

339
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:34,800
It's the third row minus
3 times the first row.

340
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,670
So I'm just doing the b column
first, because I can remember

341
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,580
what I did.

342
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,120
The third row minus 3
times the first row.

343
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,900
3 minus 3 times 1 is 0.

344
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,090
4 minus 3 times 1 is 1.

345
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,710
1 minus 3 times 1 is minus 2.

346
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:57,750
And then 2 minus 3 times
1 is minus 1.

347
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,450
Now, I could go all the way to
reduced row echelon form, but

348
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,100
something interesting is
already happening.

349
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,380
So let me from the get go try
to zero out this third row.

350
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,710
And the best way to zero out
this third row is to just

351
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,140
replace the third row.

352
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,850
So the first row-- well,
I won't even

353
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,350
write the first row.

354
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:23,400
The second row is 0, 1, minus
2, minus 1, and 2x minus y.

355
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,690
I'm not even going to worry
about the first row right now.

356
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,110
But let's replace the third row,
just in our attempt to go

357
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,100
into reduced row echelon form.

358
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,370
Let's replace it with
the second row

359
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,880
minus the third row.

360
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:42,670
So you get 2x minus
y minus z plus 3x.

361
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,560
I just took this minus this.

362
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,300
So minus z plus 3x.

363
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,420
So 0 minus 0 is 0.

364
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,140
1 minus 1 is 0.

365
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,040
Minus 2 minus minus 2 is
0, and that's also 0.

366
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:02,110
So we're only going to have a
valid solution to Ax equals b

367
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:08,270
if this guy right here
is equal to 0.

368
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,830
What happens if he's
not equal to zero?

369
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,110
Then we're going to have a bunch
of zeroes equaling some

370
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,810
number, which tells us that
there's no solution.

371
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,680
So if I pick a b where this guy
does not equal zero, then

372
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,800
I'll have no solution.

373
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,340
If this guy equals 5, if I pick
x, y, and z's such as

374
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,820
that this expression is equal to
5, then Ax equal to b will

375
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,090
have no solution, because it
will have 0 is equal to 5.

376
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,840
So this has to equal 0.

377
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:40,510
So 2x minus y minus z plus 3x
must be equal to 0 in order

378
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:47,490
for b to be valid, in order for
b to be a member of the

379
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,700
column space of A, in order for
it to be a valid vector

380
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,510
that Ax can become, or the
product A times x can become

381
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,180
for some x.

382
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,670
So what does this equal to?

383
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:09,570
If we add the 2x plus the 3x,
I get 5x minus y minus z is

384
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,050
equal to 0, which is the exact
same outcome we got when we

385
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,710
figured out the basis vectors.

386
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,550
We said oh, you know what?

387
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,260
The basis vectors, they have
to be in the column space

388
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,490
themselves by definition.

389
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,150
So let me find a normal vector
to them both by taking the

390
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,230
cross product.

391
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,720
I did that, and I said the cross
product times any valid

392
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,910
vector in our space minus one of
the basis vectors has to be

393
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,320
equal to zero, and then
I got this equation.

394
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,750
Or we could have done
it the other way.

395
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,440
We could've actually literally
solved this equation setting

396
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,480
our b equal to this.

397
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,100
We said what b's will give
us a valid solution?

398
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,620
And our only valid solution will
be obtained when this guy

399
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,540
has to be equal to zero, because
the rest of his row

400
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,760
became zero.

401
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,250
And when we set that equal
to zero, we got

402
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,900
the exact same equation.

403
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,000
So, hopefully, you found this
to be mildly satisfying,

404
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,780
because we were able to tackle
the same problem from two

405
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,255
different directions and get the
same result, and it kind

406
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:07,740
of shows you the beauty of
linear algebra, how it all

407
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,970
starts to fit together.

408
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,533
