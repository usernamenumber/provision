1
00:00:00,855 --> 00:00:03,521
Find the slope of the line that goes through the ordered

2
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:08,940
pairs (4, 2) and (-3, 16).

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:16,821
So just as a reminder, slope is defined as rise over run

4
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:20,405
or you could view that as rise is just a change in y

5
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:22,821
and run is a change in x

6
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:25,255
The triangles here, there's the delta symbol

7
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:27,506
it literally means "change in"

8
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:30,238
Or another way, and you might see this formula and

9
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,088
it tends to be really complicated

10
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:34,289
but just remember it's just these two things over here

11
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,055
Sometimes slope will be specified with the variable m

12
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:40,888
and they'll say m is the same thing

13
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:43,189
(and this is really the same thing as change in y)

14
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:48,805
They'll write y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1

15
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:51,472
And this notation tends to be kind of complicated

16
00:00:51,472 --> 00:00:55,421
but all this means is you take the y value of your endpoint

17
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:57,939
and subtract from it the y value of your starting point

18
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:00,556
That'll essentially give you your change in y

19
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:04,022
and it says take the x value of your endpoint

20
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,289
and subtract it from the x value of your starting point

21
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:09,139
and that'll give you your change in x

22
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:12,156
So whichever of these work for you, let's actually

23
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:15,206
figure out the slope of the line that goes through these

24
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:16,889
two points.

25
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:17,907
So we're starting at

26
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:19,597
(actually we can do it both ways)

27
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:22,609
we can start at this point and go to that point and calculate the slope,

28
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:25,406
or we can start at this point and go to that point and calculate the slope.

29
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:27,881
So let's do it both ways.

30
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:35,198
So let's say our starting point is the point (4,2)

31
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:42,699
And let's say our endpoint is (-3, 16)

32
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:45,583
So what is the change in x over here

33
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,132
What is the change in x in this scenario

34
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,982
So we're going from 4 to -3

35
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:54,532
if something goes from 4 to -3, what was its change?

36
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:58,134
You have to go down 4 to get to zero

37
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:01,182
Then you have to go down another 3 to get to -3.

38
00:02:01,182 --> 00:02:06,016
So our change in x here is -7

39
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:10,265
Actually, let me write it this way

40
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:16,187
Our change in x is equal to -3 - 4 which is equal to

41
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:18,595
-7

42
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:22,828
If I'm going from 4 to -3, I went down by 7

43
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:25,929
Our change in x is -7

44
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:28,362
Let's do the same thing for the change in y

45
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:30,712
And notice: I implicitly use this formula over here

46
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:34,763
our change in x was this value - our endpoint

47
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:39,230
our end x value minus our starting x value

48
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,796
let's do the same thing for our change in y

49
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:44,162
Our change in y

50
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:47,062
If we're starting at 2 and we go to 16 that means

51
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:49,662
we moved up 14

52
00:02:49,662 --> 00:02:51,429
Or another way you could say it is:

53
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,995
You could take your ending y value

54
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:56,262
and subtract from the your starting y value

55
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:58,045
and you get 14

56
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00,079
So what is the slope over here?

57
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,794
Well the slope is just change in y over change in x

58
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:08,475
So the slope over here is change in y over change in x

59
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:10,909
which is: our change in y is 14

60
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:14,191
and our change in x is -7

61
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:21,774
And if we want to simplify this 14 divided by -7 is -2

62
00:03:21,774 --> 00:03:24,044
Now what I want to show you is we could have done it

63
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:25,957
the other way around

64
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:28,558
We could have made this the starting point and this the endpoint.

65
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:30,924
And what we would have gotten is the negative values

66
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:32,840
of each of these, but they would have cancelled out

67
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,224
and we would still get -2.

68
00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:38,307
Let's try it out. So let's say that our start point

69
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:45,208
was (-3,16) and let's say that our endpoint is (4,2)

70
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:49,690
So in this situation, what is our change in x?

71
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,940
Our change in x.

72
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,276
If I start at -3 and I go to 4, that means I went up 7

73
00:03:56,276 --> 00:04:03,309
Or if you want to just calculate that, you would do 4 - -3

74
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:05,859
but needless to say, we just went up 7

75
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:08,326
And what is our change in y

76
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:10,993
Our change in y over here

77
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:13,077
Or you could say our "rise"

78
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:15,709
If we start at 16 and we end at 2, that means we

79
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,410
went down 14.

80
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,542
Or you could just say 2 - 16 is -14.

81
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:25,193
We went down by 14 - this is our run.

82
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:29,059
So if we say rise over run, which is the same thing as change

83
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:30,826
in y over change in x.

84
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:34,776
Our rise is -14 and our run here is 7.

85
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:37,410
So notice these are just the negatives of these values from

86
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,660
when we swapped them.

87
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,642
So once again, this is equal to -2.

88
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:47,226
Let's just visualize this - let me do a quick graph here

89
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:51,026
just to show you what a downward slope would look like

90
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:53,842
So let me draw our two points

91
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:56,109
So this is my x axis

92
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:58,160
That is my y axis

93
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,442
So this point over here, (4,2), so let me graph it

94
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:05,176
So, we're going to go all the way up to 16, so let me save some space here

95
00:05:05,176 --> 00:05:08,093
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4

96
00:05:08,093 --> 00:05:11,258
it's 4 comma 1 ... 2

97
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:14,126
So (4,2) is right over here

98
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:17,926
Then we have the point (-3, 16)

99
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:19,676
So let me draw that over here

100
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:21,994
So we have -1 ... 2 ... 3

101
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:27,976
and we have to go up 16, so this is 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... 5 ... 6 ... 7 ... 8 ... 9 ... 10 ... 11 ... 12

102
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:30,509
13 ... 14 ... 15 ... 16

103
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:33,093
So it goes right over here

104
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:37,991
So this is (-3,16).

105
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:42,805
So the line that goes between them is going to look something like this

106
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:47,539
I'm going to try my best to draw a relatively straight line

107
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:51,603
That line will keep going.

108
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:53,988
So that's my best attempt.

109
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:56,854
And notice it's downward sloping - as you increase in x

110
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:58,689
value the line goes down.

111
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:01,139
It's going from the top left to the bottom right

112
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,756
As x gets bigger, y gets smaller

113
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:06,271
that's what a downward sloping line looks like

114
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:09,257
And just to visualize our change in x's and our change in y's

115
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:11,506
that we dealt with here,

116
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:18,537
when we started with (4,2) and ended at (-3,16)

117
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:22,188
That was analogous to starting here and ending over there

118
00:06:22,188 --> 00:06:25,739
And we said our change in x was -7

119
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:28,321
We have to move back our run

120
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,122
We had to move in the left direction by 7

121
00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:33,239
That's why it was -7

122
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:37,923
And then we had to move in the y direction positive 14

123
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:40,255
That's why our rise was positive

124
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:42,855
So it's 14 over -7, or -2.

125
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:48,373
When we did the other way, we started at this point, and ended at this point

126
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:53,828
Started at (-3,16) and ended at that point.

127
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:57,045
So in that situation our run was positive 7

128
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:59,761
And now we had to go down in the y direction since we

129
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:01,895
switched the starting and the end point.

130
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:04,394
And now we have to go down -14.

131
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:08,280
Our run is now positive 7, and our rise is now -14

132
00:07:08,280 --> 99:59:59,999
Either way, we got the same slope.
