1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Problem number six.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,010
That's too skinny. I want to use this tool.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,560
Problem number six.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,020
I had to restart my computer, so everything got reset.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:17,470
If m and k are positive, it's fairly complicated.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:25,950
And they that 10m squared k to the negative 1

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:40,350
is equal to 100m, what is m to the negative 1 in terms of k?

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,030
Let's see if we can simplify that thing I wrote at the top.

9
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,070
k to the negative one is equal to 100m.

10
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:54,080
Well let's divide both sides by 10, you get m squared.

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,790
k to the negative one--

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,660
that's the same thing as m squared over k-- is equal to,

13
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,000
and we divide the other side by ten, is equal to 10m.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,910
Let's divide both sides by m, and they're positive,

15
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,080
so we can do that. So it's not 0.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,600
So you get m over k is equal to 10,

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:19,050
because m squared divided by m is just 10.

18
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,000
m is equal to 10k.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,800
But they don't want us to figure out what m is in terms of k

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,040
they want to know m to negative one.

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,260
Well m to the negative 1 is just 1 over m,

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,320
so if we just invert both sides of this,

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,030
we know that 1 over m is equal to 1 over 10k.

24
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,040
That's the same thing, of course, as m to the negative 1.

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,060
And 1 over 10k, that's choice D.

26
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,000
Problem number seven.

27
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,050
We are on problem number seven, that I will do in mauve.

28
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,580
Edna and Nancy leave the house for a common friend

29
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,070
at the same time, and walk for 4 hours.

30
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,070
4 hours is how far they walk.

31
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,680
Edna walks due east at the average rate

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:20,080
of 4 kilometers per hour.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:37,030
Nancy walks due north at an average of 3 kilometers per hour

34
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,010
I'm doing this a little bit messy, but you get the point.

35
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,110
Nancy's going north, Edna's going east.

36
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,830
What is the straight-line distance

37
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,080
between them in kilometers at the end of 4 hours?

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,030
So this is Pythagorean theorem.

39
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,060
At the end of 4 hours, how far has Edna traveled east?

40
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,070
They're starting at the same point, oh I don't like that.

41
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,010
How far has Edna gone east?

42
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,340
Well, she's going to be going

43
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:17,020
4 kilometers per hour times 4 hours.

44
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,010
And that equals 16 kilometers.

45
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,190
That's how far Edna went east.

46
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,070
Now how far did Nancy go north?

47
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:35,070
Well she went at, oh my god I was using the line tool.

48
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,090
Undo.

49
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,720
So same thing, she went north at 3 kilometers

50
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,080
per hour times 4 hours.

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,050
So she traveled 12 kilometers.

52
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,080
This is a Pythagorean theorem problem.

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,010
After 4 hours, Nancy's there, Edna's there.

54
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,120
And you just need to figure out

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,000
the straight-line distance between them.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,090
We just have to figure out this.

57
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,270
And actually, a trick to this,

58
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,670
let's say that we want to solve for x, you could say that

59
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:21,080
x squared is equal to 12 squared plus 16 squared.

60
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,050
And you could figure it out.

61
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,210
Or you can make the further realization that

62
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,050
this is essentially a 3, 4, 5 triangle.

63
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,850
You could say that this is 4 times 4, this is 3 times 4,

64
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,010
so this side is going to be 5 times 4.

65
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,000
If you remember your 3, 4, 5 triangle, Pythagorean theorem.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,060
If you don't, just do this.

67
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:49,060
You get x squared is equal to 144 plus 256.

68
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,660
So x squared is equal to 400,

69
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,020
and then you get x is equal to 20.

70
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,360
So you could do it either way,

71
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,050
this would have been a little bit less math.

72
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:07,070
So x is equal to 20, so it is choice E.

73
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,000
East, the other one walks north.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,020
This is choice E.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,060
Problem number eight.

76
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm using an old workbook that was used by my cousin

77
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,010
when she was in seventh grade.

78
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,340
She's now in tenth grade,

79
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,650
and she's marked up some of these problems.

80
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,070
So I have a little bit trouble reading.

81
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,840
And she was only in seventh grade,

82
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,130
but some of the problems are circled incorrect so that's

83
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,030
what's making me second guess myself every now and then.

84
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,610
But anyway, back to the problems.

85
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,130
She now doesn't get any problems incorrect,

86
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,000
back to the problem.

87
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,960
She's actually the reason why I started doing this,

88
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,050
because I worked with her, and she saw improvement.

89
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,510
And then I worked with her brother,and they saw improvement.

90
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,060
And then I said, well let me just make a bunch of videos,

91
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,460
so a bunch of people can see some improvement.

92
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,880
So let's see what they have drawn here

93
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,010
for problem number eight.

94
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,000
So let me draw the x-axis.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let me draw the y-axis.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,080
And then they drew a parabola.

97
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,000
The figure above shows the graph of a quadratic function

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,020
that has a minimum at point 1, 1.

99
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,560
At the point 1 comma 1, it has its minimum point.

100
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,040
Let me do that in a different color.

101
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,010
That's the minimum point there.

102
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,620
If f of b is equal to f of 3,

103
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,060
which of the following could be the value of b?

104
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,060
So on the graph they drew, if you go to 3.

105
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,030
1, 2, 3, and if you just follow up.

106
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:44,050
You go to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, so you go up 5.

107
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:52,060
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, there's a point here.

108
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,880
And at least this side of the parabola,

109
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,040
or the quadratic, goes something like this.

110
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,030
I'm trying to draw as carefully as possible.

111
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:08,050
And the other side is symmetric. It'll do the same thing.

112
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,070
And they say f of b is equal to f of 3.

113
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,060
So f of 3 is here, and if you want to get the exact number

114
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,060
it's f of 3 is equal to 5.

115
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,040
But that actually doesn't even matter.

116
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,030
Because this is 1, this is the point 1, 1.

117
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,040
This is the point, this is x is equal to 3.

118
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,820
And the big realization is, well this is a quadratic,

119
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,060
this is a parabola, this is it's minimum point.

120
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,040
So it's going to be symmetric around this point.

121
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,230
So if it reaches 5 here,

122
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,610
so it took 2 units to reach 5 going to the right,

123
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,060
going in the positive x direction.

124
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,500
So similarly, it's going to take 2 units to reach 1

125
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,010
going in the negative x direction.

126
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,040
So what's 2 units less than 1?

127
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,070
So 1, 2, you'd get to negative 1.

128
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,020
So at b could be equal to negative 1.

129
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,040
Actually b would be equal to negative 1.

130
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,580
So the correct answer is C.

131
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,030
The choice is b is equal to negative 1.

132
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:17,060
Let's see if I can squeeze in problem number nine.

133
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,010
Problem number nine.

134
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,030
A family of 5 is planning a 4-day camping trip.

135
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,020
So 5 people times 4 days.

136
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,660
Each person will need 1 bottle of water

137
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,010
for each day of the trip.

138
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,050
So times 1 bottle per day, per person.

139
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,440
If water is sold only in 3-bottle packages,

140
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,040
how many packages must the family buy for the trip?

141
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,060
Well how much water do they need?

142
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,950
There's 5 people, 4 days,

143
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,040
and they each need a bottle of water a day.

144
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,020
So they need 20 bottles.

145
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,800
And it only comes in packages of 3, or multiples of 3.

146
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,810
If they bought 6 packages it would be 18 bottles,

147
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,070
that's not enough.

148
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,030
So they have to get 7 packages.

149
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,540
7 packages times 3 is equal to 21 bottles,

150
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,010
so they have to buy 7 packages.

151
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,030
Not too bad. All right.

152
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,010
I'll do the next problem in the next video.

153
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,070
I'll see you soon.
