1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:04,563
A zoo has 15 Emperor Penguins who make up

2
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:08,485
30% of the total number of penguins at the zoo.

3
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:11,251
How many penguins live at the zoo?

4
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:16,747
So let's let x equal the total number of penguins

5
00:00:16,747 --> 00:00:21,384
who live at the zoo.

6
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:23,710
So, they're telling us that 30% of that [number]

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,948
are the emperor penguins – which is 15.

8
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:28,021
So they're saying, if we take 30% –

9
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:33,830
So 30% of x is equal to 15.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,956
Or another way of saying this is

11
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:37,548
we could say – instead of writing 30%,

12
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:38,831
we could write that as a decimal –

13
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:42,169
as 0.30 of x.

14
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:51,178
So it’s 0.30 times x = 15.

15
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:55,723
And now, to solve this, we just have to divide

16
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,830
both sides by 0.30.

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,959
Let's do that.

18
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:04,227
[WRITES '0.30' TWICE.]

19
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:10,540
We get x is equal to 15/0.30.

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,407
Now that’s –

21
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:12,139
Let's do a little –

22
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,251
We’re going to have to do a little arithmetic

23
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:14,218
to solve this one.

24
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:15,800
So if we take 0 –

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,279
It's 15 divided by 0.30.

26
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:23,767
So just as a refresher of dividing decimals,

27
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:27,169
we can essentially multiply both of these by 100.

28
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:28,882
And when you multiply both of them by 100,

29
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:30,274
you can’t just multiply one of them,

30
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:32,431
[because] then you'd get a different answer.

31
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:34,023
But if you multiply both of them by 100,

32
00:01:34,023 --> 00:01:35,957
you move this decimal point over two spots,

33
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:37,518
so it becomes a 30 –

34
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:40,367
And you move this decimal point over two spots –

35
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,878
so it becomes 1500.

36
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:45,684
So it really boils down to the fact that

37
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:48,139
the same number of times that 30 goes into 1500

38
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:51,853
is the number of times that 0.30 will go into 15.

39
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:52,875
So let's think about this.

40
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,667
(Let me rewrite it here, just so it’s neat.)

41
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,854
30 goes into 1500 –

42
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:59,362
All we did is we moved both decimals

43
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:00,815
over to the right, twice.

44
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:02,191
Or you could say, we just multiplied

45
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,799
the numerator and the denominator here by 100 –

46
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,103
which wouldn't change the value of the fraction.

47
00:02:07,103 --> 00:02:08,932
So 30 goes into –

48
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:11,018
Let’s see. It doesn't go into 1. It doesn't go into 15.

49
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:12,693
It does go into 150.

50
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:14,701
It goes into 150 5 times.

51
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,966
5 × 30 = 150.

52
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,287
Subtract, you get 0.

53
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:22,071
And then 30 goes into 0 times.

54
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:26,061
So this 30 goes into 1500 fifty times.

55
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:30,069
So this right over here is equal to 50.

56
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:31,106
And you can verify it.

57
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:35,549
Multiply 0.3 × 50, and you will get 15.

58
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,958
Now there is another way of doing it.

59
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,856
You could say the fraction of Emperor penguins

60
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:43,524
over the total number of penguins at the zoo –

61
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:45,354
So you could say –

62
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:48,456
You could say 15 –

63
00:02:48,456 --> 00:02:50,326
You could say 15

64
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:53,647
over the total number of penguins at the zoo

65
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:55,807
is equal to 30%.

66
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:57,659
Percent literally means 30 100ths.

67
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,797
So it’s equal to 30 for every 100.

68
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:04,288
It's equal to 30 for every 100.

69
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:07,709
And then you could solve for this right over here.

70
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,180
And a really simple way of doing this is to say,

71
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,006
“Look, to go from 30 to 15, you have to divide by 2 –

72
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:15,817
if you're going from the right to the left.

73
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:18,172
So let's divide by 2 right over here.

74
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:21,055
So x would be equal to 50.

75
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:24,351
15/50 is the same thing as 30/100.

76
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,947
So the total number of penguins is 50.
