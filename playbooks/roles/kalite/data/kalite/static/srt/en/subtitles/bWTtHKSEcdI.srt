1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,730
Actually, just right after
stopping that video, I

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,770
realized a very simple way
of showing you that RP is

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,930
congruent to TA, a little bit
more of a rigorous definition.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:23,150
If we can show that this
triangle right there, that one

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,990
I drew in purple, and this
triangle right here are

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:33,140
congruent, then we could make
a fairly reasonable argument

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,920
that RP is going to be congruent
to TA, because

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,190
they're essentially the
corresponding sides of the two

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,130
congruent triangles.

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,000
This congruent triangles
would be kind of

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,730
flipping each other.

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,430
So how can we make
that argument?

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,650
Well, on the purple triangle,
this angle is going to be

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:55,850
equal to this angle on
the yellow triangle.

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,640
Actually, we got that from the
fact that this is an isosceles

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,380
trapezoid, so the base angles
are going to be the same.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,730
They told us this is an
isosceles trapezoid, so we

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,480
know that this side, right
there, is going to be

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,110
congruent to this side.

21
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,880
And then finally, they both
share this side right here.

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,460
   

23
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,750
So we could use the argument--
once again, side, angle,

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,770
side-- that the side, angle, and
side are congruent to this

25
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,160
side, angle, and side.

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:37,930
So you could say by SAS,
triangle TRP is congruent to

27
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,230
triangle TAP.

28
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,760
   

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,870
And if they're congruent, then
all of the corresponding sides

30
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,790
are equal, so then TA
is congruent to RP.

31
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,140
Once again, you didn't
have to do all that.

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,830
It's a multiple choice test. But
I wanted to give you that.

33
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,490
I felt bad I wasn't giving you
a more rigorous definition.

34
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,040
A more rigorous proof.

35
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:14,360
So anyway, problem number 11.

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,970
A conditional statement
is shown below.

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,530
If a quadrilateral has
perpendicular diagonals, then

38
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,010
it is a rhombus.

39
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,140
Fair enough.

40
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,100
Which of the following is
a counterexample to the

41
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,460
statement above?

42
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,120
So they're saying, if it's
perpendicular diagonals, then

43
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,040
it's a rhombus.

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,260
So if we could find something
that has perpendicular

45
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,190
diagonals that is not a rhombus,
then we have a

46
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,870
counterexample.

47
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,900
Then this would not be true.

48
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,600
So let's find something with
perpendicular diagonals that

49
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,670
is not a rhombus.

50
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,310
Well, this one has perpendicular
diagonals.

51
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,180
The diagonals are perpendicular
to each other,

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,300
all 90-degree angles.

53
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,000
And this is clearly
not a rhombus.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,650
This is like a kite.

55
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,260
This is not parallel to this and
that is not parallel, so

56
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,140
this is not a rhombus.

57
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,570
So this is definitely
a counterexample.

58
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,520
This one does have perpendicular
diagonals, but

59
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,430
it's also a rhombus.

60
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,530
So it's not a counterexample.

61
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,850
It's just an example of what
they're trying to say.

62
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,860
This has perpendicular
diagonals, it's a square, but

63
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,900
a square is a subset
of rhombuses.

64
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,060
So this is another example.

65
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,240
And, of course, this
one does not have

66
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,630
perpendicular diagonals.

67
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,900
This is not a right angle.

68
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,250
So A is the counterexample.

69
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,500
Next question.

70
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,110
   

71
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:36,040
Problem 12.

72
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,035
Which triangles must
be similar?

73
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:40,970
   

74
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,430
Two obtuse triangles.

75
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,340
Well, obtuse just means that
they have two angles, one

76
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,710
obtuse angle might look like
that where that is greater

77
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,990
than 90 degrees there,
and the other obtuse

78
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,880
might be super obtuse.

79
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,120
It might be like that.

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,230
And clearly these
aren't similar.

81
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,270
Well, this angle is obviously
larger than that one.

82
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,390
OK, so this is not similar.

83
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,080
Similar means all the
angles are the same.

84
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,020
So it's like congruent, but you
can scale them in size.

85
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,650
That's how I think of them.

86
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,560
Like this triangle.

87
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,100
   

88
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm trying to draw it so it
looks exactly the same.

89
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,600
That triangle.

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,270
Well no, but you can imagine
if I cut and

91
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,790
pasted that, right?

92
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,020
It would only be similar to
this triangle if I drew

93
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,820
everything to scale.

94
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,040
Because the sides are different
sizes, but all the

95
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,680
angles are the same.

96
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,000
That's what similar means.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,630
So let's see.

98
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,440
Two scalene triangles with
congruent bases.

99
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,600
   

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,810
Well no, that's not true.

101
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,330
That's not similar.

102
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,710
Let's say they share
the same base.

103
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,745
One scalene triangle might
look like this.

104
00:04:50,745 --> 00:04:56,320
It might come out a little bit
and then go down like that.

105
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,580
And the other scalene triangle
has the same base right there.

106
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,850
The sides might be a little
closer to each other.

107
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,650
So clearly, these two things
aren't similar.

108
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,110
This angle is different
than that angle.

109
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,160
All the angles are
different, so

110
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,870
they're not similar triangles.

111
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,870
So that's not right.

112
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,040
Two right triangles.

113
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,090
Do those have to be similar?

114
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,650
Well, no.

115
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,440
You could have a right triangle
that looks like this,

116
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,320
where maybe the two sides
are equal, right?

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,020
That's a 45-45-90 triangle.

118
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:31,370
Or you could have something
like this where you have a

119
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,100
30-60-90 triangle.

120
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,440
These clearly are not similar.

121
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,660
All the angles are
not the same.

122
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,980
They both have a 90-degree
angle.

123
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,250
So I'm already guessing that D
is our right answer, but let's

124
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,100
see how it works out.

125
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,925
Two isosceles triangles with
congruent vertex angles.

126
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:53,960
   

127
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,610
So I'm assuming when they say
congruent vertex angles, I'm

128
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,906
assuming they mean all of the
angles are congruent.

129
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:03,910
   

130
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,295
So two isosceles triangles.

131
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:08,750
   

132
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,690
Let me think about
it a little bit.

133
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,990
Oh, actually, I think what
they mean is angle in the

134
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,460
middle when they say
vertex angle.

135
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,300
   

136
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,760
If that's one of my isosceles
triangles.

137
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,560
   

138
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,390
And isosceles triangle means
that that side is equal to

139
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,980
that side and that angle
is equal to that angle.

140
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,380
The vertex angle, I'm guessing,
they mean is this

141
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,720
angle right there.

142
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,760
So if I had another isosceles
triangle.

143
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,140
Let's say maybe it's a
little bit smaller.

144
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,800
It looks something like that.

145
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,690
And their vertex angles
are the same.

146
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,410
That angle is equal
to this angle.

147
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,770
Well, if that angle is equal to
this angle and we know it's

148
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,167
isosceles, so if we know it's
isosceles, that is equal to

149
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,930
that, then that has to be equal
to that, we know that

150
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,230
all the angles are the same.

151
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,380
How do we know that this angle
is equal to this angle?

152
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,580
Well, think about it.

153
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,680
Whatever angle this us,
let's call this x.

154
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,650
Let's call this angle
y and this angle y.

155
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:19,340
We know that x plus 2y is equal
to 180, or that 2y is

156
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:27,170
equal to 180 minus x, Or y is
equal to 90 minus x over 2.

157
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:33,100
Now if this is x, And let's call
these z and z, So we know

158
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,190
that x plus 2z is
equal to 180.

159
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,160
All the angles in a triangle
have to add up to 180.

160
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,970
Subtract x from both sides,
you get 2z is equal

161
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,320
to 180 minus x.

162
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,890
Divide by 2, you get z is equal
to 90 minus x over 2.

163
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,960
So z and y are going to
be the same angles.

164
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,230
So all the angles are the same,
so we're dealing with

165
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,170
similar triangles.

166
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,230
So choice D was definitely
correct.

167
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:11,340
13.

168
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,930
OK.

169
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,130
Which of the following facts
would be sufficient to prove

170
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,630
that triangles ABC, that's the
big triangle, and triangle

171
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,270
DBE, so that's a small
one, are similar?

172
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,600
So we have to prove that all of
their angles are similar.

173
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,300
I cannot even look at the
choices and I can guess where

174
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,840
this is going.

175
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,740
So we want to prove that
those are similar.

176
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,730
So first of all, they share
the same angle.

177
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:38,340
Angle ABC, this angle, is
the same as angle DBE.

178
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,750
So they share that same angle.

179
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,549
So we got one angle down.

180
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,620
Now let's think about it.

181
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,750
If we knew that this angle is
equal to that angle and that

182
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,220
angle is equal to that
angle, we'd be done.

183
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,240
And the best way to come to
that conclusion is if they

184
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,340
told us that this and
this are parallel.

185
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,670
I'm guessing that's where
they're going.

186
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,340
Now I might have gone on a
completely wrong tangent.

187
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,440
Because it those two are
parallel, then these two lines

188
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,450
are transversals of
the parallel.

189
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:10,310
So that angle and that angle
would be corresponding angles,

190
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,750
so they would be congruent, and
then that angle and that

191
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,240
angle would be corresponding
angles so

192
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,080
they'd also be congruent.

193
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,240
So if they told us that these
are parallel, we're done.

194
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,860
These are definitely
similar triangles.

195
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:27,190
And sure enough, choice C, they
tell us that AC and DE

196
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,860
are parallel.

197
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,440
These are parallel, that's
a transversal, this is a

198
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,110
corresponding angle of that,
so they're congruent.

199
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,370
This is a corresponding angle to
this, congruent, so all of

200
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,360
the angles are congruent.

201
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,185
So we have a similar triangle.

202
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:44,030
   

203
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:53,190
Problem 14.

204
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,440
OK.

205
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:01,080
   

206
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,940
Parallelogram ABCD
is shown below.

207
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,740
Fair enough.

208
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,860
Parallelogram: that
tells us that the

209
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,870
opposites sides are parallel.

210
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,650
That's parallel to that, and
then this is parallel to that.

211
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,680
And all of the choices got
clipped at the bottom, but

212
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,455
I'll copy them over.

213
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:20,500
   

214
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,200
Maybe I'll copy them
above the question.

215
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,570
Well, let me see
what I can do.

216
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,300
   

217
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,276
I think that's good enough.

218
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:33,070
A little unconventional.

219
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,080
OK.

220
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,100
Parallelogram is shown below.

221
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,280
They say which pair of triangles
can be established

222
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:47,160
to be congruent to prove
that angle DAB is

223
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,410
congruent to angle BCD?

224
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,400
   

225
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,020
So DAB is this.

226
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,380
Let me do it in another color.

227
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:02,060
DAB is that angle, is
congruent to BCD.

228
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,470
They want us to show
that those have

229
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,640
the same angle measure.

230
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,310
OK, and what do we
have to show?

231
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,120
They say what pair of triangles
can be established

232
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,250
to be congruent to prove that.

233
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,830
OK, if these are both part of
two different congruent

234
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,440
triangles and they are the
corresponding angles, then we

235
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,090
know that they're congruent
and we'd be done.

236
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,330
So let's see what they say.

237
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,980
Triangle ADC and BCD.

238
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:31,870
   

239
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,650
BCD has this angle in it.

240
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,640
BCD does help us because it
has this angle in it, but

241
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,780
triangle ADC does not have
this angle in it, right?

242
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,010
Triangle ADC has this the
smaller angle in it.

243
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,560
ADC doesn't involve this whole
thing, so that's not

244
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,490
going to help us.

245
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,610
Triangle AED, once again, does
not involve this larger angle,

246
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,820
does not involve
the angle DAB.

247
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,850
It only involves the little
smaller angle, so that's not

248
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,250
going to help us.

249
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,060
Triangle DAB.

250
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,690
That looks good.

251
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,260
That has this whole
angle in it.

252
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,700
DAB.

253
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,190
And then BCD.

254
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:15,780
If we showed that that triangle
is congruent to this

255
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,780
triangle right here,
I think we're done.

256
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,150
That would be enough to show
that this angle is congruent

257
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,160
to that angle, because they
would be the corresponding

258
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,210
angles of a congruent
triangle.

259
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,010
So I think C is where
we're going to go.

260
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,750
Let's just look at choice D.

261
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,670
DEC.

262
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,420
Once again, triangle DEC.

263
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,050
Let me make this point clear.

264
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,420
Triangle DEC does not involve
either of the angles we care.

265
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,610
It clearly does not involve
this angle, and it only

266
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,570
involves part of this angle,
only this part.

267
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,120
It doesn't involve this whole
angle, so that's not going to

268
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,060
help us either.

269
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,470
So the answer is C.

270
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,680
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
