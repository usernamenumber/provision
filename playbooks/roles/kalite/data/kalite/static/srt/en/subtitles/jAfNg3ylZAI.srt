00:00:00,437 --> 00:00:05,262
What I want to do in this video is familiarize 
ourselves with the notion of a set

2
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:08,999
and also perform some operations on sets.

3
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:13,103
A set is really just a collection of distinct objects.

4
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:15,500
For example, I can have a set

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,250
let's call this set X.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,372
I'll deal with numbers right now, 
but a set could contain anything.

7
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:28,104
It could contain colours, people, 
other sets, cars, farm animals

8
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:32,104
but numbers will be easy to deal with 
just because they're numbers.

9
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:34,248
So let's say I have a set X.

10
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:36,574
It has the distinct objects in it

11
00:00:36,574 --> 00:00:44,170
the number 3, 12, 5, and 13.

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,263
That right there is a set.

13
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:50,000
I could have another set,
let's call that set Y.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,999
I didn't have to call it Y

15
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:54,503
I could have called it A, I could have called it Sal, 
I could have called it a bunch of different things

16
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:55,926
but I'll just call it Y.

17
00:00:55,957 --> 00:01:00,705
And let's say that set Y is a collection 
of the distinct objects

18
00:01:00,705 --> 00:01:08,288
the number 14, 15, 6, and 3.

19
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:11,621
So those are just two set definitions.

20
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:13,970
The way that we typically do it in mathematics

21
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,571
is we put these little curly brackets around the 
objects that are separated by commas.

22
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:22,370
Now let's do some basic operations on sets.

23
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,304
The first operation that I will do is called "intersection".

24
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:36,950
We would say X intersect Y, the intersection of X and Y

25
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,700
X intersect Y.

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,718
The way I think about it is this is going to yield another set

27
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:50,817
that contains the elements that are in both X and Y.

28
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:57,084
I often view this intersection symbol here as "and".

29
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:00,760
So all of the things that are in X and in Y.

30
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,204
What are those things going to be?

31
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:06,227
Let's look at both sets X and Y.

32
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:11,768
The number 3 is in set X, is it in set Y as well?

33
00:02:11,768 --> 00:02:19,560
Sure, it's in both, so it will be in the intersection of X and Y.

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,925
The number 12 is in set X but it isn't in set Y
so we're not going to include that.

35
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:29,434
The number 5 is in X but not in Y

36
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:36,109
and then we have the number 13 that is in X but not in Y.

37
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:42,016
And so the intersection between X and Y 
is the set that has only has one object in it

38
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:44,448
it only has the number 3.

39
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:49,951
So we are done. The intersection between X and Y is 3.

40
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:53,550
Another common operation on sets is "union".

41
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:00,545
You could have the union of X and Y.

42
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:05,028
People often view this as "or".

43
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:09,998
We're thinking about all of the elements that are in X or Y.

44
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:14,501
You can imagine that we're bringing 
these two sets together.

45
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:21,281
The key here is that a set is a collection of distinct objects

46
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:25,743
and the way we're conceptualizing things 
right here, this is the number 3

47
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:29,027
this isn't someboy's score on a test 
or the number of apples they have

48
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:33,028
so there you could have multiple people 
with the same number of apples

49
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:35,828
here we're talking about the object of the number 3

50
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:37,827
so we can only have a 3 once.

51
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:42,785
But a 3 is in X or Y, so I'll put a 3 there.

52
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:45,452
A 12 is in X or Y

53
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:48,567
a 5 is in X or Y

54
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:49,968
13 is in X or Y

55
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:53,709
and just to simplify things, we really don't care 
about order if we're just talking about a set

56
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,771
I've just put all of the things that are in set X here

57
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:59,605
and now let's see what we have to add from set Y.

58
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:02,568
We haven't put a 14 yet, so let's put a 14.

59
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:05,570
We haven't put a 15 yet

60
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,503
we haven't put the 6 yet

61
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:09,636
and we already have a 3 in our set.

62
00:04:09,636 --> 00:04:13,188
So that's the union of X and Y.

63
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:19,048
One way to visual sets and visuals intersections 
and unions and more complicated things

64
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,484
is using a Vien Diagram.

65
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:29,573
Let's say this whole box is the set of all numbers.

66
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:34,949
We have set X, I'll just draw a circle here

67
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,352
and I can even draw the elements of set X

68
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:46,217
so you have 3, 5, 12, and 13.

69
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:50,066
And then we can draw set Y.

70
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:54,041
Notice that I drew a little overlap here 
because they overlap at 3.

71
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,951
3 is an element in both set X and set Y.

72
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:04,183
Set Y also has the numbers 14, 15, and 6.

73
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:10,485
When we're talking about X "intersect" Y, we're talking about where the two sets overlap.

74
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:13,136
So that's this region right over here.

75
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:17,018
The only place that they overlap is at the number 3

76
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:21,350
so that's X intersect Y.

77
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,350
Then X union Y is the combination of these two sets

78
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:32,683
so X union Y is literally everything 
right here that we are combining.

79
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:37,885
Let's do one more example just so we make sure we understand intersection and union.

80
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:47,837
Let's say that I have set A and set A has 
the numbers 11, 4, 12, and 7 in it

81
00:05:47,837 --> 00:06:01,817
and I have set B and it has the numbers 
13, 4, 12, 10 and 3 in it.

82
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:17,530
First of all, let's think about what 
A "intersect" B is going to be equal to.

83
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:21,087
It's the things that are in both sets.

84
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:25,753
I have an 11 here but I don't have an 11 there so that doesn't make the intersection.

85
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:32,631
I have a 4 here and I also have a 4 here so 4 is in A and B.

86
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,161
I'll put a 4 here.

87
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:38,829
The number 12 is in A and B, so I'll put a 12 here.

88
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:46,816
Number 7 is only in A and the numbers 13, 10 
and 3 are only in B so we're done!

89
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:52,485
The set of 4 and 12 is the intersection of sets A and B.

90
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:55,428
If we wanted to, we could even label this as a new set.

91
00:06:55,428 --> 00:07:00,696
We could say set C is the intersection of A and B
and it's this set right over here.

92
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:02,484
Now let's think about union.

93
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:14,031
Let's think about A union B.

94
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:19,291
What are all the elements that are in A or B?

95
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,436
We can just put all the elements in A

96
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:25,435
11, 4, 12, 7

97
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:29,171
and put the things in B that aren't already in A.

98
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:35,561
So 13, (we already put the 4 and the 12), 10, and a 3.

99
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:40,095
I could write this in any order I want, we don't care 
about order if we're thinking about a set.

100
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:44,000
So this right here is the union.
