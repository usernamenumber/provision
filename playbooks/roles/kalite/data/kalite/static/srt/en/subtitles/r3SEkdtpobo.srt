1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,170
In the last video, I told you
that if you had a quadratic

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:10,020
equation of the form ax squared
plus bx, plus c is

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,770
equal to zero, you could use the
quadratic formula to find

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,800
the solutions to
this equation.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,590
And the quadratic
formula was x.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,780
The solutions would be equal
to negative b plus or minus

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,800
the square root of b squared
minus 4ac, all

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,950
of that over 2a.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,240
And we learned how to use it.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,040
You literally just substitute
the numbers a for a, b for b,

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,660
c for c, and then it gives you
two answers, because you have

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,830
a plus or a minus right there.

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,000
What I want to do
in this video is

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,380
actually prove it to you.

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,930
Prove that using, essentially
completing the square, I can

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,540
get from that to that
right over there.

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,190
So the first thing I want to
do, so that I can start

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,600
completing the square from this
point right here, is--

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,635
let me rewrite the equation
right here-- so we have ax--

21
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:08,340
let me do it in a different
color-- I have ax squared plus

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,920
bx, plus c is equal to 0.

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,060
So the first I want to do is
divide everything by a, so I

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,790
just have a 1 out here
as a coefficient.

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,160
So you divide everything by a,
you get x squared plus b over

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,030
ax, plus c over a, is equal
to 0 over a, which

27
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,530
is still just 0.

28
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,620
Now we want to-- well, let me
get the c over a term on to

29
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,880
the right-hand side,
so let's subtract c

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,710
over a from both sides.

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:45,850
And we get x squared plus b over
a x, plus-- well, I'll

32
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,950
just leave it blank there,
because this is gone now; we

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,250
subtracted it from both sides--
is equal to negative c

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,580
over a I left a space
there so that we can

35
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,740
complete the square.

36
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,030
And you saw in the completing
the square video, you

37
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,800
literally just take 1/2 of this
coefficient right here

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,060
and you square it.

39
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,990
So what is b over
a divided by 2?

40
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,800
Or what is 1/2 times b over a?

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,610
Well, that is just b over 2a,
and, of course, we are going

42
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,110
to square it.

43
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,520
You take 1/2 of this
and you square it.

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,500
That's what we do in completing
a square, so that

45
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,770
we can turn this into the
perfect square of a binomial.

46
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,570
Now, of course, we cannot just
add the b over 2a squared to

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,280
the left-hand side.

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,130
We have to add it
to both sides.

49
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:43,750
So you have a plus b over 2a
squared there as well.

50
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,310
Now what happens?

51
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,040
Well, this over here, this
expression right over here,

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:59,250
this is the exact same thing as
x plus b over 2a squared.

53
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,120
And if you don't believe me, I'm
going to multiply it out.

54
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:10,030
That x plus b over 2a squared
is x plus b over 2a, times x

55
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,830
plus b over 2a. x times
x is x squared.

56
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:21,960
x times b over 2a is
plus b over 2ax.

57
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,560
You have b over 2a times x,
which is another b over 2ax,

58
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,580
and then you have b over 2a
times b over 2a, that is plus

59
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,660
b over 2a squared.

60
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,180
That and this are the same
thing, because these two

61
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,910
middle terms, b over 2a plus b
over 2a, that's the same thing

62
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:50,200
as 2b over 2ax, which is the
same thing as b over ax.

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,520
So this simplifies to x squared
plus b over ax, plus b

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,960
over 2a squared, which is
exactly what we have written

65
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,720
right there.

66
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,580
That was the whole point of
adding this term to both

67
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,340
sides, so it becomes
a perfect square.

68
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,970
So the left-hand side
simplifies to this.

69
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,810
The right-hand side, maybe
not quite as simple.

70
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,490
Maybe we'll leave it the
way it is right now.

71
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,160
Actually, let's simplify
it a little bit.

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,339
So the right-hand side,
we can rewrite it.

73
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,960
This is going to be equal
to-- well, this is

74
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,090
going to be b squared.

75
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,220
I'll write that term first. This
is b-- let me do it in

76
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,340
green so we can follow along.

77
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,250
So that term right there
can be written as b

78
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,210
squared over 4a square.

79
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,420
And what's this term?

80
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,270
What would that become?

81
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,730
This would become-- in order
to have 4a squared as the

82
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,640
denominator, we have to multiply
the numerator and the

83
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,280
denominator by 4a.

84
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,590
So this term right
here will become

85
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:58,480
minus 4ac over 4a squared.

86
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,970
And you can verify for yourself
that that is the same

87
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,550
thing as that.

88
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,790
I just multiplied the
numerator and the

89
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,400
denominator by 4a.

90
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,400
In fact, the 4's cancel out and
then this a cancels out

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,930
and you just have a c over a.

92
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,730
So these, this and that
are equivalent.

93
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,460
I just switched which I write
first. And you might already

94
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,980
be seeing the beginnings of the
quadratic formula here.

95
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,700
So this I can rewrite.

96
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,760
This I can rewrite.

97
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,220
The right-hand side, right
here, I can rewrite as b

98
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:37,060
squared minus 4ac, all of
that over 4a squared.

99
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,150
This is looking very close.

100
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,800
Notice, b squared minus 4ac,
it's already appearing.

101
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,470
We don't have a square root yet,
but we haven't taken the

102
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,720
square root of both
sides of this

103
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,670
equation, so let's do that.

104
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,720
So if you take the square root
of both sides, the left-hand

105
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,260
side will just become x plus--
let me scroll down a little

106
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,900
bit-- x plus b over 2a is going
to be equal to the plus

107
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,670
or minus square root
of this thing.

108
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,460
And the square root of this
is the square root of the

109
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,360
numerator over the square
root of the denominator.

110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,040
So it's going to be the plus or
minus the square root of b

111
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,690
squared minus 4ac over the
square root of 4a squared.

112
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,690
Now, what is the square
root of 4a squared?

113
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,820
It is 2a, right?

114
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,390
2a squared is 4a squared.

115
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,580
   

116
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,530
The square root of this
is that right here.

117
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,260
So to go from here to here, I
just took the square root of

118
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,650
both sides of this equation.

119
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,860
Now, this is looking very
close to the quadratic.

120
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,990
We have a b squared minus
4ac over 2a, now we just

121
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,070
essentially have to subtract
this b over 2a from both sides

122
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,740
of the equation and
we're done.

123
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,210
So let's do that.

124
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,640
So if you subtract the b over
2a from both sides of this

125
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,980
equation, what do you get?

126
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:00,080
You get x is equal to negative
b over 2a, plus or minus the

127
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,000
square root of b squared minus
4ac over 2a, common

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,960
denominator.

129
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,640
So this is equal
to negative b.

130
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,500
Let me do this in a new color.

131
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,370
So it's orange.

132
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,980
Negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared minus

133
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,970
4ac, all of that over 2a.

134
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,370
And we are done!

135
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,630
By completing the square with
just general coefficients in

136
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,890
front of our a, b and c, we
were able to derive the

137
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,600
quadratic formula.

138
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,360
Just like that.

139
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,920
Hopefully you found that as
entertaining as I did.
