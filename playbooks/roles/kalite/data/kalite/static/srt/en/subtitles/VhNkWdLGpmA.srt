1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,730
What we're going to do in this
video is, through a bunch of

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,710
examples, familiarize
ourselves with the

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,670
x,y-coordinate plane.

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,810
And first we're going to just
look at some points that are

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,500
already plotted and figure
out their coordinates.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,390
Then we're going to look at some
coordinates and figure

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,290
out where those points are.

9
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,395
Then we'll do one
more problem.

10
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:19,700
So let's figure out
what are the

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,890
coordinates of these points?

12
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,550
So you have this point
right here, A.

13
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,680
So its x-coordinate, you
can see it right there.

14
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,600
You just drop down.

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,800
Where does it intersect
the x-axis?

16
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,346
x is equal to 5.

17
00:00:31,346 --> 00:00:36,960
So it's the point 5 comma and
y is going to be equal to 6.

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,990
5 comma 6.

19
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,920
Now this point B here, what's
the x-coordinate?

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,920
It is 5 to the left.

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,940
5 to the left of the x-axis.

22
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,496
This is negative 5.

23
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:50,590
Its x-coordinate
is negative 5.

24
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,340
y-coordinate is, if you just
go straight to the right,

25
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,210
you're going to hit
y is equal to 5.

26
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,620
y is equal 5.

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,190
Let me switch colors.

28
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,050
C.

29
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,750
I think you're getting
the hang of this.

30
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,040
Let's do the y-coordinate first.
The y-coordinate is 3.

31
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,760
You see that right there.

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,440
And then the x-coordinate
is negative 2.

33
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,130
Negative 2.

34
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,850
You always put the x-coordinate
first. That's

35
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,800
just the convention we use.

36
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,660
D, x-coordinate negative 2.

37
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,210
You see that right there.

38
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,750
y-coordinate negative
2, as well.

39
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,040
Let me get another color.

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,170
E, let's do the y-coordinate.

41
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,650
We'll figure it out first,
but you always

42
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,450
have to write it second.

43
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,780
It's negative 4.

44
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,510
You see that right there,
the y-coordinate.

45
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,420
The x-coordinate is 3.

46
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,820
And then finally, F.

47
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,046
The x-coordinate is 2.

48
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:46,000
And the y-coordinate
is negative 6.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,550
Hopefully that gives you a sense
of at least figuring out

50
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,570
the coordinates.

51
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,550
Now let's go the other way.

52
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,190
Let's start with coordinates
and figure out where those

53
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,600
points are.

54
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,900
So you have this first one.

55
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,560
I'll do it lowercase case a in
parentheses to differentiate

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,200
it from this uppercase A.

57
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,190
So it's at 4 comma 2.
x is equal to 4.

58
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,500
y is equal to 2.

59
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,410
   

60
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,360
So that's that point
right there.

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,855
Let's do the next one.

62
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:15,850
Let me do it in a color that
you'll be able to read.

63
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,150
b.

64
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,680
x is equal to negative 3.

65
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,190
y is equal to 5.5.

66
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,480
So you go all the
way up to 5.5.

67
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,440
y is equal to 5.5.

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,100
So that is the point lowercase
b with parentheses around it.

69
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,050
Then c, 4 negative 4.
x is equal to 4.

70
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,300
y is equal to negative 4.

71
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,190
Right over there.

72
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,610
And then one last one.

73
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,230
I'll do it in orange.

74
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,915
d, x is negative 2,
y is negative 3.

75
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:54,760
   

76
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,140
Right there.

77
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,180
That's the d with parentheses.

78
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,980
And you could have gone
the other way.

79
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,790
You could have said, hey, y
is equal to negative 3.

80
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,690
x is equal to negative 2.

81
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,360
So you could go to the
left and down.

82
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,070
Or you could go down
and to the left.

83
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,610
And you're still going to
get to the same point.

84
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,400
So hopefully that gives you a
good sense of how to figure

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,160
out coordinates.

86
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,160
Or if you're given coordinates,
how to figure out

87
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,550
where to plot something on
the x,y-coordinate plane.

88
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,480
Now let's do a slightly
more involved problem.

89
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,100
So it says the following 3
points are 3 vertices of

90
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,000
square A, B, C, D.

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,440
Plot them on a graph.

92
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,180
Then determine what the
coordinates of the fourth

93
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,030
point, D, would be.

94
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,210
All right, let's plot
these on a graph, as

95
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,230
they tell us to do.

96
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:35,860
All right.

97
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,890
That'll be my y-axis.

98
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,410
That's my y-axis.

99
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,910
The vertical axis.

100
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,160
That'll be my x-axis.

101
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,620
   

102
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,750
And let me put some--
let me mark it.

103
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,800
So that's x equals 1, 2, 3, 4.

104
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,700
This is x is equal to negative
1, negative 2, negative 3,

105
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,460
negative 4.

106
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,000
That's y is equal
to 1, 2, 3, 4.

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,270
This is y is equal to negative
1, negative 2, negative 3,

108
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,590
negative 4.

109
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,350
I could write that
this y equals 4.

110
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,530
This y equals negative
4. x is equal to 4.

111
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,950
x is equal to negative 4.

112
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,180
And let's see.

113
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,649
Let's plot these points.

114
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,970
So first, we have the point
A is equal to negative 4,

115
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,730
negative 4.

116
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,230
So we go x is negative 4.

117
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,810
And then y is negative 4.

118
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,040
So we drop down 4 right there.

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,790
And that is our point A.

120
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,080
Negative 4, negative 4.

121
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,350
And just to familiarize yourself
with a labeling

122
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,790
scheme that you may or may not
have seen before, is that

123
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,600
people label these sections
of the coordinate plane.

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,440
They call this the
first quadrant.

125
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,510
They call this the
second quadrant.

126
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,850
They call this the
third quadrant.

127
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,950
And they call this the
fourth quadrant.

128
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,290
And these are just the Roman
numerals for I, II, III, and

129
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,570
IV, So this point is in
the third quadrant.

130
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,480
When we looked up at this stuff
over here, these points

131
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,840
are in the fourth quadrant.

132
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,160
These are in the third,
second, first. Just an

133
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,430
interesting thing to know.

134
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,920
Sometimes someone might
ask you, what quadrant

135
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,540
is that point in?

136
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,990
And you just say, OK, I see.

137
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,850
If they're both negative,
they're going to be in the

138
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,000
third quadrant.

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,100
If just the y is negative, but
the x is positive, you're

140
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,640
going to be in the fourth.

141
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,560
If they're both positive, you're
in the first. If y is

142
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,760
positive, but x is negative,
you're in the second.

143
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,150
And we'll talk a little
bit about that as

144
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,480
we plot these points.

145
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,880
So point B, x is positive.

146
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,730
It's 1, 2, 3.

147
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,430
And y is negative 4.

148
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,710
So we drop down here into
the fourth quadrant.

149
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,580
That is the point B.

150
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,620
It's 3, negative 4.

151
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,280
So we can already see the bottom
of our rectangle that

152
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,920
they're talking about,
right there.

153
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,700
And notice, both of these
have the exact same y.

154
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,080
They're both at the same
level below the x-axis.

155
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
And then what's the
next point?

156
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,880
Point C is 3 comma 3.

157
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
So 3 comma 3.

158
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,100
It's in the first quadrant.

159
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,600
Both of its coordinates
are positive.

160
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,490
3 comma 3.

161
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,910
Both x and y are positive.

162
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,620
And notice, it's on the
same vertical as B.

163
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,690
It has the same x value.

164
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,460
They both have an
x value of 3.

165
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,220
So it's right above it.

166
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,910
Right above it.

167
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,210
Now we have to figure out
the last point here.

168
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,740
Well, the point is going to
have to be on the same

169
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,760
vertical as this point.

170
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,690
It's going to have to be on
the same vertical as this

171
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,290
point, which means it's going
to have the same x value as

172
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,250
this point.

173
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,320
So its x value is going
to be negative 4.

174
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,360
And then it's going to have to
be on the same horizontal as

175
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,660
this point.

176
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,680
It's going to have
to be on the same

177
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,020
horizontal as that point.

178
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,560
So it's going to have to have
the same y value at the same

179
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,320
height above the x-axis.

180
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,270
So it's going to have to be 3.

181
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,570
So that is our point D.

182
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,850
Notice it's at negative
4, right above A.

183
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,230
And it's at y is equal to 3.

184
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,210
Right to the left of point C.

185
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,980
And we are done.

186
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,266
