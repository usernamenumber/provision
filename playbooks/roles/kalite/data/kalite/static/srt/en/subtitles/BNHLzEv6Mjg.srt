1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450
   

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,250
We're told to look at the
coordinate grid above.

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,830
I put it on the side here.

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,600
Identify one system
of two lines that

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,910
has a single solution.

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,690
Then identify one system
of two lines that

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,270
does not have a solution.

8
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,655
So let's do the first part
first. So a single solution.

9
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:23,040
   

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,370
And they say identify one
system, but we can see here

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,000
there's actually going to
be two systems that

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,650
have a single solution.

13
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,229
And when we talk about a single
solution, we're talking

14
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,170
about a single x and y value
that will satisfy both

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,850
equations in the system.

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,370
So if we look right here at the
points of intersection,

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,170
this point right there, that
satisfies this equation y is

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,970
equal to 0.1x plus 1.

19
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,940
And it also satisfies, well,
this blue line, but the graph

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,180
that that line represents,
y is equal to 4x plus 10.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,530
So this dot right here, that
point represents a solution to

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,460
both of these.

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,950
Or I guess another way to think
about it, it represents

24
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,290
an x and y value that satisfy
both of these constraints.

25
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,890
So one system that has one
solution is the system that

26
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:19,880
has y is equal to 0.1x plus 1,
and then this blue line right

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,800
here, which is y is equal
to 4x plus 10.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,020
Now, they only want us to
identify one system of two

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,650
lines that has a single
solution.

30
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,080
We've already done that.

31
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,730
But just so you see it, there's
actually another

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,730
system here.

33
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,380
So this is one system right
here, or another system would

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,130
be the green line and
this red line.

35
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,900
This point of intersection right
here, once again, that

36
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,740
represents an x and y value
that satisfies both the

37
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:56,930
equation y is equal to 0.1x plus
1, and this point right

38
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,070
here satisfies the equation
y is equal to 4x minus 6.

39
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,240
   

40
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,289
So if you look at this system,
there's one solution, because

41
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,020
there's one point of
intersection of these two

42
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,530
equations or these two lines,
and this system also has one

43
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,000
solution because it has one
point of intersection.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,510
Now, the second part of the
problem, they say identify one

45
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,950
system of two lines that does
not have a single solution or

46
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,740
does not have a solution,
so no solution.

47
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,690
   

48
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,180
So in order for there to be no
solution, that means that the

49
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,840
two constraints don't overlap,
that there's no point that is

50
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,660
common to both equations or
there's no pair of x, y values

51
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,360
that's common to
both equations.

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,840
And that's the case of the two
parallel lines here, this blue

53
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,230
line and this green line.

54
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,410
Because they never intersect,
there's no coordinate on the

55
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,950
coordinate plane that satisfies
both equations.

56
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,420
So there's no x and y
that satisfy both.

57
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,380
So the second part of the
question, a system that has no

58
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,450
solution is y is equal to 4x
plus 10, and then the other

59
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:12,250
one is y is equal
to 4x minus 6.

60
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,680
And notice, they have the exact
same slope, and they're

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,270
two different lines, they have
different intercepts, so they

62
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,660
never, ever intersect,
and that's why

63
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,600
they have no solutions.

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,266
