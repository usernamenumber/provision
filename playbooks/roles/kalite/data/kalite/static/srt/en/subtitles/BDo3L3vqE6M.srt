1
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:07,109
Dr. Francesca Tronchin: Hi, I'm Francesca Tronchin

2
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,026
and I'm going to be talking to you from the Getty Villa

3
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:13,808
in southern California about a crater--that is to say

4
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:17,375
a mixing vessel that comes from the Greek Archaic period

5
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,823
with a scene of Odysseus, the great hero, escaping

6
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:23,386
from the cave of Polyphemus.

7
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:24,504
Dr. Beth Harris: Can I just ask

8
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:25,504
what would have been mixed in here?

9
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:27,472
Dr. Tronchin: Hmm--it's a good question

10
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:31,073
and fortunately an easy one to answer.

11
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:34,804
The Greeks would always mix their wine with water.

12
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:38,535
It sounds kind of strange to us, but Greek wine

13
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:41,404
was evidently very dense and heavy.

14
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:45,171
Some wines could even be mixed with honey and spices and herbs

15
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:45,954
and things like that.

16
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:48,721
And according to the Greeks, only a barbarian

17
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,087
would drink his wine un-mixed.

18
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:53,658
Dr. Steven Zucker: That would be us (sarcastically).

19
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:56,370
Dr. Steven Zucker: Maybe we should start off with a little bit about the story

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,337
Dr. Tronchin: Okay! This comes from the The Odyssey of Homer

21
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:03,488
The story of Odysseus who was on the victorious side

22
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,055
of the Trojan war.

23
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:08,271
One of the great Greek warriors who survived

24
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:10,639
the Trojan war, and he wanted nothing more

25
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:15,021
but to get back home to Ithaca and the island off the coast of Greece.

26
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:17,159
Dr. Harris: And his wife Penelope

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,004
and his son, Telemachus.

28
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:23,638
Dr. Tronchin: But Odysseus had a lot difficulties

29
00:01:23,638 --> 00:01:26,620
in finding his way home, and according to Homer

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,471
it took him about ten years.

31
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:33,337
So what we have here is just one little snippet

32
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:37,370
of a scene that occurs after Odysseus and his men

33
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,736
have spent the night in the cave of Polyphemus--a cyclops.

34
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:44,186
A son of the god of the sea, Poseidon.

35
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:48,654
Dr. Zucker: A cyclops is a giant--and known for having had one eye

36
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:52,503
So the giant had actually trapped these men in the cave

37
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:55,221
with the intention of eating them?

38
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:58,453
Dr. Tronchin: He did snack on a few--like a good barbaian

39
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,837
Polyphemus drank his wine un-mixed

40
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:03,571
and got too drunk and got very angry

41
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:06,421
and started scooping up Odysseus' men

42
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:08,305
and eating them like peanuts.

43
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:11,703
Odysseus and the survivors developed a plan

44
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:13,586
to escape from the cave.

45
00:02:13,586 --> 00:02:16,221
And since Polyphemus was already pretty drunk

46
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,937
and he was passing out, Odysseus and his men

47
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:22,604
took a big long tree trunk, put it in a fire

48
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:25,422
and sharpened the end of it--and Polyphemus

49
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:28,587
passed out drunk--they gouged his eye out.

50
00:02:28,587 --> 00:02:29,370
Dr. Zucker: Lovely!

51
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,403
Dr. Harris: My latin teacher loved to talk about that.

52
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:35,170
Dr. Tronchin: You know--as grizzly as the story is

53
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,288
it's very indicative of a Greek way of thinking

54
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:40,987
You don't treat your house guest badly

55
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:44,155
And that's precisely what Polyphemus had done

56
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:47,620
and so they needed to escape, so they blind Polyphemus

57
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,472
with this giant stake--then the next step to sneaking out

58
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:55,455
of the cave was Odysseus and his men

59
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:59,138
lashed themselves underneath the herd

60
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:02,055
of sheep and rams that Polyphemus had.

61
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:05,821
So as the sheep were walking out of the cave

62
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:08,854
Polyphemus was sort of patting the sheep on the back

63
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:11,903
and he couldn't feel that the men were riding underneath.

64
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:14,236
Dr. Zucker: He was standing guard at the mouth of the cave.

65
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,056
Dr. Harris: To make sure they didn't escape

66
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:19,271
Dr. Tronchin: Yes, and as Odysseus and his men as they

67
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:22,487
are leaving and about to sail away, Polyphemus says

68
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:25,121
"Well the least you can do is tell me your name"

69
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,871
And Odysseus tells him in Greek

70
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:29,222
"My name is Nobody"

71
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:32,287
And so Polyphemus is very angry and he says

72
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:36,422
"Nobody has blinded me and Nobody has stolen my sheep"

73
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:39,370
So the scene that we have here, is really

74
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,687
just a little snapshot of that entire story

75
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:45,587
but you have to remember that a Greek audience

76
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:48,172
would immediately recognize this.

77
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:50,756
One particular scene would be able to

78
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:53,339
recount the entire story.

79
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:55,489
Dr. Zucker: I think there is little extra humor here

80
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,638
because of course this is painted on a vessel

81
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,761
that's meant to serve wine--right?

82
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:02,828
And so it is sort of wonderfully folded into itself.

83
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:04,445
Dr. Tronchin: Oh absolutely, and I think

84
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,528
on a lot of Greek vases designed for drinking wine

85
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:11,212
there are all kinds of life lessons--so to speak.

86
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,845
And this is one of them of course

87
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:15,927
By looking at this little snapshot of the story of Odysseus

88
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:19,761
you remember Polyphemus and you remember not to drink too much.

89
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,611
Dr. Harris: Hopefully. (Laughter)

90
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:23,178
Dr. Zucker: So how is this painted?

91
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:25,246
When we think about ceramics, we think about glazes

92
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:26,913
and this looks very shiny in certain places

93
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:30,194
But the Greeks didn't really have glazes in the way that we understand them

94
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:32,277
Dr. Tronchin: That's absolutely right.

95
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:34,344
What the Greeks used for vase painting

96
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:37,811
--and we use that term "painting" rather loosely

97
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,378
because just the same that it wasn't really glaze

98
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:42,579
it wasn't really paint, but in fact slip

99
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:45,328
which is very watered down clay

100
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:48,163
And this gives us an insight into the tremendous

101
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,744
difficulty of vase painting

102
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:54,027
because after the potter has thrown the vase

103
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,645
on a potter's wheel--he might paint the vase

104
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:59,062
himself--or he might pass it off to someone

105
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:00,478
was exclusively a painter

106
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,945
And in using that slip--that watered down clay

107
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:06,394
and painting on a clay vessel

108
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:10,776
It's almost like painting on a black canvas with black paint

109
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:14,929
There would have been very difficult to see a lot of the areas

110
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:16,961
that had been painted.

111
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:19,829
Dr. Zucker: But now you can see them--so what makes that visible?

112
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:23,795
Dr. Tronchin: That happens through the magic of firing clay

113
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:26,510
Dr. Zucker: And the amount of oxygen that get's into the kiln?

114
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,678
Dr. Tronchin: Yes. The Greeks very early on developed an excellent

115
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:35,330
way of firing their pots like this--and let air in--and out

116
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,413
of the kiln at certain times in the firing process

117
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:42,230
So that all of the areas that were unpainted

118
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,495
remained this clay colored red--this terra cotta reddish orange

119
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:50,227
And all of those place that had been painted--

120
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:53,512
touched by the brush--they turned black through oxidation.

121
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:56,331
Dr. Zucker: And then the artist has gone in

122
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:58,845
and it seems like with a little stylus of some sort

123
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:00,912
etched into that black.

124
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:02,529
Dr. Harris: Did that happen after the firing?

125
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,746
Dr. Tronchin: Yes, yes that happened after the firing.

126
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:06,378
So those details that you see--for example

127
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:10,079
of the arm of Odysseus coming around the side of the ram

128
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,362
Of the ropes that are tying Odysseus to the ram

129
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:16,395
The ram's eye as well--those are all incised in with

130
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:19,961
--like you said--a stylus

131
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:23,945
Another technique that's been used here is added color

132
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:28,379
There are big patches of white in those two big eyes

133
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,331
that are either side of the vessel

134
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:34,462
These eyes that have a very enigmatic meaning to us today

135
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,228
I don't any has quite worked out

136
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:38,762
exactly what those giant eyes mean.

137
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:42,427
And there's also added white along the belly

138
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:44,278
of the ram and for the ram's horns.

139
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,179
Dr. Zucker: Oh yes

140
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:48,194
Dr. Tronchin: And that white was added after the firing process

141
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:51,628
and that explains why a lot of it has flaked off

142
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,778
Dr. Zucker: I'm really interested in looking at Odysseus' face

143
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:56,028
because here he is--his men have been devoured

144
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:59,363
or at least some of them--he's really defying death by escaping

145
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:02,395
and yet as a hero--he looks so calm

146
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:04,545
he looks so beautiful

147
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:06,596
and his face looks so determined

148
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:08,996
Dr. Harris: Well, I think is a characteristic--you could say

149
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:13,643
of Greek art from Archaic and the Classical period

150
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:16,662
that the facial expressions for the most part

151
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:19,414
are really quite blank--and there are some

152
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:22,331
tremendously violent scenes--for example

153
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:25,929
you can think of the pediment of the Temple of Zeus

154
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:30,228
where centars are attacking Greek women and men

155
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:34,446
yet everyone has these perfectly placid facial expressions

156
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:37,695
Dr. Zucker: Why would they do that?

157
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:40,229
Dr. Harris: Is it about transcending the earthly?

158
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:42,763
Dr. Zucker: Or perhaps just the nobility of calm?

159
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,260
Dr. Tronchin: Your guess is as good as mine

160
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,846
Dr. Harris: And this is an example of black figure pottery

161
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,696
Dr. Tronchin: Yes, black figure which was the earliest form of painting

162
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:54,213
on vases like this one--where really you're painting

163
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:57,296
the positive areas--you're painting the objects you see

164
00:07:57,296 --> 00:07:59,725
the tree--the sheep--and so forth

165
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:02,846
rather than red figure where those details

166
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:05,496
where the actual figures as reserved

167
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:08,080
and the background is painted in

168
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,378
Dr. Zucker: So this is silhouette--that a kind of reserve line

169
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:26,743
