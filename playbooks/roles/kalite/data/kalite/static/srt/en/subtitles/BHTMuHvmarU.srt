1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
   

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,900
I think most of us have a sense
that payday loans are

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,010
probably not the best source for
a loan, that they probably

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,420
charge a lot of money to those
people who need that cash

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,135
really badly.

6
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:14,750
And what I want to do in this
video is one, explain what

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,090
they are but even more do
a little bit of math to

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,570
understand really how bad of
an interest that they do

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,100
charge,

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,730
So the way that works is let's
say that I need to buy my wife

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,050
a nice gift for her birthday
that's tomorrow and I want to

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,970
borrow $500.

13
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,600
So I want to borrow $500.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,510
I would suspect that most people
aren't borrowing it for

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,700
some type of a gift, they're
desperate to make the rent or

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,540
pay the utilities or buy food
or who knows what else, but

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,750
whatever your reason, you need
to borrow $500 and I would

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,690
suspect that you have very
little in your bank account,

19
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,900
otherwise you wouldn't go
to the payday lendor.

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,820
And they say all right Sal,
we're open to lending you $500

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,170
and we're not going to do all
of this deep research on how

22
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,500
good of a credit you are and
all of that, but we want a

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,170
couple of things.

24
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,570
One, we want to know your pay
stub and your pay date.

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,590
   

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,760
They're going to want to see
your pay stub, they're going

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,220
to they want to know when you're
going to get paid, so I

28
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,590
guess we call it your payday.

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,400
And they might want some
recent bank statements.

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,380
   

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,050
And the whole reason why they
want these things is they want

32
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,430
to know you know even though
your credit might be horrible,

33
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:39,340
then you're going to get your
salary or you're going to to

34
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,320
get a payment from your employer
probably in two weeks

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,500
on your payday, and then you're
going to be good to pay

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,230
back to the $500.

37
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,000
And to ensure this, so one
they're going to make sure

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,900
that you have a job, that in
your pay stub maybe you make

39
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,830
$1,000 every two weeks or maybe
you make $2,000 every

40
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,220
two weeks so that you're
good for this.

41
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,230
So maybe you maybe make $1,500
every two weeks, so they like

42
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,250
to see that.

43
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,480
Maybe your payday is two weeks
from the day that you're

44
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,699
borrowing it, borrowing
the money.

45
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:15,790
So two weeks from today.

46
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,820
And then your bank statement
shows that your bank kind of

47
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,410
goes up $1,500 and you pay the
rent and the food and then it

48
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,960
goes back close to zero, then it
goes up to $1,500 but they

49
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,100
want to see that this $1,500
is hitting periodically.

50
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,170
And they say, you know,
we're going to give

51
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,310
you the $500 today.

52
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,445
You need to write us a check.

53
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:42,330
   

54
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,370
We want you to write a check for
not $500, for every $100

55
00:02:47,370 --> 00:03:00,370
you borrow, I want you to
pay us back another $25.

56
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,690
So $25 extra.

57
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,370
And at first you might say,
that's not bad, that's 25%

58
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,430
interest. It's high, maybe it
compares to some interest,

59
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,360
some credit cards.

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,050
But this isn't 25% a year, this
is 25% for two weeks.

61
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,900
And at the end of this video,
we're going to do the map on

62
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,790
what that actually turns
into on an APR, or an

63
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,410
effective APR basis.

64
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,560
And these numbers are not crazy,
these are actually very

65
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,960
typical for payday loans.

66
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,780
So if I'm borrowing $500, I
have to give them back the

67
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,570
$500 in two weeks plus
$25 for every $100.

68
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,540
So I'm borrowing $500, so I'm
going to have to do plus five

69
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,390
times 25 five or $125.

70
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,760
So I'm going to write them a
check for $500 plus a $125 so

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,880
that's $625.

72
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,850
I'm going to write a check, but
obviously I don't have the

73
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,650
money in my bank account right
now, otherwise I wouldn't even

74
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,240
be going to the payday loan.

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,520
What I'm going to do on
the date, I'm going to

76
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,310
forward-date this check.

77
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,180
I'm going to put the date, let's
say this is the first of

78
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,070
the month, instead of let's say,
it's January 1, I'm going

79
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,520
to put January 16 and whatever
year I might be doing it.

80
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,709
So I've forwarded it, this
is two weeks from today.

81
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:23,780
Two weeks in the future, and
then I'm going to sign the

82
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:31,780
check and I'll write it's for
a payday loan and I'll write

83
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:39,910
$625 etc. etc., then I have my
little information here.

84
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,220
And I'm going to give them this
check and what they're

85
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,370
going to say is we're not going
to cash this, we're just

86
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,510
going to keep this nice little
check for us and when your

87
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,520
payday hits you have
an option.

88
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:58,250
You can come back to us and give
us $625 in cash and then

89
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,510
we will give you back this check
that is uncashed or if

90
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,950
you don't show up, we are just
going to cash this check.

91
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,070
So one of these two things
are going to happen.

92
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,670
But effectively, if you didn't
lie to them, they're going to

93
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,870
essentially charge you $625
and you can imagine it is

94
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,890
risky for the lender or because
these are people with

95
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,130
you know be maybe shady pay
stubs and obviously they're

96
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,970
desperate, so they weren't
good at managing their

97
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,700
finances, but they're doing
their best to ensure that once

98
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,950
that payday comes in, once
that's that payment from the

99
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,300
employer comes in, that they
get first dibs was on the

100
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,200
money before the person can
pay their rent or their

101
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,790
utilities or their food.

102
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,030
And so that's the general
idea behind it.

103
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,550
Now we start off saying this
probably not a good idea and

104
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,980
you got a sense of that, because
we're essentially

105
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:47,070
paying 25% interest for every
two weeks, not for every year.

106
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,580
But let's think about what
that is on an APR basis.

107
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,040
So let's say we're paying $25
for every $100, that's really

108
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,700
25 per cent.

109
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:01,640
When you say per cent, that
root means hundred, right?

110
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,940
Century, 100 years.

111
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,220
So per cent, it literally
means per 100.

112
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,590
25 per 100, so this is literally
25% interest or we

113
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,655
could write it the traditional
way, this is 25%

114
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:18,625
interest per two weeks.

115
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,970
   

116
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,750
So if we were just calculate a
simple APR, a simple annual

117
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:36,690
percentage interest rate, and
you might want to watch the

118
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,820
video on that to understand that
that just takes your 25%

119
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,490
and then multiplies by the
number of periods in the year.

120
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,860
So we have 52 weeks per year,
but this is every two weeks,

121
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,750
so instead of multiplying it
by 52 weeks, we're going to

122
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,450
multiply by there's 26 two-week
periods in the year.

123
00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:03,535
So times 26 two-week
periods per year.

124
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:08,360
And this is 25% per two weeks.

125
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,950
When you multiply this out, this
is equal to-- let's get

126
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,325
the calculator out-- I'll just
multiply the numbers, I won't

127
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:16,920
do the decimals.

128
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:27,320
25 times 26 equal to 650%.

129
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,900
We're paying an APR of 650%.

130
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
So if you thought the credit
card companies were charging a

131
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,660
lot of interest, charging you
a mid teens interest rate or

132
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,240
20% rate, this is 650%.

133
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,890
It's an one order of magnitude
or to above what even credit

134
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,780
cards charge.

135
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,300
So this is a really, really,
crazy annual percentage rate

136
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,340
and this was just a simple
annual percentage rate where

137
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,670
we multiplied it by 26, this
isn't the effective annual

138
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,685
percentage rate, or the actual
mathematically correct one.

139
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:01,680
To do that, we would actually
have to take-- and you might

140
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,040
want to watch the video on
this-- if you were to let that

141
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,150
just compound, and you can
imagine if you're the payday

142
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,380
lender, you are essentially
getting that compounding if

143
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,000
you keep lending your money
out and if you lend the

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,940
interest you get from the last
person, and you lend that out

145
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,130
the same rate.

146
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,590
To figure out that effective
annual percent rate, you do

147
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,100
1.25, 25% plus 1 to
the 26th power.

148
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,570
We have 26 of these
periods in a year.

149
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,160
And what is that going
to be equal to?

150
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,980
So we have 1.25 to
the 26th power.

151
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,370
And then we get this crazy
number, we're going to want to

152
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,770
subtract a 1 from it, not
that it's going to

153
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,710
change much of our math.

154
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:50,450
So minus 1, and we get, well
let me be very clear--

155
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,550
essentially this is 329
times our money.

156
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,550
So this if this was a one here,
that would be 100%.

157
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,720
So let me just be clear, this
number right here that number

158
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,990
right there is such a high
number it's hard to fathom.

159
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,140
If you were to actually let
money compound at this rate,

160
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,490
and usually they would make
you at least roll over the

161
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,080
principal, so this may or may
not be accurate but that

162
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,550
actual payday lender, if they
actually are able to roll over

163
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,330
the money at this rate, they're
going to have 329

164
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,140
times their money.

165
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,610
Or if you write it as
a percent, it would

166
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,410
literally be 32,987.

167
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,900
Literally, 32,987%.

168
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,560
Or after a year, you'll
essentially have to pay

169
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,480
roughly 330 times your money
back to the payday lender.

170
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,680
And obviously they don't let
you compound like that, but

171
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,590
this just gives you a sense
of how ridiculous this

172
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,550
interest rate is.

173
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,430
I mean, you might have heard
of the term usury.

174
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,960
   

175
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,560
In the past, usury really meant
any kind of interest,

176
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,390
but now in our current cultural
context we associate

177
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,630
it with just an unreasonable
level of interest and that

178
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,450
threshold might be different
for some people.

179
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,050
Some people might say it's
unreasonable to pay 20%, or

180
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,610
30% interest, or 40% annual
interest. But I think everyone

181
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:15,840
would agree that whether you
look at 650% or 33,000%, these

182
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,330
are usurious and reasonable
interest rates.

183
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,310
So you really, at all costs,
unless your life depends on

184
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,260
it, you want to avoid
these payday loans.

185
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,600
