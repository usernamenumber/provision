1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,170
I was sent some problems by
one of the viewers out there.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,760
I believe his name is Cortaggio
or Cortajio, I apologize.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,260
I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,570
But they are really
interesting problems.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,390
What's interesting about them
is that they don't involve

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,300
super-fancy mathematics.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,000
They just involve an elegant
way to apply fairly

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,970
simple mathematics.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,950
So, without me talking too much
about the problems, let's

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,140
try to solve one of them.

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,740
Actually, I don't know where
I'm going to categorize this.

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,770
Either in algebra or in the
brain-teaser playlist,

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,770
or maybe both.

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,950
So, an officer on horseback
starts at the back of a column

15
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,140
of marching soldiers and rides
to the front of the column.

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,160
Then turns around and rides
to the rear of the column.

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,280
If the rider travels three
times as fast as the column

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,310
moves, and the column is 100
meters long -- OK, I think we

19
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,160
have enough information
to start drawing this.

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,090
Let me draw the
column of soldiers.

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,450
I'll just draw this
as a big fat line.

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,630
So, that's the
column of soldiers.

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,310
I'm about to cough.

24
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,480
Excuse me.

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,000
I've learned not to cough
directly in the microphone.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,120
Don't want blow
your speakers out.

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,630
So that's the column of
soldiers right there.

28
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,920
And the problem tells us
that it's 100 meters long.

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,370
So this distance right
here is 100 meters.

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,420
And it's moving with
some velocity.

31
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,640
Let's say, to the right.

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,990
So I'm going to just call
it, it's moving with

33
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,570
some velocity, v.

34
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,090
We'll have to stay abstract
there because it doesn't

35
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,280
tell us the velocity.

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,380
And then we have, what is this, the officer. Is that what they...right.

37
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,740
I wanted to make sure I wasn't giving the incorrect title.

38
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,250
So, an officer on horseback
stars at the back of a column.

39
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,110
So he starts here.

40
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,060
He's on his horse.

41
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,660
He's on his horse.

42
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,875
That's my rendition of the
horse for these purposes, it

43
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,800
has an officer on on the back.

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,170
And he is going to, while the
whole column is going forward

45
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,150
with the velocity, v, he's
going to go to the front of it.

46
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,210
Obviously he can go faster
because he's on a horse.

47
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,640
And then he's going to go to
the back and they want to

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,750
know how far did this
whole column move.

49
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,950
And how fast is he going?

50
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,990
Let's see, if the rider travels
3 times as fast as the column,

51
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,290
if the column is this traveling
with the velocity v, he's going

52
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,720
to be traveling with
the velocity of 3v.

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,110
So let's think
about two things.

54
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,200
Let's think about the time it
takes him to go to the front

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,270
of the column, and the
time it takes to go back.

56
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,603
So let's say t1 is equal
to time to front.

57
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,610
And then t2 would
be time to back.

58
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,840
There might be other ways to
solve this, but this is the

59
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,790
way that's jumping
out into my brain.

60
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,560
So let's figure out what
the time to the front

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,040
of the column is.

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,030
So, over some period of time
-- so, how far is the column

63
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,170
going to move over to t1?

64
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,380
The column is going to move,
well, actually, let me write

65
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,510
a little formula here.

66
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,420
Although I'm sure you
know this formula.

67
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,330
Distance is equal to
rate times time.

68
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,080
Right?

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,360
So, over time 1, how far
does the column move?

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,460
It's going to move v.

71
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,100
v times time 1.

72
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,920
And how far is this
guy going to move?

73
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,740
Well, we're saying over
time, when he moves to

74
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,840
the front of the column.

75
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,645
So, this whole column is
moving to the right.

76
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:28,470
And at the same time,
this guy's moving to

77
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,300
the right faster.

78
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,720
So at the end of time 1, which
I've defined as the time

79
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,020
it takes him to get to the
front, what's true about the

80
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,330
officer on the horseback?

81
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,120
He will have had to travel
100 meters further than

82
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,950
the column, right?

83
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,380
In order to catch up to the
front of the column, he would

84
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,800
have had to go 100 meters
further than the column.

85
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:53,520
So, the distance that the
column travels, plus 100 meters

86
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,040
is going to be the distance
that the officer travels in

87
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,130
the same amount of time.

88
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,580
And what's the distance
that he travels in that

89
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,620
same amount of time?

90
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,520
Well, distance is equal to
rate, 3v, times time, t1.

91
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,320
Time to the front.

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,970
So this is a relationship
between velocity and

93
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,300
the time to the front.

94
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,900
And let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

95
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:22,070
So, if we subtract v t1 from both
sides, we get 100 is equal to

96
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,030
3v t1 minus v t1, that's 2v t1,
and divide both sides

97
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,400
by 2, you get 50.

98
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,630
v t1 is equal to 50.

99
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,120
The velocity of this column of
soldiers times the time it

100
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,760
takes this officer to get to
the front is equal to 50.

101
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, that doesn't
solve our problem yet.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,060
We want to know how far
does the column move?

103
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,730
We have two variables
with one equation.

104
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,110
Not helpful yet.

105
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,110
Let's see if t2 can
help us a little bit?

106
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,630
All right.

107
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,040
I'll switch colors to
ease the monotony.

108
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,210
Time to back.

109
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,420
So, now we're in the opposite
situation, where the

110
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,030
guy's gotten here.

111
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,070
He turns around.

112
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,640
I'd argue, immediately.

113
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,300
He turns around immediately.

114
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,440
And he goes back.

115
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,830
With the velocity of 3v.

116
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,800
So, my question to you as he
starts out here, and relative

117
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,550
to him, he's going this
direction at a velocity of 3v.

118
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,990
And the back of the column
is moving towards him with

119
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,330
the velocity of v, right?

120
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,720
So if you think about it, the
back of the column is going to

121
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,050
be approaching the rider
with the velocity of 4v.

122
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,140
When you have two velocities
that are moving in opposite

123
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,540
directions -- if I move in this
direction, at 60 miles per

124
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,290
hour, and you're moving in that
direction at 60 miles per hour.

125
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,790
Relative to me, if I assume
that I'm stationary, you would

126
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,610
look like you're coming at
me at 120 miles per hour.

127
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,310
So that same idea -- this
officer is going to be

128
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,020
approaching the end of the
column, the back of the column,

129
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,700
with the velocity of 4v.

130
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,420
So how long does it take
them to get to the back?

131
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,950
Well, let's see.

132
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,040
His velocity is 4v.

133
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,110
I'll do that in green.

134
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,070
So his velocity is 4v.

135
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,870
That's how fast he's
approaching the back

136
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,000
of the column.

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,250
And it's going to take him
time 2, times time 2.

138
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,250
And his distance, he's going to
travel 100 meters, because

139
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,720
that's the length
of the column.

140
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,110
Is equal to 100.

141
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,310
And let's see, if we divide
both sides of this by 4,

142
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,520
we got velocity times
time 2 is equal to 25.

143
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,630
And, once again, we have 1
equation with two unknowns.

144
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,000
It doesn't help a lot.

145
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,210
Let's review the problem again
to see if somehow we can use

146
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,050
this information and this
information to solve what

147
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,600
they're asking for.

148
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:49,110
So, they want to know how far
does the column move by the

149
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,130
time the officer arrives back
at the rear of the column.

150
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,470
So, they want to know how far
did this whole thing move over

151
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,320
the entire time of this
problem happening?

152
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,080
What was the entire time?

153
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,910
It was t1 plus t2.

154
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,040
That's the entire time. t1 to
go to the front, and then

155
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,120
t2 to go back to the back.

156
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,040
So how far did the column move?

157
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,050
Well, the column, distance is
equal to rate times time.

158
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,260
So the column will move its
distance -- is equal to the

159
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,330
column's rate, velocity.

160
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,770
And then what's the time
that this whole little

161
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,440
problem occurs on?

162
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Well t1 is how long it
takes the officer to

163
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,680
get to the front.

164
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,330
Plus t2.

165
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,270
So this is what
we're solving for.

166
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,260
This is what we need to know.

167
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,360
We need to know the distance
traveled by the column.

168
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,790
And, once again, we have
all these variables.

169
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,160
But maybe we can do
something interesting.

170
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,890
Let's look at this.

171
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,260
So what is -- so if we just
distribute this, we have

172
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:49,130
distance is equal to v
times t1 plus v times t2.

173
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,900
And do we know what
these things are?

174
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,490
Well, sure.

175
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,760
We were able to kind of stumble
our way into into what

176
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,510
these values are.

177
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,990
And that's what's interesting
about this problem.

178
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,150
We never figured out v.

179
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,680
We never figured out t1 or t2.

180
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,980
But we can figure out
this whole thing.

181
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,590
Because v times t1 --
they tell us, is 50.

182
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,920
So we can substitute
it back here.

183
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,660
So the distance is equal to 50.

184
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,280
Plus, what's v times t2?

185
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,460
Well, we solved it here when we
figured out how long it would

186
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,050
take to go back to the
front of the column.

187
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,960
So that's 25.

188
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,440
So that, we'll put over here.

189
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,370
So the total distance that the
column traveled is 50 plus

190
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,380
25 meters, or 75 meters.

191
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,040
And this is a neat problem,
because they didn't tell us

192
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,610
how fast the column
is actually going.

193
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,720
They're just saying it's v.

194
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,880
They just said that the
officer is going 3 times

195
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,320
as fast, but we don't
know absolute velocities.

196
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,330
But we were still able to
figure out, even without even

197
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,440
knowing the absolute times, we
were still able to figure out

198
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,590
the total distance that
the column travelled.

199
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,080
Anyway, I hope you
enjoyed that.

200
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,840
And if you did, you can thank
Cortagio for the problem.
