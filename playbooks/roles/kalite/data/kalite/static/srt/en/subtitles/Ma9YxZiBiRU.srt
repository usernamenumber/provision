1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
So let's say you were walking down the street

2
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:06,216
and you see this person, this green sickly person

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,845
and this person is coughing and sneezing

4
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:15,660
and you feel really bad for them, they look awful and they must feel awful as well

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,163
and the thought that goes through your mind is

6
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:20,594
How do you avoid getting sick as well?

7
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:22,840
Because you don't want to feel this way either right?

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,204
so you want to think about all the things you can do to make sure that you don't

9
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:28,789
get sick from this person

10
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:31,096
So what are some of those things that you might

11
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:33,805
be able to do to avoid getting sick?

12
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:34,974
Well let's think through it.

13
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:37,444
How are you interacting with your environment?

14
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:39,996
What is the only real way in which you interact?

15
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:42,870
It's when you touch things right?

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,425
You usually have your feet and your body covered up

17
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:49,009
But your hands are always exposed and always kinda touching things

18
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:53,317
and then you usually turn around and touch your mouth, your eyes, your face.

19
00:00:53,317 --> 00:00:57,836
So two real quick things you can do to try to prevent getting sick

20
00:00:57,836 --> 00:01:01,748
are simply making sure that you wash your hands

21
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:03,278
and that's why you always hear that message

22
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:05,953
Wash your hands after you go to the bathroom

23
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:10,131
before you eat, and that's the reason why

24
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:13,663
And the other key message is don't touch your face

25
00:01:13,663 --> 00:01:16,752
You want to make sure you avoid your mouth your eyes your nose

26
00:01:16,752 --> 00:01:19,640
because that's where the viruses get into your body

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,795
So don't touch your face.

28
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:25,129
So these are two really good ideas, right?

29
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:27,577
But are some others? What else can you do?

30
00:01:27,577 --> 00:01:29,655
Well you can try

31
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:32,396
But this isn't always possible. Well you can try to avoid the person altogether

32
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:34,358
You can try and just kind of move away.

33
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:38,125
You can make some distance over here so you are further away from this person

34
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,329
And that's another possible strategy

35
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:43,522
And like I said it doesn't always work but

36
00:01:43,522 --> 00:01:45,984
when you can avoid someone that's always a good idea

37
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,917
So avoid sick people

38
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:56,013
And finally, and this one is going to be the main point of this video

39
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:58,333
Is you can actually get vaccinated.

40
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:04,316
You can get a vaccine that will actually prevent you from getting ill

41
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:07,263
So, flu vaccine is something that a lot of people

42
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:09,331
have strong feelings about

43
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:10,887
and the first thing I want to point out

44
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:13,831
is on this list of prevention, it is probably the most important

45
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:17,806
It is the most effective way of preventing, of getting sick from the flu

46
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:19,648
So certainly think about it

47
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:21,026
But if you're gonna think about it

48
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:23,102
You want to think critically about doing something like this

49
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,574
you want to make sure that it is a good idea

50
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:29,100
Do we really have any evidence that it really does help?

51
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,251
Or is it the opposite?

52
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:34,035
Does flu vaccine actually make you more sick? Does it give you the flu?

53
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:35,230
So let's talk about that

54
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,321
Think through how the vaccine works and what we know about it?

55
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:41,898
There is some research that has been done on flu vaccine

56
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:45,794
I'm going to present you with what we've learned so far.

57
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:49,143
A group out of the University of Michigan came along

58
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:53,608
and they said "Let's figure out the answer to whether vaccine is a good idea"

59
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:57,490
Let's actually take, start over here on the left side

60
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:03,284
Let's take an injection and fill it with salt water

61
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:06,136
So this is regular old salt water

62
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:11,508
or something very similar to it and it has no real effect at all

63
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:15,414
In fact sometimes people call this a placebo, I'll write that over here

64
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:18,059
So that's one side

65
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:21,812
On the other side let's actually come up with a vaccine

66
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:24,810
and this vaccine that I'm going to draw out looks basically the same

67
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,526
It's also an injection

68
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:31,056
And this injection is full of DEAD virus.

69
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:35,281
They literally take live virus, remember live virus has an envelope

70
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:39,840
and it has RNA on the inside, I'm going to sketch that out

71
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,684
And what they do is they actually have different ways of killing it.

72
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:45,661
They literally just destroy this thing

73
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:51,176
And just like human beings, if you're killed you cannot come back to life

74
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:54,111
And a virus is the same way

75
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:56,705
Once a virus is dead it is dead forever.

76
00:03:56,705 --> 00:04:00,832
So this dead virus is lying here on its side

77
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:03,896
Completely and utterly dead , right?

78
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:08,589
And this dead virus, they take it and they put it into the vaccine

79
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:12,113
So this is what is in the vaccine, this is our flu vaccine

80
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:15,299
Let me label it over here, Flu vaccine

81
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,340
So two groups of people then are going to get two different types of injections

82
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,765
And they also had 100's and 100's of people involved in this study

83
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:27,298
But I'm only going to show you a representative slice.

84
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:31,283
So let's say this is 100 people over here and that's a grid

85
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:33,858
So each square represents one person

86
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,355
And there is 100 people over here.

87
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:38,881
They don't know which vaccine they're going to get

88
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,778
They don't know if they're getting the salt water

89
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:42,141
or the flu vaccine

90
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:44,798
They're what we call "blinded" in this study

91
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:48,306
And I should also tell you that these people are very healthy

92
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:53,214
and they're young adults so they're between 18 and 49 years old

93
00:04:53,214 --> 00:04:57,639
They're healthy and the two groups are fairly similar

94
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,926
in terms of the amount of the number of men and women in each group

95
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,825
their age breakdowns and the two side are fairly similar

96
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:08,605
So these two groups get the salt water or the flu and they don't know which is which

97
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:13,043
and they're told over the course of 6 months over the course of the flu season

98
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:18,744
to keep track of illnesses and if they get flu I'm going to sketch them out in red

99
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:24,501
What they actually did is they said if you get the flu let us know and we will confirm it

100
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:29,544
Actually do a lab test to make sure it really is the flu and not just some other illness

101
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:33,992
that you think you have. So they actually took all these people that said they have the flu

102
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:39,563
and I'm only going to draw them in red if they were confirmed by PCR

103
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:41,848
that was the lab technique they used

104
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:47,213
So these are PCR confirmed so that's laboratory confirmed

105
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,185
illness with flu

106
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:53,494
So this is people with PCR confirmed illness

107
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:58,057
And you can count them out. Out of 100 people in the first group, in the salt water group

108
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:06,814
we had a total of 10 individuals. So that 10% percent of these folks were ill with the flu

109
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:08,133
over the flu season

110
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:13,869
And on the flu vaccine side we also had some people sick with the flu

111
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:21,558
So that is the first thing you should know is that the flu vaccine does not prevent you 100% from getting the flu

112
00:06:21,558 --> 00:06:23,702
But look at how many people I shaded in.

113
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:29,549
In the placebo side I said there were 10 out of 100 people that got sick

114
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:35,205
and on the flu vaccine side only about 3 out of 100 people got sick.

115
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:40,085
And both, I should put arrows on both sides, were PCR confirmed.

116
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:43,507
So what does this mean? How do you take this and make some sense out of it?

117
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:46,662
There is a term called Vaccine Efficacy

118
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:55,156
And what it refers to is how good is the vaccine at preventing you from getting sick

119
00:06:55,156 --> 00:07:00,031
So this is the term vaccine efficacy and sometimes you might even see the term VE

120
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:03,755
Sometimes people use VE for vaccine efficacy

121
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,732
And the way you calculate it, you say

122
00:07:05,732 --> 00:07:09,943
VE equals the proportion of people that got sick

123
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:13,220
with the salt water, that was 10 out of 100

124
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:19,058
minus the proportion that got sick with the flu vaccine, so minus 3 out of a hundred

125
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:23,822
and you divide by the group that did not get vaccine

126
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:26,576
and so you can take this and you can simplify it

127
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:29,695
you say this is basically 7 over 100

128
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:35,383
divided by 10 over 100. And you can make it even simpler by cancelling the 100's out

129
00:07:35,383 --> 00:07:37,782
And this is seven tenths (7/10)

130
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:43,265
And to make a percent out of it you multiply 7/10ths by 100 %

131
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:49,333
So if I were to describe the VE or the vaccine efficacy based on this study

132
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:54,829
I would say well flu has a 70% vaccine efficacy

133
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:57,568
So you see how we got that number. It's fairly simple

134
00:07:57,568 --> 00:08:01,891
Just comparing the two groups to each other. And there have been many studies on the flu

135
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:06,774
And the CDC took all this data and they said well in general the VE

136
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:14,298
or the vaccine efficacy for the flu vaccine is usually between 60 and 70 %

137
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:17,965
That's kind of the number they usually quote for this vaccine

138
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:21,597
So take that number, 60 to 70 % VE

139
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:23,073
I'm going to write that down here

140
00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:25,063
so we don't lose track of what that is

141
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:29,730
And lets take it back up here to our little example

142
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,300
We said that there are a few ways to try to prevent the flu

143
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,286
And if I imagine now that there is a force field around me

144
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:40,449
Let's say there is a little purple force field around me

145
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:44,264
And this force field protects me from germs.

146
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:48,537
I'm going to show germs kind of coming in and bouncing off my force field.

147
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:55,052
Well this would be really accurate if I was describing 100% vaccine efficacy

148
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:59,978
meaning if I get the vaccine I am completely unable to get sick.

149
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:03,655
But we know that is not true. That it is actually closer to 60 to 70 %

150
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:05,695
So for 60 to 70%

151
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:11,011
Let me show you what you can kind of change this picture to look like.

152
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:16,389
Instead of making it completely impenetrable you can just draw a few holes in it.

153
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,613
So a few holes there, maybe a hole there, and maybe a hole down here.

154
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:25,929
So now you can show a few of the germs kind of breaking through and getting in.

155
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:32,087
Maybe getting in over here. But many of them actually still kind of bounce off

156
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:37,934
And so you are still protected by a lot of the germs but some of them can still get you sick.

157
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:42,351
Probably the best way to avoid getting sick is to get your vaccine

158
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:43,933
but still make sure you wash your hands

159
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:46,333
Don't touch your face and avoid sick people
