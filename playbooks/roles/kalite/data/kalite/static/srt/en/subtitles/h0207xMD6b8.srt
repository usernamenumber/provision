00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:04,574
I want to clarify some of the terminology I used in the last video.

2
00:00:04,574 --> 00:00:11,819
But before I do that, let's just make sure that we understand the mechanism of how arteries get blocked.

3
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:16,556
So in the last video we talked about these plaques forming, and if this plaque is unstable

4
00:00:16,556 --> 00:00:23,800
at some point it could rupture. And when it ruptures, this material can flow out into the bloodstream.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,813
Two things will happen--I want to make it clearer relative to the last video,

6
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:35,132
especially since I can zoom in on these arteries--two things can happen:

7
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:48,924
Plaques, or I should say, clotting factors can clot these released pieces from the plaque.

8
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:54,172
And the other thing that can and will happen--and I didn't talk about this in depth in the last video--

9
00:00:54,172 --> 00:01:00,116
When this thing ruptures, you can also have blood clots form here.

10
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:06,572
Let me just draw this in a reddish color, because you can have blood clots form on the ruptured plaque.

11
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:12,841
So, everything: the part of the plaque that hasn't moved can experience clotting,

12
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:18,553
and the part of the plaque that is dumped in the bloodstream can also clot.

13
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:23,940
And in the last video we saw that one of these clots can go downstream to some point

14
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,166
where the arteries get narrow enough so that they actually block the arteries.

15
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:38,987
And that restricts the blood flow, so all of a sudden you do not have any blood flow going that way,

16
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:43,677
and all of the muscle tissue that needs the blood flow from this point,

17
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:49,993
that needs oxygen from that, it might die in a mild myocardial infarction, or even a heart attack.

18
00:01:49,993 --> 00:02:01,742
Now, what I want to clarify is the actual terminology--[the last video] was a little bit "hand wavy"

19
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:03,971
with the terminology, and I want to go deeper here.

20
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:09,498
This actual clot that forms, that can restrict the blood vessel, this is a thrombus.

21
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:16,464
Thrombosis is the process of a thrombus forming.

22
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:23,383
So [thrombi] are these blood clots that form, that can help to obstruct a blood vessel.

23
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:32,625
So this thrombus right here is going to make it harder for the blood to flow through this vessel.

24
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:37,501
Now any of these released pieces or chunks in any of these blood vessels,

25
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:43,027
that can float around and eventually lodge themselves in and eventually block the blood flow,

26
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:49,297
these are called emboli, or if I use it in the singular, one of these is an embolus.

27
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:57,377
I want to be clear, embolus is the general term for anything that can float around in your blood

28
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:04,668
and eventually lodge itself at some point in your circulatory system and restrict blood flow.

29
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:11,402
What we drew in the last video--and this one as well--these emboli that are also clotted,

30
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:20,040
they are also thrombi and emboli at the same time, this would be called a thromboembolus.

31
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:37,316
So it would not be wrong to call it an embolus, but in particular if you know it is a thromboembolus,

32
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:42,703
you know it is the clotted material from a released plaque that can go lodge itself.

33
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:46,650
In the last video I called this a thrombosis but that's really not quite right,

34
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,387
thrombosis is the formation of the clot that can restrict the blood flow,

35
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:59,049
but when it breaks off, becomes an embolus, and lodges itself further off and restricts blood flow,

36
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,325
this is called a thromboemoblism.

37
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:13,167
Hopefully I'm not confusing too much--these medical terms confuse ME a lot--

38
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:19,158
but I want to make it very clear, thrombosis is formation of a blood clot inside of a blood vessel

39
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,805
than can restrict the flow of blood.

40
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:24,406
So this right here is thrombosis occurring.

41
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:34,715
Once things break off and become an embolus--that's the general term for it--and in particular,

42
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:39,824
if it's broken off material that is due to a clot, it is a thromboembolus.

43
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:43,957
So, thromboembolus is a more specific way of calling it an embolus,

44
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:49,065
and once one of these things lodge themselves and block the blood flow,

45
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:54,081
that's a thromboembolism. You can also call it an embolism.

46
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:58,818
Just that when you say, "thromboembolism," it specifies it as clotted material.

47
00:04:58,818 --> 99:59:59,999
Hopefully that clarifies things and doesn't confuse you to much.
