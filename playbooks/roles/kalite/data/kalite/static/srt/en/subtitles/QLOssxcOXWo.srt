1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Determine the sine of 135 degrees the cosine of 135 degrees and teh tangent of 135 degrees so lets start off

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just by drawing a 135 degree angle in standard position so to do that let me draw some axis and I'll

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
put a unit circle on that axis that's about as good as I can hand draw

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the unit circle and let me mark this up I'll mark it up a little bit neater

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is when x is equal to one and this is when y

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to one. this is when y is equal to

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negitive no excuse me this is when x is equal to negative onw

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is when y is equal to negitive one and the only reason why I had to draw

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
kind of a dotted line is that I find it easier to draw a dotted line we can fill it

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in and it actually should be a filled in line

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so there you go

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now lets draw a 135 degree angle in standard position so lets sit the vertex of that angle

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at the origin, let me do this in a new color so this is going to sit at the origin

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the initial side is going to go along the positive x-axis

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just like that draw it as a ray. and then the terminal side since it's a positive

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
135 degrees we're going to go in a counterclockwise

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
direction if we go straight up to the y axis that gives us

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
90 degrees we have to get to 135 so we have to go another 45

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we have to go another 45 it takes us about right about

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
half way or exactly half way

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
through the second quadrant so it takes us right over there.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that is 135 degree angle

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now we know from our

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the unit circle definition of trig function that the intersection between

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the terminal side and the unit circle is going to have some coordinates

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(x,y) we know from the unit circle definition

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that x is equal to the cosine

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of 135 degrees in this case and y

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to equal the sine of 135 degrees

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we know that y over x is going to be

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to the tangent of 135 degrees

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if we can figure out this intersection point the x and y coordinates we've essintially figured out

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this entire problem.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and there is a little bit of a hint, what i'm going to do is create a triangle here and this really

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
does show the connection that show's that the unit circle definition is really just an extention

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the traditional soh cah toa right trainagle definition so what i'm going to do

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is drop, i'm gonna do is create a right triangle

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me do it in a different color a color different from

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the unit circle so i'm going to drop a right triangle here

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's 90 degrees this magenta line has gone straight down

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if we can figure out the base

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if we can figure out this distance, let me do it in a different color here, if we can figure out this blue distance

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we know that it's in the negative direction so if this blue distance

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is what ever it might be, the negative value of that

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because we're going to the left of the origin is going to be our x coordinate and whatever

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this height is in magenta that's going to be out y coordinate do you see it right over here so the x coordinate

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is where ever this blue distance takes us to the left

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the height in magenta is out y coordinate

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets think about what we know about this triangle

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so my first question to you is what is the

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
length of the hypotenuse of this triangle

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here the one that is formed between these points the origin

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the intersection between the unit circle and the terminal side of the angle and where this

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and where this vertical line intersects the x-axis so these three points

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here what is the hypotenuse formed by these three points

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well this hypotenuse right over here

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this distance this distance right over here it is a radius

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it is a length of the radius of the unit circle and by definition the unit cirle has a

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
radius of length one so the hypotenuse here has length

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
has length one. Now my second question

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to you is can you figure out the angles of this triangle

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in particular can you figure out the measure

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can you figure out the measure of this orange angle

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over there? Well let's think about it.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is essintally or it deffinitely is

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
suplementary to the 135 degrees. 135 plus this orange

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
angle must be equal to 180 degrees

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so 180 minus 135 gives us

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
45, 45 degrees.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is often refered to as the reference angle. It

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is that positive angle

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
between the terminal side of an angle whether that

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
135 degree angle and the x-axis.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now my next question to you

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is can you figure out the last angle in this triangle? We know that is one is a right angle we know that this one is 45

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
degrees can you figure out what this top angle is right over here.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well we know that the angles in a triangle

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
have to add up to 180 degrees

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if you call this angle theta, if you call that angle theta we know that theta

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus 45 degrees plus 90 degrees

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
must add up to 180 degrees

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or theta plus 135 must add up to

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
180 so if you subtract 135 from both sides you get that

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
theta is equal to 45 degrees so this is also equal to 45 degrees.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me zoom in

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on this triangle because it

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is getting a little bit messy so let me zoomin

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is the exact same triangle i'm just going to blow it up and I'm going to try to use the exact same colors.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is just a zoomed in version of the same triangle this right over here

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is a right angle we know that the hypotenuse has length

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one it's opposite the right angle, we know that this

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
angle right over here is 45 degrees

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we know that this angle up here is 45 degrees

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so my next question to you is can we figure out

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the length of these sides?

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the first thing, well i'll let you think about that for a second.

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The first thing you might realize from your traditional geometry

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is that this a triangle that has two angles that are the same

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if the two angles are the same the two sides here are going to be the same aswell

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we know from our geometry that this side is equal to that side.

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some times it's easier to visualize if you have a triangle like this and these two base angles

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are congruent then you know that these two sides are congruent this is one of the fundamental things

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we learned in geometry, this is just reoriented in a different way.

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we know those those two sides are going to be the same thing.

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and what we're eventually going to realize

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that triangles like this 45 45 90 triangles we're going to use the pythagorian

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
theorem this time but, these are good triangles in general to know the ratio

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you know that the two sides are going to be equal and that the ratio between them and the hypotenuse

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but we'll figure it out this time. So we can use the Pythagorian

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Theorem, we can call that x actually let me not call them x
