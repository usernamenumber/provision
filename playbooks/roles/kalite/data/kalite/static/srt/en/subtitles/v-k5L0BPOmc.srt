00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:04,600
Determine in the data in the table is direct, inverse

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,333
or joint variation. Then identify the equation that

3
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:12,467
represents the relationship. So lets just think about

4
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:15,667
direct , inverse of joint variation means.

5
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:22,200
Direct variation - if y varies directly with x

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,933
if y = constant multiple of x. if you divide both sides by x

7
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:35,533
y / x = k, so the ratio betwen y & x is some constant

8
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:44,000
and you can go the other way around x = consta x ynt

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,533
or x/y = k these are not the same k

10
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:56,000
I am saying these are constant relationship

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,467
inverse relationship is some degree the opposite.

12
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:16,600
If x increases y should increase in direct variation.

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:30,533
if you increase x by some factor x going up by 3x

14
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:56,600
then y should also increase by the same factor 3

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,600
inverse variation you have y being some constant over

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,533
1/x; y = k x 1/x

17
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:14,933
if you multiply both sides by x then you have x.y = k

18
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:35,533
If you increase x they y will go down

19
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:41,200
and if you take x and increase by a factor of 3

20
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:50,600
you are decreasing this by a whole factor of 1/3

21
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:58,333
so then you are going to reduce y by 1/3

22
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,467
now finally they talk about joint variation

23
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:07,733
joint variation deals with more than one variable

24
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:16,600
if area of a rectangle = length x breadth, this is

25
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:24,667
a example of joint variation. area depends on two variables

26
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:34,933
joint variation deals with more than two variables

27
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:50,800
as x goes from 1 to 2, y is going from 12 to 6

28
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:59,333
if x is going up by 2, y is oming down by 1/2

29
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:08,800
as x goes from 1 to 3, y is multipled by 1/3

30
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,867
this is not direct variation as x increases

31
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:21,667
y is decreasing this is going to be inverse variation

32
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:24,133
when x increases by a certain factor,

33
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,667
y is decreasing by the same factor.

34
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:39,000
if x is increasing by 3, y is decreasing by 1/3 of the

35
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,933
original value. So we have inverse variation in place.

36
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:53,667
They ask identify the equation that represents this relationship

37
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:57,267
we know that inverse variation the product of x and y

38
00:04:57,267 --> 00:05:03,600
needs to be some constant. let me make another

39
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:14,933
column x times y, 1x12 = 12; 2x6=12; 3x4=12; 4x3=12

40
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:19,600
clearly in every situation x.y = 12

41
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,234
so the equation that represents the relation ship is

42
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:22,867
x.y = 12
