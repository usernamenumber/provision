1
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:08,139
We're at the Prado in Madrid and we are looking at Fra Angelico's Annunciation.

2
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:15,739
Now, the Annunciation by Fran Angelico that most people are familiar with is a fresco that's in San Marco in Florence

3
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:20,272
This is a painting that was made for a church not far from Florence,...

4
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:21,471
in Fiesole

5
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:27,874
It is extraordinary in that the frame is original and so not only do you have the main panel,

6
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:32,072
but you've got the predella underneath with all of its original framing elements.

7
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:33,305
I'm not sure that I've ever seen that.

8
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:37,105
These things were often taken apart and sold in pieces.

9
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:46,324
We have an Old Testament scene of Adam and Eve being cast out of the Garden of Eden, or "The Expulsion," by an angel.

10
00:00:46,324 --> 00:00:51,489
And, actually, that scene is joined to the annunciation scene, because in the upper left...

11
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,256
...we see the hands of God releasing this divine light

12
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:01,388
and a dove, which you can see just to the left of the column, which is the Holy Spirit.

13
00:01:01,388 --> 00:01:05,022
So we have, actually, The Fall and then the reason for Christ's existence.

14
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:09,088
And Adam and Eve as the precursors to Mary and Christ.

15
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:15,688
So the man and woman that cause the fall from grace and Mary and Christ who make salvation possible.

16
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:22,171
And then we have God the Father looking down, in an almost classical relief sculpture in the center just above that column.

17
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:29,138
The predella below, is a very condensed series of scenes of the life of the Virgin Mary,

18
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:35,772
from her birth, to her marriage to Joseph, to The Visitation, through to her death. Through to her death, that's right.

19
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:40,721
And they are...really meant, in a sense, to be the literal support for this later story.

20
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:45,806
So, stylistically, one of the things I find quite important is...

21
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:52,054
this sense of quiet and solemnity that Fra Angelico is able to achieve.

22
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:56,888
You have the angel who is bowing below Mary.

23
00:01:56,888 --> 00:02:04,238
His hands are crossed, which is a symbol of respect, of prayer. Mary reflects that with her own hands.

24
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:11,822
I'm really taken by the density of the Garden of Eden, all of the fruit, those flowers.

25
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:16,971
That wonderful, anti-perspective field of flowers below the feet.

26
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:22,754
And then you have this stark architecture, they are both too large for the space that they occupy...?

27
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:26,188
Oh, absolutely. I think if Mary were to stand up, she would hit her head on the ceiling.

28
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:36,372
But none of that is really important because this is a kind of reverential and invented exploration of beauty as a way of representing the divine.

29
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:42,072
So this is painted contemporaneous with Masaccio painting the Brancacci Chapel.

30
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:46,821
So we have two radically different approaches going on in Florence at the same time.

31
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:56,138
And I think that's a good reminder that not everything in the Renaissance is this linear movement toward naturalism. But this kind of variety of styles.

32
00:02:56,138 --> 00:03:07,506
Whereas Masaccio is looking for an almost mathematically accurate rendering, here we see an artist who is looking to celebrate the decorative as a way of expressing the moral and the spiritual.

33
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:14,188
Yeah, and if you look there are no cast shadows, there is not that kind of intense modelling that we see with Masaccio.

34
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:20,479
There's not a lot of specificity to the faces, and individuality in the faces. But there is specificity to the decorative.

35
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:31,172
I mean, look at the wings of the angel. Yeah. Or the gilding of the halos. Or just the the foliage in the garden. Its just sumptuous.

36
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:31,749
It is.
