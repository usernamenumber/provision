1
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:18,415
Steven: We're in the museum of modern art

2
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:21,999
and we're on the 4th floor in the rooms devoted to abstract expressionism

3
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:27,828
and we're standing in front of Mark Rothko's No. 3/No. 13

4
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,462
which dates to 1949

5
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:33,660
Beth: Those abstract expressionists love to <i>not</i> name their paintings

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,743
in fact, it's sort of a modernist problem

7
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:37,130
Steven: It is, it is

8
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,663
Beth: Composition number...blah

9
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:41,538
Steven: Well, they didn't want to close down meaning, right?

10
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:44,243
Beth: I understand, that ambiguity is incredibly important

11
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:45,495
for artists in the 20th century.

12
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:48,331
Steven: It is. But I think the weird No. 3/No. 13 part

13
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:53,127
I wonder if that has to do with the curators trying to figure out really what this thing was called

14
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:54,334
and not being sure about it

15
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:55,472
Beth: Yeah, that could be it.

16
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,334
Steven: I have no idea, actually.

17
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:59,265
Beth: You know, it's interesting cause Rothko is an artist that

18
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:03,833
even at a time when I a little bit put off by abstract painting

19
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,970
I always loved the Rothko's

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,332
They have a kind of brooding heaviness about them

21
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:12,000
Steven: A gorgeous melancholy

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,828
Beth: Yeah!

23
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:17,264
And I don't think I even knew why it made me feel that way

24
00:01:17,264 --> 00:01:20,803
Steven: I think Rothko would have been really, really happy to hear you say that

25
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:24,748
I think Rothko really wanted people, in fact, I seem to remember a quote where he said

26
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:27,574
if people understood his paintings, they would be in tears before them

27
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:29,423
Beth: Yeah, I think it did that to me

28
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:35,832
Steven: There's something wonderful solemn and, almost the kind of feeling you sometimes get when you look at stained glass windows in a Gothic cathedral

29
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:39,264
Yeah, there's something incredibly, sort of, awesome about it.

30
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:43,660
Beth: And so, what is it that evokes those feelings, really

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,265
You know, it's a lot of things

32
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:47,750
It's the "horizontality"

33
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:55,994
it's the way that the forms are, sort of, behind and in front and have no edges and kind of hover

34
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:59,742
Steven: Until you said, "no edges" and "hover", it sounded like you were talking about a Mondrian

35
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:04,470
Beth: Yeah, but, also there's that kind of way you can kind of see underneath the paint

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,189
and you know sometimes it comes in front

37
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,911
It's a kind of incompleteness, and...

38
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:11,867
Steven: A kind of finding, it's a process, right?

39
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:16,250
You can feel almost Rothko's efforts to find his way through this

40
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,046
and you know there's...

41
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:19,745
Beth: Now you sound like we're talking about a "Cezanne"

42
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:20,531
Steven: Oh that's interesting.

43
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:22,664
But I think there are elements of "Cezanne" and "Mondrian" here

44
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:24,470
which is not what you would think of at first

45
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,334
Beth: No

46
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:26,866
Steven: I think that these are paintings that

47
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:28,860
as you were saying that, you were moving your hands back and forth

48
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,867
and I think that this is exactly right.

49
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:32,932
It took me a while to figure this out about Rothko

50
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:35,206
but I think that these are paintings about space

51
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,416
rather than color

52
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,658
I mean, color is important, obviously

53
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,764
and color is gorgeous

54
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:42,417
These are forms, these almost clouds of forms

55
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:45,463
that exist in some sort of space of their own construction

56
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:46,263
Beth: That makes sense.

57
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:48,666
Steven: And it's interesting when you said the "horizontality"

58
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,262
because they are horizontal paintings,

59
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:51,129
even though...

60
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,159
Beth: In that, it's a vertical image

61
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,461
Steven: The canvas is vertical

62
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,266
Beth: Yeah

63
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:57,078
Steven: But they create an occupy space in a very important way

64
00:02:57,078 --> 00:03:00,130
and the heaviness of that black form,

65
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,613
that sort of cloud of black rectangle

66
00:03:02,643 --> 00:03:03,665
soft at its edges

67
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:04,470
Beth: So ominous

68
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,064
Steven: And because it's high

69
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:10,129
it's center of gravity is ever more powerful, do you see what I mean?

70
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,433
Beth: Well, I feel like almost it pulls me into it.

71
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,335
Steven: It does, right.

72
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:14,417
Beth: Is that what you mean by the?

73
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:19,538
Steven: Yeah, well I think so, but it also presses down vertically on the cream white below,

74
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:23,731
the line of dark blackness below that and the green below that, absolutely

75
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:25,006
Beth: It's oppressive.

76
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:27,577
Steven: This is kind of incredible luminosity that exists here

77
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:32,863
but actually according to some conservators, Rothko's colors have lost a lot of their edge

78
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:36,330
and I wonder what they would have looked like, even been more luminous

79
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,396
Beth: They're very vivid.

80
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:40,998
Steven: So, this notion that one's not after a sort of finished product

81
00:03:40,998 --> 00:03:43,247
but that these are process-oriented paintings

82
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:46,197
you know the famous term that Rosenberg used was "Action Painting"

83
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:49,395
we don't usually think about that term in relationship to Rothko

84
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:53,185
because there's a kind of centrality and a kind of balance that's...

85
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:57,137
Beth: Well, and when you think of action you think about Pallega, you know, leaning over the...

86
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:00,332
Steven: But I think there is a kind of "provisional-ness" and a process of finding,

87
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:05,942
I think you're absolutely right, which is very much tied to the artist and his experience in the making of this canvas

88
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:10,169
and I think that the "authentic-ness" of the canvas can really be embedded in that notion

89
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:13,502
Beth: Of finding, of the artist exploring

90
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:14,933
Steven: Finding and feeling, yeah

91
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,412
I think that's exactly right, you know it's interesting, because...

92
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:20,529
Beth: So, there's a kind of turn toward the psyche of the artist

93
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,524
Steven: Exactly right, this is an expression of the interior

94
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:24,749
but, sort of funny, is that in the next generation

95
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:27,415
some artists will begin to disavow that

96
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:28,864
Beth: Complete rejection of that

97
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:31,460
Steven: Right, because this is seen as a kind of psycho-analytic heroism

98
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,859
growing out of the European surrealism, etc.

99
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:36,334
Growing out of Jung, out of Freud

100
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:39,581
but in a kind of purely American idiom, native american kind of scale

101
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,665
this sort of grandeur and space

102
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:46,680
Beth: Right, so use Worhol as a kind of reaction to the soup cans

103
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,728
Steven: Absolutely, or Rauschenberger, even Jasper

104
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:54,797
Beth: That sort of statement that art is about, is <i>not</i> about some kind of inner psychic state, right

105
00:04:54,797 --> 00:05:00,203
Steven: But, this is in some ways a very beautiful and expressive kind of romanticism in that way, isn't it?

106
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:01,100
Beth: I think so.
