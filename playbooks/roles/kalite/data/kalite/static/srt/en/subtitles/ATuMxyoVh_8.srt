1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,299
In early August 1914,

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:06,271
we know that Germany declares war on Russia

3
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:08,300
just as Russia is mobilizing troops

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,893
to get into a war

5
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:11,967
with the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

6
00:00:11,967 --> 00:00:13,283
Because the Austro-Hungarians

7
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:15,721
have declared war on Serbia,

8
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:19,135
and the Russians use protection of Serbia

9
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:21,636
as a pretext for getting into a war

10
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:23,215
with the Austrians.

11
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:24,293
The Germans have an alliance

12
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:25,862
with the Austrians, so they feel

13
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:27,560
the need to fight the Russians;

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,093
and because the Russians have an alliance

15
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:30,426
with the French,

16
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:32,026
to fight the French as well.

17
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:34,693
The first combat on the Eastern Front

18
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:36,868
actually happens with Russia

19
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:38,447
fighting on the offensive.

20
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:40,160
There a 2 Russian armies:

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,493
the Russian 1st Army

22
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:43,426
and the Russian 2nd Army

23
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:46,493
attacking the Germans in Eastern Prussia.

24
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:49,560
They were up against one German army:

25
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,560
the German 8th Army

26
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,293
and in theory, it should have been a rout

27
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:54,794
of the German 8th Army.

28
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:55,893
They had them outnumbered,

29
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:57,426
you had 2 Russian armies

30
00:00:57,426 --> 00:00:58,788
coming from different directions,

31
00:00:58,788 --> 00:01:00,426
but because of really bad coordination,

32
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:02,426
one could even argue: bad leadership,

33
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:04,093
and other tactical problems,

34
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:06,492
it was actually a rout the other way.

35
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:08,960
So World War 1 on the Eastern Front

36
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,626
starts very badly for the Russians.

37
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:13,626
You actually had a huge rout of them

38
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:15,693
at the Battle of Tannenberg.

39
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:19,293
Tannenberg is interesting,

40
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:20,626
because it did not actually

41
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:22,160
happen in Tannenberg.

42
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,560
Tannenberg is around here;

43
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,258
it wasn't far from the battle

44
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:26,826
but there were other cities

45
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:29,760
the battle could have been named for.

46
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,493
But since the Germans won the battle,

47
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:33,226
they named it Tannenberg

48
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,693
because there was an ancient battle

49
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:36,760
in mediaeval times, in the 1400's,

50
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,626
where the Slavic and Sub-Slavic peoples were able

51
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:41,626
to rout German Teutonic knights.

52
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:44,360
These were mediaeval battles with knights.

53
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,160
In order to redeem that,

54
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,160
they labeled this other war

55
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,826
of Germans against Slavic people

56
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:54,893
as the second Battle for Tannenberg.

57
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:58,360
So it helped to bring out German patriottism.

58
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,026
But this was a major rout for the Russians.

59
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:03,826
The 2nd Army in particular

60
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,960
got completely decimated.

61
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,760
The Russian 2nd Army went in to the battle

62
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,960
with an estimated 150,000 to 180,000 troops.

63
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,093
Roughly half were killed.

64
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:22,293
Only about 10,000 escaped the battle of Tannenberg.

65
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:24,892
It was such a humiliating defeat

66
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:27,026
for the Russian 2nd army

67
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:29,159
that its general,

68
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:37,693
general Samsonow, shot himself.

69
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:39,225
He commited suicide

70
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,759
he was so humiliated

71
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,360
and so embarassed by that defeat.

72
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,225
So the war did not begin well

73
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:46,159
for the Russians.

74
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,892
But by the end of 1914,

75
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:51,225
they were able to get back into gear

76
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:54,159
and they stayed on the offensive

77
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,140
and did have some victories

78
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,825
up here in Galicia

79
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:59,159
which at the time was part of

80
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,784
north-eastern Hungary.

81
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:02,892
And they were able to capture

82
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,759
a good bit of territory.

83
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,559
Now as we enter into 1915

84
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,892
- and we already covered this

85
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:11,093
in the videos on the Western Front -

86
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:12,559
We know the Western Front

87
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,360
was entering into a stalemate,

88
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,892
- the Schlieffen plan did not happen

89
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:17,426
as quickly as possible -

90
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:19,408
but the defenders had a huge advantage.

91
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,403
This gave the Germans an opportunity

92
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:23,225
to bring some troops back

93
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:27,492
to the Eastern Front.

94
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:29,159
They also got better at

95
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,492
coordinating with the Austro-Hungarians.

96
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:33,990
And so in 1915, you have the Central Powers

97
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,167
going back on the offensive.

98
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:46,159
And they are able to drive

99
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,123
the Russians out of Russian Poland,

100
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,492
roughly to this border

101
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:57,572
that I have drawn over here.

102
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,225
We talk about Russian Poland.

103
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,159
The modern state of Poland,

104
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,894
- I am making this video in 2013 -

105
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:08,159
Poland was split between

106
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,892
as you see in this map

107
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,492
between the Russian Empire

108
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:13,159
and the German Empire.

109
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,717
The modern state of Poland

110
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:18,892
is roughly this region over here.

111
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,894
You see it is completely split,

112
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,693
almost in a Yin and Yang symbol,

113
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:26,893
between these two empires.

114
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:30,760
Through 1915, the Russians were pushed out

115
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,458
of Russian Poland,

116
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,826
roughly to this border.

117
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,760
To a large degree,

118
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,226
this was because Russia,

119
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:41,292
even though they had a huge army,

120
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,426
they had bad communication lines

121
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,229
and bad technical supplies.

122
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:46,807
Russian industry was unable

123
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,960
to keep up with the demands of the war

124
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,626
and was not able to supply

125
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:53,826
munitions and arms in proper quantities

126
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,560
to their troops.

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
As we enter into 1916,

128
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,789
the Russians were once again

129
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:00,160
able to get their footing back.

130
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,226
As you can see,

131
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:02,226
it is starting to become

132
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:03,493
a bit of a back-and-forth.

133
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:09,009
So Russian industry picks back up in 1916

134
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,960
and it puts Russia more on the offensive.

135
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,760
They were driven out of Russian Poland

136
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,493
but now by 1916 they are able

137
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:19,893
to keep the Central Powers

138
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:21,626
a bit more on the defensive.

139
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:23,493
But the boundaries of the front

140
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:26,160
roughly stay in line

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,426
with this line over here.

142
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:31,093
And by the end of 1916,

143
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:33,201
the Romanians join in

144
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:35,693
on the side of the Triple Entente

145
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,292
on the side of the Russians,

146
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:42,025
in order to fight the Central Powers.

147
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:43,560
Now, this might look like

148
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,626
it is going better for the Russians.

149
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:48,061
The Russian industry is finally picking up,

150
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:49,426
they are starting to put

151
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:50,560
the Central Powers more

152
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,148
on the defensive,

153
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:53,226
but the entire time we are

154
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:54,960
talking about this battle

155
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,395
the economic situation in the Russian Empire

156
00:05:57,395 --> 00:06:00,093
is deteriorating dramatically.

157
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,292
By the time you get into 1917,

158
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,818
the Russian economy is falling apart.

159
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:14,502
There are food shortages, riots,

160
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:19,160
and in February of 1917,

161
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,093
you have the February Revolution,

162
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:25,770
the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty.

163
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,768
It has been in power for 300 years,

164
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:31,960
but in February and early March

165
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,618
Czar Nicholas II abdicates the throne.

166
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:43,493
This is him over here.

167
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:45,426
We will do more detailed videos

168
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:46,760
on the entire Russian Revolution

169
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,292
and what happens to his family

170
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:49,826
and all the rest.

171
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,893
An interim government takes place.

172
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:56,093
This is an interesting fact of history:

173
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:58,025
this interim government all of a sudden

174
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,760
becomes a democracy.

175
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,426
It is February 1917 and remember

176
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:03,619
the United States have not entered the war

177
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:04,688
at this point

178
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:06,093
And you may also remember

179
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,520
that in April, the United States

180
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,893
use the idea of fighting

181
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:10,028
on the side of Democracy

182
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,189
as a justification

183
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:12,560
for entering the war.

184
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,359
Which is very nice, because by April

185
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,601
all of the major powers

186
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,202
on the side of the Triple Entente

187
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:19,626
were all democracies:

188
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:22,426
the interim government of the Russians,

189
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:24,025
the French,

190
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:26,560
and the British Empire

191
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,960
- which obviously is a democracy

192
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
only for those who can vote.

193
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,855
And the United States

194
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:33,893
were the first country

195
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:36,626
to recognize the Interim Government

196
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:41,826
after the overthrow of Czar Nicholas II.

197
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:44,493
But we are not yet done with 1917.

198
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,493
1917 is one of those huge years

199
00:07:46,493 --> 00:07:47,760
in the history of the world.

200
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,059
And especially in the history of Russia.

201
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:52,960
The situation continues to deteriorate

202
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,471
and it starts to deteriorate

203
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,561
as well for the Army.

204
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:58,760
The morale of the troops breaks down,

205
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,388
the Bolsheviks start to create unrest,

206
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:06,854
by September 1917

207
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:15,462
Germany is able to capture Riga,

208
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,294
which is a major city over here

209
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:20,523
on the Baltic,

210
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:24,378
which brings the Central Powers

211
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,861
very close to the Russian capital.

212
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:31,112
It contributes to the ongoing unrest.

213
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:35,579
And in November, on the 7th,

214
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:38,960
you have a coup d'état

215
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,893
of that ostensibly democratic

216
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:43,047
interim - or provisional - government

217
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:46,493
and the Communists - the Bolsheviks take power.

218
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,109
under the leadership

219
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:50,560
of Vladimir Lenin over here.

220
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,426
So November 7, 1917,

221
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:54,493
- a very famous date in history -

222
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:58,465
you have Lenin leading the Bolsheviks into power.

223
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:00,137
Now they had no interest to continue

224
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:02,784
fighting this battle with Germany.

225
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:04,735
They had their own civil war to worry about.

226
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:07,625
They were trying to consolidate power in Russia.

227
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,239
So in December,

228
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:11,979
they start to negotiate an armistice

229
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:13,976
with the Central Powers

230
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:16,159
and they do not have a lot of leverage

231
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,970
in this negotiation because

232
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,314
they really did not want to be in this war.

233
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:24,831
And so by March of 1918

234
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:29,069
you have the treaty between Russia

235
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,826
and the Central Powers,

236
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:40,029
the treaty of Brest-Litowsk.

237
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:43,698
The Russians, the Bolsheviks, were so desparate

238
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:47,320
to focus on the internal civil war

239
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,317
that had emerged in Russia,

240
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:50,896
that in order to consolidate power

241
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:52,826
they gave over a huge amount of territory

242
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,797
to the Central Powers.

243
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:57,398
A large part of Europe

244
00:09:57,398 --> 00:10:01,066
that is not predominantly

245
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:04,642
of Russian ethnicity

246
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:07,426
went over to the Central Powers.

247
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:09,797
This treaty is important,

248
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,237
because it is essentially

249
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:13,698
the end of World War I for the Russians.

250
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:15,974
It was the end of the Eastern Front.

251
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,760
And it allowed the Germans

252
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,893
to re-focus on the Western Front.

253
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:21,226
It allowed the Germans

254
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:22,625
to start bringing troops

255
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,379
back over to the Western Front

256
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:25,633
and they are able to do

257
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,960
quite an aggressive spring offensive

258
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,625
on the Western Front.

259
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,226
And if it was not for the US

260
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:32,893
now being able to reinforce

261
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,160
the Western Front,

262
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,731
- remember they declared war in mid 1917 -

263
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:39,160
the German offensive

264
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,375
might have been successful

265
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,652
in the spring of 1918.

266
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:45,826
So the importance of Brest-Litowsk

267
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:47,645
is that it was the end of the Eastern Front,

268
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,642
it allowed the Germans

269
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:51,036
to do an offensive

270
00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:52,567
on the Western Front

271
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:55,633
and it was a very strong offensive

272
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,630
but with the help of the Americans

273
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,226
it was not a successful one.

274
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,826
But the territorial gain

275
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,692
for the Central Powers

276
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,226
because of Brest-Litowsk,

277
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:07,104
were not that significant.

278
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:10,914
Because in November 1918,

279
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:22,111
you have the Central Powers

280
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:26,208
saying 'we are not able to win this war'

281
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,180
and you have what for a long time

282
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,887
was known as Armistice day:

283
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:32,287
on the 11th hour

284
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:34,487
of the 11th day

285
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,796
of the 11th month

286
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,487
you have an armistice

287
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:40,093
and the end of World War 1.

288
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:41,764
And the Allies win

289
00:11:41,764 --> 00:11:43,623
and get to say

290
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:45,499
what happens to this territory.
