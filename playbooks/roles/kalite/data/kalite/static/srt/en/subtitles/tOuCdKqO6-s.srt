1
00:00:01,254 --> 00:00:07,340
So a few videos ago I told you that anything to the 0 power is equal to 1.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,420
So x to the zeroth power
is equal to 1.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,140
And I gave you one argument
why this is the case

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,910
I used the example of, if we
have 3 to the first power,

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,250
that is equal to 3.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,870
3 to the second power
is equal to 9.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,940
3 to the third power
is equal to 27.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,480
So every time we decrease by a
power, we're dividing by 3.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,170
27 divided by 3 is 9.

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,390
9 divided by 3 is 3.

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,890
Then 3 divided by 3 is 1.

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,930
And that should be what 3
to the zeroth power is.

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,980
So that's one way to
think about it.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,640
The other way to think about
it is that we need this for

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,920
the exponent properties
to work.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,840
For example, I told you that a
to the b times a to the c is

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,180
equal to a to the b plus c.

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,440
Now, what happens if c is 0?

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,430
What happens if we have a to
the b times a to the 0?

20
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,210
Well, by this property, this
needs to be equal to a to the

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,670
b plus 0, which is equal
to a to the b.

22
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,850
So a to the b times a to the 0
must be equal to a to the b.

23
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,290
If you divide both sides of this
times a-- let me rewrite

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,610
this-- a to the b times a to the
0, if we use this property

25
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,370
up here, must be equal to a to
the b, right? b plus 0 is b.

26
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:37,460
If you divide both sides by a
to the b, what do you get?

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,020
On the left-hand side,
you're left with

28
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,450
just a to the 0, right?

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,900
These cancel out.

30
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,210
a to the 0 is equal to 1.

31
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,570
And you can use a similar
argument in pretty much all of

32
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,400
the exponent properties, that we
need anything to the zeroth

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,385
power to be equal to 1.

34
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:58,080
And it also makes sense as we
divide by 3, each step as we

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,310
decrement our exponent.

36
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,820
It keeps working.

37
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,610
When you take 3 to the negative
1 power, we saw on

38
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,980
the last video that that's equal
to 1 over 3 to the first

39
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,259
power, or 1/3 .

40
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,360
So once again, from 3 to
the 0 to 1/3, you're

41
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,710
dividing by 3 again.

42
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,660
So it really makes sense on
some level that 3 to the

43
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,100
zeroth power is equal to 1.

44
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,570
But that leaves a little
bit of a gap.

45
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,930
What about 0 to the
zeroth power?

46
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,460
This is a very strange notion.

47
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,700
0 multiplied by itself
0 times.

48
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,890
And it depends what context
you're using.

49
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,160
Sometimes people will say that
this is undefined, but many

50
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,270
more times, at least in my
experience, this'll be

51
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,525
defined to be 1.

52
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,440
And the reason why-- even though
this is completely not

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,870
intuitive, and you could type
in 0 to the zeroth power in

54
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,920
Google, and it'll give you 1.

55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,660
Even though this is completely
not intuitive, the reason why

56
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,350
this is defined to be this way
is that makes a lot of

57
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,450
formulas work.

58
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,130
One in particular, the binomial
formula works for

59
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,190
your binomial coefficients,
which I'm not going to go over

60
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,630
right here, when 0 to the zeroth
power is equal to 1.

61
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,160
So that's an interesting thing
for you to think about, what

62
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,020
that might even mean.

63
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,830
So let's talk about some of
the other properties.

64
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,850
And then we can put them all
together with a couple of

65
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,250
example problems. I told you
in the last video what it

66
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,080
means to raise to a
negative power.

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,290
a to the negative 1 power, or
maybe I should say a to the

68
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,560
negative b power is equal to
1 over a to the b power.

69
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,570
So just to do that with a couple
of concrete examples, 3

70
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,620
to the negative 3 power is equal
to 1 over 3 to the third

71
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,530
power, which is equal to 1 over
3 times 3, times 3, which

72
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,590
is equal to 1 over 27.

73
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:55,490
If I were to ask you what 1/3
to the negative 2 power is--

74
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:00,830
well, this is going to be equal
to 1 over 1/3 to the

75
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,950
second power.

76
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,130
You get rid of the negative
and you inverse it.

77
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,350
So this is going to be
equal to 1 over--

78
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,090
what's 1/3 times 1/3?

79
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,470
1/9.

80
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,090
Which is equal to-- this is 1
divided by 1/9 is the same

81
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,870
thing is 1 times 9, so
this is equal to 9.

82
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,210
And this makes complete sense,
because 1/3, remember, 1/3 is

83
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,010
the same thing as 3 to the
negative 1 power, right?

84
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,930
3 to the negative 1 is equal
to 1 over 3 to the 1 power,

85
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,040
which is the same
thing is 1/3.

86
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,980
So if we replace 1/3 with 3 to
the negative 1, this is 3 to

87
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,670
the negative 1 to the
negative 2 power.

88
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,760
These two things are equivalent
statements.

89
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,850
And if we use one of the
properties we learned in the

90
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,410
first video, we can
take the product

91
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,480
of these two exponents.

92
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,480
So this is equal to 3 to the
negative 1, times negative 2,

93
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,000
which is just positive 2,
which is equal to 9.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,290
So it's really neat how all of
these exponent properties

95
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,840
really fit together in a nice,
neat puzzle, that they don't

96
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,890
contradict each other.

97
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,330
And it doesn't matter which
property you use, you'll get

98
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,360
the right answer in the end,
as long as you don't do

99
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,060
something crazy.

100
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,370
Now, the last thing I want to
define is the notion of a

101
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,970
fractional exponent.

102
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,980
So if I have something to a
fractional power-- so let's

103
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,040
say I have a to the
1 over b power.

104
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,380
I'm going to define this.

105
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,150
This is going to be equal
to the bth root of a.

106
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,690
So let me be very clear here.

107
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,520
Let me make it with
some numbers here.

108
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,250
If I said 4 to the 1/2 power
right there, this means this

109
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,920
is equivalent to the
square root of 4.

110
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,180
Which is equal to, if we're
taking the principal root,

111
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,070
this is equal to 2.

112
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,460
So if I were to take, let's be
clear, 8 to the 1/3 power,

113
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,020
this is taking the
cube root of 8.

114
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,780
And this is, on some level,
one of the most sometimes

115
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,560
confusing things in exponents.

116
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,740
Here I'm saying, what number
times itself 3 times

117
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,720
is equal to 8 ?

118
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:23,540
So if I said that x is equal to
8 to the 1/3 power, this is

119
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,520
the exact same thing as
saying x to the third

120
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,320
power is equal to 8.

121
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,930
And how do I know that these
are equivalent statements?

122
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,950
Well, I could take both
sides of this equation

123
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,930
to the third power.

124
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,340
If I take the left-hand side
of the third power and the

125
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,520
right-hand side of the third
power, what do I get?

126
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,710
On the left-hand side,
I get x to the third.

127
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,715
On the right-hand side, I get 8
to the 1/3 times 3, which is

128
00:06:48,715 --> 00:06:52,130
just 3 over 3, which
is just 1.

129
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:58,860
So if x is equal to 8 to
the 1/3, what is x?

130
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,960
Well, 2 times 2, times
2 is equal to 8.

131
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,160
And there's no really easy way,
especially once you go to

132
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,540
the fourth root, or the fifth
root, and you have decimals of

133
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,260
calculating these.

134
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,850
You probably need a calculator
most of the time to do these.

135
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,560
But things like 8 to the 1/3, or
16 to the 1/4, or 27 to the

136
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,970
1/3 , they're not too
hard to calculate.

137
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,250
So this right here, let
me be clear, is 2.

138
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,700
Now, let's make it a little
bit more confusing.

139
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:35,390
What is 27 to the negative
1/3 power?

140
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,120
Well, don't get too worried.

141
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,230
We're just going to take
it step by step.

142
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,800
When you take the negative
power, this is completely

143
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,560
equivalent to 1 over 27
to the 1/3 power.

144
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,590
These two are equivalent.

145
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,010
You get rid of the negative
and take 1

146
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,380
over the whole thing.

147
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,170
And then what is 27
to the 1/3 power?

148
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,590
Well, what number times itself
3 times is equal to 27?

149
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,690
Well, that's equal to 3.

150
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,330
So this is going to be
equal to 1 over 3.

151
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,860
Not too bad.

152
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,770
Now I'm going to take it even to
another level, make it even

153
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,280
more confusing, even
more daunting.

154
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,980
Now, let me do something
interesting.

155
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:32,289
What is 8 to the 2/3 power?

156
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,700
Now that seems a little
bit scary.

157
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,770
And all you have to remember
is this is the same thing,

158
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,490
using our exponent rules
really, as 8

159
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,870
squared to the 1/3 power.

160
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,680
How do I know that?

161
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,560
Well, if I multiply these two
exponents, this is 2/3.

162
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,690
So 8 to the 2/3 is the same
thing is 8 squared, and then

163
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,250
the third root of that.

164
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,450
But you could view
it the other way.

165
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,200
This should also be equal to
8 to the 1/3 power squared.

166
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,540
Because either way, when I
multiply these exponents, I

167
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,760
get 8 to the 2/3.

168
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,850
Let's verify for ourselves
that we really do

169
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,310
get the same value.

170
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,840
So 8 squared is 64.

171
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,090
And we're going to take
that to the 1/3 power.

172
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,410
Down here, we have
8 to the 1/3.

173
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,590
We already figured
out what that is.

174
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,650
That's 2, because 2 to
the third power is 8.

175
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,050
So this is 2 squared.

176
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,950
Now, what is 64 to the 1/3?

177
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,620
What times itself 3 times
is equal to 64?

178
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,830
Well, 4 times 4, times 4 is
equal to 64, or 4 to the third

179
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:46,230
is equal to 64, which means
that 4 is equal

180
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,360
to 64 to the 1/3.

181
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,710
So this is equal to 4.

182
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,400
And, lucky for us, 2 squared
is also equal to 4.

183
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,730
So it doesn't matter which
way you do it.

184
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,760
You could take the square and
then the third root, or you

185
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,200
could take the third root
and then square it.

186
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,740
You're going to get the
exact same answer.

187
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,830
Now, everything I've
been doing has

188
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,920
been with actual numbers.

189
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,020
Let me do a couple of problems
that just bring everything

190
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,662
we've done together
using variables.

191
00:10:14,662 --> 00:10:18,180
So let's say we wanted to do a
few expressions and we want to

192
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,220
make sure there are no negative

193
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,980
exponents in the answer.

194
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:28,140
So let's add x to the negative
3 over x to the negative 7.

195
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,410
There's a bunch of ways
we could view this.

196
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,460
We could view this as equal to
x to the negative 3, times 1

197
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,390
over x to the negative 7.

198
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,150
And what is 1 over x
to the negative 7?

199
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:49,890
This is the same thing as x to
the seventh power, right?

200
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,570
If you have 1 over something,
you can get rid of the 1 over,

201
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,370
and put a negative in front
of the exponent.

202
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,630
But if you're putting a
negative in front of a

203
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,020
negative 7, you're going
to get x to a seventh.

204
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,550
So this thing can simplify to
x to the negative 3, times x

205
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,540
to the seventh power.

206
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,480
And then we can add the
exponents, and that is x to

207
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,870
the fourth power.

208
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,150
Now, another way, a completely
legitimate way we could have

209
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,300
done this, is we could have just
subtracted the exponents.

210
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,520
We could have said, well, gee,
this is the same base.

211
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,660
This is going to be x to the
negative 3, minus negative

212
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,390
seventh power.

213
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,390
Well, negative 3 minus negative
7, that's a negative

214
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:33,920
3 plus 7 which is equal to
x to the fourth power.

215
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,600
And then one final way-- I mean,
actually, there's more

216
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,275
than one final way we could
have done this.

217
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:41,280
We could have said x to the
negative 3 over x to the

218
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,140
negative 7-- sorry, not negative
x-- over x to the

219
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,370
negative 7.

220
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,220
Well, x to the negative 3 is the
same thing as 1 over x to

221
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,710
the third-- that's that term
right there-- times 1 over x

222
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,330
to the negative 7, so this would
have been equal to 1

223
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,350
over x to the third times
x to the negative 7.

224
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,470
You could add the exponents,
so that's equal to 1 over 3

225
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,350
minus 7 is x to the
negative 4.

226
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,480
And then this-- if we just get
rid of the inverse, we take

227
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,890
the inverse of it, we can put
a negative in front of this

228
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,480
negative, making it a positive--
this is going to be

229
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,510
equal to x to the 4.

230
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,960
So no matter how we did it, as
long as we're consistent with

231
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,150
the rules, we got
x to the fourth.

232
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,770
Let's do one more slightly
hairy one.

233
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,710
And then I think we'll
be done for now.

234
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:43,690
Let's say we have 3x squared
times y to the 3/2 power.

235
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:51,250
And we're going to divide it by
x times y to the 1/2 power.

236
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,130
Well, once again, this is the
same thing as 3 times the x

237
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:03,070
terms right here, so 3 times x
squared over x, times y to the

238
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,690
3/2 over y to the 1/2.

239
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,260
Well, this is going to be equal
to 3 times-- what's x

240
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,920
squared over x?

241
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,910
Or x squared over x to
the first power?

242
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,080
That's going to be equal
to x to the 2 minus 1.

243
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:31,520
And then this is going to be
times y to the 3/2 minus 1/2.

244
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,790
So what does the whole
thing become?

245
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,990
It becomes 3 times x.

246
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:41,520
2 minus 1 is just 1-- I can just
write x there-- times 3/2

247
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,980
minus 1/2 is 2/2.

248
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,670
So that's y to the 2/2.

249
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,570
2/2, or 2 2ths-- that's just
the same thing is y.

250
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,040
so this is equal to 3xy.

251
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,580
Anyway, I encourage you
to do many, many

252
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,800
more examples of that.

253
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,880
But, you'll see that just using
the rules that we've

254
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,350
been exposed to in the last
few videos, you can pretty

255
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,760
much simplify any exponent
expression.

256
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ching ching chong

257
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So a few videos I told you that anything to the 0 power is 1.
