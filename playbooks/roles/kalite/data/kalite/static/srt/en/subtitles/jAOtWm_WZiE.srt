1
00:00:00,975 --> 00:00:07,733
Let’s see you don’t like company A B C D very much and you convince that the stock is going to go down.

2
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,533
So, in that situation, you can actually short,

3
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:17,392
you can actually short the stock which in very high level is bet the stock is going to go down.

4
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:21,667
And the way you do that mechanically is that you borrow the stock.

5
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:25,728
You borrow the stock, from someone else who owns it.

6
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:31,800
And you immediately sells that stock that you don’t even know, you sell the stock borrow from someone else.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,971
And you will sell at current price

8
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:34,800
So, for example,

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,133
at this situation, you’ll sell it, you’ll sell it at current trading pricea, of 50 dollars

10
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:44,733
You then hope that stock price goes down

11
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:49,067
So, in this situation, let’s think about this situation where the stock price goes down

12
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:55,403
So if you shorted it, right over here you borrow the stock and you sold it for 50 dollars

13
00:00:55,403 --> 00:01:01,467
And then the stock actually go down. Iets go all the way down to 20, you think that’s about how far it’s gone go down

14
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:04,807
Then, you can buy back the stock

15
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:10,333
You can buy the stock, you can buy the stock for 20 dollars

16
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:17,810
In this situation, and then give it back to the owner you had borrowed the stock and now you can hand back the stock to the owner

17
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:24,800
So, you can give it back you’ve centrally unwanted it. What allow you to do is allow you to do the buying and selling in revise order

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,539
Normally, before you sell something you have to buy something

19
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:35,643
But here you are able to sell it and buy it later for a lower price so the situation were the end prices 20 dollars

20
00:01:35,643 --> 00:01:41,634
You have sold it for 50, so that 50 dollars and you have to use 20 of it to buy it back

21
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:50,875
So in that situation, you’ve shortening the stock you would have made, you would have made 30 dollars

22
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:55,667
Let me wirte this columns here, this is shorting, this is the short option

23
00:01:55,667 --> 00:02:03,298
You sold it 50, you borrowed and sold 50, then when it went down 20 you bought is back, you bought it back for 20

24
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:09,474
So you have 50 dollars processed, and you have used 20 of it to buy back ,so you have 30 dollars profits

25
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:15,467
but that’s only good scenario ,what happens if your band is wrong what happens, if the stock price goes up to 80 and over here

26
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:22,067
you get so scared like oh my god, I have to buy this stock back by 80, what if it’s keep going up, I will lose unlimited lots of money

27
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:29,000
So, over here, you get scared and you unwilled your situation. You say :OK, I’ll go and buy the stock for 80 dollars

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,970
So ,I can give it back, So, in this situation, stock goes up, you actually can loose a lot of money

29
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:42,633
You had sold for 50, so, you only have 50 dollars that you have from transaction, but now you have to buy the stock for 80

30
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:50,806
So if you sold for 50, and you’ll buy for 80. You now lost 30 dollars, 30 dollars in a whole

31
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:57,533
So, now, you are negative, negative 30 dollars, really shorting is the riskiest of all of things you can do

32
00:02:57,533 --> 00:03:04,333
Because a stock price goes unbelievably high. What happens suppose stock goes 800 dollars, suppose 8000 dollars

33
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:11,000
All of a sudden, you’ve, you’ve sold something for 50 and you have the obligation it’s some point of future,

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,400
because you have to get the stock back of paying 500 dollars, 800 dollars, 8000 dollars you don’t know how much you’ve go to lose

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:28,533
So it’s the really the riskiest thing you can do , but it is one way to bet that stock price will go down or profit from the stock price going down.
