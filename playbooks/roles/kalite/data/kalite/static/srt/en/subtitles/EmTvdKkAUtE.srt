1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
In this video, I want
to do a few examples

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,800
dealing with functions.

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,570
Functions tend to be something
that a lot of students find

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,230
difficult, but I think if you
really get what we're talking

6
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,070
about, you'll see that it's
actually a pretty

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,240
straightforward idea.

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,710
And you sometimes wonder,
well what was all

9
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,880
of the hubbub about?

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,720
All a function is, is an

11
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,830
association between two variables.

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,540
So if we say that y is equal to
a function of x, all that

13
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,260
means is, you give me an x.

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,660
You can imagine this function
is kind of eating up this x.

15
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,190
You pop an x into
this function.

16
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,480
This function is just
a set of rules.

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,150
It's going to say, oh,
with that x, I

18
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,230
associate some value y.

19
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,945
You can imagine it is
some type of a box.

20
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:45,900
   

21
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,990
That is a function.

22
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:53,830
When I give it some number
x, it'll give me some

23
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,990
other number y.

24
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,160
This might seem a
little abstract.

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,360
What are these x's and y's?

26
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,830
Maybe I have a function-- let
me make it like this.

27
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,190
Let's say I have a function
definition

28
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,720
that looks like this.

29
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,770
For any x you give me, I'm going
to produce 1 if x is

30
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,440
equal to-- I don't know-- 0.

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,730
I'm going to produce 2
if x is equal to 1.

32
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,320
And I'm going to produce
3 otherwise.

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,790
   

34
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,720
So now we've defined what's
going on inside of the box.

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,630
So let's draw the
box around it.

36
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,650
This is our box.

37
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,940
This is just an arbitrary
function definition, but

38
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,760
hopefully it'll help you
understand what's actually

39
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,070
going on with a function.

40
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:47,500
So now if I make x is equal to--
if I pick x is equal to

41
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,480
7, now what is f of x going
to be equal to?

42
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,400
What is f of 7 going
to be equal to?

43
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,020
So I take 7 into the box.

44
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,700
You could view it as some
type of a computer.

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,770
The computer looks at that x and
then looks at its rules.

46
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,060
It says, OK. x is 7.

47
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,270
Well x isn't 0. x isn't 1.

48
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,229
I go to the otherwise
situation.

49
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,100
So I'm going to pop out a 3.

50
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,040
So f of 7 is equal to 3.

51
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,320
So we write f of 7
is equal to 3.

52
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,760
Where f is the name of this
function, this rule system, or

53
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,310
this association, this
mapping, whatever you

54
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,190
want to call it.

55
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,350
When you give it a 7,
it'll produce a 3.

56
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,460
When you give f a 7,
it'll produce a 3.

57
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,240
What is f of 2?

58
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,690
Well, that means instead of x
is equal to 7, I'm going to

59
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,420
give it an x equal 2.

60
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,550
Then the little computer inside
the function is going

61
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,550
to say, OK, let's see,
when x is equal to 2.

62
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,410
No, I'm still in the otherwise
situation.

63
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,910
x isn't 0 or 1.

64
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,800
So once again f of
x is equal to 3.

65
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,470
   

66
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,970
So, this is f of 2 is
also equal to 3.

67
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:03,200
Now what happens if x
is now equal to 1?

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,100
Well then it's just going
to turn over this.

69
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,990
So f of 1.

70
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,080
It's going to look at its
rules right here.

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,620
Oh look, x is equal to 1.

72
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,350
I can use my rule right here.

73
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,520
So when x is equal to
1, I spit out a 2.

74
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,750
So f of 1 is going
to be equal to 2.

75
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,290
I spit out f of 1, which is
equal to 2 in that situation.

76
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,420
That's all a function is.

77
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,120
Now, with that in mind, let's
do some of these example

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,620
problems. They tell us for
each of the following

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,010
functions, evaluate these
different functions-- these

80
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,570
are the different boxes they've
created-- at these

81
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,070
different points.

82
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,800
Let's do part a first. They're
defining the box.

83
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,880
f of x is equal to negative
2x plus 3.

84
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,790
They want to know what happens
when f is equal to negative 3.

85
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,300
Well f is equal to negative 3,
this is telling me what do I

86
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,430
do with the x?

87
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,110
What do I produce?

88
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,060
Wherever I see an x, I replace
it with the negative 3.

89
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,060
So it's going to be equal
to negative 2.

90
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,780
Let me do it this way, so you
see exactly what I'm doing.

91
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,520
That negative 3, I'll do
it in that bold color.

92
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:13,130
It's negative 2 times
negative 3 plus 3.

93
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,149
Notice wherever there was an
x, I put the negative 3.

94
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,250
So I know what the black box
is going to produce.

95
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,600
This is going to be equal to
negative 2 times negative 3 is

96
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,640
6 plus 3, which is equal to 9.

97
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,470
So f of negative 3
is equal to 9.

98
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,130
What about f of 7?

99
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,340
I'll do the same thing one more
time. f of-- I'll do 7 in

100
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:43,120
yellow-- f of 7 is going to
be equal to negative 2

101
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,650
times 7 plus 3.

102
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,480
   

103
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,140
So this is equal to negative 14
plus 3, which is equal to

104
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,260
negative 11.

105
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:03,940
You put in-- let me make it very
clear-- you put in a 7

106
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:11,060
into our function f here and it
will pop out a negative 11.

107
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,310
That's what this just
told us right there.

108
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,760
This is the rule.

109
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,470
This is completely analogous
to what I did up here.

110
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,980
This is the rule of
our function.

111
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,430
Let's do the next two.

112
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,200
I won't do part b.

113
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,330
You can do part b for fun.

114
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,650
I'll do part c after that, just
for the sake of time.

115
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,540
Now we are at f of 0.

116
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,810
Here I'll just do
it in one color.

117
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,300
I think you're getting
the idea. f of 0.

118
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,500
Wherever we see an
x, we put a 0.

119
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,005
So negative 2 times 0 plus 3.

120
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:43,100
   

121
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,345
Well, that's just
going to be a 0.

122
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,300
So f of 0 is 3.

123
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,000
Then one last one. f of z.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,720
They want to keep it
abstract for us.

125
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,780
Here I'll color code it.

126
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,800
So f of z.

127
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,150
Let me make the z in
a different color.

128
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,900
f of z.

129
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,210
Everywhere that we saw
an x, we will now

130
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,750
replace it with a z.

131
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,240
Negative 2.

132
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,040
Instead of an x, we're going
to put a z there.

133
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,860
We're going to put an
orange z there.

134
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,760
Negative 2 times z plus 3.

135
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,330
And that's our answer. f of
z is negative 2z plus 3.

136
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,110
If you imagine our box,
the function f.

137
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:38,130
You put in a z, you are going to
get out a negative 2 times

138
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:43,480
whatever that z is plus 3.

139
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,520
That's all this is saying.

140
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,830
It's a little bit more abstract,
but same exact idea.

141
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,030
Now let's just do part c here.

142
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,330
Let me clear this actually.

143
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,820
I'm running out of
real estate.

144
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,102
Let me clear all of
this business.

145
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:02,910
Let me clear all of
this business.

146
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,810
We can do part c.

147
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,370
I'm skipping part b.

148
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,710
You can work on that part.

149
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,830
Part b.

150
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,430
They tell us-- this is our
function definition.

151
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,680
Sorry, I said I was
doing part c.

152
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,610
This is our function
definition.

153
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:26,300
f of x is equal to 5 times
2 minus x over 11.

154
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,440
So let's apply these different
values of x, these different

155
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,620
inputs into our function.

156
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:39,900
So f of negative 3 is equal to
5 times 2 minus-- wherever we

157
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,250
see an x, we put a negative 3.

158
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,620
2 minus negative 3 over 11.

159
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,700
This is equal to 2 plus 3.

160
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,870
This is equal to 5.

161
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,260
So you get 5 times 5 over 11.

162
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,120
That's equal to 25/11.

163
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,850
Let's do this one.

164
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,990
F of 7.

165
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:06,680
For this second function right
here, f of 7 is equal to 5

166
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,160
times 2 minus-- now
for x we have a 7.

167
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,360
2 minus 7 over 11.

168
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,540
So what is this going
to be equal to?

169
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,250
2 minus 7 is negative 5.

170
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,780
5 times negative 5 is
negative 25/11.

171
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,410
Then finally, well we have
two more. f of 0.

172
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:35,000
That's equal to 5 times 2 minus
0 So this is just 2.

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,130
5 times 2 is 10.

174
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,850
So this is equal to 10/11.

175
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,840
One more.

176
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,059
f of z.

177
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,299
Well every time we saw
an x, we're going to

178
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,490
replace it with a z.

179
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,960
It's equal to 5 times
2 minus z over 11.

180
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,630
And that's our answer.

181
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,910
We could distribute the 5.

182
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,210
You could say this is the same
thing as 10 minus 5z over 11.

183
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,260
We could even write it in
slope-intercept form.

184
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:06,000
This is the same thing as
minus 5/11 z plus 10/11.

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,990
These are all equivalent.

186
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,430
But that is what f
of z is equal to.

187
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,590
Now.

188
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,510
A function, we said, if you give
me any x value, I will

189
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,470
give you an output.

190
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,120
I will give you an f of x.

191
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,040
So if this is our function,
you give me an x, it will

192
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,550
produce an f of x.

193
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,680
It can only produce 1
f of x for any x.

194
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,840
You can't have a function that
could produce two possible

195
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,700
values for an x.

196
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,540
So you can't have a function--
this would be an invalid

197
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,790
function definition-- f
of x is equal to 3 if

198
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,230
x is equal to 0.

199
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,240
Or it could be equal to
4 if x is equal to 0.

200
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,170
Because in this situation, we
don't know what f of 0 is.

201
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,090
What it's going to be equal?

202
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,330
It says if x is equal to 0, it
should be 3 or it could be--

203
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,310
we don't know.

204
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:57,830
We don't know.

205
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,190
We don't know.

206
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,550
This is not a function
even though it might

207
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,800
have looked like one.

208
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,700
   

209
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,250
So you can't have two f of
x values for one x value.

210
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,020
So let's see which of these
graphs are functions.

211
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,390
To figure that out, you could
say, look at any x value

212
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,850
here-- pick any x value-- I have
exactly one f of x value.

213
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,090
This is y is equal to
f of x right here.

214
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,950
I have exactly only one--
at that x, that

215
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,550
is my y value here.

216
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,970
So you could have a vertical
line test, which says at any

217
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,720
point if you draw a vertical
line-- notice a vertical line

218
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,570
is for a certain x value.

219
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,920
That shows that I only have
one y value at that point.

220
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,630
So this is a valid function.

221
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,240
Any time you draw a vertical
line, it will only intersect

222
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,610
the graph once.

223
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,410
So this is a valid function.

224
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,220
Now what about this
one right here?

225
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,960
I could draw a vertical
line, let's say, at

226
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,230
that point right there.

227
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,650
For that x, this relation
seems to have two

228
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,860
possible f of x's.

229
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,550
f of x could be that value or
f of x could be that value.

230
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,270
Right?

231
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,520
We're intersecting
the graph twice.

232
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,840
So this is not a function.

233
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,150
We're doing exactly what
I described here.

234
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,090
For a certain x, we're
describing two possible y's

235
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,800
that could be equal to f of x.

236
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,220
So this is not a function.

237
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,830
Over here, same thing.

238
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,310
You draw a vertical
line right there.

239
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,540
You're intersecting
the graph twice.

240
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,000
This is not a function.

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,590
You're defining two possible
y values for 1 x value.

242
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,490
Let's go to this function.

243
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,160
It's kind of a weird
looking function.

244
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,750
Looks like a reversed
check mark.

245
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,020
But any time you draw a vertical
line, you're only

246
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,720
intersecting it once.

247
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,420
So this is a valid function.

248
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,470
For every x, you only have
one y associated.

249
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,450
Or only one f of x associated
with it.

250
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,960
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
