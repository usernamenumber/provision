1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,030
When we compare triangle ABC to triangle XYZ,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,500
it's pretty clear they aren't congruent,

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,360
that they have a very different lengths of their sides

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,130
But, there does to be seem something interesting

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,300
about the relationship between this two triangles

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,670
One, all of their corresponding angles are the same

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,870
So, the angle right here, angle BAC is congruent to XYZ

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,830
Angle BCA is congruent to YZX,

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,290
And angle ABC is congruent to XYZ

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,850
So all of their angles, the corresponding angles are the same

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,990
And we also see, we also see that the sides

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
are just scaled up versions of each other

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,260
So the goal from the length of XZ to AC,

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,570
we can, we can multiply by 3, we multiplied by 3 there,

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,440
to go from, to go from XY, the length of XY

16
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,700
to the length of AB which is of course the corresponding side

17
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,060
We are multiplying by 3, we have to multiply by 3

18
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,450
And then, to go from the length of YZ to the length of BC,

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,480
we also, we also, multiplied

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,860
We also multiplied by 3

21
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,690
So essentially, triangle ABC is just a scaled up version

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,550
of triangle XYZ

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,730
If they were the same scale,

24
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,390
they would be the exact same triangles but,

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,270
one is just a bigger, a blown up version of the other one or,

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,970
this is miniaturize version of that one over there

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,710
If you just multiply all of the sides by 3, you get to this triangle

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,010
And so, we can't call them congruent but they're,

29
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,530
there does seem to be a bit of a special relationship

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,810
So we call this special relationship "similarity"

31
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,600
So we can write that triangle, triangle ABC

32
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,300
is similar, similar to triangle,

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,660
and we wanna make sure we get the corresponding sides right,

34
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,540
ABC is gonna be similar to XYZ

35
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,060
To XYZ

36
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,670
And so, based on what we just saw,

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
there's actually kind of 3 ideas here,

38
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,060
and they're all equivalent ways of thinking about similarities

39
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,070
One way to think about it is that,

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,470
one is a scaled up version of the other

41
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,000
So scaled, scaled up or down of the other

42
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,070
Down versions

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,860
When we talk about congruency, they have to be exactly the same

44
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,500
You could rotate, you could shift it, you could flip it,

45
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,950
but when you do all those things,

46
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,950
they would have to be essentially identical

47
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,620
With similarity, you can rotate it, you can shift it, you can flip it,

48
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,170
and you can also scale it up and down

49
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,280
in order for something to be similar

50
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,630
So for example, if you say, if something is congruent,

51
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,500
if, if, let me say triangle, let's say triangle CDE,

52
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:50,390
if we know that triangle CDE is congruent to triangle FGH,

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,640
then we definitely know that they're similar

54
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,660
They're scaled up by factor of one

55
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,310
Then, we know for a fact that CDE

56
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,010
Is also similar to triangle FGH,

57
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,840
but we can't say the other way around

58
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,710
If, if trianlge ABC is similar to XYZ,

59
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,700
we can't say that it's necessarily congruent,

60
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,560
and we see for this particular example,

61
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
they definitely are not congruent

62
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,500
So this is one way to think about similarity

63
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,530
The other way to think about similarity is that,

64
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,950
all the corresponding angles will be equal

65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,700
So, if something is similar, then all of the corresponding angles

66
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,110
are going to be congruent

67
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,140
Corresponding, corresponding angle

68
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,240
Always having trouble spelling this

69
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,110
It is two R's, one S

70
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,300
Corresponding, corresponding angles, corresponding angles

71
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,000
are congruent

72
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,570
Are congruent

73
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,910
So, if we say that triangle ABC is,

74
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,540
triangle ABC is similar to triangle XYZ,

75
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,070
that is equivalent to saying that angle, angle ABC,

76
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,850
angle ABC is congruent,

77
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,470
or we can say their measures are equal to angle XYZ,

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,930
to angle XYZ,

79
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,200
that angle, that angle BAC,

80
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:18,230
BAC is going to be congruent to angle YXZ, to angle YXZ

81
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:26,320
And then finally, angle ACB, ACB is going to be congruent to

82
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,210
angle, to angle XZY

83
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,010
XZY

84
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,300
Angle XZY

85
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,450
So if you have two triangles, all of their angles are the same,

86
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,750
then you could say that they are similar

87
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,170
Or if you find two triangles,

88
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,690
and you are told they are similar triangles

89
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,650
then you know that all of their corresponding angles are the same

90
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,050
And the last, I guess the way to think about it is that,

91
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,220
all the sides are just scaled up versions of each other

92
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:59,240
So the sides, so sides, scaled by the same factor,

93
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,050
scaled by same, same factor

94
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,620
And the example we did here, the scaling factor was 3,

95
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,570
it doesn't have to be 3

96
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,700
It just to be the same scaling factor for every side

97
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,770
If this side, if we scaled this side up by 3,

98
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,630
and we only scaled this side up by 2 then,

99
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,150
we would not be dealing with a similar triangle

100
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,480
But, if we scaled all of these sides up by 7,

101
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,680
then that's still similar

102
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,610
As long as you have all of them scaled up by,

103
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,460
or scaled down by the exact same factor

104
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,690
So one way to think about it is, and I wanna, wanna keep having,

105
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,860
well, I wanna still visualize those triangles

106
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,310
Let me, let me re-draw em' right over here, a little bit simpler

107
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,060
So I'm now talkig in, now in general terms,

108
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,680
not even for that specific case

109
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,220
So, if we say that this is A B and C,

110
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:48,730
and this right over here is, X, XYZ

111
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,190
I just re-drew em' so I can refer to them when we write down here

112
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,720
If we're saying that this two things right over here are similar,

113
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,800
that means that corresponding sides

114
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,730
are scaled up versions of each other

115
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,110
So we could say that the length of AB,

116
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,040
we could say that the length of AB,

117
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,550
AB, is equal to some scaling factor,

118
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,200
and this thing could be less than one,

119
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,920
some scaling factor times the length of XY, the corresponding sides

120
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,900
And I know that AB corresponds to XY

121
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,870
because of the order in which I wrote this similarity statement

122
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,530
So some scaling factor times XY,

123
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,330
we know that BC, the length of BC

124
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,450
we know that the length of BC needs to be that same scaling factor

125
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,070
The same scaling factor times the length of YZ,

126
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,370
times the length of YZ, so that same scaling factor

127
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,470
And then, we know the length of AC, the length of AC,

128
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,180
is going to be equal to that same scaling factor times XZ

129
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,490
So that's XZ and this could be a scaling factor

130
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,640
So if AB is larger than, if ABC is larger than XYZ,

131
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,740
than this K's will be larger than one,

132
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,300
if they're the exact same size,

133
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,100
if they are essentially congruent triangles,

134
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,680
than this K's will be one

135
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,410
And if XYZ is bigger than ABC,

136
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,690
than this scaling factors will be less than one

137
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,390
But another way to write the same,

138
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,360
all I'm saying is corresponding sides

139
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,080
are scaled up versions of each other

140
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,830
This first statement right here if you divide both sides by XY,

141
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,850
you get AB over XY, is equal to, our scaling factor

142
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,120
And then the second statement right over here,

143
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,210
if you divide both sides by YZ, you get B, let me do that same colour

144
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:47,080
You get BC divided by YZ is equal to that scaling factor,

145
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,550
is equal to that scaling factor

146
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,730
Whatever, the example we just showed that scaling factor was,

147
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,720
scaling factor was 3 but, now we're saying

148
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,240
in a more general term, similarities,

149
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,310
as long as you have same scaling factor

150
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,700
And then finally, if you divide both sides here

151
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,330
by the length between X,XZ , or segment XZ's length,

152
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:10,210
you get AC over XZ is equal to K as well

153
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,620
Is equal to K as well

154
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,950
Or another way to think about it is,

155
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,210
the ratio between corresponding sides,

156
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,510
notice this is the ratio between AB and XY

157
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,100
AB and XY

158
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,080
The ratio between BC and YZ, BC and YZ

159
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,790
The ratio between AC and XZ, AC and XZ

160
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,840
That the ratio between corresponding sides

161
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,160
all gives us the same constant

162
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:42,450
Or you can rewrite this as, AB over XY is equal to BC over YZ,

163
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,790
is equal to, is equal to AC over XZ,

164
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,330
which would be equal to some scaling factor,

165
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,440
which is equal to K

166
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,810
So if you have similar triangles,

167
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,860
let me draw an arrow right over here,

168
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,710
similar triangles means that they're scaled up versions and,

169
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,300
you can also flip and rotate, do all the stuff with congruency,

170
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,100
and you can scale them up or down, which means,

171
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,340
all of the corresponding angles are congruent,

172
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,760
which also means that the ratio between corresponding sides

173
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,900
is going to be the same concept for all the corresponding sides,

174
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,020
or the ratio between the corresponding sides is constant
