1
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:15,125
We're in the Italian city of Ravenna standing outside the Church of San Vitale. This is a really important 6th century church, it's just really old.

2
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:19,322
And it's unusual in that it's essentially a planned church.

3
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:20,234
That means its focus is on its centre instead of a basilica which has a long or longitudinal axis.

4
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:31,450
Right. When we think about a church we generally think about a building shaped like a cross

5
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,181
and it has that long hallway, the nave. This doesn't have that.

6
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:39,404
Instead it has an ambulatory or aisle that surrounds its central space.

7
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:42,377
In this particular case on the east side of the church

8
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:45,964
there is also an extension with an apse at the end.

9
00:00:45,964 --> 00:00:49,938
Looking at the outside of San Vitale we see that it has eight sides,

10
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:55,124
so it's an octagon and within that octagon there's a smaller octagon that rises higher.

11
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:58,248
The exterior of the church is brick. Those bricks were

12
00:00:58,248 --> 00:01:02,370
taken from ancient Roman buildings and were reused here in the 6th century.

13
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,071
The walls are pierced with lots of windows and that's especially important because the interior

14
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:10,828
is covered with some of the most magnificent mosaics that survive

15
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:12,795
from the early Medieval period.

16
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:19,630
And of course you'd want that light glistening on the gold and beautifully coloured mosaics let's go inside and have a look.

17
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,216
We've walked into the church and the centre towers over us.

18
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:28,387
And yet these apse-like shapes that are supported by columns

19
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:30,616
undulates and moves around us.

20
00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:36,539
There are massive pillars that support the building, but there's also a real delicacy. Look for instance at the way the columns

21
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,873
are doubled, that is the stacking of one set of columns

22
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:44,965
above the next. And they move in and out back into

23
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:50,072
the space of the ambulatory on the ground and up into the gallery above. But the real

24
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:54,162
gem in this church can be seen on the east end. Let's walk over there.

25
00:01:54,162 --> 00:01:57,664
The eastern end of San Vitale is completely covered in

26
00:01:57,664 --> 00:02:01,795
dense mosaic. These tiny pieces of glass and

27
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:06,540
glass sandwiched in gold that reflect the light. We're walking up

28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,506
towards the apse now: this semi-circular space. There are three large

29
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:14,236
windows and just above that, a large apse mosaic. And in the

30
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:18,804
centre we see Christ dressed royally in purple sitting on orb

31
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:23,125
the orb of the Earth, of the Universe. Below flow the four rivers

32
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:27,546
of Paradise, and on either side of him an angel.

33
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:30,339
Christ is holding the Book of the Apocalypse with the Seven

34
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:33,708
Seals visible, and in his right hand he's handing a crown

35
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:37,736
to San Vitalus, who was adopted as the primary

36
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:42,381
martyr of this city. And on the other side we see Ecclesius who founded and

37
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:46,170
sponsored the building of this church and we see him handing

38
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,790
the church to the angel beside Christ. Every

39
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,571
surface here in the apse is covered with imagery with figures

40
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:58,301
with decorative patterning. The only surfaces that really are

41
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:02,126
stone are of a very decorative marble, cut to pair

42
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:05,374
and create wonderful abstract designs. It is this

43
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:09,382
lush, glorious space, here in this city that's distant perhaps

44
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:12,543
from the capital of the Empire, but that speaks to its importance.

45
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:17,409
Right above the altar we see an image of the Lamb

46
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:21,463
of God, and the Lamb of God refers to Christ. He's wearing

47
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:25,110
a halo. This ideas of Christ as the sacrificial

48
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,214
lamb sacrificed for the redemption of mankind.

49
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:31,906
The lamb is surrounded by a wreath of victory, in this case

50
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:36,719
the idea of the triumph of Christianity itself, and that wreath is held in place

51
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,330
by four angels who stand on globes that refer

52
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,464
to the globe on which Christ in the apse sits.

53
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:49,164
And then we see Christ again, but this time older, in the archway

54
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:51,162
at the beginning of the chancel.

55
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:56,795
Right the triumphal arch has Christ in the centre. It's really a kind of bust-length portrait, and his

56
00:03:56,795 --> 00:04:01,053
body is surrounded by a mendorla kind of rainbow-coloured halo,

57
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:04,460
and then moving down the arch on either side

58
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,341
are fourteen figures, including the Apostles.

59
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:12,959
We see scenes from the Old Testament specifically the ones that prefigure the life of Christ

60
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,389
and Christ's sacrifice, and we see scenes from the New Testament.

61
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,721
There are also fabulously decorative columns, made out of a high-quality marble that

62
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:24,393
was brought from the east. What's most remarkable about these columns for me

63
00:04:24,393 --> 00:04:28,606
is that we've really left behind the Classical Orders. These are

64
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:32,382
not Doric, they're not Ionic, they're nor Corinthian. They are

65
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:37,720
the early Christians trying to invent a new iconography for their architecture.

66
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,353
And on top of the capitals we see

67
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:44,105
something called impost blocks, that help make the transition up to the arches.

68
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:47,846
The two most important important mosaics in San Vitale flank the apse.

69
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:51,110
And those show the Emperor Justinian and

70
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,512
his Empress Theodora. Now Justinian and Theodora never actually came to Ravenna.

71
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:58,940
And they're in the mosaics

72
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,004
we think, to reassert their control over the city.

73
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:07,103
For much of the 400s, Ravenna was under the control

74
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:10,306
of a Goth, Theodoric. And Theodoric was an

75
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:16,892
Arian, that is he didn't follow the Orthodoxy, the Orthodox doctrines of the Church.

76
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:18,778
And basically the Arians

77
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:22,392
believed that Christ was the creation of God

78
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:27,227
the Father, and therefore was subordinate in the hierarchy of the Trinity.

79
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,638
Christ wasn't co-equal with God the Father the way he

80
00:05:30,638 --> 00:05:33,718
is in Orthodox Christian belief, and so,

81
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:38,265
Justinian, the Emperor in Constantinople in the early 500s,

82
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:42,033
sends his general Bellesarius to conquer Italy

83
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:48,039
to reconquer Ravenna, and re-establish Orthodox Christian belief here in Ravenna.

84
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,961
And the Arian belief was suppressed, and so what we're seeing here

85
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:56,561
is the reassertion of eastern Imperial control, that is Justinian

86
00:05:56,561 --> 00:06:00,539
is in Constantinople, in the East, and he is saying I'm in

87
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,176
charge, even here, in Ravenna, in Italy.

88
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:07,605
Spiritual power goes hand-in-hand with political power, with the power of the Emperor.

89
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,715
We see Justinian in the centre,

90
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:13,174
wearing purple, the colour that is associated with the Throne.

91
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:17,610
He's surrounded by his court, but there are also religious figures,

92
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,847
representing the Church, and there are soldiers;

93
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,972
three centres of power: the Church, the Emperor, and the military.

94
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:29,308
And we can see that some of the figures are treated more individually than others.

95
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:33,894
Justinian, Maximian, are more individualised, and it's possible that

96
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,764
people of the time would have looked up and recognised the other figures who are

97
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,563
lost to us today, but the figures from the army are a lot more anonymous.

98
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:47,938
Justinian the Emperor's authority is divine, you can see a halo around his head,and he holds

99
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:53,498
a bowl associated with Eucharist, which is handing in the direction of Chris, in the apse.

100
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:57,035
Right this is a bowl that would have contained the bread for the Sacrament

101
00:06:57,035 --> 00:07:00,772
of the Eucharist. He's in the centre of the composition he's frontal,

102
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:05,391
but really all of the figures in this mosaic are frontal.

103
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:12,507
There are schematic, abstracted, medieval. We've left the Classical tradition of Naturalism behind.

104
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:16,890
And so if we look closely at the figures we can see that there's no real concern for

105
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,939
accurate proportions. Their feet don't really seem to carry the

106
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,341
weight of their bodies, they seem to float in an eternal

107
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:29,104
space and not in an earthly space. Next to

108
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:33,342
Justinian we see the bishop, Maximian, with his name above

109
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:37,502
him although that was added later, and beside him are the clergymen.

110
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:44,378
Maximian holds a beautiful jewelled cross, and he wears the same purple the Emperor wears associating

111
00:07:44,378 --> 00:07:48,896
him with the power of the Emperor in Constantinople.

112
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:53,315
The figures next to him hold a jewelled Book of the Gospels, and the

113
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:56,983
figure at the far right holds an incense burner. What we're seeing here is

114
00:07:56,983 --> 00:08:00,439
the Emperor leading a procession for the

115
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,778
enactment for the Sacrament of the Eucharist.

116
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:09,005
And in fact, the Eucharist would have been performed the the Sanctuary. The figures stand in

117
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:12,775
front of a field of gold, which is very much a Byzantine tradition.

118
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:17,818
And when we say Byzantine we are referring to the capital of the Empire which is Constantinople.

119
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:21,337
Which we now call Istanbul. You'll notice that the tesserae,

120
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:24,977
that is these small pieces of coloured glass, many of them with gold

121
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:29,350
leaf that is actually fused, almost like a sandwich, in between two pieces of

122
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,162
clear glass, are set into the wall at angles so that

123
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:36,704
the light reflects off them in a way that is complicated and beautiful

124
00:08:36,704 --> 00:08:40,600
and creates a sense of the liveliness of the surface, and that would have

125
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,061
been especially true when it was illuminated by candles and by

126
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:48,604
lanterns. Let's walk around to the other side and take a look at the panel

127
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:52,720
devoted to Theodora, Justinian's wife. To the right of the apse

128
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,149
windows, we see the panel of the Theodora the Empress, and it mirrors the panel with Justinian.

129
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:03,056
So we have an idea that Theodora, Justinian's Empress, ruled

130
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:07,561
as co-equal to Justinian, that she was a very powerful woman, even

131
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:11,396
though she was reputedly of lower class, that she was

132
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:13,316
an "entertainer", apparently.

133
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:15,818
There are some colourful descriptions of her past.

134
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:20,001
She's wearing incredibly elaborate clothing and jewellery, with

135
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:23,897
rubies, with emeralds, with sapphires, and very large pearls

136
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:28,038
and in back of her head just like Justinian, is a halo, which

137
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:31,944
speaks not to her own divinity, but to the divine origin of her

138
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:32,938
authority.

139
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:35,901
Like Justinian, whose carrying a bowl that

140
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:39,870
held the bread for the Eucharist, Theodora is carrying the chalice

141
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,924
for the wine for the Eucharist, and like Justinian too, she is surrounded by attendents

142
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:50,096
that symbolise the Imperial court. A curtain is raised as

143
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:54,206
though she is about to take part in a ceremony related to the Eucharist.

144
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:58,103
I'm really taken by the elaborate Byzantine costume.

145
00:09:58,103 --> 00:10:07,664
There's a sense of trying to bring the richness of the Imperial court in Constantinople here to Ravenna.
