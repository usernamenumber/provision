1
00:00:00,747 --> 00:00:02,864
we have now talked a lot about the demand

2
00:00:02,864 --> 00:00:04,842
and the consumer surplus

3
00:00:04,842 --> 00:00:06,048
now let's look at the other side

4
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,911
let's think about the supply curve

5
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:10,511
and you could imagine that there might be

6
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,025
something called the producer surplus

7
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:15,513
so let's say that this is price axis

8
00:00:15,513 --> 00:00:17,823
this is the quantity axis

9
00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:23,741
and let's say that we are running some type of a berry farm

10
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:26,492
and this is our supply curve

11
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:34,010
that is the supply curve and this is our demand curve

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,790
so that is the demand

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,380
and just like what we did to the supply curve

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,510
for the demand curve, now instead of thinking of a price

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,279
think about how much quantity would be supplied

16
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:47,060
let's think about a given quantity and think about what price

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,294
would it have to be in order for the producers to produce

18
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:52,082
that quantity

19
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:53,673
and let's say that this quantity right over here this is

20
00:00:53,673 --> 00:00:58,005
in thousands of ponds of berries. thousands of ponds

21
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:02,081
so this is 1 thousand ponds, 2 thousand ponds, 3 thousand

22
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:06,478
ponds, 4 thousand ponds, and 5 thousand ponds.

23
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,276
and let's say this price right over here is 1 dollar per pond

24
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:16,148
$2, $3, $4, maybe I could make it more even

25
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:22,977
so this is $3, this is $4, this is $5 per pond

26
00:01:22,977 --> 00:01:27,897
let me write this all in per pond

27
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:32,382
so let's say that we want the suppliers to produce

28
00:01:32,382 --> 00:01:39,062
1 thousand ponds of berries. so this is we want them to

29
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:40,531
produce 1 thousand ponds of berries.

30
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,857
what does the price have to be for them to produce

31
00:01:42,857 --> 00:01:47,908
1 thousand ponds of berries. well think of it from the supplier

32
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,878
from the berry farmers' point of view, if they are going

33
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:53,362
to produce 1 thousand ponds of berries. in order for them

34
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:56,142
to produce it, in order to convince them produce it.

35
00:01:56,142 --> 00:01:59,913
they have to get at minimum as much as they would get

36
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:04,395
using the same resources to produce something else

37
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:08,307
so if they could get a dollar per pond or equivalent in dollars

38
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:10,975
of a dollar per pond for those first thousand ponds of a

39
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:14,177
thousand dollars. if they could get that by producing their

40
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:19,465
land for apple or using it to grapes or maybe renting

41
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:22,676
out the land to someone else that's the minimum you would

42
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:23,978
have to pay them. because if you pay them less than that

43
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:27,916
they would go do the other thing. they would go and rent

44
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:31,252
their land out or they will allow their land for grazing.

45
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:34,353
so you would have to pay them the opportunity cost

46
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:37,867
for them to produce a thousand ponds.so the opportunity

47
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:41,502
cost for them to producing a thousand ponds would be right

48
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:44,820
over there. and this is on average first thousand ponds

49
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,421
you could also think that the very first pond, the opportunity

50
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:51,000
cost would be right over there. and the next pond would be right

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,507
after that. the five hundred pond would be there,

52
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,071
the thousand pond would right be there. or you could say

53
00:02:56,071 --> 00:03:00,424
the first thousand pond on average would be right overthere

54
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:03,333
now let's say that we wanted them to produce another

55
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,916
thousand ponds. so we want the market or this entire farm

56
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:10,137
to produce or maybe it's multiple farms to produce a total

57
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:12,607
of two thousand ponds. what would we have to do

58
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:17,233
well, same exact thing. we kind of assuming the market

59
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:20,699
is already producing that first thousand ponds. so now we

60
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:21,199
would have to think about what are they giving up to

61
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,634
produce that next thousand ponds. and now we would

62
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:28,196
assume that for that first thousand ponds, they would have

63
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:32,344
used the land and the inputs that are most suitable

64
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:39,080
so this is the most suitable resources. so we are talking

65
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,576
about the labour that really knows how to grow berries

66
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:44,478
the land where the berries are the best grown and maybe

67
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:46,907
they are really close to transportation networks so it's much

68
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:50,216
cheaper to produce and ship from there. but now if we want

69
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:52,796
another two thousand ponds of berries at this time period

70
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:58,244
and maybe this per year. if we want another thousand ponds.

71
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:01,428
they are now going to less suitable resources

72
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:04,499
maybe the land is slightly further away from the transportation resources

73
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,697
they are now going to have labours that are slightly less

74
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:09,813
efficient, they are going have to take land away from that

75
00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:12,701
might have been slightly more suitable for other things

76
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:16,213
so now the opportunity cost for these growers for the next thousand ponds

77
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:18,645
is going to be slightly higher.

78
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:21,435
so their opportunity cost is going to be like that on average

79
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:27,076
for the next thousand ponds. you could that the opportunity cost for the one thousand ponds will be right over there

80
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:29,712
for the two thousand ponds would be right over there. but

81
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:34,208
on average for the two thousand ponds. this is their opportunity cost

82
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,908
now, same thing, the next thousand ponds after that If we

83
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:41,482
want to get the market if we want the whole supply be three thousand ponds

84
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,064
they would have to produce, they would have to get that

85
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:47,948
their opportunity across that incremental thousand ponds

86
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:50,698
that opportunity cost of that incremental thousand ponds

87
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:55,360
so view it as this way, the supply curve no longer and it is

88
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,929
the same exact curve, before we used to say, oh if we want

89
00:04:57,929 --> 00:05:02,299
how much would people produce if the price were 3 dollars

90
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:05,247
oh they produce 3 thousand ponds, now we are looking at

91
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:08,683
the other way, we are saying if we want the suppliers to

92
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,462
produce 3 thousand ponds, what would the price actually

93
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:16,599
have to be. now with that out of the way. now we can think

94
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,858
about the supply curve is really a opportunity cost curve

95
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:23,514
for the suppliers. and let's say that this is supply and the

96
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:26,742
demand, and then this would be the actual price which

97
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:29,397
supply equals demand right over there so let's

98
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:32,448
just say that is the market price. so what's going on

99
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:35,201
over here, all of the suppliers, so this is the price

100
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,065
here let's just for making the math simple let's just say

101
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:41,114
that price here is 4 dollars and the quantity demanded

102
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:44,745
and the quantity supplied here is 4 thousand ponds. what's going on

103
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:48,333
here, the very first 4 thousand pond produced by the

104
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,714
suppliers, the opportunity cost for them to produce it

105
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:52,326
would be 4 dollars. we are gonna get exactly 4 dollars for it

106
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:58,915
so they are right on the fence. but for the first three

107
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:04,029
thousand 999 ponds, the opportunity cost of producing it

108
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,063
was lower than the price to get it, so in this situation

109
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:12,416
the producers are getting more, for the first 3999 ponds

110
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:16,798
they are getting more for their berries than their opportunity

111
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:18,561
cost. and just like we talked about the consumer surplus

112
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:25,428
this is the producer surplus. so for example for the first thousand ponds right here

113
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:29,934
the producers, their opportunity cost was a little over a dollar a pond

114
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:32,408
but they are getting 4 dollar a pond for it

115
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:35,162
for the next thousand ponds, the opportunity cost is approaching

116
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:38,967
2 dollars per pond. like a 1.75, just eyeballing it

117
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:41,531
once again, they are getting 4 dollars a pond for it

118
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:44,198
so they are getting this surplus, so if you think about

119
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:48,381
the entire market, the producers as a whole, they are getting this entire

120
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:52,696
area, this entire area represents the excess value that they are getting above and beyond

121
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:57,764
their opportunity cost. and we call this right over here the

122
00:06:57,764 --> 00:07:03,903
producer surplus. the producer surplus. and we are assuming

123
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:07,384
or we will assume a linear supply curve

124
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,259
right over here. this is just a triangle. the area of

125
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:15,949
a triangle. this length right on this side is just 4-1

126
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,646
it's just 3. 3 dollar per pond

127
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:24,213
and then this length right over here is 4 thousand

128
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:27,049
ponds. 4 thousand ponds. so to find the producer surplus

129
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,831
we are just finding the area of this region

130
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:31,543
so, let me write this, the producer surplus

131
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:34,598
here is going to be, I will use the same color

132
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,197
3 times, I want to do it with pink

133
00:07:38,197 --> 00:07:45,515
3 times the 4 thousand, and that would give us

134
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:48,044
the area of this entire rectangle, so we have to divide it

135
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:51,878
by 2. that's just finding the area of the triangle.

136
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:55,647
so times one half. dividing by 2. and so this gives us one

137
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,166
half times 4thousand is 2 thousand times 3 is 6 thousand

138
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,750
and you could look at the unit it's 6 thousand

139
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:09,100
or 3 dollar per pond times thousand of ponds per week

140
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,548
so we end up with, so the, we end up with 6 thousand dollars

141
00:08:14,548 --> 99:59:59,999
of producers' surplus per week.
