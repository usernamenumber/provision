1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,430
   

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,440
I want to bring everything we've
learned about linear

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,450
independence and dependence,
and the span of a set of

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,850
vectors together in one
particularly hairy problem,

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,850
because if you understand what
this problem is all about, I

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,640
think you understand what we're
doing, which is key to

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,120
your understanding of linear
algebra, these two concepts.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,230
So the first question I'm going
to ask about the set of

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,050
vectors s, and they're all
three-dimensional vectors,

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:34,020
they have three components, Is
the span of s equal to R3?

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,070
It seems like it might be.

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,160
If each of these add new
information, it seems like

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,680
maybe I could describe any
vector in R3 by these three

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,500
vectors, by some combination
of these three vectors.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,540
And the second question I'm
going to ask is are they

16
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,910
linearly independent?

17
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,700
And maybe I'll be able to answer
them at the same time.

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,240
So let's answer the first one.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,600
Do they span R3?

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,760
To span R3, that means some
linear combination of these

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,540
three vectors should be able to
construct any vector in R3.

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,340
So let me give you a linear
combination of these vectors.

23
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:18,450
I could have c1 times the first
vector, 1, minus 1, 2

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,260
plus some other arbitrary
constant c2, some scalar,

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:28,890
times the second vector, 2, 1,
2 plus some third scaling

26
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,680
vector times the third
vector minus 1, 0, 2.

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,070
I should be able to, using some
arbitrary constants, take

28
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,010
a combination of these vectors
that sum up to

29
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,990
any vector in R3.

30
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,620
And I'm going to represent any
vector in R3 by the vector a,

31
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,090
b, and c, where a, b, and
c are any real numbers.

32
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,850
So if you give me any a, b, and
c, and I can give you a

33
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,140
formula for telling you what
your c3's, your c2's and your

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,640
c1's are, then than essentially
means that it

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,200
spans R3, because if you give me
a vector, I can always tell

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,850
you how to construct that
vector with these three.

37
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,650
So Let's see if I can do that.

38
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,790
Just from our definition of
scalar multiplication of a

39
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,810
vector, we know that c1 times
this vector, I could rewrite

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,380
it if I want.

41
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,660
I normally skip this
step, but I really

42
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,370
want to make it clear.

43
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,770
So c1 times, I could just
rewrite as 1 times c-- it's

44
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,950
each of the terms times c1.

45
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,840
Similarly, c2 times this is the
same thing as each of the

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,790
terms times c2.

47
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,040
And c3 times this is the
same thing as each of

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,535
the terms times c3.

49
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,760
I want to show you that
everything we do it just

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,220
formally comes from our
definition of multiplication

51
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,980
of a vector times a scalar,
which is what we just did, or

52
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,550
vector addition, which is
what we're about to do.

53
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,500
So vector addition tells us that
this term plus this term

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,010
plus this term needs
to equal that term.

55
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,100
So let me write that down.

56
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:05,470
We get c1 plus 2c2 minus
c3 will be equal to a.

57
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,950
Likewise, we can do the same
thing with the next row.

58
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:14,160
Minus c1 plus c2 plus 0c3
must be equal to b.

59
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:21,600
So we get minus c1 plus c2 plus
0c3-- so we don't even

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,240
have to write that-- is going
to be equal to b.

61
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,940
And then finally, let's
just do that last row.

62
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:43,390
2c1 plus 3c2 plus 2c3 is
going to be equal to c.

63
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,430
Now, let's see if we can solve
for our different constants.

64
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,810
I'm going to do it
by elimination.

65
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,750
I think you might be familiar
with this process.

66
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,160
I think I've done it in some of
the earlier linear algebra

67
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,480
videos before I started doing
a formal presentation of it.

68
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,540
And I'm going to review it again
in a few videos from

69
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,190
now, but I think you
understand how to

70
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,260
solve it this way.

71
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,150
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to first eliminate these

72
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,390
two terms and then I'm going
to eliminate this term, and

73
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,150
then I can solve for my
various constants.

74
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,750
If I want to eliminate this term
right here, what I could

75
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,050
do is I could add this equation
to that equation.

76
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,209
Or even better, I can replace
this equation with the sum of

77
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,750
these two equations.

78
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,269
Let me do that.

79
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,120
I'm just going to add these two
equations to each other

80
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,350
and replace this one
with that sum.

81
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,140
So minus c1 plus c1, that
just gives you 0.

82
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,380
I can ignore it.

83
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,630
Then c2 plus 2c2, that's 3c2.

84
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,450
   

85
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:42,910
And then 0 plus minus c3
is equal to minus c3.

86
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,400
Minus c3 is equal to-- and I'm
replacing this with the sum of

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,900
these two, so b plus a.

88
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,110
It equals b plus a.

89
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,070
Let me write down that first
equation on the top.

90
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,810
So the first equation, I'm
not doing anything to it.

91
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:03,730
So I get c1 plus 2c2 minus
c3 is equal to a.

92
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,120
Now, in this last equation, I
want to eliminate this term.

93
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,260
Let's take this equation and
subtract from it 2 times this

94
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,510
top equation.

95
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,700
   

96
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,810
You can also view it as let's
add this to minus 2 times this

97
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,090
top equation.

98
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,890
Since we're almost done using
this when we actually even

99
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,900
wrote it, let's just multiply
this times minus 2.

100
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:42,200
So this becomes a minus 2c1
minus 4c2 plus 2c3 is

101
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,300
equal to minus 2a.

102
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,890
If you just multiply each of
these terms-- I want to be

103
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:47,540
very careful.

104
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,600
I don't want to make
a careless mistake.

105
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,700
Minus 2 times c1 minus 4 plus
2 and then minus 2.

106
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,830
And now we can add these
two together.

107
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,520
And what do we get?

108
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,380
2c1 minus 2c1, that's a 0.

109
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,540
I don't have to write it.

110
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,300
3c2 minus 4c2, that's
a minus c2.

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,030
   

112
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:16,890
And then you have your 2c3 plus
another 2c3, so that is

113
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:26,710
equal to plus 4c3 is equal
to c minus 2a.

114
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,820
All I did is I replaced this
with this minus 2 times that,

115
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,070
and I got this.

116
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,740
   

117
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,580
Now I'm going to keep my top
equation constant again.

118
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,160
I'm not going to do anything
to it, so I'm just going to

119
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,230
move it to the right.

120
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:48,440
So I get c1 plus 2c2 minus
c3 is equal to a.

121
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,320
I'm also going to keep my second
equation the same, so I

122
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:59,040
get 3c2 minus c3 is
equal to b plus a.

123
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,900
Let me scroll over a good bit.

124
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,620
And then this last equation
I want to eliminate.

125
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,520
My goal is to eliminate
this term right here.

126
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,960
What I want to do is I want to
multiply this bottom equation

127
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,070
times 3 and add it to this
middle equation to eliminate

128
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,000
this term right here.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,840
So if I multiply this bottom
equation times 3-- let me just

130
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,190
do-- well, actually, I don't
want to make things messier,

131
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,010
so this becomes a minus 3 plus
a 3, so those cancel out.

132
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,940
This becomes a 12 minus a 1.

133
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:43,040
So this becomes 12c3 minus
c3, which is 11c3.

134
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,690
And then this becomes a-- oh,
sorry, I was already done.

135
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,570
When I do 3 times this plus
that, those canceled out.

136
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,540
And then when I multiplied 3
times this, I get 12c3 minus a

137
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,810
c3, so that's 11c3.

138
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:11,770
And I multiplied this times 3
plus this, so I get 3c minus

139
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:17,280
6a-- I'm just multiplying
this times 3-- plus

140
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,490
this, plus b plus a.

141
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,280
So what can I rewrite this by?

142
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,600
Actually, I want to make
something very clear.

143
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,810
This c is different than these
c1's, c2's and c3's

144
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,710
that I had up here.

145
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,940
I think you realize that.

146
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,010
But I just realized that I used
the letters c twice, and

147
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,490
I just didn't want any
confusion here.

148
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,850
So this c that doesn't have any
subscript is a different

149
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,059
constant then all of these
things over here.

150
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,930
Let's see if we can
simplify this.

151
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,550
We have an a and a minus 6a,
so let's just add them.

152
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,500
So let's get rid of that a and
this becomes minus 5a.

153
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,630
If we divide both sides
of this equation by

154
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,520
11, what do we get?

155
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:13,310
We get c3 is equal to 1/11
times 3c minus 5a.

156
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,570
So you give me any a or
c and I'll already

157
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,810
tell you what c3 is.

158
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,190
What is c2?

159
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,590
c2 is equal to-- let
me simplify this

160
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,960
equation right here.

161
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,710
Let me do it right there.

162
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,250
So if I just add c3 to both
sides of the equation, I get

163
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:34,370
3c2 is equal to b
plus a plus c3.

164
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:40,160
And if I divide both sides of
this by 3, I get c2 is equal

165
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,930
to 1/3 times b plus a plus c3.

166
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll just leave it like
that for now.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,190
Then what is c1 equal to?

168
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,000
I could just rewrite this top
equation as if I subtract 2c2

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,430
and add c3 to both sides,
I get c1 is equal to a

170
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,990
minus 2c2 plus c3.

171
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,240
What have I just shown you?

172
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,660
   

173
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,580
You can give me any vector in
R3 that you want to find.

174
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,040
So you can give me any real
number for a, any real number

175
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,760
for b, any real number for c.

176
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,660
And if you give me those
numbers, I'm claiming now that

177
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,150
I can always tell you some
combination of these three

178
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,980
vectors that will
add up to those.

179
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,160
And I've actually already solved
for what I have to

180
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,260
multiply each of those
vectors by to add up

181
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,620
to this third vector.

182
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,770
So you give me your a's, b's
and c's, I just have to

183
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,240
substitute into the a's and
the c's right here.

184
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,220
Oh, sorry.

185
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,780
I forgot this b over here.

186
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,230
There's also a b.

187
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,130
It was suspicious that I didn't
have to deal with a b.

188
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,040
So there was a b right there.

189
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,090
So this is 3c minus 5a plus b.

190
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,860
Let me write that.

191
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,300
There's a b right there
in a parentheses.

192
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,720
But I think you get
the general idea.

193
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,100
You give me your a's,
b's and c's, any

194
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,290
real numbers can apply.

195
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,290
There's no division over here,
so I don't have to worry about

196
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,810
dividing by zero.

197
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,600
So this is just a linear
combination of any real

198
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,950
numbers, so I can clearly
get another real number.

199
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,050
So you give me your a's,
b's and c's, I'm going

200
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,800
to give you a c3.

201
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,170
Now, you gave me a's,
b's and c's.

202
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,070
I got a c3.

203
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,290
This is just going to be
another real number.

204
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,750
I'm just going to take that with
your former a's and b's

205
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,030
and I'm going to be able
to give you a c2.

206
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,530
We were already able to solve
for a c2 and a c3, and then I

207
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,325
just use your a as well,
and then I'm going

208
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,575
to give you a c1.

209
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,690
   

210
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,490
Hopefully, you're seeing that no
matter what a, b, and c you

211
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,600
give me, I can give you
a c1, c2, or c3.

212
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,200
There's no reason that any a's,
b's or c's should break

213
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,100
down these formulas.

214
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,410
We're not doing any division, so
it's not like a zero would

215
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,070
break it down.

216
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,380
I can say definitively that the
set of vectors, of these

217
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,930
three vectors, does
indeed span R3.

218
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,980
Let me ask you another
question.

219
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,120
I already asked it.

220
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,530
Are these vectors linearly
independent?

221
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,340
   

222
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,570
We said in order for them to be
linearly independent, the

223
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:28,900
only solution to c1 times my
first vector, 1, minus 1, 2,

224
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:36,920
plus c2 times my second vector,
2, 1, 3, plus c3 times

225
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,670
my third vector,
minus 1, 0, 2.

226
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,510
If something is linearly
independent that means that

227
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:51,970
the only solution to this
equation-- so I want to find

228
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,320
some set of combinations of
these vectors that add up to

229
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,830
the zero vector, and I did that
in the previous video.

230
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,900
If they are linearly dependent,
there must be some

231
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,890
non-zero solution.

232
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,260
One of these constants, at least
one of these constants,

233
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,440
would be non-zero for
this solution.

234
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,670
You can always make them zero,
no matter what, but if they

235
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,120
are linearly dependent,
then one of

236
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,870
these could be non-zero.

237
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:23,080
If they're linearly independent
then all of these

238
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,740
have to be-- the only solution
to this equation

239
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,570
would be c1, c2, c3.

240
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,870
All have to be equal to
0. c1, c2, c3 all have

241
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,070
to be equal to 0.

242
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,460
Linear independence implies
this, this implies linear

243
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,256
independence.

244
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:44,770
Now, this is the exact same
thing we did here, but in this

245
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,330
case, I'm just picking my a's,
b's and c's to be zero.

246
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:55,170
This is a, this is b and
this is c, right?

247
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,030
I can pick any vector in R3
for my a's, b's and c's.

248
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,030
I'm now picking the
zero vector.

249
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,740
So let's see what our c1's,
c2's and c3's are.

250
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,820
So my a equals b is equal
to c is equal to 0.

251
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,940
I'm setting it equal
to the zero vector.

252
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,980
What linear combination of these
three vectors equal the

253
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,490
zero vector?

254
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,150
Well, if a, b, and c are all
equal to 0, that term is 0,

255
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,910
that is 0, that is 0.

256
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,350
You have 1/11 times
0 minus 0 plus 0.

257
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,380
That's just 0.

258
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,140
So c3 is equal to 0.

259
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,320
Now, if c3 is equal to 0, we
already know that a is equal

260
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,210
to 0 and b is equal to 0.

261
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,090
C2 is 1/3 times 0,
so it equals 0.

262
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:39,850
Now what's c1?

263
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,400
Well, it's c3, which is 0.

264
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,240
c2 is 0, so 2 times 0 is 0.

265
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,460
So c1 is just going
to be equal to a.

266
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,960
I just said a is equal to 0.

267
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:58,210
So the only solution to this
equation right here, the only

268
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,570
linear combination of these
three vectors that result in

269
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,690
the zero vector are when you
weight all of them by zero.

270
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:11,600
So I just showed you that c1, c2
and c3 all have to be zero.

271
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,820
And because they're all zero,
we know that this is a

272
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:22,240
linearly independent
set of vectors.

273
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,610
Or that none of these vectors
can be represented as a

274
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,680
combination of the other two.

275
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,150
   

276
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,750
This is interesting.

277
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,170
I have exactly three vectors
that span R3 and they're

278
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,820
linearly independent.

279
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,810
And linearly independent, in my
brain that means, look, I

280
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,640
don't have any redundant
vectors, anything that could

281
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,340
have just been built with the
other vectors, and I have

282
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,190
exactly three vectors,
and it's spanning R3.

283
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,970
So in general, and I haven't
proven this to you, but I

284
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,070
could, is that if you have
exactly three vectors and they

285
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,590
do span R3, they have to be
linearly independent.

286
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,680
If they weren't linearly
independent, then one of these

287
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,930
would be redundant.

288
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,490
Let's say that that guy
was a redundant one.

289
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,150
I always pick the third one, but
let's say this guy would

290
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,580
be redundant, which means that
the span of this would be

291
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,790
equal to the span of
these two, right?

292
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,200
Because if this guy is
redundant, he could just be

293
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,730
part of the span of
these two guys.

294
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,760
And the span of two of vectors
could never span R3.

295
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,850
Or the other way you could go,
if you have three linear

296
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,950
independent-- three tuples, and
they're all independent,

297
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,960
then you can also say
that that spans R3.

298
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,820
I haven't proven that to you,
but hopefully, you get the

299
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,450
sense that each of these
is contributing new

300
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,960
directionality, right?

301
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,220
One is going like that.

302
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,510
They're not completely
orthogonal to each other, but

303
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,040
they're giving just enough

next video.
