1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,860
SAL: I've done a bunch of videos
where I use words like

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,150
pressure and-- let me write
these down-- pressure and

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,950
temperature and volume.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,840
And I've done them in the
chemistry and physics

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,780
playlist. Especially the physics
playlist, but even in

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:27,220
the chemistry playlist, I also
use words like kinetic energy.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,120
I'll just write e for energy.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,280
Or I use force and velocity.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,940
And you know, a whole bunch of
other types of, I guess,

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,300
properties of things, for
better or for worse.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,910
And in this video what I want
to do is I want to make a

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,510
distinction.

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,800
Because it becomes important
when we start getting a little

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,660
bit more precise, especially
when we get more precise in

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,110
thermodynamics, or, I guess,
you know, the study of how

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,740
heat moves around.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,320
So these properties right
here, these are

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,655
properties of a system.

20
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:02,085
Or we could call them
macrostates of a system.

21
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:09,870
   

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,340
And these could be
macrostates.

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,170
So for example, let me make it
clear, when I call a system,

24
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:23,750
if I have some balloon like
this, and it has a little tie

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,410
there and, you know, maybe
it has a string.

26
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,350
This has these macrostates
associated with it.

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,060
There is some pressure
in that balloon.

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,020
Remember that's force
per area.

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,030
There is some temperature
for that balloon.

30
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,850
And there's some volume to
the balloon, obviously.

31
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,170
But all of these, these help
us relate what's going on

32
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,200
inside that balloon, or what
that balloon is doing in kind

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,560
of an every day reality.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,020
Before people even knew about
what an atom was, or maybe

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,830
they thought that there might
be such an atom but they had

36
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,910
never proved it, they were
dealing with these

37
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,820
macrostates.

38
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,070
They could measure pressure,
they could measure

39
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,210
temperature, they could
measure volume.

40
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,030
Now we know that that pressure
is due to things like, you

41
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,020
have a bunch of atoms
bumping around.

42
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,870
And let's say that this is a
gas-- it's a balloon- it's

43
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,170
going to be a gas.

44
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,910
And we know that the pressure is
actually caused-- and I've

45
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,320
done several, I think I did
the same video in both the

46
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,750
chemistry and the physics
playlist. I did them a year

47
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,670
apart, so you can see if my
thinking has evolved at all.

48
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,790
But we know that the pressure's
really due by the

49
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,280
bumps of these particles as they
bump into the walls and

50
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,740
the side of the balloon.

51
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,570
And we have so many particles
at any given point of time,

52
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,530
some of them are bumping into
the wall the balloon, and

53
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,280
that's what's essentially
keeping the balloon pushed

54
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,260
outward, giving it its pressure
and its volume.

55
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,790
We've talked about temperature,
as essentially

56
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,290
the average kinetic energy of
these-- which is a function of

57
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,430
these particles, which could
be either the molecules of

58
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,650
gas, or if it's an ideal gas,
it could be just the

59
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,650
atoms of the gas.

60
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,260
Maybe it's atoms of helium or
neon, or something like that.

61
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,030
And all of these things, these
describe the microstates.

62
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,440
So for example, I could describe
what's going on with

63
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,890
the balloon.

64
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,510
I could say, hey, you know,
there are-- I could just make

65
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,500
up some numbers.

66
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:29,040
The pressure is five newtons
per meters squared, or some

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,760
number of pascals.

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,320
The units aren't what's
important.

69
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,490
In this video I really
just want to make the

70
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,430
differentiation between these
two ways of describing

71
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,150
what's going on.

72
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,640
I could say the temperature
is 300 kelvin.

73
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,230
I could say that the volume
is, I don't know,

74
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,660
maybe it's one liter.

75
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,020
And I've described a system,
but I've described in on a

76
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,520
macro level.

77
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,400
Now I could get a lot more
precise, especially now that

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,600
we know that things like atoms
and molecules exist. What I

79
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,690
could do, is I could essentially
label every one of

80
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,930
these molecules, or let's say
atoms, in the gas that's

81
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,810
contained in the balloon.

82
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,570
And I could say, at exactly this
moment in time, I could

83
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:21,399
say at time equals 0, atom 1
has-- its momentum is equal to

84
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:27,760
x, and its position, in
three-dimensional coordinates,

85
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,480
is x, y, and z.

86
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,910
And then I could say, atom
number 2-- its momentum-- I'm

87
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,700
just using rho for momentum--
it's equal to y.

88
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,050
And its position is a, b, c.

89
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:49,270
And I could list every atom
in this molecule.

90
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,300
Obviously we're dealing with a
huge number of atoms, on the

91
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,320
order of 10 to the
20 something.

92
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,580
So it's a massive list I would
have to give you, but I could

93
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,300
literally give you the state of
every atom in this balloon.

94
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,280
And then if I did that, I
would be giving you the

95
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,790
microstates.

96
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,550
Or I would give you a specific
microstate of the

97
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,280
balloon at this time.

98
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,300
Now when a system-- and I'm
going to introduce a word

99
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,020
here, because this word is
important, especially as we

100
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,400
go-- is in thermodynamic
equilibrium.

101
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,680
So let me write that down.

102
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,300
   

103
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,550
Equilibrium.

104
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,190
   

105
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,330
We learned about equilibrium
from the

106
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,390
chemistry point of view.

107
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,680
And that tells you, that the
amount of something going into

108
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,620
forward reaction is equivalent
to the amount going in the

109
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,890
reverse reaction.

110
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,300
And when we talk about
macrostates, thermodynamic

111
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,820
equilibrium essentially
says that the

112
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,300
macrostate is defined.

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,580
That they're not changing.

114
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,260
If this balloon is in
equilibrium, at time 1 its

115
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,240
pressure, temperature, and
volume will be these things.

116
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,690
And if we look at it a second
later, its pressure,

117
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,340
temperature, and volume will
also be these things.

118
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,870
It's in equilibrium.

119
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,550
None of the macrostates
have changed.

120
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,620
And actually, I'll talk about
in a second, in order for

121
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,180
these macrostates to even be
defined, to be well defined,

122
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,270
you have to be in equilibrium.

123
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,970
I'll talk about that
in a second.

124
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,110
Now, at second number, at time
equals 0, you might have this

125
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,750
whole set of-- I went and
I listed 10 to the

126
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,680
20th-something microstates of
all the different atoms in

127
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,900
this molecule.

128
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,120
But then if I look at these
gases a second later, I'm

129
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,280
going to have a completely
different microstate right?

130
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,210
Because all of these guys are
going to have bumped into each

131
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,640
other, and given each other
their momentum.

132
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,770
And all sorts of crazy things
could have happened in a

133
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,530
second here, so I would have
a completely different

134
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,510
microstate.

135
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,520
So even though we're at
thermodynamic equilibrium, and

136
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,320
our macrostate stayed the same,
our microstates are

137
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,770
changing every gazillionth
of a second.

138
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,440
They're constantly changing.

139
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,590
And that's why, for the most
part, in thermodynamic, we

140
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,370
tend to deal with these
macrostates.

141
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,430
And actually most of
thermodynamics, or at least

142
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,510
most of what you'll learn in
a first-year chemistry or

143
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,210
physics course, it was devised
or it was thought about well

144
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,280
before people even had a sense
of what was going on at the

145
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,410
macro level.

146
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,350
That's often a very important
thing to think about.

147
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,430
And we'll go into concepts
like entropy and internal

148
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,930
energy, and things like that.

149
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,040
And you can rack your brain, how
does it relate to atoms?

150
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,320
And we will relate them to
atoms and molecules.

151
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,980
But it's useful to think that
the people who first came up

152
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,680
with these concepts came up
with them not really being

153
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,890
sure of what was going on
at the micro level.

154
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,860
They were just measuring
everything at the macro level.

155
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,490
Now I want to go back to this
idea here, of equilibrium.

156
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,000
   

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,370
Because in order for these
macrostates to be defined, the

158
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,140
system has to be
in equilibrium.

159
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,800
And let me explain
what that means.

160
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,220
If I were to take a cylinder.

161
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,000
And we will be using this
cylinder a lot, so it's good

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,685
to get used to this cylinder.

163
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,810
   

164
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,210
And it's got a piston in it.

165
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,840
And that's just, it's kind of
the roof of the cylinder can

166
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,830
move up and down.

167
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,510
This is the roof of
the cylinder.

168
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,780
The cylinder's bigger, but let's
say this is a, kind of a

169
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,850
roof of the cylinder.

170
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,550
And we can move this
up and down.

171
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,420
And essentially we'll just be
changing the volume of the

172
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,260
cylinder, right?

173
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,150
I could have drawn
it this way.

174
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,400
I could have drawn it
like a cylinder.

175
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,740
   

176
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,950
I could have drawn it like this,
and then I could have

177
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,490
drawn the piston like this.

178
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,210
So there's some depth here
that I'm not showing.

179
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,220
We're just looking at the
cylinder front on.

180
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,130
And so, at any point in time,
let's say the gas is between

181
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,099
the cylinder and the floor
of our container.

182
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,120
   

183
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,140
You know, we have a bunch of
molecules of gas here, a huge

184
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,250
number of molecules.

185
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,200
And let's say that we have
a rock on the cylinder.

186
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,170
We're doing this in space
so everything above

187
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,480
the piston is a vacuum.

188
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,070
Actually just let me erase
everything above.

189
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,110
Let me just erase this stuff,
just so you see.

190
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,410
We're doing this in space and
we're doing it in a vacuum.

191
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,990
Just let me write that down.

192
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:13,500
So all of this stuff up here is
a vacuum, which essentially

193
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,940
says there's nothing there.

194
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,380
There's no pressure from here,
there's no particles here,

195
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,410
just empty space.

196
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,410
And in order to keep this-- we
know already, we've studied it

197
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,710
multiple times, that this gas is
generating, you know things

198
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,800
are bumping into the wall,
the floor of this

199
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,240
piston all the time.

200
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,390
They're bumping into
everything, right?

201
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,850
We know that's continuously
happening.

202
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,970
So we would apply some pressure
to offset the

203
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,350
pressure being generated
by the gas.

204
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,110
Otherwise the piston
would just expand.

205
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,380
It would just move up and the
whole gas would expand.

206
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,920
So let's just say we stick a
big rock or a big weight on

207
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,440
top of-- let me do it in a
different color-- We put a big

208
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,580
weight on top of this piston,
where the force-- completely

209
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,100
offsets the force being
applied by the gas.

210
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,370
And obviously this is some force
over some area-- right,

211
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,240
the area of the piston-- over
some areas so that we could

212
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,070
figure out its pressure.

213
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,020
And that pressure will
completely offset the pressure

214
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,940
of the gas.

215
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,720
But the pressure of the gas,
just as a reminder, is going

216
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,370
in every direction.

217
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,230
The pressure on this plate is
the same as the pressure on

218
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,250
that side, or on that side, or
on the bottom of the container

219
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,510
that we're dealing with.

220
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,450
Now let's say that we were to
just evaporate this-- well

221
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,330
let's not say that we
evaporate the rock.

222
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,220
Let's say that we just evaporate
half of the rock

223
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,560
immediately.

224
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,630
So all of a sudden our weight
that's being pushed down, or

225
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,700
the force that's being pushed
down just goes to half

226
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,270
immediately.

227
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,630
Let me draw that.

228
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,850
So I have-- maybe I would be
better off just cut and

229
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,980
pasting this right here.

230
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,610
So if I copy and paste it.

231
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,392
So now I'm going to evaporate
half of that rock magically.

232
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:59,980
So let me take my eraser tool.

233
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,190
And I just evaporate
half of it.

234
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,180
And now what's going
to happen?

235
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:11,110
Well, this piston is now
applying half the force.

236
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,150
It can't offset the pressure
due to this gas.

237
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,430
So this whole thing is going
to be pushed upwards.

238
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,240
But I did it so fast. I did it
so fast. And you could try it.

239
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,220
I mean, this would be truth
of a lot of things.

240
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,300
If you had a weight hanging from
a spring, and you would

241
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,610
just remove half the weight, it
wouldn't just go very, you

242
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,940
know, nice and smoothly
to another state.

243
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,920
What's going to happen is--
and let me see if I can do

244
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,070
this using their cut and paste
tool-- it'll essentially,

245
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,660
right when I evaporate half of
it, the gas is going to expand

246
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,945
a bunch, and then this weight
is going to come back down,

247
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:41,590
it's going to spring
and go down.

248
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,570
So let me do it again.

249
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,260
It's going to expand, because
that gas is going to push up,

250
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,750
and then it's going
to come back down.

251
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,020
And then, it's just going to
oscillate a little bit.

252
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,330
And then eventually it'll come
back to some stable and maybe

253
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,490
it'll go back.

254
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,680
It'll look, like right
about there.

255
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,380
And let me fill this in.

256
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,605
This shouldn't be white,
it should be black.

257
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:04,605
Let me put some walls on
it, on the container.

258
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:09,100
   

259
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,240
So if we wait long enough,
eventually we'll get to

260
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,720
another equilibrium state, where
this thing, the piston

261
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,570
on top isn't, or the ceiling
isn't moving anymore.

262
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,810
And now the gas has filled
this container.

263
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,850
Now, at this point in time
we were in equilibrium.

264
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,520
The pressure throughout
the gas was the same.

265
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,960
The temperature throughout
the gas was the same.

266
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,720
The volume was in a
stable situation.

267
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,860
It wasn't changing from
second to second.

268
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,050
So because of that, our
macrostates were well defined.

269
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:47,530
   

270
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,750
Now, when we wait long enough,
this thing will get to some

271
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,600
stability where this
thing stops moving.

272
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,440
When this thing stops moving
our volume stops changing.

273
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,760
And hopefully our pressure will
start to become uniform

274
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,800
throughout the container.

275
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,290
And our temperature will
become uniform.

276
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,240
And we'll now be a higher volume
or lower pressure,

277
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,160
probably a lower temperature if
we assume that there's no

278
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,870
other heat being added
to the system.

279
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,580
And then we'll be well
defined again.

280
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,140
So we could say what the
pressure, and the volume, and

281
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,070
the temperature's going to be.

282
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,880
But what about right when
I removed this rock?

283
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,030
And this thing flew up and it
oscillated, and for a while

284
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,080
the pressure at the top
was lower than the

285
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,790
pressure down here.

286
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,750
Maybe the temperature at the
top was lower than the

287
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,930
temperature down here.

288
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,740
The whole thing was in
a state of flux.

289
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,440
It was not an equilibrium.

290
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,390
And at that point, when we're--
let me let me draw

291
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,110
that really-- so you know, when
we were in that state,

292
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,140
where everything was just
crazy, right when we

293
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,840
evaporated the rock.

294
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,560
You know, we have a little
rock up here.

295
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,490
Everything is going
up and down.

296
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,320
Maybe the pressure up here
was lower than the

297
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,820
pressure down here.

298
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,610
Everything did not have
a chance to reach an

299
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,560
equilibrium.

300
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,950
At this state-- and this is
important, especially as we go

301
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,570
into talking about things like
reversible reactions, and

302
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,580
reversible processes, and
quasi-static processes.

303
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,100
At this point in the reaction,
when we just did this, none of

304
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,030
these macrostates were
well defined.

305
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,350
You couldn't tell me what the
volume of this system is,

306
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,720
because it's changing for every
second to second, or

307
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,000
microsecond to microsecond,
it's fluctuating.

308
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,110
You couldn't tell me what the
pressure of the system is,

309
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,950
because it's changing
every second.

310
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,300
You couldn't tell me what
the temperature is.

311
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,380
Maybe the temperature could
be something there.

312
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,880
It could be something there.

313
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,900
All sorts of crazy things
are happening.

314
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,500
So when the system is in
a state of flux, your

315
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,670
macrostates are not
well defined.

316
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,690
And I really want to hit
that point home.

317
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,190
So me just draw that
in a diagram.

318
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,450
Let me draw that in
a PV diagram.

319
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,340
And we're going to use
these fairly heavily.

320
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,300
So on my y-axis I'm going
to put pressure.

321
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,500
In my x-axis I'm going
to put volume.

322
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,720
So our initial state here, when
we had the rock sitting

323
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,420
on top of the ceiling, this
movable ceiling or this

324
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,100
piston, maybe we had
some well-defined

325
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,090
pressure and volume.

326
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,420
So my y, this is pressure
and this is volume.

327
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,260
So this is where
we started off.

328
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,800
So it was well defined.

329
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,050
This is state 1.

330
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,500
Let me label it right there.

331
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,270
Now when we evaporated half the
rock, we eventually waited

332
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,580
long enough, and this got
to an equilibrium.

333
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,560
We got to state 2, and our
pressure volume and out

334
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,310
temperature was well defined.

335
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,670
And I'll just put it on
this pressure volume.

336
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,630
So maybe this is state 2.

337
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,500
We got down here.

338
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,920
And just as an aside, I could
maybe put temperature as an

339
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,690
extra dimension, but temperature
is completely

340
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,420
determined by pressure and
volume, especially if we're

341
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,030
dealing with an ideal gas.

342
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,470
Remember, and we did this in
multiple videos, you have PV

343
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,300
is equal to nRT.

344
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,750
These are constants.

345
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,260
The number of moles
isn't changing.

346
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,710
This is the universal gas
constant, not changing.

347
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,180
So if you know P and
V you know T.

348
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,110
So that's the only two things
we have to plot.

349
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,460
But I'll talk a lot more about
that in future videos.

350
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,020
But the important thing to
realize is, I started off at

351
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,750
this state, where pressure and
volume were well defined.

352
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,980
I finished in this state, where
pressure and volume were

353
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,210
well defined.

354
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,810
But how did I get there?

355
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,220
And because this reaction I
did, all of a sudden it

356
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,960
happened super fast, and it was
essentially thrown out of

357
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,210
equilibrium.

358
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:33,640
   

359
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,650
I don't know how I got here.

360
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,960
The pressure and volume were
not well defined from going

361
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,090
from that state to this state.

362
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,500
Pressure, volume, and
temperature are only well

363
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:50,580
defined if every intermediate
step is still almost in

364
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,190
equilibrium.

365
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,950
And we'll talk a lot more about
that in the next video.

366
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,500
But I want to really make
this point home.

367
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,390
It would be nice if we
could draw some path.

368
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:02,240
We could say, we moved from some
pressure and volume to

369
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,339
some other pressure and volume,
and we moved along a

370
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,720
well-defined path.

371
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,410
But we cannot say that.

372
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,240
Because when we went from there
there, our definitions

373
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,910
just disappeared for pressure
and volume.

374
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:16,839
We cannot define those
macrostates in these

375
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,000
intermediate non-equilibrium
states.

376
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,560
Now, just as a little aside,
we could have defined the

377
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,800
microstates.

378
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,230
The microstates never change.

379
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,950
At any given snapshot in time,
I could have listed every

380
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,470
particle that's in this thing.

381
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,310
And I could have given you
its kinetic energy.

382
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,890
I could have given
you its position.

383
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,780
I could have given
you its momentum.

384
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,900
And there's no reason why I
couldn't have done that.

385
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,920
So I could have actually
made a plot of

386
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,270
one particular particle.

387
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,980
And I could have said what its
kinetic energy, and over a

388
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,170
course of time, is at any
given moment in time.

389
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,110
And this is really important.

390
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,690
So microstates are always
well defined.

391
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,330
The microstate is what's exactly
happening to the atom

392
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,970
in terms of its force and its
velocity and its momentum.

393
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,800
While macrostates are only
defined, I should say well

394
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,260
defined, when the system-- in
this case it's the balloon, in

395
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,060
this case it's this piston on
top of this cylinder, this

396
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,730
movable ceiling-- the
macrostates are only well

397
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,700
defined when the system is in
equilibrium, or when you can

398
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,390
essentially say, the pressure is
x, the pressure is the same

399
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,920
throughout.

400
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,950
Or the volume isn't changing
from moment to moment.

401
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,000
Or the temperature is the
same thing throughout.

402
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,870
Anyway, I'll leave you there and
we'll talk more about why

403
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,320
I went through all this pain
in the next video.
