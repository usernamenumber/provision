1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,260
Let's do another example where we're projecting something and it lands at a different level

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,740
Let's also figure out some other interesting things. We'll figure out

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,670
what the actual velocity vector is when it's landing

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,300
So both its magnitude and direction

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,910
Let's say we're launching something from ground level

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,830
and we're going to launch it at a pretty step angle over here

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:39,920
Let's say we launch it with an angle of 80 degrees

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,860
and it is going to be going at 30 meters per second

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,050
So that's the length of the vector; that's the magnitude of that vector

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,640
And let's say we want to make it land on this landing

11
00:00:50,650 --> 00:01:03,110
And this landing over here has a height of 10 meters

12
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:13,250
So what I want to do first of all is figure out how far along the landing do I actually land?

13
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,330
And maybe I'll add some other information right here

14
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,170
From the launching point to the beginning of the landing--

15
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,260
let's say this right over here is 2 meters

16
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,910
So we just want to know how far along the landing do we land

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,420
So like we did before, we want to break this vector into its horizontal and vertical components

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,210
I'm gonna go a little bit faster in this video

19
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,240
hopefully we're getting hold of this type of thing

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:46,020
So the vertical component of our velocity

21
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,900
is going to be equal to the magnitude of our total velocity 30 m/s

22
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,610
And the horizontal component of our velocity is going to be

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,250
Again cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse

24
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,780
I'm gonna skipping steps. In the last two videos I go into this in a much more detail

25
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,050
So how much time do we spend in the air?

26
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:37,940
So once again, in the last few videos, we saw that we can look at our displacement

27
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,330
If we want to figure out time in the air, we know that displacement is equal to

28
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,140
the initial velocity times time--

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:55,500
let me write change in time, that's technically more correct

30
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:03,070
plus acceleration times change in time squared over two

31
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,440
Now in our situation, we know what our initial velocity is

32
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,690
We're talking about the vertical direction right over here

33
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,820
So our initial velocity is going to be this

34
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,630
We're trying to figure out how much time in the air

35
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,710
and then the vertical component determines that

36
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,390
because at some point when it hits back to the ground

37
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,720
it's not going to be traveling anymore, so that's what determines this time in the air

38
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,360
So we know the acceleration. Remember the convention when we're dealing with the

39
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,350
vertical dimension is, up is positive, down is negative

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,530
So this is -9.8 m/s squared

41
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,430
And then what is the total displacement that we're gonna have?

42
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,430
Well, we're starting at ground level

43
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,500
And we're just talking about the vertical, remember that

44
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,960
So our total displacement is going to be 10 m

45
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,330
So this value right here is going to be 10 m

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,560
Times our change in time

47
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:31,120
So this is -9.8 divided by 2, so it's -4.9 m/s squared, times delta t squared

48
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,920
And then we can subtract 10 from both sides and write this into a

49
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,660
traditional quadratic equation form

50
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:55,030
So we get -4.9 times delta t squared + 29.54 times delta t -10 is equal to zero

51
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,980
And then we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of this

52
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,210
So the delta t's that satisfy this quadratic equation are going to be negative B

53
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,780
So -29.54

54
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,030
of 29.54 squared, B squared

55
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:25,960
-4 times A which is -4.9, the negative times and negative is positive, so it's +4 times +4.9

56
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,000
times--I shouldn't have jumped so fast to get rid of the negatives

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So it's gonna be -4 times A which is -4.9, times C which is -10

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,550
So just A times C, -4.9 times -10

59
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,900
These two guys, their signs are gonna cancel out

60
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:58,190
All of that over 2A, over -4.9 times 2, so -9.8

61
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,600
And like we saw in the last video, we want a positive value for this

62
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,790
and negative time is nonsensical. That's kind of going into the past

63
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,020
So we want a positive value

64
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,340
And since we have a negative in the denominator, we want have a negative value up here

65
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,900
And if we already have a negative value here and if we subtract from that negative value

66
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,700
we'll definitely have a negative value here

67
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,470
Then you divide by a negative value. You'll get a positive value

68
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,250
So we can really focus on the subtracting the radical

69
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,890
You can try it out. If you try the positive version

70
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,450
you'll get a negative value for this entire thing

71
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,600
You can try that out after this video

72
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,690
just to verify that that will get a nonsensical answer

73
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,180
So let's use the negative right over here. So we have

74
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:45,200
-29.54 - square root of

75
00:06:45,220 --> 00:07:00,620
29.54 squared -4 times (-4.9)ĄÁ(-10) which is 49, times 49

76
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:09,360
Actually I should add some parentheses. Okay

77
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,910
Times 49. So this right over here would give me the numerator if I evaluate this

78
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:22,110
We've got a negative value, and I divide that by -9.8

79
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:31,350
Gives me 5.67 second

80
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,790
And you can keep the units in there and make sure the dimensional analysis works

81
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,550
You'll find that it does

82
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:47,420
So our total time in the air is 5.67 seconds

83
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,790
Now what I want to do, the whole point of this, is to figure out

84
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,200
how far along the this landing we land

85
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,890
Well, the horizontal component of our velocity is right over here

86
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,870
We know that our displacement in the horizontal direction

87
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,460
will be our velocity in the horizontal direction--

88
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,170
it's a constant velocity

89
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,050
So it's the same thing as our average velocity in the horizontal direction

90
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:20,100
Times the change in time

91
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,250
I won't write the unit. This is m/s times s and it'll give us the answer in m

92
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,200
Gives us 29.53 m

93
00:08:52,650 --> 00:09:04,580
So our total horizontal traveling displacement is 29.53 m

94
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:11,270
It's a vector. That is our horizontal displacement, which is 29.53 m

95
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,040
Now we've done a lot of deconstructing vectors

96
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,840
What I'm interesting in this video is to construct a vector

97
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,870
So we know our horizontal displacement; we also know our vertical displacement

98
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,910
It's positive 10 m

99
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,700
So what's our total displacement?

100
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,160
Let me write this down

101
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:34,860
So we have a horizontal displacement of 29.53 m

102
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:42,330
and we have a vertical displacement of +10 m

103
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,420
So what is our total displacement?

104
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,070
We can use the Pythagorean theorem here

105
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,740
The square of the magnitude of our total displacement is

106
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,130
going to be equal to the sum of these two squares

107
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,160
This is just the Pythagorean theorem

108
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:06,440
So let me write it over here. So this is the magnitude of our displacement right over here

109
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:26,060
The magnitude of our total displacement squared is going to be equal to 10^2 +29.53^2

110
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,100
To solve for this, we just take the square root of both sides

111
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,560
If we just take the square root of both sides

112
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,990
we will get the magnitude of our total displacement--

113
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,390
let's get the calculator out to do that

114
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,730
So the magnitude of our total displacement is

115
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,370
the square root of 10^2 is just 100 + 29--

116
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,830
I can use all this information

117
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:58,590
I'll use the Ans, which literally means the previous answer which is 29.53

118
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,410
squared

119
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:09,360
Gives us a total displacement of 31.18 m

120
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,660
Of course it's a vector. This is only the magnitude. We also need the direction

121
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,640
So one way to specify direction is to give you the angle with the horizontal

122
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,120
And let's call that angle theta

123
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:27,410
And once again we can use our trig functions over here

124
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,190
We can use pretty much any of the trig functions

125
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:37,230
But we know the opposite side is 10; we know the hypotenuse here is 31.18

126
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,320
So why not use sine? Sine is opposite over hypotenuse

127
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:51,780
So we know the sin of theta is going to be equal to 10/31.18

128
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,200
Or if you want solve for theta

129
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,790
you take the arcsine or the inverse sine of both sides

130
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:12,900
Theta is equal to the inverse sine, or arcsin of 10 / 31.18

131
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,390
Once again get the calculator out to figure out that value

132
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,340
I'll take the inverse sine--this is the same thing as arcsin

133
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,080
This says, give me the angle. When I take its sine, I get this value

134
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:33,850
So the inverse sine of 10 divided by our previous answer 31.18

135
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,810
is equal to--

136
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,460
This says, give me the angle whose sine is 10/31.18

137
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,750
Here we've constructed a vector. We took its vertical component and its horizontal component

138
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,790
and we're able to figure out the total vectors

139
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,670
This projectile in this situation, its total placement--just to make it clear

140
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:15,510
Its path will look something like this

141
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,150
And we've just calculated its total displacement

142
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,660
And I realize that when I started this problem, I asked you

143
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,750
I think I was asking, how far along the platform

144
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,980
We figured out its total horizontal displacement

145
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,740
So if you want to know how far along the platform, the platform starts 2 m to the right

146
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:44,520
so it's really 27.53 m along the platform is where it lands
