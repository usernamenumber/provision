1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:02,933
when we learned about social security

2
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:07,200
we saw that people who are currently working are paying their faco taxes

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,667
those...essentially those revenues are being used directly

4
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,667
to provide the social security benefits for

5
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,933
existing retirees and other beneficiaries

6
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,800
and any surplus courses Social security trust

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,067
and when you have this baby boomer generation

8
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,800
on the left hand side of this...

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,000
of the system right here so the baby boomer generation is this

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,867
huge population boom that happened after world war 2

11
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:32,000
after...after you know the country was happy

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,267
and all the soldiers had come back, they produced a lot of babies

13
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:39,000
and it was ...this population boom when the population boom

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,800
was on the left hand side of this system

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,133
they were able to generate a lot of revenue

16
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,600
to supply for the benefit for essentially

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,800
their parents' generation and so that did help build the surplus

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,600
the problem is that they didn't produce

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,933
uh...the population did not grow as much

20
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:57,133
as next generation and you can do that as a problem or a good thing

21
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:59,333
but it's a problem in the context of social security

22
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,667
because starting recently in over the next 2 decades

23
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:06,923
this baby boom generation is going to move on to the right

24
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:09,400
hand side of this equation

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,600
and we saw that they will start to

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,333
drawdown even this surplus fairly soon and that

27
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:20,467
because of this demographic change the social security surplus

28
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:24,667
will be completely depleted between 2030 and 2040

29
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,867
medicare is very similar

30
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:30,067
you have some portion of the faco taxes is for medicare

31
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:34,800
and that revenue is used to paid for the health benefits of the retirees

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,600
any surplus goes into a medicare trust and

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,867
that medicare trust of the formal name is the hospital insurance trust fund

34
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:45,800
the problem with medicare is that the situation is even worse

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,733
the medicare trust the medicare or i guess you could

36
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,467
see the medicare system is already running at a deficit meaning

37
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:55,067
they're spending more money on the right

38
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:57,867
they're spending more money on the right and they're getting it on the left

39
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:01,200
so there are already starting to drawdown

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,067
already starting to draw down their trust

41
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:08,467
so social security at least the trust is continuing to grow to 2023

42
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,200
and that's our best estimate right now

43
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,867
that it'll start drawing down and we get the puted between 2030 and 2040

44
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:16,267
in medicare

45
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:18,067
situations is a lot worse

46
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:22,467
so in medicare we are already starting to draw down the trust we are already

47
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,867
spending more beneficiaries and we're taking down

48
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:27,092
it that we were taking in fico revenues

49
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:30,385
and the entire trust based on uh...

50
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:33,733
our current assumptions will probably be depleted

51
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,933
in the next ten years

52
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:38,667
depleted

53
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,867
in next

54
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:42,333
ten years

55
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,800
and what makes medicare especially troubling despite the fact

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,067
it is a kind of a worst financial position

57
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,800
is that these costs are growing even faster

58
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,667
and i want to be clear a lot of people think that

59
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:55,667
the so for social security the main problem with this system over here

60
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,200
is a demographic changes you have this huge population

61
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,933
that's retiring the baby boomers

62
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:02,267
which makes this not sustainable

63
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:05,267
but with medicare that's also going on but what makes medicare even

64
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:08,333
uh...a bigger problems until security is above and beyond

65
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,467
those demographic changes above and beyond these

66
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:12,867
this baby boomer generation retiring

67
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:15,933
instead of paying into medicare takings benefits from medicare

68
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:18,133
the big problem is that you actually have medical

69
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:20,400
health care costs going up

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,467
well above the cost inflation personal security

71
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,200
these people's benefits to just go up with

72
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,000
inflation for medicare the benefits go up with

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,800
the cost of medical care and that's going well above

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,733
the cost of inflation and so you have the situation

75
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:39,200
where based on current benefits and our best assumptions

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,133
about the economy in the faco taxes coming in

77
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:43,867
you kind of have a reality where

78
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,467
if you have to give the cart benefits

79
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,533
and if you expect medical costs health care cost to

80
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,667
continue to increase at the rate they're doing

81
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,133
and there's no sign frankly that it is stopping

82
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,800
then you have this reality medicare

83
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,210
left on checked could at a rate right now

84
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,036
it's roughly about 23 percent of our budget 23,24 percent of our budget

85
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:05,005
Three twenty four percent of our budget,or about four percent of our GDP.

86
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:06,929
so here we are

87
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:09,885
twenty eleven it’s about four percent of our GDP,

88
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:12,398
we are spending on medicare and medicaid

89
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:15,156
and medicaid is essentially health benefits for mainly the poor

90
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:16,456
it’s run by the states but it’s gets federal funding

91
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:19,941
so right now that’s four perent of GDP,

92
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:24,318
but because of the cost growth in at health care costs,

93
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,752
if we need a completely inch unchecked over the next fifty sixty years.

94
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:32,771
it could go to fifteen sixteen seventeen percent of GDP in just to be clear.

95
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:34,890
that’s the ,that’s the percentage of GDP.

96
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,731
that’s roughly our entire federal budget.

97
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:40,731
So this has a potential if we do not grow our bugdet

98
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:45,915
any to actually crowd out a lot of other things and just understand this graph a little bit.

99
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:47,992
They show they said they show the part of that part of the cost of medicare

100
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:51,700
the part of the growth to do two defferent things

101
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,677
This is the effect of aging population.

102
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:56,105
This is the affect of access cost growth

103
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:59,095
and and this is the interaction of the two

104
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:00,795
and understand why that make sense,

105
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:07,408
you just have to think about the total costs being the product of the number

106
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:10,075
and maybe to see the net number of recipient for some people are paying as well.

107
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,500
But this will hopefully hope you understand what I’m talking about number of recipients,

108
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:17,038
number of recipients times.

109
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:23,715
Times the cost per recepient,solicited this is ht cost per recipient

110
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:28,044
cost per recipient.Cost per recipient

111
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,048
so if you take the numbers have been some times the cost per recipient

112
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:32,748
you are gonna get the total cost.

113
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:35,131
Let’s say that the total cost today.

114
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:39,290
So that’s that would be the area of that square just multipllying the base times high.

115
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,359
So card costs,

116
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:44,002
card cost and anunal cost,card costs.

117
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,105
Now because of demographic changes

118
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:50,413
you are going to have some increase in the net number of recipients.

119
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:53,064
so you were to have some increase there

120
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:55,321
but because of medical costs growth

121
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:58,613
you are going to have old big increase in the cost per recipient.

122
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:01,823
So this thing is going to increase much more

123
00:06:01,823 --> 00:06:04,433
and so if you go to some future point when you can pice your future point.

124
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:05,171
But future point

125
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:07,771
i am really just try to make you understand why we have three categoriest.

126
00:06:07,771 --> 00:06:09,438
the total cost is going not be that total cost for the total cost

127
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:12,308
is going to be that total cost for sippin that has grown dramatically

128
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,238
times the total number of recipients number of sippin

129
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:16,215
and so now you are talking about this area. this area.

130
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:19,767
this area is going to be the total cost

131
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,300
and if you think about how much of the stole

132
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,077
causes do purely to the increased cost growth

133
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:28,536
well it would be this part right over here.

134
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:31,636
would be this part over here

135
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:33,321
this part would be the amount the cost the increase in the area ture

136
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:35,129
ture purely due to the increased cost growth.

137
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,398
So that would be this part of the graph right over here.

138
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,095
What part of this increased area is due purely to the increased number of recipients.

139
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:46,721
Well,that would be best part of the graph right over here.

140
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:48,998
Purely due to the increased numbers recipients and that is right of your affect of aging population

141
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:52,685
And then, you have some part of this error

142
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:57,369
that’s created by both of you not increasing the number severty

143
00:06:57,523 --> 00:06:59,648
and the increase in costs and thats going to be

144
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:03,438
That’s going to be this area right over here.

145
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:06,141
Which is this part of the graph.

146
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:08,695
So when people talk about the unsustainable.

147
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,479
Well one we have an unsustainable that to begin with

148
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,269
the second thing.The second thing is that the liabilities the obligations

149
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:16,125
that we have aren’t even on

150
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,010
these are not even counted in the govemment deficit

151
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,602
and these are the things that are really really scary.

152
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:23,033
Because something has to give

153
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:26,152
Some thing all of these that the single factor this t

154
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:29,869
this kind of driving most of the scariness is medicare in particular.

155
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,231
And not just medicare

156
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:34,510
but it’s not just the demographic change but specific to medical.

157
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,085
It’s the increased costs of healthccare

158
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:39,392
So if somehow that not can be cracked

159
