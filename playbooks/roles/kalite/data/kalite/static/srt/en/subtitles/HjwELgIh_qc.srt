1
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:08,852
We're in the church of Sant' Apollinare in Classe, just outside of Ravenna.

2
00:00:08,852 --> 00:00:13,083
This was once the port for the Roman empire in the early 1st century.

3
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:17,920
Right, there had once been a large lagoon in-between the two towns, that's long gone.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,630
This was actually the site of an ancient Roman cemetery,

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,726
and there is every possibility that the first bishop of Ravenna, St. Apolenaris,

6
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,062
was actually buried here on this site.

7
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:31,807
And we see St. Apolenaris right here in the centre of the apse.

8
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:35,228
But before we get to that, let's talk about the church for a second.

9
00:00:35,228 --> 00:00:41,783
We're in a basilica, and, like so many churches in Ravenna, it's been through many phases.

10
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:47,684
And just like Sant' Apollinare Nuovo there would have been mosaics all along the nave, but those are gone.

11
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:52,817
What we do have is an extraordinary apse mosaic.
It's huge.

12
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:56,359
Let's start with the archway around the apse.

13
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,560
That's known as the triumphal arch.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,568
And on the top centre we see a bearded image of God holding a book,

15
00:01:03,568 --> 00:01:07,609
and on either side of him the symbols of the four evangelists.

16
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:12,942
Right, Jonas is an eagle, Matthew's the man, Mark is the lion, and Luke is the ox.

17
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:17,244
And they're in a sky filled with blue and red clouds.

18
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:22,959
Below them we see on the left the city of Jerusalem, on the right Bethlehem,

19
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:30,293
and from those two very symbolically represented cities we see lambs emerging.

20
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:33,964
Walking up a mountain, up towards the clouds, up towards heaven.

21
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:41,064
So clearly, purely symbolic representation, and that continues in the apse mosaic itself.

22
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:43,969
Largest and most central is a gold cross.

23
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:48,445
In the centre of the cross you can see a small bust of Jesus Christ.

24
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:52,480
Surrounding it is a blue field with 99 gold stars.

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,189
On either edge of the short arm of the cross we see the Greek letters Alpha and Omega,

26
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:02,983
the idea that Christ is the beginning and the end, that Christ is all things.

27
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:08,330
So what we have symbolically represented here is the story we call the transfiguration,

28
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:15,671
the moment when Christ revealed his divine nature to three of his apostles, Peter, James, and John,

29
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:24,013
and they're shown here as sheep in a field, Christ is symbolically represented as the cross.

30
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:32,321
On either side we do see two human figures, half-length representations, one is Moses, and one is Elijah.

31
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:38,399
And then the story of the transfiguration when Christ revealed his divine nature and was filled with white light,

32
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:42,767
Moses and Elijah appeared with him, and God, the Father, spoke,

33
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:48,905
and said "This is my son, whom I love, with whom I am well pleased, listen to him."

34
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:57,046
And so this is the moment of divine revelation, this appearance of Christ, the man, as God.

35
00:02:57,046 --> 00:03:04,187
It's so easy to imagine a 6th century worshiper sitting here, understanding that this is a sort of an

36
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:10,093
extraordinary opportunity to have these sacred truths revealed to them as they sit before it.

37
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:19,310
The figures of Moses and Elijah in a golden sky, in the realm of the eternal, below St. Apollinare in a more earthy realm,

38
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,483
but one represented very schematically and decoratively.

39
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:27,211
And of course the sheep are wonderful, especially down at the bottom.

40
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:30,413
There are 12 of them, and it's clearly a reference to the apostles.

41
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:35,651
And St. Apollinare himself stands frontal, we can see his name written on either side of him,

42
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:38,320
just in case we were going to forget, or be confused.

43
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,686
That's right, we can't do that.

44
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:45,134
And he's got its arms raised in prayer, which is actually a position we often see in Early Christian imagery.

45
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:51,978
So in these churches in Ravenna, we see here an apse, in another church the apse might be missing,

46
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:57,558
but we have the mosaics on the walls of the nave, and we can begin to fit together

47
00:03:57,558 --> 00:04:01,558
what these churches would have looked like when they were new in the 5th and 6th century.
