1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,920
In the last video we figured
out the mean, variance and

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,340
standard deviation for our
Bernoulli Distribution with

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,340
specific numbers.

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,120
What I want to do in this video
is to generalize it.

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,080
To figure out really the
formulas for the mean and the

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,180
variance of a Bernoulli
Distribution if we don't have

8
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,120
the actual numbers.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,790
If we just know that the
probability of success is p

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,950
and the probability a failure
is 1 minus p.

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:31,700
So let's look at this, let's
look at a population where the

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,660
probability of success-- we'll
define success as 1-- as

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,450
having a probability of p, and
the probability of failure,

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,720
the probability of failure
is 1 minus p.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,420
Whatever this might be.

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,690
And obviously, if you add these
two up, if you view them

17
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,170
as percentages, these are
going to add up to 100%.

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,850
Or if you add up these
two values, they are

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,980
going to add to 1.

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,230
And that needs to be the case
because these are the only two

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,800
possibilities that can occur.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,150
If this is 60% chance of success
there has to be a 40%

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,890
chance of failure.

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,940
70% chance of success, 30%
chance of failure.

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,030
Now with this definition of
this-- and this is the most

26
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,180
general definition of a
Bernoulli Distribution.

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,890
   

28
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,980
It's really exactly what we did
in the last video, I now

29
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,490
want to calculate the expected
value, which is the same thing

30
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,180
as the mean of this
distribution, and I also want

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,780
to calculate the variance, which
is the same thing as the

32
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,420
expected squared distance of
a value from the mean.

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,940
So let's do that.

34
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,970
So what is the mean over here?

35
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,310
What is going to be the mean?

36
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,840
Well that's just the probability
weighted sum of

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,610
the values that this
could take on.

38
00:01:52,610 --> 00:02:01,010
So there is a 1 minus p
probability that we get

39
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,670
failure, that we get 0.

40
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,570
So there's 1 minus
p probability of

41
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,320
getting 0, so times 0.

42
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,680
And then there is a p
probability of getting 1,

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,500
plus p times 1.

44
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,820
Well this is pretty
easy to calculate.

45
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,310
0 times anything is 0.

46
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,840
So that cancels out.

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,645
And then p times 1 is
just going to be p.

48
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:32,190
   

49
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,280
So pretty straightforward.

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,120
The mean, the expected value
of this distribution, is p.

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,480
And p might be here
or something.

52
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,480
So once again it's a value that
you cannot actually take

53
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,950
on in this distribution,
which is interesting.

54
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,380
But it is the expected value.

55
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,030
Now what is going to
be the variance?

56
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,680
What is the variance of
this distribution?

57
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,890
Remember, that is the weighted
sum of the squared distances

58
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,400
from the mean.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,200
Now what's the probability
that we get a 0?

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,120
We already figured that out.

61
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,040
There's a 1 minus p probability
that we get a 0.

62
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,680
So that is the probability
part.

63
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,860
And what is the squared distance
from 0 to our mean?

64
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,815
Well the squared distance from
0 to our mean-- let me write

65
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:19,350
it over here-- it's going to be
0, that's the value we're

66
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,470
taking on-- let me do that in
blue since I already wrote the

67
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:29,050
0-- 0 minus our mean-- let
me do this in a new

68
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,060
color-- minus our mean.

69
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,370
That's too similar
to that orange.

70
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,070
Let me do the mean in white.

71
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:42,090
0 minus our mean, which is p
plus the probability that we

72
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:49,000
get a 1, which is just p-- this
is the squared distance,

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,970
let me be very careful.

74
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,030
It's the probability weighted
sum of the squared distances

75
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,210
from the mean.

76
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,470
Now what's the distance-- now
we've got a 1-- and what's the

77
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,460
difference between
1 and the mean?

78
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:04,630
It's 1 minus our mean, which
is going to be p over here.

79
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,630
And we're going to want to
square this as well.

80
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,350
This right here is going
to be the variance.

81
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,640
Now let's actually
work this out.

82
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,100
So this is going to be
equal to 1 minus p.

83
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,110
Now 0 minus p is going
to be negative p.

84
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,360
If you square it you're just
going to get p squared.

85
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,340
So it's going to be p squared.

86
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:31,390
Then plus p times-- what's
1 minus p squared?

87
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:38,570
1 minus p squared is going to be
1 squared, which is just 1,

88
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,020
minus 2 times the
product of this.

89
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,710
So this is going to be minus
2p right over here.

90
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,830
And then plus negative
p squared.

91
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,070
So plus p squared
just like that.

92
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,650
And now let's multiply
everything out.

93
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,950
This is going to be, this term
right over here is going to be

94
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,070
p squared minus p
to the third.

95
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,300
And then this term over here,
this whole thing over here, is

96
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,420
going to be plus
p times 1 is p.

97
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,840
p times negative 2p is
negative 2p squared.

98
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,460
And then p times p squared
is p to the third.

99
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,710
Now we can simplify these.

100
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,290
p to the third cancels out
with p to the third.

101
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,740
And then we have p squared
minus 2p squared.

102
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,900
So this right here becomes,
you have this p right over

103
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,100
here, so this is equal to p.

104
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,800
And then when you add p squared
to negative 2p squared

105
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,820
you're left with negative p
squared minus p squared.

106
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,910
And if you want to factor a p
out of this, this is going to

107
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,590
be equal to p times, if you take
p divided p you get a 1,

108
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,380
p square divided by p is p.

109
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,480
So p times 1 minus p, which is
a pretty neat, clean formula.

110
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,250
So our variance is p
times 1 minus p.

111
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,060
And if we want to take it to the
next level and figure out

112
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,080
the standard deviation, the
standard deviation is just the

113
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,270
square root of the variance,
which is equal to the square

114
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,890
root of p times 1 minus p.

115
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,560
And we could even verify that
this actually works for the

116
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,500
example that we did up here.

117
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,880
Our mean is p, the probability
of success.

118
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,280
We see that indeed it
was, it was 0.6.

119
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,280
And we know that our variance is
essentially the probability

120
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,140
of success times the probability
of failure.

121
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,620
That's our variance
right over there.

122
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,290
The probability of success
in this example was 0.6,

123
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,070
probability of failure
was 0.4.

124
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,290
You multiply the two, you get
0.24, which is exactly what we

125
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,540
got in the last example.

126
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,440
And if you take its square
root for the standard

127
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,810
deviation, which is what we
do right here, it's 0.49.

128
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,230
So hopefully you found that
helpful, and we're going to

129
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,210
build on this later on in some
of our inferential statistics.

130
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:58,399
