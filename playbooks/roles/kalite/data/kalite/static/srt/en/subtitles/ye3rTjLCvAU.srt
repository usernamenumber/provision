1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
   

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,110
Two corrections I want to make
to the video on the sodium

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,770
potassium pump.

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,420
One very minor one-- and I don't
think it would trip too

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,000
many of you guys up, but near
the end of the video, as we

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,050
learned, we have potassium
getting pumped into the cell

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,740
by the sodium potassium pump.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,640
Let me draw the membrane.

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,270
It'll actually be useful
in the more significant

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,410
correction I'd like to make.

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,870
So let me draw a cross section
of a cell membrane.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,790
And let me draw the sodium
potassium pump right here.

13
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,580
   

14
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,750
We saw it pumps out three
sodiums for every two

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,185
potassiums that it pumps in.

16
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:41,853
It definitely doesn't
look like that, but

17
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:42,880
it gives the idea.

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:50,690
And we're pumping potassium
ions in-- so K plus-- and

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,730
we're pumping sodium ions out--
and that's what the

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,460
whole point of that video was.

21
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,000
When this thing changes shape
with ATP, it pumps

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,790
the sodium ions out.

23
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,870
Now the minor correction I want
to make-- and I don't

24
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,290
think it would have tripped you
up too much-- is near the

25
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,790
end of that video, I drew the
potassium ions-- and I wrote a

26
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,420
K plus, but a few times near
the end of the video, I

27
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,300
referred to them as sodium
ions-- and I don't want that

28
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,780
to confuse you at all.

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,750
It is potassium ions that
are getting pumped in.

30
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,040
Two potassium ions get pumped in
for every three sodium ions

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,710
that get pumped out.

32
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,860
So I don't want-- even thought
I drew a K plus, sometimes I

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,330
said sodium by accident.

34
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,930
Don't want that to
confuse you.

35
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,710
That is the minor error.

36
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,120
The more significant error is
that I said that the main

37
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,540
reason that we had this
potential difference-- why it

38
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:49,050
is more positive on the outside
than the inside-- so

39
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,260
this is less positive.

40
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,060
I said that the main reason
was because of this ratio.

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,320
We're pumping out three sodium
ions for every two potassium

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,740
ions that we pump in.

43
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,700
And I just got a very nice
letter from a professor of

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,020
physiology, Steven Baylor at
University of Pennsylvania,

45
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,120
and he wrote a very interesting
email and it

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,940
corrects me.

47
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,750
And it's a very interesting
thing to

48
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,830
think about in general.

49
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,210
So here's what he wrote
and let's think

50
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,410
about what he's saying.

51
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,310
He says: Here at Penn Medical
School, we have a nice

52
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,480
teaching program that stimulates
the ion fluxes

53
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,630
across a generic cell, --So
the ion flux is just the

54
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,660
movement of the ions across the
membrane-- including that

55
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,340
due to the sodium potassium
pump and that which arises

56
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,100
from the resting

57
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,600
permeabilities of the membrane.

58
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,550
So the resting permeabilities
is how easy it is for these

59
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,850
ions to go through
the membrane.

60
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,270
And we'll talk more about
that in a second.

61
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,140
And the resting permeabilities
of the membrane to sodium,

62
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,050
potassium, chloride,
et cetera.

63
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,130
One option our program gives
students is to change the pump

64
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,760
stoichiometry from
three to two.

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,160
So when he's talking about pump
stoichiometry from three

66
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,200
to two, he's just talking
about they're

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,340
changing the ratios.

68
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,400
So they change it
from 3:2 to 2:2.

69
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,850
So what that means is, they have
a simulation program that

70
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,520
says, well, what if the sodium
potassium pump, instead of

71
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,030
pumping three sodiums out for
every two potassium it pumps

72
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,420
in, what if it was even?

73
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,820
What if it was two sodiums
and two potassiums?

74
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,310
And based on my explanation of
why we have this potential

75
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,910
difference, that should not lead
to a potential difference

76
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,880
if the main reason was the
stoichiometry-- the ratio of

77
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,870
sodium being pumped to the
potassium being pumped in.

78
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,630
But he goes on to say: They
could change it to 2:2 in the

79
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,690
simulation.

80
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,500
As a result of this maneuver,
the membrane potential changes

81
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,070
from its normal value of about
-80 millivolts-- and they

82
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,030
measure that.

83
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,750
They take the voltage here minus
the voltage there so

84
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,790
that you get a negative
number.

85
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,950
This is more positive.

86
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,240
It's a larger number.

87
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,300
So it changes from -80
millivolts to about -78

88
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,850
millivolts.

89
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,510
So what he's saying is, if you
change this from three and

90
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,962
two-- three sodiums for every
two potassiums that get pumped

91
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:10,620
in-- if you change that to
2:2, it actually doesn't

92
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,790
change the potential
that much.

93
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,310
You still have a more positive
environment outside than you

94
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,630
have inside.

95
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,459
So that leads to the question--
then why do we have

96
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,030
the potential if the
stoichiometry of this ratio is

97
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,870
not the main cause?

98
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,610
So it says, it changes
a little bit.

99
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,980
The potential difference becomes
a little bit less.

100
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,320
The cell swells a few percentage
and then everything

101
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,340
stabilizes.

102
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,750
So then he goes on to write: So
while it is true that the

103
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,290
normal stoichiometry of the
pump does have a slight

104
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,010
negative influence on the
membrane potential-- that's

105
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,100
just the membrane potential,
the voltage across the

106
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,750
membrane-- the imbalance in the
pump stoichiometry is not

107
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,590
the main reason for the large
negative membrane

108
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,180
potential of the cell.

109
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,120
Rather, the main-- let me
underline this-- the main

110
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,790
reason is the concentration
gradients established by the

111
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:12,350
pump in combination with the
fact that the resting cell

112
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,360
membrane is highly permeable to
potassium and only slightly

113
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,610
permeable to sodium.

114
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,380
So we said in the last video--
or the first video on the

115
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,650
sodium potassium pump-- we said
there were channels that

116
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,420
the sodium could go through and
there's also channels that

117
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,780
the potassium could
go through.

118
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,030
   

119
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,490
And now what he's saying is
that the main cause of the

120
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,900
potential difference isn't this
ratio, it's the fact that

121
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,560
the membrane is highly permeable
to potassium.

122
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,580
So this is very permeable.

123
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,640
Potassium can get out if it
wants to, much easier than it

124
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,160
is for sodium to get in.

125
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,760
So what that happens-- even if
this was a 2:2 ratio-- it's

126
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,550
actually a 3:2, but even if
this was a 2:2 ratio, even

127
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,040
though this environment is more
positive, you're just

128
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,460
more likely to have to potassium
ions down here bump

129
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,200
in just the right way to get
across and get to the other

130
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,940
side, go against its chemical
gradient, right, because you

131
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,130
have a higher concentration of
potassium here than over here.

132
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,420
So you're more likely to have
a potassium bump in just the

133
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,980
right way to get through this
channel and get out-- than you

134
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,420
are to have a sodium be able to
go the opposite direction.

135
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,500
And that's what makes
this environment.

136
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,700
So you have more potassium
coming outside because of this

137
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,590
permeability than sodium coming
inside-- and that's the

138
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,380
main cause of the potential
difference between the outside

139
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,700
and the inside.

140
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,930
And so thank you, Steven Baylor,
for that correction.

141
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,410
Very interesting.
