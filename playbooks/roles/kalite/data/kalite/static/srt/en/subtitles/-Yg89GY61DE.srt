1
00:00:09,494 --> 00:00:13,044
Your genes come from your parents, of course.

2
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:16,396
And from their parents. And from their parents' parents.

3
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:20,332
And well... you get the idea.

4
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:23,511
You have two sets of 23 chromosomes.

5
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:26,886
One set from each parent.

6
00:00:29,794 --> 00:00:33,247
For almost every chromosome you inherit from your mohter,

7
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:36,031
You also inherit one from your father.

8
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:41,660
That has his versions of the same genes.

9
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:48,361
Together they form a pair of homologous chromosomes.

10
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:59,724
The X and Y chromosomes however, are special.

11
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:08,328
Usually, females have two X chromosomes, while males have and X and a Y.

12
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:13,443
You get one of your X chromosomes from your mother.

13
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:17,974
Whether you get your father's X chromosome or his Y chromosome,

14
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:21,789
determines your sex.

15
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:30,215
Most adult cells contain two sets of chromosomes,

16
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:40,464
but sperm and egg cells have only one set of 23 chromosomes each.

17
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:48,318
When the body forms sperm or egg cells, a cell divides and pairs of chromosomes separate.

18
00:01:51,179 --> 00:02:01,347
A random member or each pair moves into each new cell.

19
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:04,580
This is why when you were concieved,

20
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,863
you obtained half of you mother's genes

21
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:11,364
and half of your father's genes

22
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:17,380
but your siblibngs didn't necessarity get the same versions of your parents' genes

23
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,898
that you did,

24
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:28,897
unless you happen to be and identical twin.

25
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:33,647
To form sperm or egg cells, your chromosomes double

26
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:35,987
like so.

27
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:41,052
When the homologuos pairs seperate, sometimes they cross over

28
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:46,701
and at seemingly random points, exchange DNA.

29
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:55,334
This is called genetic recombination.

30
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:59,385
Because your genes get shuffled during recombination,

31
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:03,085
the chromosomes you pass along to your children

32
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:08,685
are not exactly the same as the ones you inherited from your parents.

33
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:11,514
This makes it hard to use most of your chromosomes

34
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:16,047
to trace your geneology back very far.

35
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:20,914
However, most of the Y chromosome is handed down

36
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:25,347
from father to son entirely intact.

37
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:29,352
Likewise, in humans, DNA in the mitochondria

38
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:33,964
is passed on only from mother to child.

39
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,047
For this reason ancestry along your father's line,

40
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:43,148
or your mother's line is easier to trace using the Y chromosome

41
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:48,648
or mitochondrial DNA.

42
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:52,751
When sperm and egg cells join together at fertilization,

43
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:57,351
they create a single cell with two complete sets

44
00:03:57,351 --> 00:04:01,351
of 23 chromosomes, one set from your mother

45
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:05,236
and one from your father.

46
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:12,098
This single cell will divide to create new cells

47
00:04:12,098 --> 99:59:59,999
over and over until it creates a child.
