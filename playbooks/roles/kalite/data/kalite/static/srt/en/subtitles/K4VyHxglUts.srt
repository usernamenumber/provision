1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
   

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,280
We are on problem 63.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,140
The height of a triangle
is 4 inches greater

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,580
than twice its base.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,215
Let me this triangle
in question.

6
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:12,900
   

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,300
That's the triangle, that's its
height, that's its base.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,400
   

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,530
Let's say this is the base.

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,970
Let's call that b.

11
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,030
So then the height, that's that,
is 4 inches greater than

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,070
twice its base.

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,450
So 4 inches more than
2 times the base.

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,440
Fair enough.

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,980
The area of the triangle
is 168 square inches.

16
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,920
What is the base of
the triangle?

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,900
So what's the area
of a triangle?

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,640
It's the base times the
height times 1/2.

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,080
So area is equal to 1/2
base times height.

20
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,660
Well they told us that the
height is four more than twice

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,710
the base, so we can just
substitute that in.

22
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,385
And then we'll have a just
in terms of the base.

23
00:00:57,385 --> 00:00:58,510
Let me keep that there.

24
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,920
So the area is equal to 1/2
the base times the height,

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,210
which they told us is 4 more
than twice the base.

26
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,710
And now if we distribute
the 1/2 b.

27
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,240
1/2 b times 4 is equal to 2b.

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,500
And then 1/2 b times 2b,
that's plus b squared.

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,890
1/2 time 2 is 1 and then
b times b is b squared.

30
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,590
Fair enough.

31
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,780
And they tell us that
the area is 168.

32
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,160
OK, so we have area is 168, and
that's equal to 2 times

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,110
the base plus the
base sqaured.

34
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,110
Let's swap the sides just
to make it look

35
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:38,980
a little bit familiar.

36
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,220
B squared plus 2 times the
base is equal to 168.

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,650
We could subtract 168
from both sides.

38
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:54,850
You get b squared plus 2b
minus 168 is equal to 0.

39
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,730
And 168 is a bit of
a strange number.

40
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,060
I don't know exactly which
numbers go into 168.

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:07,770
Let's see, 4 isn't
going to work.

42
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,060
   

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,770
Does 12 go into it?

44
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,970
Yeah, 12 goes into 168,
and I think it

45
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,140
goes into it 14 times.

46
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,200
So that works.

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,820
So you could use the quadratic
equation to solve this.

48
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,490
But I think that 12
times 14 is 168.

49
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,190
And they have to be of different
signs, since this is

50
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,610
a negative.

51
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,290
Only different signs
when multiplied get

52
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,220
you a negative number.

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,790
And they're 2 apart.

54
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,510
So that works out.

55
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:42,840
So you get b plus 14 times
b minus 12 is equal to 0.

56
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,610
Let me just confirm and
not waste your time.

57
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,600
14 times 12, I'm pretty
sure I'm right.

58
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,570
Yeah, 168.

59
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,630
I just factored that out.

60
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,260
So b could be equal
to minus 14.

61
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,360
Right, that would make that 0.

62
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,470
Or b could be equal to 12,
which would make that 0.

63
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,390
Obviously if you can make one
of these terms 0, you're

64
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,190
making this whole thing 0.

65
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,200
And the base, since we're
dealing with distances or

66
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,960
lengths, we can't have
a negative length.

67
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,250
So the base has to
be 12 inches.

68
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,805
Which is choice C in
that question.

69
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:16,140
   

70
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,840
Next question.

71
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,550
Problem 64.

72
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,800
All right.

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,960
   

74
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,920
This is a good one.

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,620
What is that thing reduced
to lowest terms?

76
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,750
So essentially what they want
us to do is factor stuff out

77
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,390
and factor it out and write it
as a product of factors and

78
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,410
then cancel out the ones.

79
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,320
So let's see what we can do.

80
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,030
Can we factor that
top expression?

81
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,300
Let's see.

82
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,340
This is looks like a perfect
square, right?

83
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,430
Because if you have minus 2y
squared is 4y squared.

84
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,020
And minus 2y and minus
2y is minus 4y.

85
00:03:54,020 --> 00:04:01,150
So the top expression is
x minus 2y squared.

86
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,060
And I'll just write it twice.

87
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,360
Because I'm guessing that one
of them are going to have to

88
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,050
be factored out.

89
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,520
And once, the intuition is that
if I had this, x squared

90
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,380
minus 4x plus 4, you say OK,
what two numbers when you

91
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,204
multiply them equal four
and when you add

92
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:20,170
them equal minus 4?

93
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,250
You say, minus 2 and you'd so
that's equal to x minus

94
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,720
2 and x minus 2.

95
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,500
The only difference between
that and that is

96
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,560
they put y's here.

97
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,540
Y and a y squared.

98
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,690
OK, so you could visualize this
thing as x squared minus

99
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:45,810
4yx plus 4y squared.

100
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,000
Or you could visualize this as x
squared minus two times 2y x

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,630
plus 2y squared.

102
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,450
This isn't 4y squared.

103
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,410
This is 4 y squared.

104
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,600
Forget the parentheses.

105
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,540
But I hope you can see that this
thing up here is the same

106
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,940
thing is this thing
right here.

107
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,910
And that's where I got the
intuition that that's going to

108
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,900
be x minus 2y times
x minus 2y.

109
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,970
You say, OK what two numbers
when you add

110
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,740
them are 2 times 2y?

111
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,410
Well, obviously 2y.

112
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,130
And what numbers when you
squared them are 2y squared?

113
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,120
Well 2y times 2y
is 2y squared.

114
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,660
So that's where you get the
intuition that it's x minus 2y

115
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,490
times x minus 2y.

116
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,130
That's the numerator, let's see
what we can do with the

117
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,910
denominator.

118
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,230
Well immediately, both factors
are divisible by 3 and both

119
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,040
terms are divisible by y.

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,980
So let's factor those out.

121
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,781
So this is equal to 3y.

122
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:42,640
Now if you divide this term
by 3y, all you're

123
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,880
left with is an x.

124
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,780
3xy divided by 3y, you
just have an x.

125
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:53,120
And then if you divide minus
6y squared by 3y, minus six

126
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,470
divided by 3 is minus 2, y
squared divided by y is y.

127
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,180
Let's see, if we assume that x
does not equal 2y, because

128
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,940
then this would be undefined,
we can cancel these two out.

129
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:11,680
And you're just left with
x minus 2y over 3y.

130
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,020
And that is choice B.

131
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,710
Problem 65.

132
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,960
They want us to do it again.

133
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,910
   

134
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,290
OK, let's see.

135
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,550
   

136
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,110
So this top expression,
everything is divisible by 3,

137
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,070
so let's rewrite it.

138
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,950
Let's factor out a 3 there.

139
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,620
So it'd be 3 times to 2x
squared, plus 7x-- or 21

140
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,540
divided by 3-- Plus 3.

141
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,480
Let's see, what's
the bottom one?

142
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,520
Well this fits a pattern.

143
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,190
A squared minus b
squared, right?

144
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,130
This is something squared.

145
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,030
4x squared is 2x squared.

146
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,980
And then 1 is obviously
1 squared.

147
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,950
So we can write this as a
plus b times a minus b.

148
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:10,550
And that would be 2x plus
1, times 2x minus 1.

149
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,800
   

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
2x squared is 4x squared,
and 1 squared is 1.

151
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,960
So let's see, we factored
that top part.

152
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,860
And I'm guessing it's going to
cancel out with something in

153
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,450
the denominator.

154
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,890
So let's see what we can get.

155
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,251
Let me do it on the side here.

156
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:33,620
So if I have to factor 2x
squared plus 7x plus 3, it's

157
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:40,815
going to be 2x plus something
times x plus something.

158
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:43,460
   

159
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,610
Because 2x times the
x is 2x squared.

160
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,070
And the b times the a is
going to be equal to 3.

161
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,960
So I'm guessing one of them is
going to be a 3 and one of

162
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,200
them is going to be 1.

163
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,610
And I could already guess, if
we could do it a little bit

164
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,440
more systematically than
how it's going, so

165
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,210
let's multiply it out.

166
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,690
2x times x, 2x squared.

167
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,840
2x times a, plus 2ax.

168
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,120
B times x, plus bx.

169
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
B times a, plus ba.

170
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,360
So you get 2x squared, then
merge these terms, add the

171
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,040
coefficients.

172
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:26,660
Plus 2a plus bx, that's those
two terms. Plus ba is equal to

173
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,610
this thing up here.

174
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,090
I'll write it right below it so
we can compare terms. It's

175
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:37,600
equal to 2x squared
plus 7x plus 3.

176
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
So what could a and b equal?

177
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,900
Let's see, 2 times a plus b is
equal to-- so if a is 3 and

178
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,630
this is 1, 2 times 3 is
6 plus 1 is 7, works.

179
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,980
And then 3 times 1 is 7.

180
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,746
So b is 1 and a is 3.

181
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:02,160
   

182
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,690
And you could multiply that
out if you're not

183
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,430
comfortable with it.

184
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,190
But anyway, we could rewrite
this top thing as 3 times--

185
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,690
and we did the factoring here,
we figured out that b and a

186
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:18,990
are 2x plus 1, times x plus 3.

187
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,620
All of that over 2x plus
1, times 2x minus 1.

188
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,160
And we know we're on the right
track because we've got

189
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,010
something to cancel out.

190
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,860
And sure enough, we
cancel those out.

191
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,800
Assuming that this
never equals 0.

192
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,600
This x does not equal minus 1/2,
because that would make

193
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,630
that equal 0.

194
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:43,510
And we get 3 times x plus
3 over 2x minus 1.

195
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:48,500
And that is choice B.

196
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,180
Let me see the next problem,
see if we have time

197
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,620
to do it right now.

198
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,510
Oh, it's another one of these.

199
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,170
I'll wait for the next
video, see you soon.

200
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,000
