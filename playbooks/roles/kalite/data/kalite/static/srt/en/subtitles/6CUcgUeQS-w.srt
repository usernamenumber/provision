1
00:00:00,745 --> 00:00:03,989
Let's say that you dont' like company ABCD

2
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:07,107
that's right now trading for 50 dollars a share

3
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:10,291
but you don't have the stomach to short the stock

4
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:14,048
because there's a possibility that you could lose an infinite amount of money

5
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,072
if you short it

6
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:17,554
you still have an option

7
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:19,156
quite literally you still have an option

8
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:21,548
you can buy a put option

9
00:00:21,548 --> 00:00:24,033
once again we're dealing with the American variation

10
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,610
and just like an American call option

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:33,314
an American put option gives you the right to exercise the option any time before the expiration date

12
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:38,684
a European call or put option you can only exercise on the expiration date

13
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:40,635
and the situation with the put option

14
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:45,681
a call option gave you the right to buy the stock at a specified price

15
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,903
a put option is the opposite

16
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:52,361
it gives you the right to sell the stock at a specified price

17
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:56,680
so this little made up put option I've constructed right here

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,463
is maybe being sold on an exchange for five dollars per option

19
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:10,333
and it gives you the right to sell company ABCD at 40 dollars a share

20
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,957
any time over the next month

21
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:14,722
and let's see how, if you were to buy this

22
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:18,553
how this really is a bet that the company would go down

23
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:21,618
so let's imagine the scenario where the company does what you expect

24
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:25,055
it goes down and one month later

25
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:26,239
it keeps going down

26
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,491
you're like, I better use it today, because it's going to expire

27
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:30,001
if I don't use it today

28
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:34,018
so you exercise the option right over there

29
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:38,128
and so what this allows you to do is sell the stock at 40 dollars

30
00:01:38,128 --> 00:01:41,402
and if you don't own it, that's ok, because you can go and buy the stock

31
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:42,609
right now on the market

32
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,420
you knew it was going to get cheaper

33
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,929
so you can buy it for 20 dollars

34
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:49,296
and then exercise your option and sell it for 40

35
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:52,663
so you're buying at 20, and immediately selling for 40

36
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:54,776
so you're gonna be making 20 dollars

37
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:58,236
and then if you subtract out the price that you had to pay for the option

38
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:01,878
you're going to have a 15 dollar profit

39
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:05,220
you're going to have a 15 dollar profit over here

40
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,222
let me scroll over to the right so you have some space

41
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:11,717
and this is of course the situation with the put option

42
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:14,142
this is the put option

43
00:02:14,142 --> 00:02:17,137
and if your bet goes against you

44
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,088
and the stock actually goes up

45
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:23,058
it's not gonna be like a short position where you can lose an unlimited amount of money

46
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:27,679
in that situation let's say the stock just keeps going up and up and up

47
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:31,162
well, any point above 40 dollars, it's like, you know

48
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:33,577
there's no point in me exercising the option

49
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:35,295
so you just let it expire

50
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:39,475
so in that situation you just wasted your money buying the actual option

51
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:44,142
so you just lose the actual 5 dollars

52
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:47,578
even that stock were to go up to a gazillion dollars

53
00:02:47,578 --> 00:02:51,340
you're not required to buy it back like you would if you were shorting it

54
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,931
you can just let the option expire
