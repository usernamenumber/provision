1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870
   

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,470
In the last video we defined
internal energy as literally

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,470
all the energy that's
in a system.

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,340
That's kind of the most
inclusive version,

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,190
at least in my head.

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,840
So that's my system, it's
some type of container.

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,100
And I have a bunch of
particles in here.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,630
It's literally the sum of
the kinetic energies

9
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,820
of all these particles.

10
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,280
If they had potential
energies, we'd

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,240
throw that in there.

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,260
If they have electrical
potential, we'd

13
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,460
throw that in there.

14
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,680
If they have bonds with each
other, the energies in that

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,840
bond, we would throw
it in there.

16
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,710
It's everything.

17
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,540
It's all inclusive.

18
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,550
And, I told you in the last
video it's unintuitive that U

19
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,890
stands for internal energy.

20
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,720
But I kind of think that, you
know, U, it contains the

21
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,550
universe of energy.

22
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,980
You know, that's just for
me to memorize it.

23
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,340
Don't think too deeply into
what I just said.

24
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,830
But this is internal energy.

25
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,320
If you show me a system, it
has some internal energy.

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,890
It's a function of its state.

27
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,070
I don't care how it got to that
state, but if you told me

28
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,580
a system at a certain state,
maybe with a certain pressure,

29
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,280
or a certain volume, or at a
certain temperature-- although

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,550
if you give me pressure and
volume that should be enough--

31
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,940
I can tell you what its
internal energy is.

32
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,840
Especially if you tell me the
type of molecule I have, and

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,930
things like that.

34
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,990
Now we also said in the last
video that because internal

35
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,640
energy is all the energy in
the system, it can't be

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,260
randomly created or destroyed.

37
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,050
It can just be transformed
from one form to another.

38
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,600
So if I have a change in
internal energy, it can only

39
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,060
be due to-- well, it can be
due to more than what I'm

40
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,620
describing.

41
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,220
But in our simple world where
all of the energy in a

42
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,520
system-- and maybe we're dealing
with gases, because

43
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,080
that's normally what you deal
with in a first-year chemistry

44
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,290
course-- it's going to be the
heat that could be added to

45
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,860
the system, plus the work
done on the system.

46
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,820
   

47
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,830
And like I said in the last
video, sometimes they'll say,

48
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,260
instead of plus the work done
on the system, sometimes

49
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,020
they'll say, minus the work
that the system does.

50
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,970
Either way.

51
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,680
And here I just want to make
another side discussion here,

52
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,880
because I decided to write
it without the

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,810
little deltas here.

54
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,330
And the reason why I did that
is if you were to write this

55
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,560
equation, which you will see,
you'll see it in textbooks,

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,460
teachers will do it-- nothing
inherently criminal about

57
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,320
that-- but I just do that
because it clears in my mind

58
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,840
what heat and what work are
relative to internal energy.

59
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:31,630
If I were to write delta U is
equal to heat delta Q plus

60
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:38,340
delta W to me this implies that
at some point I had some

61
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,330
amount of heat in my system,
and then I have a different

62
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,860
amount of heat in my system,
and I took the difference

63
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,780
between the two and I got
a change in heat.

64
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,860
So this implies that heat is
somehow an inherent macrostate

65
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,880
of the system, and that's
not the case.

66
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,530
   

67
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,440
I can tell you what the
internal energy

68
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,540
of this system is.

69
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,100
I can tell you its pressure.

70
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,600
I can tell you its volume.

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,390
I can tell you its
temperature.

72
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,340
These are all macrostates
of the system.

73
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,040
I don't know how it got to this
situation, but I can tell

74
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,800
you about it.

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,880
I cannot tell you what the
heat is of this system.

76
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,690
And that might be a little
unintuitive, because if I ask

77
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,330
you, hey I have a cup of coffee,
what's the heat of it?

78
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,920
You might say, oh, it's, you
know, you might give me the

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,450
temperature.

80
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,940
Because in our everyday language
we use things like

81
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,790
heat and temperature
interchangeably.

82
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,920
But in thermodynamics, heat
is a transfer of energy.

83
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,080
A way to think about it
is, if internal energy

84
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,510
is your bank account.

85
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,195
So you could say change
in bank account.

86
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:45,940
   

87
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,370
And it really is like
the energy bank

88
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,690
account of a system.

89
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,660
If you have a change in a bank
account, you had some deposits

90
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,770
or withdrawals.

91
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,480
And heat and work are really
just deposits or withdrawals

92
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,550
into our energy bank account.

93
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,570
Heat is one kind.

94
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,790
Maybe heat is like
a wire transfer.

95
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,640
So you could say it's wire
transfers to your account.

96
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,570
Transfers to your account
plus check deposits.

97
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,399
   

98
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,840
Now it makes a lot of sense to
say, you could say, what is my

99
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,360
value of my bank account?

100
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,630
Or you could say what is my
change in my bank account?

101
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,860
You take two snapshots of
your bank account at

102
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,140
two different times.

103
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,170
But would it make sense to say--
you know, I could say I

104
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,420
wire transferred $10, right?

105
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,220
So I could say, this statement
would be plus $10.

106
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,080
And I could say that I
wrote $20 in checks,

107
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,710
minus $20 in checks.

108
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,630
In which case, my change
in my bank account

109
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,440
would be minus $10.

110
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,160
Now would it make sense
for me to say

111
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,930
change in wire transfer?

112
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,810
That implies that when I started
off maybe my bank

113
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,390
account had $100 in it
and now it has $90.

114
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,240
When my bank account had $100
in it, did it have any wire

115
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,010
transfer amount?

116
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,000
No, wire transfer was how money
was deposited or taken

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,920
away from my account.

118
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,780
Likewise, it didn't have a
checking deposit account, so I

119
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,080
can't really-- it just seems
weird to me to say change in

120
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,280
wire transfer is $10, or change
in check deposits is

121
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,340
$20 or minus $20.

122
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,370
Would you say, I made a
$10 wire transfer and

123
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,970
I paid $20 in checks.

124
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,050
So I had a net change in
my bank account of $10.

125
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,280
Likewise, I say how much work
was done to me or I did, which

126
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,610
is essentially a deposit or
withdrawal of energy.

127
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,900
Or I could say much heat was
given to me or how much heat

128
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,160
was released, which is another
way of depositing or

129
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,360
withdrawing energy from my
energy bank account.

130
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,920
So that's why I like
to stick to this.

131
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,400
And I like to stay
away from this.

132
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,940
And just like I said, you can't
say how much heat is in

133
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,920
the system.

134
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,270
So someone will say, oh, how
much heat is in this?

135
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,560
You cannot say that.

136
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,460
There's no heat state variable
for that system.

137
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,370
You have internal energy.

138
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,150
The closest thing to heat,
we'll talk about it in a

139
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,860
future video, is enthalpy.

140
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,430
Enthalpy is essentially a way of
measuring how much heat is

141
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,120
in a system, but we won't talk
about that just now.

142
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,940
And you can't say how much
work is in a system.

143
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,140
You can't say, oh I have x
amount of work in a system.

144
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,190
The system can do work or have
work done to it, but there's

145
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,710
not a certain amount of work,
because that energy in the

146
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,180
system could be all used for
work, it could all be used for

147
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,470
heat, it could all be used for
a ton of different things.

148
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,760
So you can't say those things.

149
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,030
And that's why I don't like
treating them like state

150
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,940
variables, or state functions.

151
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,530
So with that said, this
is our definition.

152
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,760
Let's do a couple of
simple problems,

153
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,840
just to give you intuition.

154
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,040
And I really want to make
you comfortable.

155
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,560
My real goal is to make you
comfortable with, when to know

156
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,320
to use plus or minus
on the work.

157
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,000
And the best way to do it is not
to memorize a formula, but

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,520
just to kind of think about
what's happening.

159
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,490
So let's say that I have some
system here and, I don't know,

160
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,540
it's a balloon.

161
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:09,770
And let's say that I have no
change in internal energy.

162
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,990
Internal energy is 0.

163
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,100
And for our purposes we can kind
of view it as the kinetic

164
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,350
energy of the particles
haven't changed.

165
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,200
And let's say by expanding a
bit, by my balloon expanding a

166
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,420
bit-- I did some work.

167
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,730
I'll do this in more detail
in the next video.

168
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:35,940
So the system does 10
joules of work.

169
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,840
My question is, how much heat
was added or taken away from

170
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,090
the system?

171
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,190
   

172
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,615
So the way I can think about
it-- you don't even have to

173
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:49,160
write the formula down, or you
can write it-- you could say,

174
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,370
look, the internal energy, the
amount of energy in the system

175
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,050
hasn't changed.

176
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,430
The system did 10
joules of work.

177
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,510
So that's energy going
out of the system.

178
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,100
It did 10 joules.

179
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,980
So 10 joules went out
in the form of work.

180
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,640
If the internal energy did not
change, then essentially 10

181
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,790
joules of energy had to
go into the system.

182
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,800
10 joules had to go
into the system.

183
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,280
If it didn't, the internal
energy would have gone down by

184
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,020
the amount of work we had.

185
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,490
And the only way, if is this is
the net work, the only way

186
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,920
that we're talking about, that
we can add energy outside of

187
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,000
work, is through heat.

188
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,810
So 10 joules of heat must
have been added.

189
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:36,860
So we can write 10 joules
of heat added to system.

190
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,690
Now let's look at that from
the point of view of the

191
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,450
actual formula.

192
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:49,720
If we have delta U is equal to
heat added, plus work done to

193
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,970
the system, then we would
say, OK, this was 0.

194
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,190
It's equal to the heat
added to the system.

195
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,060
Remember, in this way we're
saying this is the heat done,

196
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,610
or the work done,
to the system.

197
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,420
W is work done.

198
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,600
Now, the system did work
to something else.

199
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,180
It didn't have work
done to it.

200
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,540
So if this is work done to the
system, and it did work, then

201
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,040
this is going to
be a minus 10.

202
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,820
Minus 10 joules.

203
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,260
And then you solve both
sides of this.

204
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:31,220
You add 10 to both sides and
you get 10 is equal to Q,

205
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,460
which is exactly what
we got up here.

206
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,200
But this can get confusing
sometimes, because you're

207
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,570
like, oh, is this heat
that the system did?

208
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,180
Is this heat that was added to
the system or taken away?

209
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,080
The convention tends to be
that this is heat added.

210
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,280
But then sometimes
it's confusing.

211
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,080
Is this the work done to the
system or work done by?

212
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,750
And that's why I like just
doing it this way.

213
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,660
If the system does work
it loses energy.

214
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,330
If the system has work done
to it, it gains energy.

215
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,280
So let's do another problem.

216
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,350
I mean, I could have done this
exact same thing using the

217
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,650
other formula that you'll
sometimes see.

218
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:14,860
Delta U is equal to Q minus the
work that the system does

219
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,520
by the system-- Work
done by the system.

220
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,980
And in this case, once
again, change in

221
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,710
internal energy was 0.

222
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,990
That is equal to heat
added to the system,

223
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,320
minus the work done.

224
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,560
So minus-- I told you at the
beginning of the problem that

225
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,590
the system did 10 joules of
work-- so minus the work done.

226
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,790
Minus 10 joules.

227
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,080
We get the same situation
up here from

228
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,690
two different formulas.

229
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,420
And we got 10 is equal to Q.

230
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,850
Either way, the heat added to
the system is 10 joules.

231
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,170
Let's do one more.

232
00:10:51,170 --> 00:11:02,370
Let's say that, I don't know,
5 joules of heat taken away

233
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,620
from system.

234
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:09,030
   

235
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:16,260
And let's say that 1 joule
of work done on system.

236
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,170
So maybe we're compressing the
balloon on the system.

237
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,150
What is our change in
internal energy?

238
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,140
Let's just figure
out our change.

239
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,190
So the way I think of it is 5
joules of heat taken away from

240
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,990
the system, that's going
to reduce our internal

241
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,930
energy by minus 5.

242
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,070
And if 1 joule work is done onto
the system, we're putting

243
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,740
energy into it so that'll
be plus 1.

244
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,950
So minus 5, plus 1, is
going to be minus 4.

245
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,780
Or enter our change in internal

246
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,450
energy is minus 4 joules.

247
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,970
Now we could have done that a
little bit more formally with

248
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,400
the formula, change in internal
energy is equal to

249
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:03,720
heat added to the system, plus
work done on the system.

250
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,680
So it's equal to heat
added to the system.

251
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,530
We had 5 joules heat taken away,
so this is minus 5, plus

252
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,990
work done on the system.

253
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,180
We have 1 joule of work done
on the system, and there we

254
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,880
get, once again, minus 4.

255
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,540
Now, I could have written that
same formula the other way.

256
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,340
I could have said change in
internal energy is equal to

257
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,950
heat added to the system minus
the work that the system does.

258
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,530
I want to do this both ways,
because I don't want you to

259
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,380
get confused, either way you
see it on problems or in

260
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,410
school, or maybe you take one
class that does it one way and

261
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,425
one class that does
it the other.

262
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:43,210
If you use it this way,
what was the heat

263
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,340
added to the system?

264
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,440
We had heat taken away,
so it's minus 5.

265
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,890
So minus the work that the
system does, how much work

266
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,250
does the system do?

267
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,720
Well, the system had 1 joule
of work done to it.

268
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,550
So it did itself minus
1 joules of work.

269
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,110
So it's minus minus 1.

270
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,130
I want to be clear, when I use
this formula, this is work

271
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,060
done by system, done by.

272
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,720
This is work done to.

273
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,000
The system had work
done to it.

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,700
So it had minus 1 joules of work
done by the system, so

275
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,970
these become pluses, and you
get back to a minus 4.

276
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,550
Do whatever's intuitive
for you.

277
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,510
For me, this tends to be the
most intuitive, where you

278
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,550
don't even use a formula.

279
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,990
We just think, if I'm doing
work, I'm using up energy.

280
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,550
If I get work done to me, I'm
being handed over energy.

281
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,200
If I have heat taken away from
me, I'm giving away energy.

282
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,300
If I have heat added to me,
I'm getting energy.

283
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,100
See you in the next video.
