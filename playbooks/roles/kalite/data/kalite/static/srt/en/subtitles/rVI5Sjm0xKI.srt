2
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:08,180
We're in the Wallace Collection in London. This is Fragonard's, "The Swing".

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:16,396
And the first thing that I notice is this "poof" of pink and lacy white in the center of the painting. This woman is going up

4
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:22,028
on a swing and I notice she's sitting on a red velvet and gold seat on that swing

5
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:32,147
held up by ropes and this fabulous swirl of a hat and we can see her white silk stockings and she flips one pink slipper into the air.

6
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:37,879
- And she looks completely mischievous - And of course what's going on is very naughty because we have a figure

7
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:42,117
in the left corner that she's looking down at, who's obviously her lover

8
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:49,601
hidden in the bushes and she's connived the man in the opposite corner to push her on a swing, an older gentleman

9
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:53,002
- who's probably innocent of the fact that the young man

10
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:59,831
is hidden in the bushes. - Yes, and we've just noticed that there's a double row of short fencing surrounding the sculpture

11
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:05,098
on the left side, so her lover's obviously gone into a little area that you're not supposed to go into

12
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,931
that's sort of over-grown with wild roses and is sort of hiding in the bushes there.

13
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:15,547
- Take a look at that sculpture on the left. It actually shows a little angelic figure or a putti who's actually got his finger up to his lips

14
00:01:15,547 --> 00:01:19,429
as if he's saying "shh", uh, keep the secret. - And we're not out in the wild here

15
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:23,236
we're like behind a villa or a palace... - You can just actually make out

16
00:01:23,236 --> 00:01:30,700
some architecture in the distance, just under her left arm. This is a garden that's been over-grown, that's lush but it's

17
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,381
out of control. It is nature at it's most, sort of, energetic

18
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:39,169
and - fertile - fertile - and abundant - exactly - right, sort of speaking to the

19
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:42,712
sort of sexual, sensual theme - and somewhat dream-like

20
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:44,784
as well, you know, in its mists.

21
00:01:44,784 --> 00:01:49,402
The tree and its boughs are, at times, full of foliage and, at times, are bare

22
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:54,517
and represents, sometimes what is referred to as, the blast and the bough

23
00:01:54,517 --> 00:01:58,418
which is almost like lightning; criss-crossing across the canvas - mmhmm -

24
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:02,621
which is sometimes used as an expression of passion, which would be absolutely appropriate here of course.

25
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:09,687
- We have behind, just under the woman, a sculpture that shows two little, also putti, or cupid-like figures

26
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:16,086
being playful with each other and on what maybe looks like a beehive. Perhaps indicating

27
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:20,438
the stings of love. - Easy to miss, in the bottom right corner

28
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:24,329
is a little dog - yeah, yapping - that seems to be yapping. Now a dog of course

29
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:30,021
is a symbol of fidelity. - That's a little bit ironic here - Well, maybe that's why the dog's a little upset

30
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:36,312
- And it's almost like the dog is perhaps giving away the secret. - Oh, right. That's right - and the sculpture is saying "shh"

31
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:40,649
- This is 1767, so we're really a couple of decades before the

32
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:47,697
revolution. But this is the kind of indulgence and expression of pleasure that really does characterize the aristocracy

33
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:52,182
and the ruling class in France. - And it's this kind of painting, this kind of painting that seems to

34
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:56,130
be about only pleasure that Diderot and the other thinkers

35
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,795
of the enlightenment are going to rail against and call for an art that is heroic

36
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:06,514
and virtuous and appeals to the highest human aspirations and not our basest human aspirations

37
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:14,060
and it's that kind of enlightenment thinking that will lead, of course, to the revolution in 1789

38
00:03:14,079 --> 99:59:59,999
