1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,960
OK, welcome back.

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,280
We're now on problem number
15, and I tried my best to

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,090
draw this graph ahead of time.

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,890
This is probably one of the more
difficult for me with my

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,630
shaky hand.

7
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,510
Let's see what this says.

8
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,180
So this is point O for the
origin right here.

9
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,590
This is point P.

10
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,561
This is point Q.

11
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:27,160
Then of course this is the
y-axis, this is the x-axis.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,910
And they say that this graph,
right here, is y is equal to a

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,380
minus x squared.

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:42,150
And this curve right here is
y is equal to x squared.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,420
So the question says, in the
figure above, the graphs y

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,670
equals x squared and y equals
a minus x squared for some

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,450
constant a-- oh, those
are the graphs.

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,030
Right.

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:01:05,420
If the length of PQ is equal to
6, what is the value of a?

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,710
Well, it's interesting.

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,330
So the first thing that should
jump out at you is that these

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,950
are completely symmetric
graphs, right?

23
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,120
They both are kind
of mirror images

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,300
around the y-axis, right?

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,920
So if this length is 6, then the
length of each of these--

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,340
then here is 3 and here is 3.

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,280
Right?

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,550
So what do we know about where
these graphs intersect?

29
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:37,050
Well, we know that they
intersect at the point 3, and

30
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,050
we know that they intersect as
well at the point minus 3.

31
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,740
Those are where those two
graphs intersect.

32
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,765
And that's a lot
of information.

33
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:47,200
And the way, once again, we came
to this conclusion was

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,020
that these are both symmetric
around the y-axis.

35
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,960
So if this intersection
is 6 wide, soon. then

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,110
it's 3 on each side.

37
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,320
Right?

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,920
3 at the positive side, 3
at the negative side.

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,550
So it intersects at x equals
3 and x equals minus 3.

40
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,670
And if we want to figure out the
intersection, we can also

41
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,010
just set these two equal to
each other. y equals x

42
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,150
squared, y equals a
minus x squared.

43
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:17,210
So we know that x squared must
be equal to a minus-- what am

44
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,330
I doing? a minus x squared.

45
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,640
Or add x squared to both
sides of this equation.

46
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,865
You get 2x squared
is equal to a.

47
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:29,115
Right?

48
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,210
   

49
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,540
And this'll be true at the two
points, at the two x points,

50
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,530
where these two graphs
intersect.

51
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,930
Well, what are the x points?

52
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,760
We figured that out.

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,990
It's 3 and minus 3.

54
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,110
So if you put 3 in here,
you get 2 times 3

55
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,960
squared is equal to a.

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,450
It's 2 times 9 is equal to a.

57
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,170
a is equal to 18.

58
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,060
And if you put minus 3 in here,
it'd be the same thing,

59
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,080
because when you square it
the negative goes away.

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,820
So a is 18.

61
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,880
Not too bad.

62
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,100
The key conclusion you have to
make is that they intersect at

63
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,480
the points positive
and negative 3.

64
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,350
And then you just set the
equations equal to each other

65
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,150
and solve for a.

66
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's do the next problem.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,240
Clear image.

68
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,660
Set X has x members, and
set Y has y members.

69
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,410
Set Z contains all the members
that are either in X or Y,

70
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,130
with the exception of the
k common members.

71
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,160
OK, so this sounds like
a Venn diagram.

72
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,280
I don't know if you remember a
Venn diagram, but I'll show

73
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,500
you what one is.

74
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,290
So let's say that
this is set X.

75
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,230
   

76
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,590
And let's say that this
is set Y right here.

77
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,900
   

78
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,130
Looks like a MasterCard
logo. you

79
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,230
So this is set Y,
this is set X.

80
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,280
And it says, set Z consists of
all the members that are

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,520
either in set X or set Y,
with the exception of

82
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,180
the k common members.

83
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,110
So this is the k common
members, right?

84
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,160
These are the things that
overlap with set X and set Y.

85
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,990
So what does Z consist of?

86
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:19,990
Well, Z is going to be-- let
me pick a dark color.

87
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,540
Z is going to be-- if I do the
fill tool-- it's going to be

88
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,850
that plus that.

89
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,610
Right?

90
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,520
Without the k, right?

91
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,910
Because it says Z does not
include the overlap.

92
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,270
So what are those two things?

93
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,260
Let me go back to
the paint tool.

94
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,640
Orange.

95
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,060
It's going to be tacky with
all the colors I'm using.

96
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,060
So there's x members
in all of X.

97
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,760
x members in all of capital X.

98
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,670
So how many members are
in this blue region?

99
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,170
So if there's x in the whole
region, there's going to be x

100
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,190
minus k in this blue
region, right?

101
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,100
I just subtracted
out this k part.

102
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,080
Similarly, Y has y members,
as the problem tells us.

103
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,750
Capital Y set has lowercase
y members.

104
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,190
But if we take out these k that
overlap, this is going to

105
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,920
be y minus k.

106
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm just subtracting it out.

107
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,250
And so Z is this blue area
plus this blue area.

108
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,440
So it'll be x minus
k plus y minus k.

109
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,140
And that is equal to x plus y.

110
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,420
We have two minus k's,
so it's minus 2k.

111
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,720
And that is choice D.

112
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,590
Not too bad, huh?

113
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,150
All right.

114
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,470
I think we are all done with
this practice test. Hopefully

115
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,780
you found it vaguely useful.

116
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,190
I'll see

117
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:43,833
