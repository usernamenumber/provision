1
00:00:00,725 --> 00:00:02,393
I think we're now ready to start talking about

2
00:00:02,393 --> 00:00:05,321
some general trends in the periodic table.

3
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:07,234
And the first one that normally comes up

4
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:09,109
in a lot of first-year chemistry classes

5
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:09,938
and it even shows up

6
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:12,998
on some chemistry standardized tests

7
00:00:12,998 --> 00:00:16,148
is the notion of ionization energy.

8
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:21,522
Ionization Energy.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,335
And what this is, is essentially the energy required

10
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:27,295
to remove an electron

11
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:30,590
from the neutral version of that atom.

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,745
So let's see.

13
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:41,523
Energy to remove an electron.

14
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:43,147
And just in case you haven't been exposed to

15
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:45,079
the idea of what an ion is

16
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,007
I guess this is a good time to explain it.

17
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:48,781
And then this will make sense.

18
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:53,526
So an ion is essentially any atom or molecule

19
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:54,737
and we'll talk about molecules.

20
00:00:54,737 --> 00:00:57,815
Molecules are just combinations or groups of atoms

21
00:00:57,815 --> 00:00:59,575
that are all bonded together in some way.

22
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:00,968
And we'll talk about bonding

23
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:02,787
in a few videos from now.

24
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:04,790
But it's an atom or a molecule

25
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,743
in which the protons don't equal the electrons.

26
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:12,829
And if the protons don't equal the electrons

27
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:13,918
then you have some charge.

28
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:16,087
If you have more protons than electrons

29
00:01:16,087 --> 00:01:18,993
you have a positive charge, right?

30
00:01:18,993 --> 00:01:22,681
So let's say if you have hydrogen.

31
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:23,502
Let's say you have hydrogen.

32
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:24,727
Normally it's neutral, right?

33
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:25,875
It has no charge.

34
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,121
But let's say you were to remove an electron from it.

35
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,500
So now you have hydrogen plus an electron.

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,840
Hydrogen only has one electron outside.

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,129
So now it just has a proton on the inside

38
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,290
no electrons on the outside.

39
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,343
So now it has a plus one charge.

40
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:41,129
We could write a minus one there.

41
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:43,023
And now, what we've done in this,

42
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:43,930
I guess we could say,

43
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,140
this procedure or this reaction is, we've removed

44
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,091
we've ionized hydrogen.

45
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:52,443
We've removed an electron.

46
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:57,129
And in this case, this type of ion that hydrogen is

47
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,099
where your protons are greater than your electrons

48
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,012
and this is just a nice word to know.

49
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:03,076
This is called a cation.

50
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:06,366
A cation is an ion with a positive charge.

51
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:08,978
Now you just as easily could have a situation

52
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:11,755
where you have a, let's say

53
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:13,332
I don't know, let me take an element

54
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:17,202
let's say we start with chlorine.

55
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:18,918
Cl, right?

56
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:21,218
In a stable form it has seven valence electrons.

57
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:25,048
Why don't we add an electron to it.

58
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:28,610
And now this will actually be pretty stable.

59
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,194
It will have eight valence electrons

60
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:32,910
but it'll have a negative charge.

61
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,714
So this, right here, this is a negative ion.

62
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:39,874
And that's known as an anion.

63
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:41,200
Anion.

64
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,001
The way I remember it is, in a lot of words,

65
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:47,387
"a" means the opposite or a negation.

66
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:48,174
Right?

67
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:49,821
The "a" prefix.

68
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:53,551
So "a", anion, means a negative ion.

69
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,923
And then, obviously, cation is the other.

70
00:02:55,923 --> 00:02:57,036
But ionization energy

71
00:02:57,036 --> 00:03:00,460
it really should maybe be called cationization energy

72
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,571
because it's the energy required

73
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:03,130
to remove an electron

74
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,936
not remove or add an electron.

75
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,554
So it's really the energy required

76
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:10,950
to turn something into a cation.

77
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,475
So we've already discussed the periodic table

78
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:15,732
and we'll get to this chart in a second.

79
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:17,927
But just based on what we already know

80
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:19,724
which elements will it be harder

81
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:21,226
to remove an electron from

82
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:23,646
and which ones will it be easier?

83
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:25,735
We already talked about -- let's start with group one,

84
00:03:25,735 --> 00:03:27,805
just because it is group one.

85
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:29,255
Group one is right here.

86
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:31,918
And we'll start especially with the alkali metals.

87
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:34,395
We can put hydrogen aside for now.

88
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:36,554
But all of these, guys, we've talked about a lot.

89
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:39,800
In order for them to get to the magic number eight

90
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,626
in their outermost shell

91
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:42,995
the easiest way for them to do it

92
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:45,902
is just to get rid of that one valence electron

93
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:47,930
they have in their outermost shell.

94
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,193
Let's say potassium, right there.

95
00:03:52,193 --> 00:03:57,211
Potassium has one valence electron in its fourth shell.

96
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:57,941
If it just got rid of it

97
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:59,653
then it has eight in its third shell.

98
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,216
Then it looks a lot like argon

99
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,268
from an electron configuration point of view,

100
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:04,097
which would be nice.

101
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:08,094
So these, guys, really want to give away electrons.

102
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:12,794
So it requires very little energy to ionize them

103
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,278
or to cationize them, to take away their electron.

104
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:19,055
So this is low ionization energy.

105
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:22,105
And I think you see where this is going.

106
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:24,087
What about these guys?

107
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:27,078
What about neon?

108
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:30,301
How hard is it to remove an electron from neon.

109
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:32,808
Well neon is completely satisfied.

110
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:34,179
It doesn't want to even deal with any of this

111
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:36,412
reaction business and bonding business.

112
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:37,328
It's like, you know what?

113
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:41,043
I've achieved happiness in life.

114
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:42,503
Don't mess with my electron.

115
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:44,789
So it really doesn't want to give away its electrons.

116
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:46,750
Neon, or krypton, or argon

117
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,281
or any of these noble gases.

118
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:50,540
So to remove an electron from one of these guys

119
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,298
requires a lot of energy.

120
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,881
So this is a high ionization energy.

121
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:56,538
So in general

122
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:59,293
as you go from left to right across the periodic table

123
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:00,036
it goes from low to high.

124
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:01,538
And some people memorize this,

125
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,057
but you really don't have to memorize it.

126
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:04,206
You just say, look,

127
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:05,839
these guys have one extra electron

128
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,349
that they're always trying to get rid of.

129
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,775
These guys have two.

130
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:12,602
Ideally they'd want to get rid of, maybe,

131
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:14,350
both of their electrons.

132
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,947
But the first electron doesn't want to jump off

133
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:18,646
as much as the first electron here

134
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:19,852
because the first electron here

135
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,647
you get rid of it

136
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:23,045
you immediately get to the super stable state.

137
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:25,432
And that trend just becomes more and more true.

138
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:28,427
This guy, definitely, under no circumstances

139
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:29,871
wants to give away an electron.

140
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,037
This guy is so close to being like neon

141
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:34,248
that he definitely doesn't want to go a step backwards

142
00:05:34,248 --> 00:05:35,510
and look more like oxygen.

143
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,461
So he doesn't want to get rid of an electron.

144
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:38,739
So the trend is pretty clear.

145
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:39,935
Anytime you're confused about the trend

146
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:41,247
just look at the extreme cases.

147
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,235
This guy wants to give away electrons.

148
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:45,145
This guy wants to get electrons.

149
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,924
So if you say, what's the energy required

150
00:05:47,924 --> 00:05:49,020
to take away an electron?

151
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,933
Well this guy's almost going to give it to you.

152
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,151
While this guy's going to be very hard,

153
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,439
especially neon,

154
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,198
to take away an electron.

155
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:57,237
Now what happens as you go down?

156
00:05:57,237 --> 00:06:00,153
As you go down in this direction,

157
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:01,681
let's say you go along a group, right?

158
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:03,173
We already established that

159
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:06,743
these alkali metals like to give away electrons.

160
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,128
But as you go down,

161
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:11,445
the electron cloud gets bigger and bigger.

162
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:13,742
And you could say this 55th electron

163
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:15,043
there's 55 protons,

164
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:17,527
there's also in a neutral cesium atom,

165
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,096
there's also 55 electrons

166
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:20,344
that the 55th electron is

167
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:23,835
a lot further away from the nucleus of this atom

168
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:28,961
than the third electron is in the case of lithium.

169
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:31,531
So this, the 55th electron,

170
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:32,627
not only does it want to be given away,

171
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:35,852
but it has even a weaker attraction to the nucleus

172
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:38,060
than the third electron does in lithium.

173
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,520
So because you're getting larger and larger

174
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,405
as you go down a group,

175
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:42,402
and the electrons are getting

176
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,155
further and further away from the nucleus,

177
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:49,228
this guy wants to give away his electrons

178
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:51,394
even more than lithium does.

179
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:52,316
Right?

180
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:56,310
So ionization energy decreases as you go down.

181
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,284
Even though xenon really wants to keep his electrons

182
00:07:00,284 --> 00:07:02,748
he's a little bit more willing to give them away

183
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:04,908
than neon is.

184
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:05,408
Right?

185
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:10,390
So in general, the ionization energy,

186
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:14,354
or the energy required to ionize an atom,

187
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:18,092
will increase as you go up.

188
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:18,592
Right?

189
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:20,879
And if you ever forget it, don't memorize these things.

190
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,100
Because that might be useful for just one test

191
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,903
but then later in life

192
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,294
when you're 42 and someone asks you,

193
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:28,309
hey, what has a higher ionization energy,

194
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:29,494
cesium or fluorine?

195
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:31,955
You might have forgotten it.

196
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:33,513
But then if you look at a periodic table, you'd say,

197
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:36,697
you know, cesium has this one electron

198
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:37,799
that it's just dying to give away.

199
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:40,593
It's super far away from the nucleus.

200
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:44,594
That 55th electron just really wants to leave.

201
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:47,812
While fluorine, that ninth electron

202
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:49,775
just needs one more electron.

203
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:51,013
Well let's say neon.

204
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,307
Neon is super happy.

205
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:55,834
All the electrons are in the stable configuration.

206
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,222
They're close to the nucleus.

207
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:59,184
There's a lot of attraction

208
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:00,007
with the protons in the nucleus.

209
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:01,054
They definitely don't want to

210
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:02,985
give away their electrons.

211
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:04,451
So if you talk about the

212
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,059
energy required to remove them

213
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:08,093
very low energy at cesium

214
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:10,520
very high energy at helium

215
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,989
So that's the trend.

216
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:14,597
And this is just, this trend we'll see often

217
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:18,475
this is your willingness to give electrons.

218
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,468
And this is how much you want to

219
00:08:19,618 --> 00:08:22,297
hog electrons or keep them to yourself.

220
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,763
And this right here, this is actually

221
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:26,863
I got this off Wikipedia

222
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:30,579
this is the actual, measured ionization energies.

223
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:32,936
And people looked at patterns like this.

224
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:33,667
I'm not sure if they actually

225
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:34,995
looked at the ionization energy,

226
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:36,125
but they looked at patterns like this,

227
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:36,689
and this is actually

228
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:38,284
where they came up with the periodic table.

229
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:42,014
Because they said, look,

230
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:43,138
as we increment up

231
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:45,669
the number of protons that we have in an atom,

232
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:48,096
and likewise, the number of electrons,

233
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:51,742
we see these repeated patterns, or these periods,

234
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:52,769
in the elements.

235
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,046
So this is hydrogen.

236
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,417
So hydrogen's ionization energy

237
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:01,171
is around 13 1/2 electron volts.

238
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:01,794
Right?

239
00:09:01,794 --> 00:09:03,593
Which is a unit of energy.

240
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:05,736
It can be converted into joules, if you like.

241
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:07,289
But then all of a sudden, helium is a lot more stable.

242
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:09,674
It takes almost double the energy

243
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,076
to remove that second electron from helium

244
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:14,024
because it's so stable.

245
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:15,076
But as soon as you do that,

246
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:16,561
as soon as you go from helium,

247
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:19,007
this point right here,

248
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,952
that point right here is lithium.

249
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:22,484
Right?

250
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:23,954
Lithium is atomic number of three.

251
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:25,012
Let me put that in.

252
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:26,439
This is lithium.

253
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:28,958
All of a sudden, to remove an electron from lithium

254
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,476
it only requires five electron volts.

255
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:34,204
So less than half of what it required for hydrogen.

256
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:37,790
Then as you go to the right of the periodic table,

257
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,902
the ionization energy keeps increasing.

258
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:41,994
These little divots are interesting.

259
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:44,394
We could talk about that, maybe, in a future video.

260
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,604
But the ionization energy increases

261
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:48,910
all the way to neon.

262
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,732
And then you get to neon

263
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:50,875
and then you add one more

264
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,588
see, neon is a noble gas, it's completely happy

265
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:54,523
then you add one more electron

266
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:55,954
and you get to sodium.

267
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:57,389
And you say, oh, now sodium,

268
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,779
it's really easy to take away that electron.

269
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,390
And the ionization energy drops.

270
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,518
Not only did it drop,

271
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:05,520
but here it dropped slightly below lithium.

272
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,530
So you see this general trend.

273
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,070
So these are the noble gases right here.

274
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,200
Let me make sure

275
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,140
you can see them all in the video screen.

276
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,258
Helium.

277
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:16,645
Very hard to remove that eighth electron.

278
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:17,319
Neon.

279
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,202
It's very hard, but a little easier than helium.

280
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,186
And that's because neon is a little bit bigger.

281
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:22,174
The electrons are a little bit

282
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:23,650
further away from the nucleus.

283
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,069
Argon.

284
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:27,117
Same pattern, but it's actually interesting.

285
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:30,615
Argon is actually not that different than hydrogen.

286
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:31,318
Krypton.

287
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:32,002
Same thing.

288
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:33,783
It's hard to remove that electron.

289
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:34,960
But it's actually no harder

290
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,615
to remove the electron on krypton

291
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,427
than on hydrogen.

292
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:39,138
And xenon.

293
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:44,050
And you go all the way out to radon.

294
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,196
And you can see, you know,

295
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:47,089
why is the distance between these increasing?

296
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:48,731
Well if you remember the periodic table,

297
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,908
all of a sudden when you go after argon,

298
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:55,482
then you have all of the d-block elements that go in.

299
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:58,416
So after you get to argon, notice.

300
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,593
This is where you only had s- and p-block elements.

301
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:04,288
Now all of a sudden the d-block elements show up.

302
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:09,869
So you have more subshells to fill up.

303
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,627
And now all of a sudden, before you get to radon,

304
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:16,349
you're starting to fill out the f-block, too.

305
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:18,081
And that's why that distance is increasing,

306
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:20,080
because you have to also fill out the f elements.

307
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,503
But the general trends that we just discussed

308
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:23,768
they apply here.

309
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:27,501
That as you go to the right along the periodic table,

310
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,022
it becomes harder and harder to remove an electron

311
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,257
because everyone wants to

312
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,453
get to the magic number eight.

313
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:33,841
And it's very hard to remove them from a noble gas.

314
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:35,607
But then as you go one more above that,

315
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:36,819
this guy would love to give away his electron

316
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:41,415
and get back to a configuration like neon.

317
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:44,932
And then the other trend is, as you go down a group

318
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:49,484
in this case, these are the noble gases

319
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:50,661
the ionization energy decreases.

320
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:51,592
And that's because

321
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:55,356
the overall radius of the atom increases,

322
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:59,872
so the valence electrons in radon are

323
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:01,428
a little bit less strongly attracted

324
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:04,462
than the valence electrons in helium.

325
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:07,327
Anyway, I think that's it for ionization energy.

326
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,916
I'll continue this in another video.

327
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:09,661
We'll talk about

328
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:13,000
metallic character and electronegativity.
