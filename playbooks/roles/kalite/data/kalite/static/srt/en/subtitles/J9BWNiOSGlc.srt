1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
I mentioned in the last several videos

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,210
that the coefficient of kinetic friction tends to be less

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,000
sometimes little bit roughly equal to the coefficient of static friction

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,440
but this might lead you to at least a question

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,080
that I have had in my mind and I still have to some degree

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,810
that why is the coefficient of kinetic friction lower or why can it be lower?

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,920
And the current best theory that I

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,060
can visualize in my head and based on the readings that I have done is the difference between--

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,720
so let's think about it this way

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,110
Look at a regular human level

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:44,610
maybe we have a block, so this is the static case. Let me draw like this

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,100
I will draw this static case over here

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,610
So I have a block that is stationary on top of a surface in a different color

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,030
On top of some type of surface right over here

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,850
and over here I am going to have a block

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:06,670
moving at some at a constant velocity relative to the same surface

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:14,860
Let me draw out. So this is moving at some constant velocity

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,330
and so the interesting thing here is assuming that these are the same masses

19
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,160
These are the same surfaces

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,650
is why should the coefficient of friction here

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,310
why should the coefficient of static friction--

22
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,200
so this is here, this is stationary what's under place of coefficient of static friction

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:41,200
why should that be larger than the coefficient of kinetic friction over here?

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Another way to think about it, you would need to apply

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,390
more force to overcome the static friction here and start to get this accelerating

26
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:56,600
than you would need to apply to get this already moving body to accelerate

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,600
because there would be less of a responsive friction force. So let's think about it little bit

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,280
So what I am going to do is zoom in into the atomic level. So when you zoom into the

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,030
atomic level, almost nothing is completely smooth

30
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,960
So the surface over here might look something like this

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,820
So, let me draw the molecules that make up the surface

32
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,020
So, the best to my ability

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,530
So the molecules when you zoom up really close for the surface might look

34
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:36,030
something like this and when you--you know we are really really zoom into the atomic level

35
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,840
unimaginably small, much smaller than that boxes. But I am trying to look it

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,110
what's happening with the atoms/molecules where they contact

37
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:51,050
and the box's molecules look something like this

38
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:57,340
They aren't completely smooth and hopefully this video also emphasizes

39
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,230
that all of this forces and contacts we are talking about in this video --it's actually

40
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,150
interesting philosophical, nothing is ever really in contact with each other. You really

41
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,820
just have atoms and that are repulsing each other because they are electrons

42
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,340
The electromagnetic force of repulsion between them is

43
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,630
not allowing them to get any closer together

44
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,260
So that's all when you push something

45
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:27,380
it's just the electrons in your hand pushing on the electron or the electron clouds

46
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,750
in your hand pushing on the electron clouds of say the pen you are holding

47
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,700
or the key on your keyboard or the mug

48
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,610
so that it repulses and causes it to go in the other direction

49
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:45,070
So there is never this thing like real what we imagine in our head real contact

50
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,760
and if you really want to blow your mind

51
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,340
and watch the chemistry videos if you want to understand this

52
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,830
is that most of this atoms are actually free space themselves

53
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,860
as the electron cloud is huge relative or I guess where most

54
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,120
of the probability of finding the electrons is huge compared to the size of the

55
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,730
electron or the size of the nucleus. So it's kind of just a lot of free space pushing on

56
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,760
lot of other free space through the electromagnetic force

57
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,920
But anyway we are talking about friction here

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,260
So if you would really zoom in here when this thing is stationary

59
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,380
you have the surfaces aren't actually

60
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,080
even and so you can imagine this molecules that you have sometimes when they sitting

61
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,850
stationary, they might be kind of fit in to each other

62
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,940
they kind of slit into these little ruts over there

63
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,340
and so if you are trying to move this object, if you trying to accelerate it to the

64
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,010
left with some force, you have to overcome essentially either

65
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,680
for example this part right over here either has to somehow break off

66
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,800
or the whole things to be shifted up a couple of atoms or a couple of molecules

67
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,410
or may be this part over here has to be broken off or has to be shifted down one atom

68
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,740
You wouldn't notice these things

69
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,850
we wouldn't notice the shifting of a block; you wouldn't notice it

70
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,990
by the width of a molecule or the diameter of the molecule, but that's essential

71
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,720
what you have to do or you have to rip them off entirely in order to start this thing moving.

72
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,160
Once something's already moving, and this is at least I think about it

73
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,470
a lot of--it doesn't have a chance to settle into these little ruts. So

74
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,670
let me draw something that already moving and I will try to draw a similar surface

75
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:31,540
So I am trying to draw the surface that looks essentially like the one I drew

76
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,010
So maybe it looks like that this is supposed to be the same surface

77
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,440
But once it's moving, it's not sitting in the ruts anymore

78
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,110
The whole thing is moving, so it's kind of sliding across the top

79
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:53,600
So now it looks something like this. I will try my best to draw it

80
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,260
Maybe this is been shifted up a little bit so that it can start slide

81
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,240
you've overcome the static friction

82
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:08,750
So now it is--something draw the same, I am trying to draw the same surface here

83
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,980
so give or take

84
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,690
So now it's moving; it doesn't have a chance to really settle in

85
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,970
It has to kind of bounce along the top

86
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:22,090
So that's the best understanding and so the real force of the friction here

87
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,930
there will be still you know as it's moving along it still might

88
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,470
bounce into little ruts here and there

89
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,620
but you also have any type of chemical

90
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,630
bonds that form between the atoms temporarily that keep breaking and forming

91
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:43,320
in order to keep this thing--if you want to accelerate it

92
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,870
you are going to have to keep breaking these bonds

93
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,730
So that's essentially the force of friction that you are overcoming

94
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,320
Here you might have those same bonds and not only you have those same bonds

95
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:00,780
but you also have to overcome these ruts or these little parts that have a time to settle in

96
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,010
to little looks that you have to overcome even more. So that's the intuition

97
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,310
you know this is actually still an area of research. It's not this cut and dry thing

98
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,970
so fun thing to think about what's happening in the atomic level

99
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,150
but this is the general intuition of why the coefficient of static friction

100
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,570
is higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction
