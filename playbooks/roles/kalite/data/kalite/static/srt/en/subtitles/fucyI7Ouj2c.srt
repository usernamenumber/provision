1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,460
Let me draw a good
old PV diagram.

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,510
That's my pressure axis,
this is my volume axis.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,360
Just like that, I have
pressure and volume.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,650
I showed several videos ago that
if we start at some state

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,560
here in the PV diagram, right
there, and that I change the

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,090
pressure and the volume to get
to another state, and I do it

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,770
in a quasistatic way, so
essentially I'm always close

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,170
to equilibrium, so my state
variables are always defined,

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,640
I could have some path that
takes me to some other state

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,950
right there.

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,600
And this is my path.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,020
I'm going from this state
to that state.

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,230
And we showed that if I just did
this, the work done by the

15
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,460
system is the area
under this curve.

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,730
And then if I were to move back
to the previous state,

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,480
and then if I were, you know, by
some path, just some random

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,830
path that I happened to be
drawing, the work done to the

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,600
system would be the area under
this light blue curve.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,860
So the net work done by the
system ended up being the area

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,090
inside of this path.

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,850
So this is-- let me do it
in different color.

23
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,700
The net work done would be the
area inside of this path when

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,390
I go in this clockwise
type of direction.

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:26,770
So this is the net work
done by the system.

26
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:33,360
And now, we also know that if
we're at some point on this PV

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,260
diagram, that our state is the
same as it was before.

28
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,150
So if we go all the way here,
and then go all the way back,

29
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,300
all of our state variables
will not have changed.

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,580
Our pressure is the same
as it was before.

31
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,430
Our volume was the same as it
was before because we went all

32
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,880
the way back to that same
point on the PV diagram.

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,660
And our internal energy is also
the same point as it was

34
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,130
before, so our change in
internal energy over this

35
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,290
path, you're going to have a
different internal energy here

36
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,350
than you had here, but when you
go around the circle and

37
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,840
you get back, your change
in internal

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,420
energy is equal to zero.

39
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,865
And we know that our change in
internal energy is defined as,

40
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:11,450
and this is from the first law
of thermodynamics, the heat

41
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:18,250
added to the system minus the
work done by the system.

42
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,650
Now, if we go on a closed loop
on our PV diagram, then what's

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,810
our change in internal energy?

44
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,970
It's zero.

45
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,150
So we get zero change in
internal energy, because we're

46
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,330
at the same state is equal to
the heat applied to the system

47
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,930
minus the work done or-- and
I've done this little exercise

48
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,810
multiple times.

49
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,020
I think is probably the fourth
or fifth time I'm doing it.

50
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,970
We get that the heat added to
the system, if we just add w

51
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,170
to both sides, is equal to the
work done by the system.

52
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,430
So this area inside of this
path, I already said, it's the

53
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,360
work done by the system, and
if you don't remember even

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,310
where that came from, it was,
remember, pressure times

55
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,155
volume times change in volume is
a little incremental change

56
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:02,800
in work, and that's why it
relates to the area.

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,070
But we've done that
multiple times.

58
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,180
I won't go there just yet.

59
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,150
So if you have any area here,
some heat was added to the

60
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,360
system, some net heat, right?

61
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,380
Some heat was added here, and
some heat was probably taken

62
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,780
out here, but you have
some net heat that's

63
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,260
added to the system.

64
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:24,330
And I use that argument
to say why heat isn't

65
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,410
a good state variable.

66
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,410
Because-- and I had a whole
video on this-- that if I

67
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:33,350
define some state variable,
let's just say, heat content.

68
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,200
Let's say I want to
define some state

69
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,900
variable heat content.

70
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,990
And I would say that the change
in heat content would,

71
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,350
of course, be equal to
the change in heat.

72
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,100
That's what I'm defining.

73
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,970
If I'm adding heat to
the system, my heat

74
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,550
content should go up.

75
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,230
But the problem with that heat
content state variable was

76
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,630
that, let's say over here, I say
that the heat content is

77
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,270
equal to 5.

78
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,560
Now, I just showed you that if
we go on some path here and we

79
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,280
come back, and there's some area
in this little path that

80
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,700
I took, that some
heat was added.

81
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,490
So let's say that this area
right here, so this is q is

82
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,439
equal to the work done by
the system, let's say

83
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,200
it's equal to 2.

84
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,470
So every time, if I start at
heat content is equal to 5,

85
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,850
that's just an arbitrary number,
and I were to do this

86
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,720
entire path, when I go back,
the heat content

87
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,930
would have to be 7.

88
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,030
And then when I go back and do
it again, my heat content

89
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,250
would have to be 9.

90
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,150
And it would have to increment
by 2 every time I do this

91
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,860
exact path.

92
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,590
It would have to increment by
the amount of area that this

93
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,390
path goes around.

94
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,420
So heat content can't be a state
variable, because it's

95
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,180
dependent on how
you got there.

96
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,170
A state variable-- and
remember this.

97
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,750
In order to be a state variable,
if you're at this

98
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,340
point, you have to have
the same value.

99
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,190
If your internal energy was 10
here, when you do the path and

100
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,630
you come back, your internal
energy will be 10 again.

101
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,380
That's why internal energy is
a valid state variable.

102
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,520
It's dependent only
on your state.

103
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,010
If your entropy was 50 here,
when you soon. go back and you

104
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,890
do all sorts of crazy things,
and you come back to this

105
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,040
point, your entropy
is once again 50.

106
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,030
If your pressure here is 5
atmospheres, when you come

107
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,170
back here, your pressure
will be 5 atmospheres.

108
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,060
Your state variable cannot
change based on

109
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,050
what path you took.

110
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,420
If you're at a certain state,
that's all that matters to the

111
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,030
state variable.

112
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,090
Now this heat content didn't
work, and that's why we

113
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,590
actually led into some videos
where I divided by t and we

114
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,260
got entropy, which was an
interesting variation.

115
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,790
But that's still
not satisfying.

116
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,950
What if we really wanted to
develop something that could

117
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,670
in some way be a state variable,
but at the same time

118
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,020
measure heat?

119
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,090
So obviously, we're going to
have to make some compromises,

120
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,170
because if we just do a very
arbitrary kind of heat content

121
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,440
variable, then every time
you go around this,

122
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
it's going to change.

123
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,370
That's not a valid
state variable.

124
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,780
So let's see if we
can make up one.

125
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,950
So let's just make
up a definition.

126
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,930
Let's call my new thing that
I'm going to try to maybe

127
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,350
approximate heat, let's call it
h, and just as a little bit

128
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,870
of a preview, we're going
to call it enthalpy.

129
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,830
   

130
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,980
And let's just define it.

131
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,730
I'm just playing around.

132
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,430
Let's just define it as the
internal energy plus my

133
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,883
pressure times my volume.

134
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:20,880
   

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,620
So then what would my change
in enthalpy be?

136
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,660
So my change in enthalpy will
be, of course, the change of

137
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,340
these things.

138
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,520
But I could just say, that's
my change in my internal

139
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,130
energy plus my change in
pressure times volume.

140
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,300
Now, this is interesting.

141
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,840
And I want to make
a point here.

142
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,230
This, by definition, is a
valid state variable.

143
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,220
Why is it?

144
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,320
Because it's the addition of
other state variables, right?

145
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,870
At any point in my PV diagram,
and it's also true if I did

146
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,030
diagrams that were entropy in
temperature or anything that

147
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,220
dealt with state variables, at
any point on my diagram, u is

148
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,800
going to be the same, no matter
how I got there. p is

149
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,200
by definition going
to be the same.

150
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,540
That's why it's at that point.

151
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,510
v is definitely going to
be the same point.

152
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,940
So if I just add them up, this
is a valid state variable

153
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,480
because it's just the
sum of a bunch of

154
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,595
other valid state variables.

155
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:17,780
So let's see if we can somehow
relate this thing that we've

156
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,930
already established as a
valid state variable.

157
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,550
From the get-go, from our
definition, this works because

158
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,470
it's just the sum of

159
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,030
completely valid state variables.

160
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,820
So let's see if we can relate
this somehow to heat.

161
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,320
So we know what delta u is.

162
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,070
   

163
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,790
If we're dealing with all of
the internal energy or the

164
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,810
change in internal energy, and
I'm not going to deal with all

165
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,590
the other chemical potentials
and all of that, it's equal to

166
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:48,770
the heat applied to the system
minus the work done by the

167
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,040
system, right?

168
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,380
Let me put everything
else there.

169
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,480
The change in enthalpy is equal
to the heat applied

170
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,740
minus the work done-- that's
just the change in internal

171
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,520
energy-- plus delta PV.

172
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,910
This is just from the definition
of my enthalpy.

173
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,090
Now this is starting to
look interesting.

174
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,570
What's the work done
by a system?

175
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,020
So I could write change in h,
or enthalpy, is equal to the

176
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,140
heat applied to the system
minus-- what's the work done

177
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,740
by a system?

178
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,280
If I have some system here, it's
got some piston on it,

179
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,450
you know, if we're doing it in
a quasistatic, I have those

180
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,310
classic pebbles that
I've talked

181
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,450
about in multiple videos.

182
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:36,220
When I apply heat or let's say
I remove some of these

183
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,340
pebbles, so I'm at a different
equilibrium, but what's

184
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,150
actually happening?

185
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,200
When is the work being done?

186
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,030
You have some pressure being
applied up here, and this

187
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,370
piston is going to be moving up,
and your volume is going

188
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:48,880
to increase.

189
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,710
And we showed multiple videos
ago that the work done by the

190
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,160
system can be, and you can
kind of view this as the

191
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:01,560
volume expansion work, it's
equal to pressure

192
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,975
times change in volume.

193
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,600
   

194
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,180
And let's add the other part.

195
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,475
So this was our change
in internal energy.

196
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:12,110
And I had several videos
where I show this.

197
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,750
And now let me add the other
part of the equation.

198
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,690
So our enthalpy, our change
in enthalpy, can

199
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,390
be defined by this.

200
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:17,570
Now.

201
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,780
Something interesting
is going on.

202
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,780
I said that I wanted to define
something, because I wanted to

203
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,000
somehow measure heat content.

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,270
My change in enthalpy will be
equal to the heat added to the

205
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,940
system, if these last two
terms cancel out.

206
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,510
If I can somehow get these last
two terms to cancel out,

207
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,160
then my change in enthalpy
will be equal to this, if

208
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,360
somehow these are equal
to each other.

209
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,800
So under what conditions are
these equal to each other?

210
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,060
Or another way, under what
conditions is delta pressure

211
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,010
times volume equal to pressure
times delta volume?

212
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,360
When does this happen?

213
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,560
When can I make this
statement?

214
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,670
Because if I can make this
statement, then these two

215
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,285
terms are equivalent right here,
and then you my change

216
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:07,580
in enthalpy will be equal
to the heat added.

217
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,790
Well, the only way I can make
this statement is if pressure

218
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,040
is constant.

219
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:20,280
   

220
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,100
Now why is that?

221
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,040
Let's just think about
it mathematically.

222
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,740
If this is a constant, then if
I just change-- you know, if

223
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,130
this is just 5, 5 times a change
in something is the

224
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,930
same thing as the change in 5
times that thing, so it just

225
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,360
mathematically works out.

226
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,830
Or if you view it another way,
if this is a constant, you can

227
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,660
just factor it out, right?

228
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:54,050
Well, if I said, the change in
5x, that would be equal to 5

229
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,900
times x final minus
5 times x initial.

230
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,740
And you could say, well, that's
just equal to 5 times x

231
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,950
final minus x initial.

232
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,710
Well, that's just equal to
5 times the change in x.

233
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,180
It's kind of almost too obvious
for me to explain.

234
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,270
I think sometimes when you
overexplain things, it might

235
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,480
become more confusing.

236
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,050
So this applies-- and the 5 I'm
just doing as the analogy

237
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,810
for a constant.

238
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,830
So if pressure is constant, then
this equation is true.

239
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:26,690
So if pressure is constant-- so
this is a key assumption--

240
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,700
then if heat is being applied
in a constant pressure

241
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,410
system-- so we could
write it this way.

242
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,780
I'll write it multiple times,
because this is key.

243
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:45,450
If pressure is constant, then
our definition, our little

244
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,330
thing we made up, this enthalpy
thing, which we

245
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:52,900
defined as internal energy plus
pressure and volume, then

246
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,070
in a constant pressure system,
our change in enthalpy we just

247
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:01,320
showed is equal to the heat
added to the system because

248
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,390
all of these two things become
equivalent under constant

249
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,360
pressure, so I should
write that.

250
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,270
This is only true when
heat is added in a

251
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,220
constant pressure system.

252
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,325
So how does this gel
with what we did up

253
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:13,270
here on our PV diagram?

254
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,990
What's happening in a constant
pressure system?

255
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,780
Let me draw our PV diagram.

256
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,920
That's P, that's V.

257
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,350
   

258
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,210
So what's happening in
constant pressure?

259
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,440
We're at some pressure
right there.

260
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,160
So if we're under constant
pressure, that means we can

261
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,900
only move along this line.

262
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,395
So we could go from here to
there and back to there, or we

263
00:12:39,395 --> 00:12:41,160
could go from there to
there, back to there.

264
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,280
So we could go there, all the
way there, and then go back.

265
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,040
But what do we see about this?

266
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,850
Is there any area
in this curve?

267
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,540
I mean, there is no curve to
speak of, because we're

268
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,680
staying in a constant
pressure.

269
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,000
We've kind of squeezed
out this diagram.

270
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,170
We've made the forward path and
the return path the same

271
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,590
exact path.

272
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,420
So because of this, you don't
have that state problem

273
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,490
because no net heat is being
added to the system when you

274
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,710
go from this point all the way
to this point and then back to

275
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,790
this point.

276
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,840
So because of that, you can
kind of see visually that

277
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,090
enthalpy in a constant pressure,
when you're not

278
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,540
moving up and down in pressure,
is the same thing as

279
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,400
heat added.

280
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,780
So you might say, hey Sal,
this was a bit of a

281
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,610
compromise, constant pressure,
you know, that's a big

282
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,490
assumption to make.

283
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,370
Why is this useful at all?

284
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,530
Well, it's useful, because
most chemical reactions,

285
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,530
especially ones that occur in an
open beaker, or that might

286
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,755
occur at sea level, and that
should be a big clue, they

287
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,250
occur at constant pressure.

288
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,070
You know, if I'm sitting at
the beach, and I have my

289
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,290
chemistry set, and I have some
beaker of something, and I'm

290
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,790
throwing other stuff into it,
and I'm looking for a reaction

291
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,450
or something, it's a constant
pressure system.

292
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,070
This is going to be atmospheric
pressure.

293
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,830
1 atmosphere.

294
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,310
I'm sitting at sea level.

295
00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:00,110
So this is actually a very
useful concept for everyday

296
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,910
chemical expressions.

297
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,980
It might not be so useful for
engines, because engines

298
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,710
always have pressure changing,
but it's very useful for

299
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,130
actual chemistry, for actually
dealing with what's going to

300
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,910
happen to a reaction at
a constant pressure.

301
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,520
So what we're going to see is
that this enthalpy, you can

302
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,960
kind of view it as
the heat content

303
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,450
when pressure is constant.

304
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,080
In fact, it is the heat content

305
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,200
when pressure is constant.

306
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,960
So somehow-- well, not somehow,
I showed you how-- we

307
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,930
were able to make this
definition, which by

308
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,350
definition was a state variable,
because it was the

309
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,710
sum of other state variables,
and if we just make that one

310
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,270
assumption of constant pressure,
it all of a sudden

311
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,420
reduces to the heat content
of that system.

312
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,290
So we'll talk more in the future
of measuring enthalpy,

313
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,310
but you just have to say, if
pressure is constant, enthalpy

314
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,280
is the same thing as-- and it's
really only useful when

315
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,380
we're dealing with a
constant pressure.

316
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,340
But if we have a pressure
constant, enthalpy can be

317
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,655
imagined as heat content.

318
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,900
And it's very useful for
understanding whether chemical

319
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,980
reactions need heat to occur or
whether they release heat,

320
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,200
so on and so forth.

321
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,450
