1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
   

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,150
Here's the second problem
from CK12.org's AP

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,390
statistics FlexBook.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,570
It's an open source
textbook, essentially.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,310
I'm using it essentially to
get some practice on some

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,330
statistics problems.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,770
So here, number 2.

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,070
The grades on a statistics
midterm for a high school are

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,420
normally distributed with a
mean of 81 and a standard

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,370
deviation of 6.3.

11
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,220
All right.

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,520
Calculate the z-scores for each
of the following exam grades.

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,480
Draw and label a sketch
for each example.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,300
We can probably do it all
on the same example.

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,310
But the first thing we'd
have to do is just remember

16
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,750
what is a z-score.

17
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,110
What is a z-score?

18
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,120
A z-score is literally just
measuring how many standard

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,265
deviations away from the mean?

20
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:55,940
   

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,670
Just like that.

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,260
So we literally just have to
calculate how many standard

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,040
deviations each of these guys
are from the mean, and

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,270
that's their z-scores.

25
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,280
So let me do part a.

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,210
So we have 65.

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,570
So first we can just figure out
how far is 65 from the mean.

28
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,980
Let me just draw one chart
here that we can use

29
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,900
the entire time.

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,135
So it's just our distribution.

31
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:20,030
Let's see.

32
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,050
We have a mean of 81.

33
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,050
   

34
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,030
That's our mean.

35
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,940
And then a standard
deviation of 6.3.

36
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,550
So our distribution, they're
telling us that it's

37
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,630
normally distributed.

38
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,670
So I can draw a nice
bell curve here.

39
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,630
They're saying it's normally
distributed, so that's as

40
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,500
good of a bell curve as
I'm capable of drawing.

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,060
This is the mean
right there at 81.

42
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,700
And the standard
deviation is 6.3.

43
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,140
So one standard deviation above
and below is going to be

44
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,950
6.3 away from that mean.

45
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,400
So if we go 6.3 in the positive
direction, that value right

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,620
there is going to be 87.3.

47
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,680
If we go 6.3 in the
negative direction,

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,140
where does that get us?

49
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,970
What, 74.7?

50
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,190
Right, if we add 6, it'll
get us to 80.7, and then

51
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,680
0.3 will get us to 81.

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,920
So that's one standard
deviation below and above the

53
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,560
mean, and then you'd add
another 6.3 to go 2 standard

54
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,590
deviations, so on and so forth.

55
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,890
So that's a drawing of
the distribution itself.

56
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,640
So let's figure out
the z-scores for each

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,110
of these grades.

58
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,400
65 is how far?

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,760
65 is maybe going to
be here someplace.

60
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,430
So we first want to say,
well how far is it

61
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,680
just from our mean?

62
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,140
So the distance is, you just
want to positive number here.

63
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,050
Well actually, you want
a negative number.

64
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,560
Because you want your z-score
to be positive or negative.

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,170
Negative would mean to the left
of the mean and positive would

66
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,090
mean to the right of the mean.

67
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,690
So we say 65 minus 81.

68
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,000
So that's literally
how far away we are.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,750
But we want that in terms
of standard deviations.

70
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,120
So we divide that by the length
or the magnitude of our

71
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,290
standard deviation.

72
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,290
So 65 minus 81.

73
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,260
Let's see, 81 minus 65 is what?

74
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,480
It is 5 plus 11.

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,230
It's 16.

76
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,065
So this is going to be
minus 16 over 6.3.

77
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:28,900
We'll take our calculator out.

78
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:37,060
And let's see, if we have
minus 16 divided by 6.3,

79
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,980
you get minus 2 point--
oh, it's like 54.

80
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,940
Approximately equal
to minus 2.54.

81
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,010
That's the z-score
for a grade of 65.

82
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,840
Pretty straightforward.

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,120
Let's do a couple more.

84
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,340
Let's do all of them.

85
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,940
83.

86
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,520
So how is it away
from the mean?

87
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,040
Well, it's 83 minus 81.

88
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,220
It's two grades above the mean.

89
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,320
But we want it in terms
of standard deviations.

90
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,960
How many standard deviations.

91
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
So this was part A.

92
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,310
A was right here.

93
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,300
We were 2.5 standard
deviations below the mean.

94
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,120
So this is part A.

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,650
1, 2, and then 0.5.

96
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,830
So this was A right there, 65.

97
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,770
And then part B, 83, 83 is
going to be right here.

98
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,560
A little bit higher,
but right here.

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,610
And the z-score here, 83 minus
81 divided by 6.3 will get us--

100
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,340
let's see, clear
the calculator.

101
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,420
So we have 83 minus 81
is 2 divided by 6.3.

102
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,280
It's 0.32, roughly.

103
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,770
So here we get 0.32.

104
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,520
So 83 is 0.32 standard
deviations above the mean.

105
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,860
And so it would be roughly 1/3
third of the standard deviation

106
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,685
along the way, right?

107
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:57,710
Because this as one whole
standard deviation.

108
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,260
So we're 0.3 of a standard
deviation above the mean.

109
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,900
Choice number C.

110
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,910
Or not choice, part C, I
guess I should call it.

111
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,350
93.

112
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,750
Well, we do the same exercise.

113
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,670
93 is how much above the mean?

114
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,735
Well, it's 93 minus 81 is 12.

115
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:19,170
But we want it in terms
of standard deviations.

116
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,090
So 12 is how many standard
deviations above the mean?

117
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,230
Well, it's going
to be almost 2.

118
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,680
Let's take the calculator out.

119
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,680
So we get 12 divided by 6.3.

120
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,790
It's 1.9 standard deviations.

121
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,510
Its z-score is 1.9.

122
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,020
Which means it's 1.9 standard
deviations above the mean.

123
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,660
So the mean is 81, we go one
whole standard deviation, and

124
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,900
then 0.9 standard deviations,
and that's where a score of

125
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,840
93 would lie, right there.

126
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,450
Its z-score is 1.9.

127
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,450
And all that means is
1.9 standard deviations

128
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,170
above the mean.

129
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,800
Let's do the last one.

130
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,990
I'll do it in magenta.

131
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,670
D, part D.

132
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,700
A score of 100.

133
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,470
We don't even need
the problem anymore.

134
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,220
A score of 100.

135
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,920
Well, same thing.

136
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,190
We figure out how far is 100
above the mean-- remember, the

137
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,200
mean was 81-- and we divide
that by the length or the size

138
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,260
or the magnitude of our
standard deviation.

139
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,600
So 100 minus 81 is
equal to 19 over 6.3.

140
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,140
So it's going to be a little
over 3 standard deviations.

141
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,200
And in the next problem we'll
see what does that imply in

142
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,940
terms of the probability of
that actually occurring.

143
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,750
But if we just want to figure
out the z-score, 19 divided

144
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,670
by 6.3 is equal to 3.01.

145
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,290
So it's very close.

146
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,690
3.02, really, if
I were to round.

147
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,040
So it's very close to 3.02.

148
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,500
Its z-score is 3.02, or a grade
of 100 is 3.02 standard

149
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,830
deviations above the mean.

150
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,800
So remember, this was the
mean right here at 81.

151
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,870
We go 1 standard deviation
above the mean, 2 standard

152
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,030
deviations above the mean, the
third standard deviation above

153
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,030
the mean is right there.

154
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,980
So we're sitting right
there on our chart.

155
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,980
A little bit above that, 3.02
standard deviations above

156
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,860
the mean, that's where
a score of 100 will be.

157
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,560
And you can see the
probability, the height of

158
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,390
this-- that's what the chart
tells us-- it's actually a

159
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,500
very low probability.

160
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,830
Actually, not just a very
low probability of getting

161
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,000
something higher than that.

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,460
Because as we learned before,
in a probably density function,

163
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,730
if this is a continuous, not a
discreet, the probability of

164
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,650
getting exactly that is 0,
if this wasn't discrete.

165
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,050
But since this is scores
on a test, we know that

166
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,010
it's actually a discrete
probability function.

167
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,850
But the probability is low of
getting higher than that,

168
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,760
because you can see where
we sit on the bell curve.

169
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,300
Well anyway, hopefully this at
least clarified how to solve

170
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,635
for z-scores, which is pretty
straightforward mathematically.

171
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:44,440
And in the next video,
we'll interpret z-scores

172
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,190
and probabilities
a little bit more.
