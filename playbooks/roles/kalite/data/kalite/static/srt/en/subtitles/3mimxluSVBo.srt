1
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,482
so lets define some variables here

2
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:22,221
so lets let a=abby's earnings and

3
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:35,364
lets let b=ben's earnings

4
00:00:35,364 --> 00:00:38,383
than they tell us how these earnings relate they first

5
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:44,141
tell us that together they earned 50$ so that statement can be

6
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:47,717
converted mathamaticly into, well together that means

7
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:53,568
the sum of the 2 eannings so a+b needs to be equal to $50

8
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:57,144
abby's+ben's earnings equals $50

9
00:00:57,144 --> 00:01:02,671
and then the tell us abby earned 10 dollars more than ben

10
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:05,643
so we can translate that into abby is equal to

11
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:09,915
or abby's earning is equal to ben's earnings plus 10

12
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:13,166
abby earned 10 dollars than ben

13
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,092
so we have a system of 2 equations

14
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:17,671
and accualy 2 unknowns and then they say

15
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:21,247
how much did each earn so to do that

16
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,476
and they want us to solve this graph

17
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:25,240
so there are multiple ways to do it but

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,562
we will do what they want us to do.

19
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:29,606
Let me draw some axis over here

20
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:31,835
and it'll be in the first quadrant

21
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:33,553
scince we are dealing with earnings.

22
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:35,504
niether of the earn earnings can be negative

23
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:37,408
and let me just define the vertical axis

24
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:40,380
as abby's axisor the abby's earnings axis.

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,442
and let me define the horizontal axis as Ben's axis or Ben's

26
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:48,785
earnings axis.And let me just graph each of these equations

27
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:52,315
and to do that i'm going to take this first equation

28
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:55,659
and im going to put it in the equivalent of
