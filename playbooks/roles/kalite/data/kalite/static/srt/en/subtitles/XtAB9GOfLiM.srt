1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,420
Let's figure out how long this
object is going to be in the

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,590
air given that its vertical
velocity, or the magnitude of

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,370
the vertical velocity
is s sine of theta.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,540
So its speed in the vertical
direction is s sine of theta.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,440
So how long is it going
to be in the air?

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,620
Well if I told you that
something is going upwards at

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,030
10 meters per second and gravity
is decelerating it at

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,160
10 meters per second squared.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,420
So every second it's going to
slow it down by 10 meters per

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,240
second, how long will it take
for that object to get to 0,

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,020
to stop moving?

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,810
Let me write that down.

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,460
Let's say that some object is
moving upwards at 10 meters

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,780
per second.

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,196
And let's say that the gravity
is slowing it down.

17
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:52,500
   

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:01,320
Slowing it down at 10
meters per second.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,540
So every second that goes by,
it'll slow this thing down by

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,130
10 meters per second.

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,820
Well, it'll take it exactly 1
second to make it go from 10

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,620
meters per second to 0
meters per second.

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,840
And then it's going to be at
some height in the air, and

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,320
then the thing's going to
start accelerating.

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,640
Gravity is going to start
accelerating it downward.

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,690
And then it'll take another
second for it to go from 0--

27
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,170
from having no velocity,
to having 10

28
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,610
meters per second again.

29
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,760
So in this case, it'll take the
time in the air-- we could

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,960
say time sub air, I guess, is
going to be equal to this 10

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,650
meters per second,
your velocity.

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,530
10 meters per second divided
by the acceleration.

33
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,250
Divided by this 10 meters
per second.

34
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,140
10 meters per second times 2.

35
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,880
This is how long it'll take for
the object to go from 10

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,610
meters per second to 0 at
some point in the air.

37
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,050
And then it's going to take the
exact same amount of time

38
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,910
for it to fall back
to the ground.

39
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,340
So times 2.

40
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,350
If the object was moving upwards
at 20 meters per

41
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,080
second and gravity is still
slowing it down at 10 meters

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,330
per second per second, then it's
going to take 2 seconds.

43
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,610
If this was 20, then
this would be 20.

44
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,950
And it'll take 2 seconds to slow
it down to 0 and then 2

45
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,670
more seconds until it hits
the ground again.

46
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,560
For it to speed back up as
it approaches the ground.

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,660
So no matter what your upward
velocity, the time in the air

48
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,550
is going to be your speed, your
vertical speed, divided

49
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,690
by the acceleration
of gravity.

50
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,820
And this is the amount of time
it's going to take you to go

51
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,660
from this point to that point.

52
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,000
To have some vertical velocity
and then slow down to 0.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,960
And it's going to take the exact
same amount of time for

54
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,400
you to speed back up by gravity
and get to your

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,200
original speed.

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,730
We're assuming no
air resistance.

57
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,520
So it's kind of a
pure problem.

58
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,860
So this is the time up, the time
down is going to be the

59
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,350
same thing.

60
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,900
So we can multiply that by 2.

61
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,850
Now, we already know what the
vertical component for our

62
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,710
problem is.

63
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,960
It is s sine of theta.

64
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,240
So we could just substitute
that back in there.

65
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,260
And we know how long we're
going to be in the air.

66
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,040
The time in the air is going to
be our speed-- or I should

67
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,130
maybe put the 2 out front.

68
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,665
2 times s sine theta.

69
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:26,810
   

70
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,080
Let me make it clear.

71
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,730
This 2 right here is
this 2 right there.

72
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,550
All of that over the
acceleration of gravity.

73
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,520
So if you told me that I'm
shooting this object off at--

74
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,710
I don't know-- 100 meters
per second.

75
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:48,660
So if this is 100 meters per
second and if theta were-- I

76
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,390
don't know-- let's say theta
were 30 degrees, then sine of

77
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,550
theta would be 1/2.

78
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,120
So it'd be 100 meters per second
times 1/2 divided by

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,960
the acceleration of gravity
times 2 would tell you exactly

80
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,500
how long you would
be in the air.

81
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,420
How long it takes to go up all
the way, become stationery,

82
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,530
and then fall back down
to the ground.

83
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,534
