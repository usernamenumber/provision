1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
We're on problem 226

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,190
In the figure above-- let me draw the figure above

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,550
So I have a line there

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,020
then I have another line that's like that

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,230
and then this is a triangle like that, and then

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,430
they draw another line that goes straight down like that

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,730
And they call this right here z degrees, this is y degrees

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,580
this is x degrees

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,460
They tell us that these are right angles

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,310
Fair enough

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,500
In the figure above, if z is equal to 50

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,890
so that is equal to 50 degreeS

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,160
then x plus y is equal to what?

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,090
Well if z is 50-- well, first of all

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,560
we know since these are both right angles

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,460
both of these lines are going to be parallel, right?

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,570
Both of those lines are parallel

18
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,610
And so you can view this green line as a

19
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,280
transversal of the parallel

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,250
And so, z and y are corresponding angles

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,750
so y is also going to be 50

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,040
That should make a little intuitive sense

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,510
but you could watch the Khan Academy geometry videos

24
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,470
if that doesn't make sense

25
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,070
But just eyeballing it looks right, too

26
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,040
but that's a property of transversals and parallel lines

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,410
And if that's true, then what is this angle right here?

28
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:22,170
Well, 50 plus 90 plus this angle is equal to 180, right?

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,610
So we could say 50 plus 90 plus theta is equal to 180

30
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,320
So you get 140 plus theta is equal to 180

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,900
Subtract 140 from both sides

32
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,520
so theta is equal to 40 degrees

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,290
So this angle right here is 40 degrees

34
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,350
What's x?

35
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,360
Well, they're supplementary

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,570
They have to add up

37
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,740
They have to add up to be 180, right?

38
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,140
This whole angle's 180

39
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,430
So that whole angle is 180, this is 40

40
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,150
then x has to be 140 degrees

41
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,500
So they wanted to know what x plus y is?

42
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,280
Well x is 140, y is 50, so 140 plus 50 is 190 degrees

43
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,530
And that is not one of the choices

44
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,090
So I must have -- oh, I see my mistake

45
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,490
This angle right here

46
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,970
actually, we're still completely fine

47
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,710
This angle right here isn't y

48
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,760
This angle right here is y

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,950
But everything we did so far still holds

50
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,640
If this angle is 50, this angle is still 50

51
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,800
since it's a corresponding angle, right?

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,540
And if that's 50, this is 90, then this is 40, x is 140

53
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,200
Now we just have to figure out what y is

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,660
Well, y is supplementary with this angle right here, right?

55
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,650
So y plus this angle that I used to think was y

56
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,340
until I looked closely at the drawing

57
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,270
y plus 50 has to be equal to 180 degrees, right?

58
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,210
Because it's complementary with this 50 degree angle

59
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,630
So y is equal to 130

60
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,740
So x plus y is equal to 140 plus 130

61
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:08,640
which is equal to 270 degrees, and that's choice D

62
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,120
Problem 227

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,440
Looks like they've drawn another coordinate axis

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,330
which I'll draw

65
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,930
Nope, that's not what I want to draw with

66
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,040
I'll draw with that

67
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,620
OK, and then they have a line that comes down

68
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,450
something like that

69
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,190
And they mark it off

70
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,360
They say that this is-- let me see how they mark it off

71
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,440
They say that this is the point 1, this is the point 2

72
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,730
They don't write the 2 there

73
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,880
They call this line l

74
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,750
This is the origin

75
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,690
This is the x-axis and that is the y-axis

76
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,790
And they say in the coordinate system above

77
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,230
which of the following is the equation of line l?

78
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,570
Well, if we just eyeball it--

79
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,750
I mean, they don't say it explicitly

80
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,410
but it looks like this is intersecting at y is equal to 2

81
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,840
and this is intersecting at y is equal to 3

82
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,590
I guess that's a safe assumption

83
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,570
So how do we set up this equation?

84
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,650
Well, you just have to figure out the slope of the

85
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,540
y-intercept

86
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,390
We already know the y-intercept, right?

87
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,230
It intersects-- when x is 0-- so y of 0

88
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,010
When x is 0, y is equal to 2, so that's the y-intercept

89
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,430
and now we just have to figure out the slope

90
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,370
Well, let's think about the slope

91
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,650
If we take this point--

92
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,230
well, I'll do it the formal way, right?

93
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,820
The slope is equal to change in y over change in x

94
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,090
So let's take this as the end point

95
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,480
This is 3 comma 0, [PHONE RINGS]

96
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,070
and let's see who's on the phone

97
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,560
If it's someone-- oh, I'll take that call

98
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll continue this in the next video
