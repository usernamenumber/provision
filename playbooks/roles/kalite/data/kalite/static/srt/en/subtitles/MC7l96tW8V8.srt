1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,430
   

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,385
Let's say I have
some matrix A.

3
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:05,500
Let's say it's an n-by-k
matrix, and I have the

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,450
equation Ax is equal to b.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:17,540
So in this case, x would have to
be a member of Rk, because

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,960
we have k columns here, and
b is a member of Rn.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,680
Now, let's say that it just so
happens that there is no

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:35,460
solution to Ax is equal to b.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,100
What does that mean?

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,730
Let's just expand out A.

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,200
I think you already know
what that means.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,210
If I write a like this, a1, a2,
if I just write it as its

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,250
columns vectors right there,
all the way through ak, and

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,750
then I multiply it times x1,
x2, all the way through xk,

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,690
this is the same thing as
that equation there.

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,760
I just kind of wrote out
the two matrices.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,650
Now, this is the same thing as
x1 times a1 plus x2 times a2,

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:13,870
all the way to plus xk times ak
is equal to the vector b.

19
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,330
Now, if this has no solution,
then that means that there's

20
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:23,430
no set of weights here on the
column vectors of a, where we

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,060
can get to b.

22
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,560
Or another way to say it is, no
linear combinations of the

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,500
column vectors of a will
be equal to b.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:39,290
Or an even further way of saying
it is that b is not in

25
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,880
the column space of a.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,720
No linear combination of these
guys can equal to that.

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,000
So let's see if we can
visualize it a bit.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,370
So let me draw the column
space of a.

29
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,460
So maybe the column space of
a looks something like this

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,360
right here.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,392
I'll just assume it's
a plane in Rn.

32
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:02,300
It doesn't have to be a plane.

33
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,340
Things can be very general, but
let's say that this is the

34
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,615
column space.

35
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:09,560
This is the column space of a.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,300
Now, if that's the column space
and b is not in the

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,800
column space, maybe we
can draw b like this.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,180
Maybe b, let's say this is the
origin right there, and b just

39
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,250
pops out right there.

40
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,560
So this is the 0 vector.

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,990
This is my vector b, clearly
not in my column spaces,

42
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,070
clearly not in this plane.

43
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,540
Now, up until now, we would
get an equation like that.

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,900
We would make an augmented
matrix, put in reduced row

45
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,990
echelon form, and get a line
that said 0 equals 1, and we'd

46
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,430
say, no solution, nothing
we can do here.

47
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,870
But what if we can do better?

48
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,885
You know, we clearly can't
find a solution to this.

49
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:43,610
But what if we can find
a solution that

50
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,570
gets us close to this?

51
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,030
So what if I want to find some
x, I'll call it x-star for

52
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:58,090
now, where-- so I want to find
some x-star, where A times

53
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:07,340
x-star is-- and this is
a vector-- as close as

54
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:16,560
possible-- let me write this--
as close to b as possible.

55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,450
Or another way to view it, when
I say close, I'm talking

56
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,830
about length, so I want to
minimize the length of-- let

57
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,670
me write this down.

58
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:38,260
I want to minimize the length
of b minus A times x-star.

59
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,940
   

60
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,990
Now, some of you all
might already know

61
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,840
where this is going.

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,130
But when you take the difference
between 2 and then

63
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,250
take its length, what
does that look like?

64
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,172
Let me just call Ax.

65
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:55,820
Ax is going to be a member
of my column space.

66
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,415
Let me just call that v.

67
00:03:57,415 --> 00:04:00,610
Ax is equal to v.

68
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:06,660
You multiply any vector in Rk
times your matrix A, you're

69
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,040
going to get a member of
your column space.

70
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,019
So any Ax is going to be
in your column space.

71
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,850
And maybe that is the vector v
is equal to A times x-star.

72
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,860
And we want this vector to get
as close as possible to this

73
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,890
as long as it stays--
I mean, it has to be

74
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,160
in my column space.

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,020
But we want the distance between
this vector and this

76
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,040
vector to be minimized.

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,470
Now, I just want to show you
where the terminology for this

78
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,370
will come from.

79
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,510
I haven't given it its
proper title yet.

80
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,840
If you were to take this
vector-- let just call this

81
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,980
vector v for simplicity-- that
this is equivalent to the

82
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,240
length of the vector.

83
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,350
You take the difference between
each of the elements.

84
00:04:53,350 --> 00:05:02,980
So b1 minus v1, b2 minus v2,
all the way to bn minus vn.

85
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,650
And if you take the length of
this vector, this is the same

86
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,150
thing as this.

87
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,100
This is going to be equal
to the square root.

88
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,600
Let me take the length
squared, actually.

89
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,690
The length squared of this is
just going to be b1 minus v1

90
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:21,900
squared plus b2 minus v2 squared
plus all the way to bn

91
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,870
minus vn squared.

92
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,500
And I want to minimize this.

93
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,180
So I want to make this value the
least value that it can be

94
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,990
possible, or I want to get the
least squares estimate here.

95
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,550
And that's why, this last minute
or two when I was just

96
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,720
explaining this, that was just
to give you the motivation for

97
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:52,810
why this right here is called
the least squares estimate, or

98
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,180
the least squares solution,
or the least squares

99
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,160
approximation for the equation
Ax equals b.

100
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,200
There is no solution to this,
but maybe we can find some

101
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,140
x-star, where if I multiply A
times x-star, this is clearly

102
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,900
going to be in my column space
and I want to get this vector

103
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,010
to be as close to
b as possible.

104
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,180
Now, we've already seen in
several videos, what is the

105
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,090
closest vector in any
subspace to a vector

106
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,200
that's not in my subspace?

107
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,940
Well, the closest vector to
it is the projection.

108
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,120
The closest vector to b, that's
in my subspace, is

109
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,540
going to be the projection of
b onto my column space.

110
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,940
That is the closest
vector there.

111
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:47,530
So if I want to minimize this,
I want to figure out my

112
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:57,380
x-star, where Ax-star is equal
to the projection of my vector

113
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,460
b onto my subspace or onto
the column space of A.

114
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,780
Remember what we're
doing here.

115
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,010
We said Axb has no solution, but
maybe we can find some x

116
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,310
that gets us as close
as possible.

117
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,920
So I'm calling that my least
squares solution or my least

118
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,940
squares approximation.

119
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,340
And this guy right here is
clearly going to be in my

120
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,210
column space, because you take
some vector x times A, that's

121
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,520
going to be a linear combination
of these column

122
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,420
vectors, so it's going to
be in the column space.

123
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,880
And I want this guy to be as
close as possible to this guy.

124
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,900
Well, the closest vector in my
column space to that guy is

125
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,720
the projection.

126
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,840
So Ax needs to be equal
to the projection of b

127
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,440
on my column space.

128
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,890
It needs to be equal to that.

129
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,090
But this is still pretty
hard to find.

130
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,620
You saw how, you know, you took
A times the inverse of A

131
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,160
transpose A times A transpose.

132
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,990
That's hard to find that
transformation matrix.

133
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,110
So let's see if we can find an
easier way to figure out the

134
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,870
least squares solution, or kind
of our best solution.

135
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,470
It's not THE solution.

136
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,900
It's our BEST solution
to this right here.

137
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,290
That's why we call it the least
squares solution or

138
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,070
approximation.

139
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,130
Let's just subtract b from
both sides of this and we

140
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,230
might get something
interesting.

141
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,390
So what happens if we take Ax
minus the vector b on both

142
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,360
sides of this equation?

143
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,690
I'll do it up here
on the right.

144
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,925
On the left-hand side we
get A times x-star.

145
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:32,720
It's hard write the x and
then the star because

146
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,970
they're very similar.

147
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,460
And we subtract b from it.

148
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,610
We subtract our vector b.

149
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:46,020
That's going to be equal to the
projection of b onto our

150
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,980
column space minus b.

151
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,210
All I did is I subtracted
b from both

152
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,800
sides of this equation.

153
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,585
Now, what is the projection
of b minus our vector b?

154
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:01,490
If we draw it right here, it's
going to be this vector

155
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,480
right-- let me do it in
this orange color.

156
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,860
It's going to be this
right here.

157
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,410
It's going to be that vector
right there, right?

158
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,910
If I take the projection of b,
which is that, minus b, I'm

159
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,490
going to get this vector. you
we could say b plus this

160
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,350
vector is equal to
my projection

161
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,490
of b onto my subspace.

162
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,880
So this vector right
here is orthogonal.

163
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,580
It's actually part of the
definition of a projection

164
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:34,460
that this guy is going to be
orthogonal to my subspace or

165
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,360
to my column space.

166
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,390
And so this guy is orthogonal
to my column space.

167
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:47,930
So I can write Ax-star minus
b, it's orthogonal to my

168
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,260
column space, or we could
say it's a member of the

169
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,070
orthogonal complement
of my column space.

170
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,660
The orthogonal complement is
just the set of everything,

171
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,240
all of the vectors that are
orthogonal to everything in

172
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,050
your subspace, in your column
space right here.

173
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,990
So this vector right here
that's kind of pointing

174
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,280
straight down onto my plane
is clearly a member of the

175
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,210
orthogonal complement
of my column space.

176
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,730
Now, this might look familiar
to you already.

177
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,670
What is the orthogonal
complement of my column space?

178
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,320
The orthogonal complement of
my column space is equal to

179
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,920
the null space of a transpose,
or the left null space of A.

180
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,330
We've done this in many,
many videos.

181
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:40,240
So we can say that A times my
least squares estimate of the

182
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,860
equation Ax is equal to
b-- I wrote that.

183
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,010
So x-star is my least squares
solution to Ax is equal to b.

184
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:55,010
So A times that minus
b is a member of the

185
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,770
null space of A transpose.

186
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,370
Now, what does that mean?

187
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:05,020
Well, that means that if I
multiply A transpose times

188
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:12,470
this guy right here, times
Ax-star-- and let me, no I

189
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,740
don't want to lose the vector
signs there on the x.

190
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,880
This is a vector.

191
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,420
I don't want to forget that.

192
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,710
Ax-star minus b.

193
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,210
So if I multiply A transpose
times this right there, that

194
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,630
is the same thing is that,
what am I going to get?

195
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,400
Well, this is a member of the
null space of A transpose, so

196
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
this times A transpose has
got to be equal to 0.

197
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,350
It is a solution to A transpose
times something is

198
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,120
equal to the 0 vector.

199
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,440
Now.

200
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,770
Let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

201
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:57,750
We get A transpose A times
x-star minus A transpose b is

202
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,900
equal to 0, and then if we add
this term to both sides of the

203
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:11,180
equation, we are left with A
transpose A times the least

204
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:17,230
squares solution to Ax
equal to b is equal

205
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:23,050
to A transpose b.

206
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,500
That's what we get.

207
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,220
Now, why did we do
all of this work?

208
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,050
Remember what we started with.

209
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:34,180
We said we're trying to find a
solution to Ax is equal to b,

210
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,430
but there was no solution.

211
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,950
   

212
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:46,080
So we said, well, let's find
at least an x-star that

213
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:53,360
minimizes b, that minimizes
the distance

214
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,000
between b and Ax-star.

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,680
And we call this the least
squares solution.

216
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,730
We call it the least squares
solution because, when you

217
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,320
actually take the length, or
when you're minimizing the

218
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,200
length, you're minimizing the
squares of the differences

219
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,890
right there.

220
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,240
So it's the least squares
solution.

221
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,310
Now, to find this, we know
that this has to be the

222
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,710
closest vector in our
subspace to b.

223
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,840
And we know that the closest
vector in our subspace to b is

224
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,040
the projection of b onto our
subspace, onto our column

225
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,720
space of A.

226
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,550
And so, we know that A--
let me switch colors.

227
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:37,070
We know that A times our least
squares solution should be

228
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:45,250
equal to the projection of b
onto the column space of A.

229
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,030
If we can find some x in Rk that
satisfies this, that is

230
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,665
our least squares solution.

231
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:53,820
But we've seen before that
the projection b is

232
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,090
easier said than done.

233
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,660
You know, there's a
lot of work to it.

234
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,390
So maybe we can do
it a simpler way.

235
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,020
And this is our simpler way.

236
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,270
If we're looking for this,
alternately, we can just find

237
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,710
a solution to this equation.

238
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,270
So you give me an Ax equal to
b, there is no solution.

239
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,070
Well, what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to multiply

240
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,230
both sides of this equation
times A transpose.

241
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,440
If I multiply both sides of this
equation by A transpose,

242
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:27,070
I get A transpose times Ax is
equal to A transpose-- and I

243
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,790
want to do that in the same
blue-- A-- no, that's not the

244
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:37,340
same blue-- A transpose b.

245
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,330
All I did is I multiplied
both sides of this.

246
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:45,470
Now, the solution to this
equation will not be the same

247
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,750
as the solution to
this equation.

248
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,380
This right here will always
have a solution, and this

249
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,190
right here is our least
squares solution.

250
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,880
So this right here is our
least squares solution.

251
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,630
And notice, this is some matrix,
and then this right

252
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,760
here is some vector.

253
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,410
This right here is
some vector.

254
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,220
So long as we can find a
solution here, we've given our

255
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,450
best shot at finding a solution
to Ax equal to b.

256
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,990
We've minimized the error.

257
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,440
We're going to get Ax-star,
and the difference between

258
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,420
Ax-star and b is going
to be minimized.

259
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,590
It's going to be our least
squares solution.

260
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,870
It's all a little bit abstract
right now in this video, but

261
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,780
hopefully, in the next video,
we'll realize that it's

262
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,690
actually a very, very
useful concept.
