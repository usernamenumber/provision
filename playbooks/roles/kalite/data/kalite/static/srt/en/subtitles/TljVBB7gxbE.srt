99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Where we left off in the last video, we had somewhat ...

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
simplified our polynomial P of X.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from the way that it was originialy described in the problem.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it still doesn't seem like were any closer to finding

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the roots. At least we were able to reduce the degree from a fourty-seventh degree polynomial to a

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
product of a first degree and a twenty third degree polynomial,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it still doesn't seem like we're any closer to finding the roots, especially the root that matter.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And here we're going to have a little bit of an Ah-ha moment here.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That this part in blue, which is really just a sum of all of the degrees of X from

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
X to the zero all the way to X to the twenty three.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is, if you view the common ratio was X, as a finit geometric series.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And, I have done it in other videos, there is a way to find the sum of a finit geometric series.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we'll use a similar technique right here, to simplify this a little bit, to help us find the roots.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's just call this whole thing S.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
S is equal to X to the 23 plus X to the 22 plus all the way down to X plus 1.
