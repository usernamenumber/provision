1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,370
I want to build on what
we did in the last

3
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,660
video a little bit.

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,110
Let's say we have two
random variables.

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,690
So I have random variable x.

6
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,650
And let me draw its probability
distribution.

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,210
And actually, it doesn't
have to be normal.

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,640
But I'll just draw it as
a normal distribution.

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,300
So this is the distribution
of random variable x.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,710
This is the mean.

11
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,160
The population mean of
random variable x.

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,670
And then it has some type
of standard deviation.

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,850
Actually, let me just focus
on the variance.

14
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:36,960
So it has some variance right
here for random variable x.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,510
This is x, the distribution
for x.

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,430
Let's say we have another
random variable.

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,720
Random variable y.

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,020
Let's do the same
thing for it.

19
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,050
Let's draw its distribution.

20
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,800
   

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,530
And let me draw the parameters
for that distribution.

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,890
So it has some true mean, some
population mean for the random

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,710
variable y.

24
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,570
And it has some variance
right over here.

25
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,489
   

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,940
And I've drawn it
roughly normal.

27
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,610
Once again, we don't have to
assume that it's normal.

28
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,920
Because we're going to assume,
when we go to the next level,

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,080
that when we take the samples,
we're taking enough samples

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,030
that the central limit theorem
will actually apply.

31
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,160
But with that said, let's
think about the sampling

32
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,000
distributions of each of
these random variables.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,900
So let's think about the
sampling distribution of the

34
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,745
sample mean of x.

35
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:38,150
   

36
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,130
Let's say the sample size
over here is going

37
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,550
to be equal to n.

38
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,130
   

39
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,990
So what is that going
to look like?

40
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,410
Well it's going to be
some distribution.

41
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,180
And we're assuming that n is
a fairly large number.

42
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,920
So this is going to be a
normal distribution.

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,856
Or it can be approximated with
a normal distribution.

44
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:02,440
   

45
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,510
Let me shift it over
a little bit.

46
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,180
I'm going to draw it a
little bit narrow.

47
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:14,460
   

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,500
Let me draw the mean.

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,440
So the population mean of the
sampling distribution is going

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,110
to be denoted with this x bar,
that tells us the distribution

51
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,490
of the means when the
sample size is n.

52
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,970
And we know that this is going
to be the same thing as the

53
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,810
population mean for that
random variable.

54
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,660
And we know from the central
limit theorem that the

55
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,870
variance of the sampling
distribution or, often called

56
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,260
the standard error of the mean,
is going to be equal to

57
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:57,070
the population variance
divided by this

58
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,320
n right over here.

59
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,195
   

60
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:05,490
And if you wanted the standard
deviation of this, you just

61
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,300
take the square root
of both sides.

62
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,710
Let's do the same thing
for random variable y.

63
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:18,040
Let's take the sampling
distribution

64
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,040
of the sample mean.

65
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,270
But here, we're talking about
y, random variable y.

66
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,500
And let's just say it has
a different sample size.

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,710
It doesn't have to be
a different one.

68
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,450
But it just shows you that it
doesn't have to be the same.

69
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:37,360
So it has a sample size of m.

70
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,730
Let me draw its distribution
right over here.

71
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,170
Once again, it'll be a narrower
distribution than the

72
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,180
population distribution.

73
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,970
And it will be approximately
normal, assuming that we have

74
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,730
a large enough sample size.

75
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,160
And the mean of the sampling
distribution of the sample

76
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,010
mean is going to be the same
thing as the population mean.

77
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,260
We've seen that multiple
times.

78
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,220
   

79
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:14,620
And its variance for the sample
means, or the standard

80
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,890
error of the mean.

81
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,339
Actually, this isn't
the standard error.

82
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,829
Standard error would be the
square root of this.

83
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,170
So if I called this standard
error of the

84
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:22,820
mean, that's wrong.

85
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,200
The standard error of the mean
is the square root of this.

86
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,310
It's the standard deviation.

87
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,940
This is the variance
of the mean.

88
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,210
Don't want to confuse you.

89
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,080
So the variance of the mean here
is going to be the exact

90
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,590
same thing.

91
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:41,110
It's going to be the variance
of the population divided by

92
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,360
our sample size.

93
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,420
   

94
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,860
And everything we've done so
far is complete review.

95
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,350
It's a little different, because
I'm actually doing it

96
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,030
with two different
random variables.

97
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,720
And I'm doing it with
two different random

98
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,840
variables for a reason.

99
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,640
Because now I'm going to define
a new random variable.

100
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,310
   

101
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,400
We could just call it z.

102
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,450
But z is equal to
the difference

103
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,110
of our sample means.

104
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,520
   

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:25,030
It's equal to the x sample mean
minus the y sample mean.

106
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,240
So what does that really mean?

107
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,090
Well, to get a sample mean,
or at least for this

108
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:35,500
distribution, you're taking
n samples from this

109
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,490
population over here.

110
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,620
Maybe n is 10.

111
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,800
You're taking 10 samples
and finding its mean.

112
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,390
That sample mean is
a random variable.

113
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,940
Let's say you take 10 samples
from here and you get 9.2 when

114
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,060
you find their mean.

115
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,570
That 9.2 can be viewed as a
sample from this distribution

116
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,760
right over here.

117
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,820
Same thing if this
right here is m.

118
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,600
Or if m right here is 12.

119
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,930
You're taking 12 samples,
taking its mean.

120
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,360
And that sample mean, maybe it's
15.2, could be viewed as

121
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,120
a sample from this
distribution.

122
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,940
As a sample from the sampling
distribution.

123
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,920
So what z is, z is a random
variable where you're taking n

124
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,770
samples from this distribution
up here, this population

125
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,470
distribution, taking its mean.

126
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,020
Then you're taking m samples
from this population

127
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,830
distribution up here,
taking its mean.

128
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,610
And then finding the difference
between that mean

129
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,050
and that mean.

130
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,660
So it's another random
veritable.

131
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,970
But what is the distribution
of the z?

132
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,750
   

133
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,230
So let's draw it.

134
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,300
Well there's a couple
of things we

135
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,520
immediately know about z.

136
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,210
And we kind of came up with
this in the last video.

137
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,510
   

138
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:58,430
Instead of writing z, I'm just
going to write the mean of x

139
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:05,550
bar, which is a sample from the
sampling distribution of

140
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,960
x, or the sample mean of x,
minus the sample mean of y.

141
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,940
   

142
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,020
We saw this in the last video.

143
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,780
In fact, I think I still
have the work up here.

144
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,330
Yeah, I still have the
work right up here.

145
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,350
The mean of the difference
is going to be the

146
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,720
difference of the means.

147
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,490
The mean of the difference
is the same thing is the

148
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,270
difference of the means.

149
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,100
So the mean of this new
distribution right over here

150
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:38,790
is going to be the same thing as
the mean of our sample mean

151
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,425
minus the mean of our
sample mean of y.

152
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:45,280
   

153
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,380
And this might seem a little
abstract in this video.

154
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,550
In the next video, we're
actually going to do this with

155
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,460
concrete numbers.

156
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,180
And hopefully it'll make a
little bit more sense.

157
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,540
And just so you know where we're
going with this, the

158
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,820
whole point of this is so that
we can eventually do some

159
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,580
inferential statistics about
differences of means.

160
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,990
How likely is a difference of
means of two samples, random

161
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,410
chance or not random chance?

162
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,260
Or what is a confidence
interval of the

163
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,120
difference of means?

164
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,410
That's what this is all
building up to.

165
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,200
So anyway, we know
the mean of this

166
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,960
distribution right over here.

167
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,060
And what's the variance
of this distribution?

168
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,250
We came up with that result
in the last video.

169
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,090
If we're taking essentially the
difference of two random

170
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,190
variables, the variance is going
to be the sum of those

171
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,800
two random variables.

172
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,580
And the whole point of that
video is to show that it's not

173
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,870
the difference of the
variances, it's

174
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,970
the sum of the variances.

175
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:38,630
The variance of this new
distribution-- and I haven't

176
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,880
drawn the distribution yet--
The variance of this new

177
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,210
distribution, I'll just write x
bar minus y bar, is going to

178
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,310
be equal to the sum of the
variances of each of these

179
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,440
distributions.

180
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,060
The variance of x bar plus
the variance of y bar.

181
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,250
Actually, let me just
draw this here.

182
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,190
Just so we can visualize
another distribution.

183
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,230
Although, all I'm going to
draw is another normal

184
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,480
distribution.

185
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,120
   

186
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,070
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

187
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,670
So the mean over here, the mean
of x bar minus y bar, is

188
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,350
going to be equal to
the difference of

189
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,130
these means over here.

190
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,405
I don't have to rewrite it.

191
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:24,920
   

192
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,310
Let me draw the curve.

193
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,390
And notice, I'm drawing a fatter
curve than either one.

194
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,120
And why am I doing that?

195
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,620
Because the variance here is the
sum of the variances here.

196
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,950
So we're going to have
a fatter curve.

197
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,330
It's going to have a bigger
variance, or a bigger standard

198
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,360
deviation than either
of these.

199
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,145
So then we have some variance
here, variance of

200
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,390
x bar minus y bar.

201
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,230
Now what are these, in terms
of the original population

202
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,270
distribution?

203
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,280
We came up with those results
right over here.

204
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,020
We know what the standard
deviation is.

205
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:05,680
We know that this thing is the
same thing as the variance of

206
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,130
the population distribution
divided by n.

207
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,825
We've done this multiple,
multiple times.

208
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:13,610
   

209
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,630
What's this going
to be equal to?

210
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,820
This is right here is the same
thing as the variance of our

211
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,136
population distribution.

212
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,850
   

213
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,040
And the x just means this is
for random variable x.

214
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,500
But there's no bar on top.

215
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,420
This is the actual population
distribution, not the sampling

216
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,200
distribution of the
sample mean.

217
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,390
So that divided by n.

218
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,280
And then if we want the variance
of the sampling

219
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,560
distribution for y, let me do
that in a different color.

220
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,420
I'll use blue, because that was
what we were using for the

221
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,020
y random variable.

222
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,170
That's going to be equal to
this thing over here.

223
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,420
And we've done this
multiple times.

224
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,290
Same exact logic as this.

225
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,990
The population distribution
for y divided by m.

226
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,470
   

227
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,770
And so once again, I'll just
write this out front.

228
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,860
This is the variance
of the differences

229
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,110
of the sample means.

230
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,400
   

231
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,030
And now if you wanted the
standard deviation of the

232
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,910
differences of the sample means,
you just have to take

233
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,620
the square root of both
sides of this.

234
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,420
You take the square root of
this, you get the standard

235
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,770
deviation of the difference of
the sample means is equal to

236
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:30,050
the square root of the
population distribution of x.

237
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,780
Or the variance of the
population distribution of x

238
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:40,540
divided by n plus the variance
of the population distribution

239
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:47,120
of y divided by m.

240
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,870
And this is just neat.

241
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,040
Because it kind of looks
a little bit

242
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,350
like a distance formula.

243
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,130
I'll throw that out there as we
get more sophisticated with

244
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,630
our statistics and try to
visualize what all of this

245
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,130
kind of stuff means in
more advanced topics.

246
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,710
But the whole point of this is,
now we can make inferences

247
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,060
about a difference of means.

248
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,550
If we have two samples, and we
take the means of both of

249
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,730
those samples and we find some
difference, we can make some

250
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,640
conclusions about
how likely that

251
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,750
difference was just by chance.

252
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,310
And we're going to do that
in the next video.

253
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:17,734
