1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,418
Let's say I'm hanging out with my buddies one night

2
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:05,937
and we realize that

3
00:00:05,937 --> 00:00:12,066
there's a huge opportunity in selling socks online.

4
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:13,348
And so we decide to start a company.

5
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:14,710
So the first thing we would do is

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,498
we would write a business plan.

7
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:18,590
And say, you know what?

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,961
In this business plan writing process,

9
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:23,585
this is all we've all contributed to it individually.

10
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:25,230
So we'll all be equal shareholders.

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,512
Let's say there's five of us friends.

12
00:00:27,512 --> 00:00:30,570
So the first thing we want to do is we want to start a--

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,080
well you know, you could do in different orders,

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,612
you could just write up a business plan,

15
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:34,620
or you can start the corporation.

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,800
But we'll just assume we
start a corporation.

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,360
And I'm going to indicate the
corporation

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,420
by creating a balance sheet right
from the get-go.

19
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,370
So, what are the assets of the
corporation,

20
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,720
and what are the debt-- and what are the
liabilities--

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,900
and we could talk a little bit about what
a corporation even is.

22
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,860
So it's asset to begin with.

23
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,350
It's essentially just an idea.

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,050
I mean, you could say it takes
physical form to some degree in the business plan,

25
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,040
but it's
just an idea first.

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,770
And then, there are no immediate
liabilities,

27
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,890
it doesn't owe anybody any money.

28
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,480
And we learned in the balance
sheet videos--

29
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,180
and you might want to watch the balance sheet
videos as a prerequisite to this one--

30
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,050
but in general,
assets are equal to

31
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,030
liabilities plus equity.

32
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,450
So this is assets.

33
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,300
The only asset we have right
now is our idea.

34
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,040
Maybe you want to add the
potential talent that we have,

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,780
maybe unique skills.

36
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,370
They are very intangible
at this point.

37
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,680
These are the assets that our
five buddies have together.

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,670
And we have no liabilities.

39
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,490
It doesn't sound like we
borrowed money or anything.

40
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,860
So everything we have-- so the
assets are equal to our equity--

41
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,960
and I'll do that in a
brown color--

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,520
so there's no liabilities and we
just have equity.

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,390
And equity is essentially

44
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,620
what
the owners of the company have the rights to.

45
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,250
For example, if-- I haven't
assigned any numbers here and

46
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,360
I did that for a reason-- but if
the assets were $10 million

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,760
and liability was $5 million,
if we had owed $5 million to someone else,

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,860
then you
would have $5 million left

49
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,630
for the equity.

50
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,370
And that's what the owners of
the company would have.

51
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,510
Me and my five buddies, or I
guess my four buddies,

52
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,220
we decide we're the owners of the
company,

53
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,780
so we'll be equal shareholders.

54
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,130
So we would split the equity
between us five ways.

55
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,300
So we just pick an
arbitrary number.

56
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,220
Let's say to begin with we have
a million shares,

57
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,870
so each of us have 200,000 shares
in the company.

58
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,340
And that's a bit of an
arbitrary notion.

59
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,300
And you normally do assign some
value to those shares initially,

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,450
it's some pennies
per share,

61
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,200
but I won't get into the technicalities
of that.

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,980
Just fair enough to say that

63
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,560
we
each have 200,000 shares in this company.

64
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,000
And some of them go to me

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,220
and
then the rest of them go to buddy one, buddy two, buddy
three, and buddy four.

66
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,750
This is the equity right here.

67
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,000
And there's a total of one
million shares outstanding.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,770
Good enough.

69
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,740
Well, just an idea and some
paper

70
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,020
and some well intentioned individuals
alone

71
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,300
isn't enough to start a company.

72
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,950
We're going to have to create
some type of an online presence,

73
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,340
and do some
programming,

74
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,940
and maybe have a warehouse, and do
some marketing.

75
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,900
So we're going to have to--

76
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,250
and
really we're going to have to quit our jobs so that we can
work on this full time.

77
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,500
So we're going to have
to raise some money.

78
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,230
Money to hire some engineers, so
that we can quit our jobs.

79
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,560
To hire some marketing people,
et cetera, et cetera.

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,120
So where do we get
our money from?

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,530
So this is where the whole
venture capital world

82
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,140
comes into the picture.

83
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,110
You've heard the word before.

84
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,610
I think you have some
sense of what it is.

85
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,230
And the venture capital world,

86
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,505
it's kind of separated into different people who invest
in different stages.

87
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,150
So you'll have people, they're
called angel investors.

88
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,720
And sometimes these people won't
even call themselves venture--

89
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,620
angel investors.

90
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,540
And these are the guys that
are kind of these,

91
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,480
I don't want to stereotype it,

92
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,250
but
they'll be kind of like the old guys who made it big in
the `80s

93
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,140
and now they're sitting on billions
of dollars.

94
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,550
And they want to participate
in the neat, fun ideas

95
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,880
that young guys like me and
my friends think of.

96
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,760
And so they're kind of like your
rich uncle who says,

97
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,560
oh that's a great idea, I'll throw
some money behind that.

98
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,850
They usually invest at
a very early stage.

99
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,090
So those are probably
the people

100
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,290
we would go to initially.

101
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,840
And then we'll talk to the
people after that,

102
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,100
the other types of venture capitalists.

103
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,080
But in general,

104
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,650
venture
capital can meet a lot of things.

105
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,940
But it means someone who's
going to give you money.

106
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,090
They're going to take a stake in
your company

107
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,380
and hope that your-- they give you enough
money

108
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,170
to kind of get your venture going.

109
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,240
To kind of start
your business.

110
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,010
So let's say we go to an angel
investor, and we say hey,

111
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,840
angel investor, don't you think
this is a great idea?

112
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,040
We're going to sell
socks online.

113
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,630
You know, socks are something
people run out of every week,

114
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,170
we can even do subscriptions
for socks.

115
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,640
You get 10 pairs of month,
et cetera, et cetera.

116
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,550
You can give them as gifts.

117
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,920
All of these lovely things.

118
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,650
And the first nine guys slam
their doors on our face.

119
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,570
They think our business
is stupid.

120
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,960
But the tenth guy says, hey you
know, that's interesting.

121
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,630
So we enter into negotiations.

122
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,740
And he's like, you know what?

123
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,850
I'm going to invest. But we have
to figure out

124
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,330
what I'm going to get in exchange for
investing in your company.

125
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,480
How much of your company
I'm going to get.

126
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,300
And so this leads to a
process of valuation.

127
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,050
So let's say we say need $5
million

128
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,250
from the angel investor to get started.

129
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,410
We need $5 million-- let me
write that down--

130
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,410
that's what we say we need.

131
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,680
And that's what the angel
investor says

132
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,180
that he's willing to give us,
because he agrees.

133
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,960
$5 million, that's enough for us
to quit our jobs,

134
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,300
and then we could all take salaries
for some time.

135
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,880
We could hire a bunch
of people.

136
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,060
We can rent office spaces.

137
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,710
Do everything you need to
do to start a company.

138
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,320
And $5 million will support
that for,

139
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,230
I don't know, a year or two.

140
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,760
I don't know, depending on how
many expenses we have.

141
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,140
But the question is, what does
he get for that $5 million.

142
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,830
So in order to come to that
conclusion,

143
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,860
you have to determine what is what we had

144
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,500
before he came to the picture worth, right?

145
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,980
Notice, when I did this balance
sheet

146
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,250
I didn't even write what these assets
are worth.

147
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,050
What is this worth?

148
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,560
And this value, this is called
a-- well in general,

149
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,345
whenever you're valuing anything, it's
called a valuation.

150
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,540
And since we want to know what
this is worth--

151
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,830
this is before we got any kind of money from
investors--

152
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,260
this would be called a pre-money valuation.

153
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,120
And I'll show you why that
matters in a second.

154
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:59,170
Because, if us and this angel
investor agree that this--

155
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,410
our assets before we go to them--
are worth $5 million.

156
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,180
So if we agree that they're
worth $5 million--

157
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,020
let me draw that so, what color was
I doing that in?

158
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,680
It was in yellow-- so if we
agree--

159
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,820
let me draw it a little bit smaller-- essentially
it's just an idea,

160
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,150
and then we have the shares,
a million shares.

161
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,090
Of that million,
I have 200,000.

162
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,460
The other 800,000 are
with my friends.

163
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,990
These are one million shares
total, or shares outstanding.

164
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,440
So if this idea-- we agree with
the angel investor--

165
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,470
if we agree this is worth
$5 million.

166
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,080
So everything we have today
is worth $5 million.

167
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,720
Then when he gives us
another $5 million,

168
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
that's an asset, right?

169
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,890
We'll have $5 million in cash.

170
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,850
So he'll give us another
$5 million.

171
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,020
He'll essentially get
50% of the company.

172
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,900
He'll get all of these
shares up here.

173
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,850
Now how does that work out?

174
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,340
Well if you think about it,

175
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,600
this is the post-money company, right?

176
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,730
So let's think about
it a couple ways.

177
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,060
This is $5 million.

178
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,250
That's the idea.

179
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,890
What is the $5 million worth?

180
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,110
That's not a trick question.

181
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,020
That's worth $5 million,
right?

182
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,320
It's worth $5 million.

183
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,365
So what is the post-money
valuation?

184
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:29,760
When we talk about valuation

185
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,250
we're talking about the value of the assets,

186
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,530
especially
because we're not dealing with any debt right now.

187
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,260
Everything on the right-hand
side is equity,

188
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,190
so this is all equity.

189
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,510
Let me write that, no
liabilities yet.

190
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,580
And in general, when you're
doing a startup company,

191
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,310
if I want to start socksonline.com,
and I go into my local bank

192
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,070
and say, hey give me a
loan,

193
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,910
they're just going to turn me away.

194
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,920
Because if you have a venture
that really doesn't exist yet

195
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,500
and has no cash flow, they know

196
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,380
that you're not going to pay the interest on the debt,

197
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,250
so
you're not going to even be able to raise debt until you
are a more mature company.

198
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,980
Or until you-- maybe you could
post some collateral.

199
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,070
And I'll talk more about that.

200
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,710
Maybe you could say hey,
I'll use my house.

201
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,790
If I don't pay the debt, you
can take my house,

202
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,280
or something like that.

203
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,580
But for the most part we
don't want to do that.

204
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,430
So the only way to raise money
at this early stage is

205
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,560
by issuing equity.

206
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,670
So going back to what we were
talking about,

207
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,310
what is the post-money valuation?

208
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,210
We said before any of this stuff
on the top existed,

209
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,000
the pre-money valuation of just
our idea was $5 million.

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,680
Now, the angel investor, if we
value this at $5 million,

211
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,350
he'll give us $5 million more.

212
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,240
What is the total value of
all of the assets now?

213
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,530
Well if we said this was $5
million,

214
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:40,860
that's just something we agreed with.

215
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,760
This is worth $5 million.

216
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,210
So the combined assets, if you
believe that

217
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,660
this is worth $5 million, is now $10
million, right?

218
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,410
And this would be the post-money
valuation.

219
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,780
And if you think about it, if
you think about the company

220
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,820
in this form right now, we-- me
and my buddies--

221
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,800
we've contributed half of the
value of the company.

222
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,640
And this rich guy, he's
contributed

223
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,050
the other half of the company.

224
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,200
So it makes sense that he
has 50% of the company.

225
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,760
So how is that going to work?

226
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,100
Well, I don't give away any of
my shares,

227
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,070
and neither are any of my friends.

228
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,780
They're all going to
keep their shares.

229
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,030
So we had five chunks of
$200,000 that went--

230
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,930
200,000 shares that went
to each of us.

231
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,780
All right, that was buddy
one, two, three, four.

232
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,250
So what we'll do is, we'll
actually issue another million shares

233
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,920
and give it to
this rich dude.

234
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,780
So this is another one
million shares.

235
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,670
So as the company board,

236
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,050
you
can actually authorize to create shares.

237
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,260
And that's what we did,

238
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,500
and we
essentially sold those shares for $5 million.

239
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,730
So now instead of having one
million shares,

240
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,160
you have two million shares.

241
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,150
So something interesting here,

242
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,540
and some people often talk about the notion of
dilution, right?

243
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,680
Because before, I had 200,000
out of a million shares.

244
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,750
So before, I had 20%
of the company.

245
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,330
And now what do I have?

246
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,820
Well we've essentially doubled
the share count,

247
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,190
so now I only have 10% of the company.

248
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,390
So some people say, oh you know
what,

249
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,950
my share of the company got diluted.

250
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,000
But it really isn't the case,

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,020
because the company has gotten all this cash.

252
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,810
I now own 10% of something
that's twice as valuable,

253
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,230
as opposed to 20% of something
that's half as valuable.

254
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,200
If you really believe
that,

255
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,480
then this was no change, right?

256
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,250
I now own 10% of ten million,

257
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,330
which in theory should be worth a million dollars.

258
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,190
Before I owned 20% of five
million,

259
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,380
which was also worth a million dollars.

260
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,910
So if you believe these
valuations,

261
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,990
I probably-- I'm neutral.

262
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,890
And we're going to put this
$5 million to work.

263
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,470
And actually let me take a
step-- actually no,

264
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,530
I just realized I'm out of time.

265
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,360
Let me continue this
in the next video.
