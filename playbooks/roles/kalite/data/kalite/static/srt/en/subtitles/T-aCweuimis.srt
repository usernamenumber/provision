1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,340
We are asked which of these
lines are parallel.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,490
So parallel lines are lines that
have the same slope, and

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,000
they're different lines, so they
never, ever intersect.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,540
So we need to look for different
lines that have the

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,030
exact same slope.

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,230
And lucky for us, all of these
lines are in y equals mx plus

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,990
b or slope-intercept form, so
you can really just look at

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,330
these lines and figure
out their slope.

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,870
The slope for line A,
m is equal to 2.

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,100
We see it right over there.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,040
For line B, our slope is equal
to 3, so these two guys are

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,890
not parallel.

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,020
I'll graph it in a second
and you'll see that.

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:48,360
And then finally, for line C--
I'll do it in purple-- the

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,230
slope is 2.

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,980
So m is equal to 2.

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,690
I don't know if that purple
is too dark for you.

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,040
So line C and line A have the
same slope, but they're

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,530
different lines, they have
different y-intercepts, so

21
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,960
they're going to be parallel.

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,290
And to see that, let's actually
graph all of these

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,300
characters.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,470
So line A, our y-intercept
is negative 6.

25
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:14,080
So the point 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,680
And our slope is 2.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,730
So if we move 1 in the positive
x direction, we go up

28
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,710
2 in the positive y direction.

29
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,725
One in x, up 2 in y, if we
go to in x, we're going

30
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:27,705
to go up 4 in y.

31
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:32,030
And I can just do up 2, then
we're going to go 2, 4, and

32
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,870
you're going to see it's all on
the same line, so line A is

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:40,850
going to look something like--
do my best to draw it as

34
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,180
straight as possible.

35
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,910
Line A-- I can do a better
version than that-- line A is

36
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,690
going to look like-- well,
that's about just as good as

37
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,040
what I just drew--
that is line A.

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,370
Now let's do line B.

39
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,940
Line B, the y-intercept
is negative 6.

40
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,650
0, negative 6.

41
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,422
So it has the same y-intercept,
but its slope is

42
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:05,320
3, so if x goes up by 1,
y will go up by 3.

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,620
So x goes up by 1,
y goes up by 3.

44
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,120
If x goes up by 2, y is
going to go up by 6.

45
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,876
2, 4, 6.

46
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:18,990
   

47
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,160
So this line is going to look
something like this.

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,770
Trying my best to connect
the dots.

49
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,550
It has a steeper slope, and you
see that when x increases,

50
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,560
this blue line increases by
more in the y direction.

51
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,940
So that is line B-- and notice,
they do intersect,

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,780
there's definitely not
two parallel lines.

53
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,560
And then finally, let's
look at line C.

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,670
The y-intercept is 5.

55
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,640
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

56
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,690
The point 0, 5, its
y-intercept.

57
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,370
And its slope is 2.

58
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,240
So you increase by 1 in the x
direction, you're going to go

59
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,640
up by 2 in the y direction.

60
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,890
If you decrease by 1,
you're going to go

61
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,560
down 2 in the y direction.

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,390
If you increase by, well, you're
going to go to that

63
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,100
point, you're going to have
a bunch of these points.

64
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,840
And then if I were to graph the
line-- let me do it one

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,810
more time-- if I were to
decrease by two, I'm going to

66
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,930
have to go down by 4, right?

67
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,010
Negative 4 over negative
2 still a slope of

68
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,710
2, so 1, 2, 3, 4.

69
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,780
And I can do that one more time,
get right over there.

70
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,330
And then you'll see the line.

71
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:28,120
The line will look like that,
it will look just like that.

72
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,020
And notice that line C and
line A never intersect.

73
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,560
They have the exact
same slope.

74
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,000
Different y-intercepts, same
slope, so they're increasing

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,780
at the exact same rate, but
they're never going to

76
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,900
intersect each other.

77
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,600
So line A and line
C are parallel.

78
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:47,933
