1
00:00:00,172 --> 00:00:01,488
So you're me and you're in math class

2
00:00:01,488 --> 00:00:03,201
--triangles, triangles, triangles--

3
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:04,174
I don't know--the teacher keeps saying words?

4
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:05,707
And you're supposed to be doing something with trigon

5
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:06,506
whatever those are.

6
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,556
But you're bored and--triangles, triangles, triangles, triangles

7
00:00:08,556 --> 00:00:10,906
Sure you could draw your triangles separately, but then they get lonely.

8
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:14,672
They're happiest when snuggled up together into a triangle party. Everybody knows triangles love parties!

9
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:16,873
Sometimes they get together into these triangle conga lines.

10
00:00:16,873 --> 00:00:18,824
And if you keep adding new triangles on the same side

11
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:19,924
it gets all curvy and spirally

12
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:21,940
or you can alternate and it goes sorta straight

13
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,539
In fact, since all the sides of the triangle are supposed to be straight lines

14
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,707
and since they are all lying on top of the previous straight line

15
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:28,589
then this whole line would have to be straight

16
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:29,623
if we were actually triangles

17
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:30,773
since it's not

18
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:32,190
it's proved that these aren't quite triangles

19
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,839
maybe they've been partying a little too hard

20
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:34,823
But hey!

21
00:00:34,823 --> 00:00:35,839
At least you're not doing math.

22
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:36,789
Speaking of which,

23
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:38,539
the teacher is still going on about types of trigots,

24
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,922
and you're supposed to be taking notes,

25
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:41,124
but you're more interested in types of triangles

26
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,357
which you already know about.

27
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:43,452
There are fat triangles

28
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:44,152
pointy triangles

29
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:44,959
perfect triangles

30
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:45,967
cheese slice triangles

31
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:47,276
which are a kind of pointy triangle,

32
00:00:47,276 --> 00:00:48,966
but are symmetric like a slice of cheese, or cake.

33
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,943
Super pointy triangles are fun to stack into triangle stacks.

34
00:00:51,943 --> 00:00:53,581
You could pull all the points facing one direction,

35
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:55,204
but the stacks start to wobble too much towards that direction

36
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:57,693
so it's good to put some facing the other direction before you go too far.

37
00:00:57,693 --> 00:01:00,132
You'll notice pretty quickly that the skinnier the triangle

38
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:02,211
the less wobble it adds to the stack.

39
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:03,272
To compensate for a big wobble

40
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:06,256
you could put just one not so skinny triangle that's pointing the other way.

41
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:07,248
Or maybe you want to wobble

42
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:09,323
because you have to navigate you triangle stack around your notes

43
00:01:09,323 --> 00:01:11,023
in which case you can even alternate back and forth.

44
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:14,389
as long as you make the triangles point towards where you want to go a little less skinny.

45
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:15,823
The easy part about triangle stacks

46
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:17,673
is that there's really only one part of the triangle

47
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:19,389
that's important as far as the stack is concerned

48
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:20,989
and that's the pointy point.

49
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,473
The other two angles can be fat and skinny

50
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:23,401
or skinny and fat

51
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:24,857
or both the same if it's a cheese slice

52
00:01:24,857 --> 00:01:26,373
and it doesn't change the rest of the stack

53
00:01:26,373 --> 00:01:28,256
unless the top angle is really wide

54
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:29,389
because then you'll get two skinny points

55
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,108
and which side should you continue to stack on?

56
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:31,956
Both?

57
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:33,306
Also, instead of thinking fat and skinny

58
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:34,441
you should probably create code words

59
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:36,373
that won't set off your teacher's mind reading alarms

60
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:37,574
for non-math related thoughts.

61
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:39,239
So you'd pick two words off the board:

62
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,456
obtuse and acute

63
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:43,572
Which by sheer coincidence, I'm sure, just happen to mean fat angle and skinny angle.

64
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:44,528
Of course,

65
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:45,756
those are also kinds of triangles

66
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:46,889
which doesn't make much sense

67
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:48,574
because the obtuser one angle of a triangle is,

68
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:50,257
the more acute the other two get

69
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:52,506
Yet, if you make an acute triangle with the same perimeter,

70
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:53,422
it has more area

71
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:54,956
which seems like an obtuseish quality

72
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:59,206
and then, can you still call an obtuse equilateral triangle a cheese or cake slice triangle?

73
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:01,190
because these look more like common <u><u></u><u></u></u>.

74
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,272
Point is,

75
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:03,656
triangle terminology is tricky.

76
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,906
But at least you're not paying attention to the stuff the teacher is saying

77
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,139
about trigonometric functions.

78
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:09,307
You'd rather think about the functions of triangles

79
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:10,757
and you already know some of those.

80
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:13,139
There are sines and cosines,

81
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,423
but enough of this tangent. :))

82
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:16,757
The thing to pay attention to is what affects you triangle how.

83
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:19,773
If you start drawing the next triangle on your triangle stack this way

84
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,491
by this point you already know what the full triangle will have to be

85
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:24,806
because you just continue this edge until it meets this invisible line

86
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:26,422
and then fill the rest in.

87
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:28,039
In fact, you can make an entire triangle stack

88
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:31,757
just by piling on triangle parts and adding the points later to see what happens.

89
00:02:31,757 --> 00:02:33,206
There are some possible problems though.

90
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:34,973
If you start a triangle like this,

91
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:36,656
you can see that's it's never going to close

92
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,156
no matter how far you extend the lines.

93
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:41,556
Since this triangle isn't real, let's call it a bermuda triangle.

94
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:45,473
This happens when two angles together are already more than 180 degrees.

95
00:02:45,473 --> 00:02:47,589
And since all the angles in a triangle add up to 180

96
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:50,940
which by the way you can test by ripping one up and putting the three points into a line

97
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,989
this means that if these are two 120 degree angles of a triangle.

98
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:56,557
The third angle is off somewhere being negative 60.

99
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:59,673
Of course you'd have no problem being a bermuda triangle on a sphere

100
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:01,940
where angles always add up to more than 180.

101
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,108
Just the third point might be off in Australia.

102
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:07,139
Which is fine, unless you're afraid your triangle will get eaten by sea monsters.

103
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,723
Anyway, second triangles into a curve is nice

104
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,306
and you probably want to make your spiral

105
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:13,107
but if you're not careful, it will crash into itself

106
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:14,839
so you'd better think about your angles.

107
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,675
Though, if you do just right instead of a crash disaster

108
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:20,674
you'd get a wreath thing or you can get a different triangle circle by starting with a polygon

109
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:22,039
extending the sides in one direction

110
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,723
and then triangleing around it to get this sort of apeture shape

111
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:26,339
and then you should probably add more

112
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,773
triangles, triangles, triangles, triangles.

113
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:28,806
One last game.

114
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:30,238
Start with some sort of asterisk

115
00:03:30,238 --> 00:03:31,308
then go around and triangle it up

116
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:33,573
shade out from the obtusest angles and it'll look pretty neat.

117
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:35,457
You can then extend it with another layer of triangles

118
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:36,223
and another

119
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:37,740
and if you shade the inner parts of each triangle

120
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,556
it's guaranteed to be an awesome triangle party.

121
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:42,523
And there's lots of other kinds of triangle parties just waiting to happen.

122
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:43,539
Ah, the triangle.

123
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:45,006
So simple, yet so beautiful.

124
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,322
The essence of two-dimensionality.

125
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:48,474
The fundamental object of euclidean geometry.

126
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:50,123
The three points that define a plane.

127
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:51,789
You can have your fancy, complex shapes

128
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,123
they're just made up of triangles.

129
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:54,756
Triangles

130
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:55,739
dissect a square into triangles

131
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,107
make symmetric arrangements

132
00:03:57,107 --> 00:03:58,940
some reminiscent of spherical and hyperbolic geometry

133
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,223
triangles branch into binary fractal tree

134
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:04,025
numbers increasing exponential with each iteration to infinity.

135
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,223
Triangles

136
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:08,739
with the right proportion being a golden spiral of perfect right, isoceles triangles

137
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,389
put equilateral triangles on the middle third on the outside edges of equilateral triangles

138
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,506
to infinity and get a snowflake with a boundary of a koch curve

139
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,656
an infinitely long perimeter

140
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,222
continuous yet nowhere differentiable

141
00:04:18,222 --> 00:04:20,756
with a fractional dimension of log 4 over log 3

142
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:21,579
And uh-oh,

143
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,621
teacher's walking around

144
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:25,000
better pretend to be doing math!
