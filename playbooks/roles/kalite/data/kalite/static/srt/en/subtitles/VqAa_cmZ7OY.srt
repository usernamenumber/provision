1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,740
Let's see if we can tackle this

3
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,720
spectrophotometry example.

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,090
I took this from the Kotz,
Treichel and Townsend

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,020
Chemistry & Chemical Reactivity
book and did it

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,150
with their permission.

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,320
So let's see what
the problem is.

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,900
It says a solution of potassium
permanganate-- let

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,880
me underline that in a darker
color-- potassium permanganate

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:32,189
has an absorbance of 0.539 when
measured at 540 nanometer

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,130
in a 1 centimeter cell.

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,840
So this 540 nanometers is the
wavelength of light that we're

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,700
measuring the absorbance of.

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,870
And so this is probably a
special wavelength of light

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,820
for potassium permanganate, one
that it tends to be good

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,870
at absorbing.

17
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,430
So it'll be pretty sensitive to
how much solute we have in

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,240
the solution.

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,500
OK, and the beaker
is 1 centimeter.

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,930
So that's just the length
right there.

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,790
What is the concentration of
potassium permanganate?

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,510
Prior to determining the
absorbance for the unknown

23
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,350
solution, the following
calibration data were

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,320
collected for the
spectrophotometer.

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:18,170
   

26
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,780
The absorbances of these
known concentrations

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,240
were already measured.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,400
So what we're going to do is
we're going to plot these.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,600
And then, essentially, this
absorbance is going

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,920
to sit on the line.

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,670
We learned from the Beer-Lambert
law, that is a

32
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,630
linear relationship between
absorbance and concentration.

33
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,320
So this absorbance is going to
sit some place on this line.

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,390
And we're just going to have
to read off where that

35
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,360
concentration is.

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,330
And that will be our unknown
concentration.

37
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,710
So let's plot this first. Let's
plot our concentrations

38
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:56,040
first. So this axis, the
horizontal axis, will be our

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,780
concentration axis.

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,250
I'll draw the axis in
blue right there.

41
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,000
Let me scroll down a
little bit more.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,550
I just need to make sure I
have all this data here.

43
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,310
So this is concentration
in molarity.

44
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,940
   

45
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,280
And let's see, it goes from
0.03 all the way to 0.15.

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,970
So let's make this 0.03,
then go three more.

47
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,510
This over here is 0.06.

48
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,220
One, two, three, then this
over here is 0.09.

49
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,500
This over here is 0.12.

50
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,870
And then this over
here is 0.15.

51
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,430
And then the absorbances go--
well it's close to 0, or close

52
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,040
to 0.1-- all the way
up to close to 1.

53
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,060
So let's make this
right here 0.1.

54
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:10,250
Let's make this 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
0.5-- almost done-- 0.6, 0.7,

55
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,020
0.8, and then 0.9.

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,500
And that, essentially, covers
all of the values of

57
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,050
absorbency that we have here.

58
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,720
So let's plot the first one.

59
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,865
When we had a concentration of
potassium permanganate at 0.03

60
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:31,180
molar, our absorbance
was 0.162.

61
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,640
So 0.03, and then
it goes to 0.16.

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,690
This is 0.15, so 0.162 is going
to be right over there.

63
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:48,260
And then when we had 0.06
molarity of potassium

64
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,830
permanganate our absorbance
was 0.33.

65
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:59,810
So 0.06, 0.33 which is right
about-- this is 0.35, so 0.33

66
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,570
would be right about there.

67
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,290
And we already see an
interesting line form, but

68
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,310
I'll plot all of these points.

69
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:14,860
So at 0.09 molarity,
we have 0.499.

70
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,550
So almost 0.5 right
over there.

71
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,870
That's that value.

72
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,430
And then at 0.12, we have
0.67 absorbance.

73
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,120
So at 0.12, we have 0.67.

74
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,830
So this is 0.12.

75
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,690
This would be 0.65,
so we have 0.67

76
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,510
absorbance right over there.

77
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,150
And actually, what we're doing
here, we're actually showing

78
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,080
you that the Beer-Lambert
law is true.

79
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,750
At specific concentrations,
we've measured the absorbance

80
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,700
and you see that it's a
linear relationship.

81
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,480
Anyway, let's do
this last one.

82
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,530
At 0.15 molarity, we have
absorbance of 0.84.

83
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,910
So this right here is 0.15.

84
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,660
I want to make sure I don't
lose track of that line.

85
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,550
And 0.84 is right over there.

86
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,640
So you see the linear
relationship?

87
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,520
Let me draw the line.

88
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,840
I don't have a line tool here,
so I'm just going to try to

89
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,540
freehand it.

90
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,170
I'll draw a dotted line.

91
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,860
Dotted lines are a little bit
easier to adjust. I'm doing it

92
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,000
in a slight green color, but
I think you see this linear

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,820
relationship.

94
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,110
This is the Beer-Lambert
law in effect.

95
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,980
Now let's go back
to our problem.

96
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,540
We know that a solution, some
mystery solution, has an

97
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:37,250
absorbance of 0.539-- let me do
our mystery solution in--

98
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,940
well, I've pretty much
run out of colors.

99
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,930
I'll do it in pink-- of 0.539.

100
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,200
So our absorbance is 0.5--
this is 0.55, so 0.539 is

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,240
going to be right over there.

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,630
   

103
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,630
And we want to know the
concentration of potassium

104
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,340
permanganate.

105
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,280
Well, if we just follow the
Beer-Lambert law, it's got to

106
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,230
sit on that line.

107
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,380
So the concentration is going
to be pretty darn close to

108
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,460
this line right over here.

109
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,570
And this over here looks
like 0.10 molar.

110
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,490
So this right here is 0, or at
least just estimating it,

111
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:25,650
looking at this, that looks
like 0.10 molar, or 0.10

112
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,930
molarity for that solution.

113
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,290
So that's the answer to our
question just eyeballing it

114
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,060
off of this chart.

115
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,900
Let's try to get a little
bit more exact.

116
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,760
We know the Beer-Lambert
law, and we can even

117
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,070
figure out the constant.

118
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,990
The Beer-Lambert law tells us
that the absorbance is equal

119
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:52,920
to some constant, times
the length, times the

120
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,010
concentration, where the
length is measured in

121
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,540
centimeters.

122
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,540
So that is measured
in centimeters.

123
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,780
And the concentration is
measured in moles per liter,

124
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,470
or molarity.

125
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:11,730
So we can figure out-- just
based on one of these data

126
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,450
points because we know that it's
0-- at 0 concentration

127
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,990
the absorbance is
going to be 0.

128
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,050
So that's our other one.

129
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,710
We can figure out what exactly
this constant is right here.

130
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,200
So we know all of these were
measured at the same length,

131
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,530
or at least that's what
I'm assuming.

132
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,850
They're all in a 1
centimeter cell.

133
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,290
That's how far the light had
to go through the solution.

134
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,040
So in this example, our
absorbance, our length, is

135
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,470
equal to 1 centimeter.

136
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:46,160
So let's see if we can figure
out this constant right here

137
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,380
for potassium permanganate at--
I guess this is probably

138
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,930
standard temperature and
pressure right here-- for this

139
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,370
frequency of light.

140
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:02,000
Which they told us up here
it was 540 nanometers.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,170
So if we just take this first
data point-- might as well

142
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:10,740
take the first one, we get--
the absorbance was 0.162.

143
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,240
That's going to be equal
to this constant of

144
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,930
proportionality times
1 centimeter.

145
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,310
That's how wide the vial was.

146
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,710
Times-- now what is
the concentration?

147
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,070
Well when the absorbance was
0.162, our concentration was

148
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,365
0.03 times 0.-- actually, I'll
write all the significant

149
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:39,159
digits there-- 0.0300.

150
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,370
So if we want to solve for
this epsilon, we can just

151
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:49,330
divide both sides of this
equation by 0.0300.

152
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,630
So you divide both sides by
0.0300 and what do we get?

153
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,840
These cancel out, this
is just a 1.

154
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,270
And so you get epsilon is equal
to-- let's figure out

155
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,460
what this number in
blue is here.

156
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,730
And I'll take out
my calculator.

157
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:16,390
And I have 0.162 divided by
0.03 is equal to 5.4.

158
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,150
And actually more significant
is, we could really say it's

159
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,430
5.40 since we have at least
three significant digits in

160
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,460
both situations.

161
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,990
So 5.40 is our proportionality
constant.

162
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,030
   

163
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:39,030
And you would actually divide
by 1 in both cases.

164
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,040
We just want the number here.

165
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,270
But if you wanted the units,
you'd want to divide by that 1

166
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,800
centimeters as well.

167
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,460
Now we can use this to figure
out the exact answer to our

168
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,810
problem without having to
eyeball it like we just did.

169
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,710
We know that for potassium
permanganate at 540

170
00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:02,180
nanometers, the absorbance is
going to be equal to 5.4

171
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,710
times-- and I'll put
the units here.

172
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,080
The units of this
proportionality constant right

173
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,900
here is liters per
centimeter mole.

174
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,080
And you'll see it'll just cancel
out with the distance

175
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,330
which is in centimeters, or the
length, and the molarity

176
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,480
which is in moles per liter.

177
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,000
And it just gives us a dimension
list, absorbance.

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,060
So times-- in our example the
length is 1 centimeter-- times

179
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:37,020
1 centimeter, times
the concentration.

180
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:50,430
Now in our example they told us
the absorbance was 0.539.

181
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:56,890
That's going to be equal to
5.4 liters per centimeter

182
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:06,750
mole, times 1 centimeter,
times our concentration.

183
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,310
Well this centimeter cancels out
with that centimeter right

184
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,540
over there.

185
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,670
And then we can just divide
both sides by

186
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,760
5.4 liters per mole.

187
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,290
So let's do that.

188
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:29,640
Let's divide both sides by
5.4 liters per mole,

189
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,665
and what do we have?

190
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:33,090
So on the right-hand side, all
of this business is going to

191
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,580
cancel out.

192
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,550
We're just going to have this
concentration left over.

193
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,060
So our concentration is equal
to-- let's figure out what

194
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,690
this number is.

195
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:53,030
So we have 0.539 divided by
5.4 gives us-- so we only

196
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,760
have-- well this is
actually 5.40.

197
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,740
So we actually have three
significant digits.

198
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:08,530
So we could say 0.0998.

199
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:14,060
So this is 0.0998.

200
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,130
And then if you're dividing by
liters per mole, that's the

201
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,635
same thing as moles per liter.

202
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:22,410
So we're able to get a much more
exact answer by actually

203
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,590
just going through the math.

204
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,990
But this is pretty darn close.

205
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,950
This exact answer's pretty
darn close to what we

206
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,260
estimated just by eyeballing
it off the chart.

207
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,870
0.1 is only a little bit
more than 0.0998.

208
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,830
Anyway, hopefully you
enjoyed that.

209
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:41,999
