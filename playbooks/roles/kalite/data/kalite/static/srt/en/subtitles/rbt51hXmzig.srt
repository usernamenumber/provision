1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,950
So one of the the YouTube
viewers asked me to

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:04,610
do this problem.

4
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,970
And it looked like a
pretty good problem.

5
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,350
So I thought I would record
a quick video on it.

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:15,136
So the problem's this: f of g
of x -- hope I get this right

7
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:23,790
-- is equal to 2 times the
square root of x squared plus

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:32,650
1 minus 1, all of that
over the square root of x

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,760
squared plus 1 plus 1.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:47,970
And f of x is equal to 2x
minus 1 over x plus 1.

11
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,890
And the question is, if we know
that f of g of x is equal to

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,560
this fairly complex-looking
expression, and that f of x is

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,980
equal to this, than
what is g of x?

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,530
Well, we could actually
do this problem by kind

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,850
of just looking at it.

16
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:09,840
Because f of g of x, what we do
is, we took -- everywhere we

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,220
see an x, we replace
it with g of x.

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,750
So, f of g of x would
look like this.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,230
And I'll do it in
another color.

20
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,400
So, let's see. f of g of x.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,690
And let's say we don't
know what g of x is.

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,360
Would be like this.

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,500
Everywhere where we saw an x,
we replace it with g of x.

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,610
Because -- so it would
be 2 times g of x.

25
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:41,250
Minus 1 over g of x plus 1.

26
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,250
And we also know that f of g
of x is equal to this thing.

27
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:44,870
Right?

28
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,450
Here we just took the g of x
and put it in of f of x, and

29
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,320
we wrote the g of x
in the expression.

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,120
But we know that that is equal
to this expression up here.

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,910
So that is also equal to 2
times the square root of x

32
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,870
squared plus 1, minus
1, all of that over x

33
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,900
squared plus 1 plus 1.

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,340
And I think, now, at this
point, you can kind

35
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:09,965
of pattern match.

36
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:13,430
And you can see what g of x is.

37
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,600
2 times something
minus 1, right?

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,410
2 times something minus 1.

39
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,670
2 times something minus 1 in
the numerator, and that's

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,840
something plus 1 in
the denominator.

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,460
And that's something plus
1 in the denominator.

42
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,690
So in either case, we have g
of x is equal to the square

43
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,130
root of x squared plus 1.

44
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,240
And, actually, in the example
he sent me, there was

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,110
a bunch of choices.

46
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,610
And if you were given the
choices, then all you have to

47
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,140
really do is take each of the
choices for g of x and replace

48
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,000
them in for x in
this expression.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,200
And then see which of those
choices for g of x ends

50
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,710
up with this expression.

51
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,450
Actually, we can do it.

52
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,160
I mean, he gave the choice
-- well, let me see.

53
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,620
Let me delete some of this.

54
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:11,230
   

55
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:17,390
I want to do it, let's
see if I can do it in

56
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,270
-- oh, there we go.

57
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,060
Better.

58
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,660
All right.

59
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,930
So, I wanted you to see that
you could do the problem

60
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,590
even if you weren't
given any choices.

61
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,110
But if you are given choices,
the problem actually even

62
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,120
becomes a little bit
more straightforward.

63
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,390
So the choices were --
actually, I erased some of it.

64
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,730
It was given that f of x is
2x minus 1 over x plus 1.

65
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,000
And then they said, which of
the following is g of x.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,640
So, g of x is equal to.

67
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,130
And they give these choices.

68
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:59,850
a), square root of x, b),
square root of x squared plus

69
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,830
1, which we just figured out
was actually the answer.

70
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:10,740
c), x, d), x squared.

71
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,360
And then e), x squared plus 1.

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,710
And the way you would do this
problem if, you, just by

73
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,670
looking at it you didn't -- the
method we just saw, saw that if

74
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,540
you just replaced x with square
root of x squared plus 1

75
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,500
everywhere, then you'd
get f of g of x.

76
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,440
The other option is, you just
take each of these and say well

77
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,430
what is f of -- if you replaced
x with this term everywhere,

78
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:34,990
what do you get?

79
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,230
Well, then you'd get 2 times
square root of x minus 1 over

80
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,050
the square root of x plus 1.

81
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,090
And that's not what
we have up here.

82
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,670
Then if you took this and you
replaced for x everywhere -- so

83
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,690
if you took this expression,
you replaced it for x

84
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,900
everywhere, then you would
get this expression.

85
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,630
So you would know that
this would be the answer.

86
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,680
If you just replaced x with x,
you would just get -- you would

87
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,820
just get this over again,
which does not equal this.

88
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,260
So that doesn't work.

89
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,810
If g of x was this, then f of g
of x would be -- let's see,

90
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,660
everywhere we see an x, you'd
put an x squared, so it

91
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,320
would be 2x squared minus 1
over x squared plus 1.

92
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,980
Which does not equal this.

93
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,530
And similarly, if g of x was
this term right here, then f of

94
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:32,600
g of x would be would be 2
times x squared plus 1 minus 1

95
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,070
over x squared plus 1 plus 1.

96
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,150
Which you can simplify
a bit, but that still

97
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,600
doesn't equal this.

98
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,890
And so this, once again, if
you're given the choices,

99
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,780
you just try this out.

100
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,200
And if you replace this
expression everywhere,

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,920
where you see an x, right?

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,840
Everywhere where you see an
x, and you replace it this

103
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,200
expression, you get these and
that's what the question,

104
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
essentially, was asking us.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So, hopefully I didn't
confuse everyone too much.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,730
And hopefully this was
helpful for the viewer

107
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,080
who asked me to do this.

108
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,940
I'll see you all later.

109
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,240
Bye.

110
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,282
