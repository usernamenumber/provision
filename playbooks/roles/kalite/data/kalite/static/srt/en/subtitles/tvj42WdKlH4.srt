1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:07,105
simplify three A to the fifth over nine A squared times A to the fourth over A to the third

2
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:11,540
so before we even worry about the A's we can actually simplify the three and the nine

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,980
they're both divisible by three

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,926
so let's divide the numerator and the denominator here by three

5
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:21,084
so if we divide the numerator by three, the three becomes a one

6
00:00:21,084 --> 00:00:26,122
if we divide the denominator by three, the nine becomes a three

7
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:30,400
so this reduces to, or simplifies to, one A to the fifth times A to the fourth

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,996
or maybe i should say A to the fifth over three A squared

9
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:36,897
times A to the fourth over A to the third

10
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:41,657
now this, if we just multiply the two expressions this would be equal to

11
00:00:41,657 --> 00:00:45,023
one A to the fifth times A to the fourth in the numerator

12
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:47,369
and we don't have to worry about the one, it doesn't change the values

13
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:51,757
so it's A to the fifth times A to the fourth in the numerator

14
00:00:51,757 --> 00:01:03,065
and then we have three times A squared times A to the third in the denominator

15
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:07,849
now there's multiple ways that we can simplify this from here

16
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:13,398
one, sometimes its called the quotient rule, and its just the idea that if you have

17
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:22,106
A to the 'x' over A to the 'y', that this is going to be equal to A to the 'x' minus 'y'

18
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:28,027
and just to understand why that works lets think about A to the fifth over A squared

19
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:37,800
so A to the fifth is literally A times A times A times A times A

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,405
that right there is A to the fifth

21
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:45,511
and we have that over A squared, and i'm just thinking about the A squared right over here

22
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:49,180
so we have that over A squared, which is literally just A times A

23
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,711
that is A squared

24
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:57,656
now we can clearly, both the numerator and the denominator, are both divisible by A times A

25
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:59,908
we can divide them both by A times A

26
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:06,467
if we divide the numerator by A twice, so by A times A, so lets get rid of an A times A

27
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:10,450
and if we divide the denominator by A times A, we just get a one

28
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,704
so what are we just left with

29
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:19,436
we are left with just A times A times A over 1, which is just A times A times A

30
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:22,338
but what is this?

31
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:29,667
this is A to the third power, or A to the five minus two power

32
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:33,252
we had five, we were able to cancel out two, that gave us three

33
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:36,619
so we can do the same thing over here, we can apply the quotient rule

34
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:41,657
and i'll do this in two ways, so lets apply the quotient rule with the A to the fifth and the A squared

35
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:44,049
and also, let me do it this way

36
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:51,133
so lets apply with these two guys and then lets apply it with these two guys

37
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:55,775
and of course we have the one third out front

38
00:02:55,775 --> 00:03:03,763
so this can be reduced to one third times, if we apply the quotient rule with A to the fifth over A squared

39
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:05,249
we just did it over here

40
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:07,292
that becomes A to the third power

41
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:12,267
and if we apply it over here with the A to the fourth over A to the third

42
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:25,520
that'll give us A to the four minus three power

43
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,213
or A to the first power

44
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:33,902
and of course we can simplify this as A to the third times A

45
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,690
well actually let me just do it over here

46
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,000
before I even rewrite it we know that A to the third times A to the first

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,888
is going to be A to the three plus one power

48
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:45,117
we have the same base so we can add the exponents

49
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:48,333
we're multiplying A times itself three times and then one more time

50
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,970
so that'll be A to the fourth power

51
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,600
so this right over here becomes A to the fourth power, A to the three plus one power

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,133
and then we have to multiply that by one third

53
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:01,186
so our answer could be one third A to the fourth

54
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:06,433
or we could equally write it A to the fourth over three

55
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:12,563
now the other way to do this problem would've been to apply the product

56
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:15,791
or to add the exponents in the numerator and then add the exponents in the denominator

57
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,778
so lets do it that way first

58
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:17,765
so if we add the exponents in the numerator first

59
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:19,867
we don't apply the quotient rule first, we apply it second

60
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:23,779
we get in the numerator A to the fifth times A to the fourth

61
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:27,796
would be A to the ninth power, five plus four

62
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:33,392
and then in the denominator we have A squared times A to the third

63
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:36,294
add the exponents because we were taking the product with the same base

64
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:38,500
so it'll be A to the fifth power

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,028
and we still have the three down here, we have a one third, or we could just write a three over here

66
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:47,765
now we could apply the quotient property of exponents

67
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:51,933
we could say look we have A to the ninth over A to the fifth

68
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:57,587
A to the ninth over A to the fifth is equal to A to the nine minus five power

69
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:00,791
or it's equal to A to the fourth power

70
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,042
and of course we still have the divided by three

71
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:10,567
either way we got the same answer
