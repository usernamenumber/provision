1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,480
I wanna do a quick refresher on medians of triangles

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,200
also explore interesting property of them that would be useful,

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,680
think,to a future problem so let me just draw an arbitrary,

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,400
an arbitrary triangle over here, now that's good enough

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,020
Now a median of the triangle, and we'll see the median,

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,300
a triangle has 3 of them, it's just a line that connects

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,500
a vertex of a triangle with the midpoint of the opposite sides,

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,550
so the opposite sides midpoint looks like right about there,

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,020
this length is equal to the length, and so this is a median,

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,180
close enough

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,800
And of course we have 3 vertexes, we'll have 3 medians

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,140
if start at this vertex, we wanna go to the midpoint

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,630
of the opposite side, it looks like it's right about there

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,370
so this blue line over here is another median

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,910
It's not a completely straight line but you get the idea

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,590
And we can also do it from this point, right over here,

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,860
draw a line from this vertex to the mid point of the opposite side

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,240
let's see the midpoint of the opposite side is there

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,800
And we draw a line, each of these;

20
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,950
I can draw a straighter "line" than that

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,580
We draw, well think you get the idea

22
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,770
These are all medians of this triangle

23
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,060
And what's next about medians,

24
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,610
is that all 3 medians always intersect in one point

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,610
And that by itself is a pretty neat property

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,170
That one point that they intersect is a called a centroid

27
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,340
It's called a centroid, it's called the centroid

28
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,040
And if this was a physical triangle, let's say you made it out of iron,

29
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,720
and if you were to toss it, or even before you toss it,

30
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,670
the centroid would actually be the center of mass

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,930
Let's say this is an iron triangle,

32
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,570
lets say right here this is an iron triangle,

33
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,690
that has it's centroid right over here,

34
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,040
then this iron's triangle center of mass would be the centroid is,

35
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,490
assuming the uniform density, and if you would have thrown,

36
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,830
it would have rotate, it would have rotate around this points,

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,100
around, around, assuming it had some a rotational motion

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,620
around that centroid, around the center mass

39
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,300
But anyway the point of this video is not to focus on physics

40
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,200
and throwing iron, triangles

41
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,610
The point here is, I wanna show you a neat properties of medians

42
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,350
and the property is the distance from, if you pick any median

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,240
the distance from the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite side

44
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,550
so this distance is gonna be half of this distance

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,280
So this distance right here is A, then this distance right here is 2A

46
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,940
Or another way to think about this,

47
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,440
this distance is 2/3 of the length of the entire median

48
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,230
And this distance right here is 1/3 of the length of the entire median

49
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,970
And let's just prove it for ourselves,

50
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,940
just so you don't have to take things, take things on faith

51
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,650
And to do that I'll draw an arbitrary triangle,

52
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,130
I'll do a 2 dimensional triangle, I'll even do a 3 dimensions,

53
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,670
at least in my mind it makes the math,

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,800
it makes the math a little bit easier

55
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,850
In general whenever you take a,

56
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,660
Whenever you have N dimensional

57
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,060
that you embed on an N +1 dimension,

58
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,410
it makes the math a little bit easier

59
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,360
That actually tetrahedron problem we did,

60
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,070
you can actually embed a four dimension

61
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,170
that would make the math easier,

62
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,100
it's much harder to visualize because I didn't do it that way

63
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,050
So lets just have an arbitrary triangle,

64
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,650
let's say it has a vertex there, a vertex there and a vertex there

65
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,810
I'm not making any assumptions about the triangle

66
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,130
I'm not saying its an isosceles and equilateral, anything,

67
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,940
its just an arbitrary triangle

68
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,010
8And so lets say its coordinate, lets say its coordinate right over here is,

69
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,870
I call this the X-axis, this is the X-axis, this the Y-axis and the Z-axis,

70
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,160
I know some of you are already used to swapping these two axis

71
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,930
but it doesn't make a different so lets call this coordinator right here

72
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,570
A, 0, 0 so it's A along the X-axis

73
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,790
Let's call this coordinate 0, B, 0

74
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,470
Let's call this coordinate up here 0, 0, 0, C

75
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,350
So if you connect the points, you're gonna have a triangle

76
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,790
You're going to have a triangle just like that

77
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,310
Now the centroid of a triangle especially in 3 dimensions

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,920
the centroid of is going to be the average,

79
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,090
the average of the coordinates of the vertexes

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,740
or the coordinate of the centroid, the coordinate of the centorid here

81
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,650
its just gonna be the average of the coordinates of the vertexes

82
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,320
So the coordinate right this over here is gonna be,

83
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,940
so for the x coordinate we have 0, 0, 0 + A

84
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,500
so we have 3 coordinates they add up to A so we have to divide up by 3 so its

85
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,420
A over 3

86
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,930
The Y coordinate is gonna be B+0+B+0 they add to B, but we have 3 off them

87
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,230
And the same thing we do it for the for the Z coordinate,

88
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,360
the average is gonna C, it's C over 3 and

89
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,730
I'm not proving anything to right here, you can verify it for yourself,

90
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,290
but its going to be the average, figuring out what this line is,

91
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,310
this ine is and this line is

92
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,530
This centroid or the center of this mass of this triangle,

93
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,340
if it had some

94
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,360
mass is just the average of these coordinates

95
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,270
Now what we wanna do is use this information,

96
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,260
let's just use this coordinate

97
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,410
and compare just using the distance formula,

98
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,190
lets compare this distance, lets compare this distance

99
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:26,140
up here in orange to this distance down here, down here in yellow

100
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,600
And remember this point down here, this is the point

101
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,280
the median of this, of this bottom side right over here, so the median of this bottom side

102
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,670
Is just gonna be the average of the these two points

103
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,650
and so the X coordinates 0 plus A

104
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,630
B + 0 over 2 is gonna be B over 2

105
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,340
And then it has no Z coordinates so it's just gonna be 0

106
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,170
0 + 0 over 2 = 0

107
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,150
So we know the coordinates for this point, that point and that point

108
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,610
so we can calculate the yellow distance

109
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,460
and we can calculate the orange distance

110
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,570
So lets calculate the orange distance

111
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,770
So that is gonna be equal to the square root of, square root,

112
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,820
The orange disntace is going to be the square root of,

113
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,620
which we'll take the difference of each of these point square

114
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,830
so it's A over 3 minus 0 squared,

115
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,830
that's gonna be A square over nine over 9

116
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,580
so that's gonna plus B over three minus 0 square over 9,

117
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:31,680
plus C over 3, minus C which is negative 2/3, that's negative 2/3

118
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,680
and we want to square that, so we're gonna have positive

119
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:41,320
4 over 9 positive C square, did I do that right?

120
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:48,070
C over 3, so 1/3 minus 1 is negative 2/3, so this is negative 2/3 C,

121
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,390
you square it, you're gonna get 4 9 C squar

122
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,650
So that's the orange distance, now let's calculate,

123
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,390
and if we wanna do it we can actually,

124
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,320
we can express it a little simpler than this ,

125
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,720
this is the same thing as a square root

126
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:08,540
of A square + B square + 4 C square over the square root of 9,

127
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,580
which is just, that's just equal to that's just, the equal to 3

128
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,170
So lets do the same thing with the yellow distance

129
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:26,360
so if gona be equal to have A over 2 - A over 3

130
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,720
so 1/2 minuses 1/3 that's the same thing

131
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:39,730
as 3/6 minuses 2/6 so 1/6 A square over 36

132
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,360
B over 2 minus B over 3 is B over 6, you square it,

133
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,090
you got plus B square over 36

134
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,690
An then finally you have 0 minus C over 3

135
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,370
over square, that's gonna be a C square over nine

136
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,840
that's when we get a common denominator

137
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:04,610
C square over nine is the same things as plus 4 C square over 36

138
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,250
and we can rewrite this as a square root of

139
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:14,940
A + B square + Four C square over 9

140
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,210
So you can see this distance right here,

141
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,950
if you multiply this orange distance by 1/2

142
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,080
you're going to get, so if you multiply by 1/2

143
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,370
or you divide it by 2, so if you multiply by 1/2

144
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,110
you get the yellow distance

145
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,540
So this is always gonna be twice the disntsaces

146
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,100
So we do this in the most general possible way,

147
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,480
we assume nothing about this triangle

148
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,510
Remember that little property the centroid,

149
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,340
the if the intersection of the medians,

150
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:44,020
if the intersection happens 2/3s along every median

151
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,740
2/3s away from the vertex or 1/3 away

152
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,360
of the length of median away from the midpoint of the opposite side

153
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,680
