1
00:00:00,075 --> 00:00:01,264
So in my last video,

2
00:00:01,264 --> 00:00:02,646
I joked about folding and cutting

3
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:03,914
spheres instead of paper.

4
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:05,375
But then I thought, why not?

5
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:06,720
I mean, finite symmetry groups

6
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,797
on the Euclidean plane are fun and all.

7
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:10,563
But there are really only two types:

8
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:12,305
some amount of mirror lines around a point,

9
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:14,563
and some amount of rotations around a point.

10
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:16,554
Spherical patterns are much more fun.

11
00:00:16,554 --> 00:00:18,321
And I happen to be a huge fan of some of

12
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:22,443
these symmetry groups – maybe just a little bit.

13
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:23,865
Although snowflakes are actually

14
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:25,002
three dimensional. (3-D.)

15
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:26,250
This snowflake doesn't just have

16
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,442
lines of mirror symmetry –

17
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:29,389
but planes of mirror symmetry.

18
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:31,529
And there's one more mirror plane –

19
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,998
the one going flat through the snowflake –

20
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:36,389
because one side of the paper mirrors the other.

21
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:37,750
And you can imagine that snowflake

22
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,827
suspended in this sphere –

23
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:41,021
so that we can draw the mirror lines more easily.

24
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:43,114
Now this sphere has the same symmetry

25
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:45,183
as this 3-D paper snowflake.

26
00:00:45,183 --> 00:00:46,497
If you're studying group theory,

27
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:48,446
you could label this with group theory stuff.

28
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:48,918
But whatever.

29
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,619
I'm going to fold this sphere on these lines,

30
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,092
and then cut it – and that will give me

31
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:53,437
something with the same symmetry

32
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:55,075
as a paper snowflake – except on this sphere.

33
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:55,789
And it's a mess.

34
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,137
So let's glue it to another sphere.

35
00:00:57,137 --> 00:01:00,110
And now it's perfect and beautiful in every way.

36
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,580
But the point is it's equivalent to this snowflake –

37
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,431
as far as symmetry is concerned.

38
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,963
Okay, so that's your regular old six-fold snowflake.

39
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:09,208
But I've seen pictures of twelve-fold snowflakes.

40
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,399
How do they work?

41
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:11,785
Sometimes stuff goes a little oddly

42
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:13,842
at the very beginning of snowflake formation,

43
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:15,553
and two snowflakes sprout, basically,

44
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:17,949
on top of each other – but turned 30 degrees.

45
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:19,518
If you think of them as one flat thing,

46
00:01:19,518 --> 00:01:20,864
it has twelve-fold symmetry.

47
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:23,040
But in 3-D, it's not really true.

48
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,569
The layers make it so there's

49
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:26,192
not a plane of symmetry here.

50
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:27,968
See. The branch on the left is on top.

51
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:29,037
While in the mirror image,

52
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:30,846
the branch on the right is on top.

53
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:31,981
So, is it just the same symmetry

54
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:33,651
as a normal six-fold snowflake?

55
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:35,879
What about that seventh plane of symmetry?

56
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,271
But no, through this plane,

57
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,156
one side doesn't mirror the other.

58
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:41,117
There's no extra plane of symmetry.

59
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:42,612
But there's something cooler –

60
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:44,422
rotational symmetry.

61
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:45,786
If you rotate this around this line,

62
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:47,209
you get the same thing –

63
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,894
the branch on the left is still on top.

64
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:50,645
If you imagine it floating in a sphere,

65
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:52,329
you can draw the mirror lines,

66
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,937
and then you have twelve points

67
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:55,313
of rotational symmetry.

68
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:57,673
So I can fold, then slit it, so I can [indistinct]

69
00:01:57,673 --> 00:01:59,411
around the rotation point.

70
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,764
And cut out each 'sphereflake'

71
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:04,209
with the same symmetry as this. Perfect.

72
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:04,993
And you can fold spheres

73
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:06,816
other ways to get others patterns.

74
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:08,993
Okay. What about fancier stuff like this?

75
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:10,446
Well, all I need to do is figure out

76
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:11,700
the symmetry to fold it.

77
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,061
So, say we have a cube.

78
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:14,669
What are the planes of symmetry?

79
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,307
It's symmetric around this way,

80
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:18,169
and this way, and this way.

81
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:19,499
Anything else?

82
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:21,668
How about diagonally across this way?

83
00:02:21,668 --> 00:02:23,867
But in the end, we have all the fold lines.

84
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:24,953
And now, we just need to fold

85
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:26,494
the sphere along those lines

86
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:28,671
to get just one little triangle thing.

87
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:29,525
And once we do,

88
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,169
we can unfold it to get something

89
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:32,545
with the same symmetry as a cube.

90
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:34,026
And, of course, you have to do something

91
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:35,061
with tetrahedral symmetry,

92
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:36,530
as long as you're there.

93
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,551
And, of course, you really

94
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:38,575
want to do icosahedral.

95
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,988
But the plastic is thick and imperfect,

96
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:41,005
and a complete mess.

97
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:41,851
So who knows what's going on.

98
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,366
But at least you could try some other ones

99
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:45,704
with rotational symmetry and other stuff –

100
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:46,573
and make a mess.

101
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:47,750
And soon, you're going to want to fold and cut

102
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,742
the very fabric of space itself to get awesome

103
00:02:49,742 --> 00:02:51,067
infinite 3-D symmetry groups,

104
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,839
such as the one water molecules follow

105
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,784
when they pack together into solid ice crystals.

106
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:56,586
And before you know it,

107
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:58,006
you'll be playing with multidimensional

108
00:02:58,006 --> 00:02:58,998
quasi-crystallography,

109
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:00,420
or lie algebras or something.

110
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,925
So you should probably just stop now.
