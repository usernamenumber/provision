1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,070
We're on problem 207.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:13,220
If n is equal to 4p,where p is a prime number greater than 2,

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,990
how many different positive,

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,260
even divisors does n have including n?

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,840
So how many integers go into n, or go into 4p?

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,160
Well, definitely 4 goes into it,

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,410
because this is going to be a multiple of 4.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,900
Then anything that goes into 4 will also go into it.

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:39,030
So 2 goes into it. 2 is also a divisor. p would go into it.

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,580
Are there any other numbers that go into p? No, p is prime.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,810
Well, you know 1 goes into p.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
But they wanted to know the different positive,even divisors.

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,070
So, the positive-- we're just dealing in the positive world.

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,620
That just lets us know this isn't some trick question

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,070
where we have to count negative numbers.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,920
But they want even divisors. So, first of all, 1 is not even.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,080
So that can't be it. The second question, is p even?

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,740
Well,by definition,if p was even, and if it's greater than 2,

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,200
it would be divisible by 2.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,770
So it wouldn't be able to be prime.

21
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,530
But they tell us that p is prime.

22
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,640
P is prime and it's greater than 2.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,150
So it can't be divisible by 2. So it has to be odd.

24
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,010
So this is also not an even divisor.

25
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,600
So there's only two even divisors, 4 and 2.

26
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,120
So the answer is 2. A.

27
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:33,730
Problem 208. S is a set containing 9 different numbers.

28
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:44,040
T is a set containing 8 numbers,all of which are members of S

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,490
Which of the following statements cannot be true?

30
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,480
The mean of S is equal to the mean of T.

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,090
So, let's think about this a little bit.

32
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,690
So, choice A, that their averages are equal to each other.

33
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:05,250
Let's just say that set S is equal to 1 through 9,

34
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:14,180
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So what would its mean be?

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,370
Well its mean, if you average all these numbers,

36
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,190
if you average 1 and 9, you get 5.

37
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,460
If you average 2 and 8, you get 5.

38
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,990
If you average 3 and 7, you get 5.

39
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,250
You average 4 and 6, you get 5.

40
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,930
If you average 5, you get 5. So the average is 5.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,020
So if this is S, what if T were this?

42
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,540
What if T were just this right here?

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,040
Let me label that. That's T.

44
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,600
That's not 7. That's T.

45
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,030
Then S is everything. So, it's T plus the 5.

46
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,600
So the average of all the numbers in T, if you average

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,010
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, your average is going to be 5.

48
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,060
If you think about it, the average of 4 and 6 is 5.

49
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,640
The average of 3 and 7 is 5. I think you get the idea.

50
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,080
You could work it out if you like.

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,930
If you were to take set S,

52
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,010
which is all of these numbers plus the number 5,

53
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,260
if you add 5 to a set of numbers whose average is 5,

54
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,000
the average is still going to be 5. So A definitely works.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,460
B, The median of S is equal to the median of T.

56
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,040
Well, once again, that's true with this set.

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,000
This is a good set to work with.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It proves everything we need to prove.

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,630
What's the median of T. It's the middle number in T.

60
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,980
There's 8 numbers,

61
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,060
so you have to average the middle two numbers.

62
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,850
So, if you average the middle two numbers in T,

63
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:42,000
4 and 6, you get 5. So 5 is median of T.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,420
Then what's the median of S? Well, now S includes the 5.

65
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,000
So you can put all these numbers in order.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,110
So 5 is the middle number. So 5 is also the median of S.

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,480
So, both of these can happen, A or B.

68
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,010
Choice C, the range of S is equal to the range of T.

69
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,240
The range of a set is just the difference

70
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,050
between the highest and lowest number.

71
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,970
Then the range of S is equal to what?

72
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,050
The highest number in S is 9. The lowest number in S is 1.

73
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,750
So that equals 9 minus 1, which is equal to 8.

74
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,530
What's the range of T? Well the highest number in T is 9.

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,370
The lowest number is 1. 9 minus 1 is equal to 8.

76
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,060
So this one can definitely be true.

77
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:34,030
Statement D, the mean of S is greater than the mean of T.

78
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:40,060
Well, sure. Instead of this being a 5, what if this was a 50?

79
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,790
Now all of a sudden the average of T would still be 5.

80
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,170
But if you threw this 50 in there for S,

81
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,000
your average is going to go a good bit above 5.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,770
So statement D could definitely work if you just

83
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,150
make that extra number that's in S a lot larger number.

84
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,280
Then statement E,

85
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,970
which I'm guessing is the choice it cannot be true

86
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,000
because we could figure out a case for all of A through D.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,560
The range of S is less than the range of T.

88
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,460
So the range of the difference between the highest and the

89
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,070
lowest.

90
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,040
No matter what,

91
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,000
the range of S has to be at least as large as the range of T.

92
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,600
Think about it.

93
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,550
In this case, the range of T is 9 minus 1, which is 8.

94
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,370
You could make the range of S larger if you use 50.

95
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,130
If 50 was the extra number, then the range is 50 minus 1.

96
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,720
But considering that all of these numbers in T are also in S,

97
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,220
the difference between the highest number in T and the

98
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,420
lowest number in T has to be less than

99
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,120
or equal to the range of S.

100
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,700
So they're saying the opposite,

101
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,180
the range of S is less than the range of T.

102
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,670
We know this cannot be true because T is a subset of S.

103
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,240
So the choice is E.

104
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:09,500
Next problem-- it took me more time that I wanted to-- 209,

105
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,650
How many different positive integers are factors of 441?

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,030
Well, essentially it's just factoring it.

107
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,970
Well let's see, this should be divisible by-- let's see,

108
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,060
4 plus 4 is 8 plus 1 is 9-- so this should be divisible by 3.

109
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:37,000
So 3 goes into 441. 1 times 3 is 1.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,850
Bring down a 4, it goes in it 4 times, 12,

111
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:51,010
and then you get 21, 27. So, you get 3 times 147.

112
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,440
3 should also go into this, because 1 plus 4 plus 7 is 12,

113
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,060
which is divisible by 3. So 3 goes into 147.

114
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:08,040
147, you go 4 times 12, 27, 49 times.

115
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,050
So let's just do a prime factorization of 441.

116
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,990
You get 3 and 147.

117
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:25,790
147 factors into 3 and 27, which then factors into 3 and 9,

118
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,000
which then factors into 3 and 3. OK.

119
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,960
So I didn't realize, but this is a link .

120
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,410
This is the same thing as 3 to the fifth. Is that right?

121
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,570
Oh no, sorry. I made a mistake. Let me redo this.

122
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,010
3 goes into 147 not 27 times, but 49 times.

123
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:56,100
So then this is, if you you prime factorization, a 7 and a 7.

124
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,030
I was about to say, 441 isn't 3 to the fifth power.

125
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,050
So let's write that down here.

126
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,430
Let me do it in a different color.

127
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,400
I don't want to be confusing.

128
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:11,410
So 441 is equal to 3 times 3 times 7 times 7.

129
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,470
So if they want to know how many different positive integers

130
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,740
are factors, so all you have to think about is how many

131
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,470
positive integers can I construct with two 3's and two 7's

132
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,140
So let's just list them. 3 definitely works.

133
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,920
3 times 3 will definitely work. Well, let's go in order.

134
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,060
7 will definitely work. 3 times 3 will work. That's 9.

135
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:42,550
3 times 7 would work. 21. 3 times 49 will work.

136
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,630
3 times 7 times 7, so 3 times 49 will work,

137
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,060
which was actually 147. 147 works.

138
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:59,030
Then 9 times 7 would work, which is 63. 9 times 7.

139
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:05,080
Then you have 9 times 7 times 7. That's essentially 441.

140
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,020
Let me make sure I haven't missed any combinations.

141
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,110
You have one 3 and one 7. So you have a 3 and a 7.

142
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:18,850
You have a 3 and two 7's. You have two 3's and a 7.

143
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,910
Then you could have two 3's and two 7's.

144
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,470
Then, of course, you have the 3 and the 7.

145
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,390
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 numbers.

146
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:39,160
Here I have 1, 2, 3-- what am I missing here?

147
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,800
So, I have a 3, 7-- oh, of course.

148
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,590
I'm actually missing the 3 times the 3,

149
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,860
and I'm missing the 7 times the 7.

150
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:58,970
So, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 factors of which 441--

151
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,810
and that's not one of the choices.

152
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,540
How many different positives integers?

153
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,140
Oh, and of course, the number 1.

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So, how many does that come to?

155
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,420
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 numbers. So, that is D.

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,670
There must be a faster way of doing that.

157
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,140
I'll let you think about that one. Anyway.

158
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,070
See you in the next video.
