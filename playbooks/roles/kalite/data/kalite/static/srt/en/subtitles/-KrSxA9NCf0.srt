1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,850
Let's talk a little bit about
what I'll call the Plutsky

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,830
Plan, because it came from
my friend, Todd Plutsky.

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,940
But I think it's a good plan.

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,200
But let's think about a little
bit of its repercussions and

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,470
see if it's more or less likely
to actually work.

7
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,800
Well first of all, you know, I
threw out in the last video 50

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,820
banks, maybe that's logistically
difficult.

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,390
Instead of having 50 banks
with $14 billion initial

10
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,830
capital, maybe you do five banks
with $140 forty billion

11
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,470
initial capital.

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,430
But the point being is that you
should have more than one

13
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,430
bank, it shouldn't be too big to
fail, and you should try to

14
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,790
instill some type of
competition there.

15
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,510
But because they have pristine
balance sheets, all of these

16
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,860
banks are going to be able to
lever 10:1, which we know

17
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,870
isn't crazy.

18
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,950
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley
and all the likes have

19
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,940
been leveraging up 30 to 40:1.

20
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,190
So 10:1 is normal for a bank.

21
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,560
And frankly, they're probably
going to be able to attract a

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,420
lot more-- you know we said
foreign governments probably

23
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,410
would be willing to lend to
them, the private sector is

24
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,750
willing to lend to them.

25
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,170
If these are commercial banks,
which means that they can take

26
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,930
deposits, a lot of people are
going to be willing to

27
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,980
essentially put their money with
this bank because it has

28
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,290
a clean balance sheet, and
essentially it'll be owned

29
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,560
individually by the American
people, and it will have the

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,150
federal backstop above and
beyond the FDIC insurance

31
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,030
limit and all that.

32
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,230
Although I do like the
one provision to

33
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,430
increase the FDIC caps.

34
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,550
Maybe I'll do the insurance
caps on deposits.

35
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,380
But it will actually be able
attract a lot of deposits from

36
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,170
everyday people.

37
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,920
They'll feel safer
with these banks.

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,760
So in terms of whether you'll
be able to capitalize these

39
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,810
banks and lever up 10:1,
I don't think

40
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,290
there's an issue there.

41
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,080
Then there's a question, will
it solve the fundamental

42
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,230
problem of keeping credit
markets flowing to those

43
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,720
people that it needs
to keep credit to?

44
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,560
Well we already said it'll have
no trouble being able to

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,380
have access to funds above and
beyond how much the government

46
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,650
capitalizes it with.

47
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,840
It'll be able to attract
deposits, it'll be able to

48
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,280
attract investment from the
private sector and from

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,520
international money, especially
with this five year

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,720
government backstop.

51
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,050
So it will be able to
essentially put 10 times this

52
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,770
money back into the system.

53
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,930
So if you take $700 billion
collectively, this will

54
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,090
introduce 10 times as much.

55
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,045
So $7 trillion of new loans.

56
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:18,040
   

57
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,480
So this $7 trillion -- I mean
that's literally half of the

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,320
American GDP.

59
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,770
I mean you might argue that is
too much -- that might provide

60
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,310
too much credit, and it might go
from, you know, thawing to

61
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,640
overheating credit markets.

62
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,630
So then you might say well if
$7 trillion is too much

63
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,320
liquidity, well why don't we
just reduce this number a

64
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,910
little bit.

65
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,450
Instead of saying $700 billion,
why don't you make it

66
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,670
a $100 billion, right?

67
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,550
Because then $100 billion, if
you do 10 banks with $10

68
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,640
billion each, so you introduce
$100 billion.

69
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,050
They all lever up because it's
all new liabilities and new

70
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,880
assets, clean balance sheets,
it'll introduce $1 trillion of

71
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,260
new loans that it can go put
to work for people building

72
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,000
factories and doing
real things.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,810
And because their incentive is
not to bail out their friends,

74
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,060
it's not to help out the
companies they used to work

75
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,300
for, the companies that are
donating to them in some way

76
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,920
or contributing to them, or
promising jobs in some way.

77
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,580
It won't go -- this $1 trillion
is not going to go to

78
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,150
buy assets at higher prices
than they should.

79
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,310
You know it could go to buy
assets at discount prices if

80
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,150
the new managers of these banks
do see a good return.

81
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,710
But most probably they'll invest
it in areas of the

82
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,600
economy where they do see a
positive return on investment.

83
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,570
And one person had sent me a
note and said, hey, wouldn't

84
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,640
introducing all of this
liquidity into the financial

85
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,820
system, whether it's $7 trillion
or $1 trillion,

86
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,930
wouldn't that lead to
hyperinflation?

87
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,680
And I'll probably do a whole
series on inflation.

88
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,770
I think there's a lot of
misunderstanding around it.

89
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:56,010
In general, if anyone makes a
positive investment -- so if I

90
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,270
have $1 and I make it an
investment where it generates

91
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,480
$1.20 of benefit, that
by definition is not

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,160
inflationary.

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,120
Because I had $1 in the world
and I created $1.20 of wealth.

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,990
So actually, the pie
gets bigger.

95
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,970
A good way to think about
inflation -- I'll do a lot

96
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,529
about this because it is a
very abstract concept.

97
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,310
Let's say this is the
pie of goods and

98
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,250
services in the world.

99
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,290
Or let's just say
a country right?

100
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,370
Goods and services.

101
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,130
Goods and services in a year.

102
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,230
You could say it's our
GDP, or however you

103
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,800
want to measure it.

104
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,570
Goods and services
in a year, right?

105
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,580
That's the goods and
services in a year.

106
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,980
And let's say I have another
pool of the amount of money

107
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,800
there is in a given year.

108
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,120
So money.

109
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,080
And the money supply is an
interesting thing, because

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,300
it's not just dependent
on the amount of

111
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,080
physical coins or dollars.

112
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,980
It also is a function of how
quickly those transact and how

113
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,900
much leverage there
is in the system.

114
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,130
So you can actually have a whole
economy where everyone

115
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,650
just has one dollar bill, but
every time someone needs

116
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,070
something from someone
else, they exchange

117
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,830
that one dollar bill.

118
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,390
So that one dollar bill gets
used, you know, 15 trillion

119
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,010
times a year.

120
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,970
So you'd actually have $15
trillion of money, because the

121
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,500
velocity would be so high.

122
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,240
But anyway let's just say that
this is the pool of money.

123
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,620
If this pool, the pool of money
grows faster than the

124
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,870
actual goods and services and
the actual productive capacity

125
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,810
of that country, then
you have inflation.

126
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,240
So if this circle grows
faster than this

127
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,290
one you have inflation.

128
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,270
If this circle grows
faster than this

129
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,540
circle, you have deflation.

130
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,900
You have the same, or you have
some amount of money

131
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,000
representing more goods and
services, so goods and

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,120
services actually
become cheaper.

133
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,690
And the problem that we're
talking about right now, this

134
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,590
credit crisis, this is a problem
of deleveraging, where

135
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,850
the government injects a dollar
into this current

136
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,220
broken banking system, and
instead of that dollar -- you

137
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,950
know, the normal system is you
lend a dollar to a bank, so

138
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,410
you lend $1 to a bank,
and then, let's say

139
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,110
this is the Fed right?

140
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,660
This is how they inject
liquidity.

141
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,440
They lend a dollar to a bank.

142
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,690
Let me draw a bank here.

143
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,850
Then that bank has to keep -- it
can only lever 10:1-- so it

144
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,140
essentially has to keep in
reserve $0.10 of that dollar,

145
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,490
but then it lends $0.90 to
somebody else, to another

146
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,530
bank, right?

147
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,370
Then that other bank has to keep
10% of that, so it lends

148
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,370
$0.81 to someone else.

149
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,610
And then that someone else can
lend whatever $0.81 times 0.9

150
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,710
is, so I don't know,
seventy-something cents to

151
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,160
someone else.

152
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,970
But you get the idea, that in a
normal, functioning banking

153
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,810
system, one dollar injected
into the system has this

154
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,900
multiplier effect,
so it actually

155
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,000
creates a lot of money.

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
And that's what people are
implicitly talking about when

157
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,920
they talk about the
printing press.

158
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,100
But what's going on right now is
the Fed lends $1 to Bank A,

159
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,290
but Bank A is so scared that it
doesn't lend out to anyone

160
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,580
else, it just keeps
that dollar.

161
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,870
Because right now their main
priority isn't to try to get a

162
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,090
little bit of incremental
interest on whatever money

163
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,350
they have, their main priority
is survival.

164
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,770
So that dollar just goes
into a black hole.

165
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,080
And so that's what the
Fed's frustration is.

166
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,490
It keeps lending money into
the system but that money

167
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,770
keeps disappearing.

168
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,105
And actually as the economy
slows, the velocity of money

169
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:18,530
is going to slow down as well.

170
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,250
So the main problem when you
have a credit crisis and when

171
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,500
you have a recession
is actually the

172
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,340
money supply shrinks.

173
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,970
The amount of goods and services
probably shrinks as

174
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,830
well, but the money supply
shrinks even more.

175
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,200
So your main problem
is deflation.

176
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,660
And you know, that was the
main problem in the Great

177
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,025
Depression, and that was
the main problem in

178
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,040
the Japanese crisis.

179
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,430
And you know, Ben Bernanke, he's
written papers about this

180
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:47,000
and he's like, well you can
always cure deflation by

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,680
printing money and dropping
money from a helicopter.

182
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,110
Well to some degree that's
what they've already been

183
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,200
trying to do.

184
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,700
They've already been-- the Fed's
been willing to take

185
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,450
pretty large credit risks on
bank and lending money into

186
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:00,930
the system.

187
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,440
But the problem is, if this
multiplier effect is

188
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,390
disappearing at a faster rate
than you are dropping money

189
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,970
from a helicopter, you still
have deflation, right?

190
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,220
Before when you not only let
people lever 10:1, you let

191
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,840
them lever 30:1 and 40:1, every
dollar you put in the

192
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,660
system became $40 that was given
to someone else, and

193
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,370
then they could lever up.

194
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,670
So you had this huge
explosion of money.

195
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,235
And frankly, the only reason why
we didn't have inflation--

196
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:29,770
I mean the last 5, 10 years
we had this huge

197
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,950
explosion of money.

198
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,390
And the only reason why it
didn't, at least in measurable

199
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,720
inflation, show up, is that
on the other side of the

200
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,590
equation, you had all of this
new productive capacity come

201
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,679
on line in China and India.

202
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,780
And so manufactured goods
got a lot cheaper.

203
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,190
But in things that were not
manufactured goods, like

204
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,430
commodities, like homes, you had
this huge asset inflation.

205
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,870
Or even college tuition, or
healthcare-- things that are

206
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,525
dependent on American labor--
became hugely expensive, and

207
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:02,890
that's because you had this
huge, huge infusion-- you

208
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,170
know, there's different ways
to measure money, but the

209
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,490
broadest indicator, which is
called M3-- and I know I'm

210
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,890
kind of going out of the domain,
but I'll make a bunch

211
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,780
of videos on this.

212
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,310
The broadest indicator, M3,
which the government stopped

213
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,910
officially reporting, exploded
because there was so much

214
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,780
leverage in the system.

215
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,650
Now things are-- the exact
opposite is happening.

216
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,440
The leverage is disappearing
from the system.

217
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,120
There's no lending
to each other.

218
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,760
Everyone is going from 1:30
leverage to 1:10 leverage.

219
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,000
So money is actually
disappearing in the system.

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,430
The velocity is slowing.

221
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,630
This is shrinking, but this is
shrinking more, no matter what

222
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,560
the Fed is doing.

223
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,370
And frankly, this new $700
billion bail out, I personally

224
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,800
think this is the helicopter
that Ben Bernanke always

225
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,040
talked about using.

226
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,940
And whenever you're going to
drop money from a helicopter,

227
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,220
the question is, where
do you drop it?

228
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,650
And they think they should drop
it into an already broken

229
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,770
banking system.

230
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,620
The point of this video and the
last is maybe you should

231
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,380
just drop it into a new banking
system, or maybe you

232
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,480
just drop it into everyone's
pockets and see what happens.

233
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,110
And you let new banks
form where they can.

234
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,710
Anyway, that's all
for this video.

235
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,690
I know it was a little
bit rambling.

236
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,840
But hopefully you learned
a little bit.

237
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,620
See you in the next video.
