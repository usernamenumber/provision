1
00:00:00,502 --> 00:00:04,350
The table below shows solar panel installations by state

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,434
during the last fiscal year.

3
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:10,236
How many total solar panels were installed

4
00:00:10,236 --> 00:00:12,810
last year in Wyoming?

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,314
So we look at the state –

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,569
So this right over here is Wyoming.

7
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:18,236
And this whole table is about

8
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:21,570
solar installations by state during the last year.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,401
So this is Wyoming during the last year.

10
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,552
This is the first quarter – so the first three months.

11
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:28,633
The second three months.

12
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:29,835
The third quarter.

13
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:31,139
The fourth quarter.

14
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:32,298
And then this right over here

15
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,570
is the total number of solar panels

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,434
that were installed in Wyoming last year –

17
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:36,881
which is what I think they're asking us for.

18
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:38,037
So let's just type that it in.

19
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,486
104.

20
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:40,368
We got it right.

21
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:41,653
Let's do another one.

22
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:42,769
The table below indicates

23
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:44,651
the points scored by four players

24
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:46,700
in a charity basketball game.

25
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,035
How many points did Ben have in total?

26
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:51,124
So here's Ben right over.

27
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:52,356
it's broken down by quarter –

28
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:54,217
but we care about his total number of points –

29
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:55,821
which is 31.

30
00:00:55,821 --> 00:01:00,481
So Ben had a total of 31 points.

31
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:02,154
So this indicates the points scored

32
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:04,703
by four players in a charity basketball game again.

33
00:01:04,703 --> 00:01:05,792
How many points did Vanessa score in the fourth quarter?

34
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,589
So let's look at –

35
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:08,670
This is Vanessa.

36
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:12,678
And we care about the fourth-quarter.

37
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:16,078
So she scored four points in the fourth quarter.

38
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:18,479
Put 4 right over there.

39
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,743
All right.

40
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:22,381
So once again we're talking about solar panel installations

41
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,743
by state during the last fiscal year.

42
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:26,617
How many solar panels were installed

43
00:01:26,617 --> 00:01:30,047
in Alabama in the second quarter – in 'Q2?'

44
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:33,210
So Alabama [and] in the second quarter?

45
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,277
So that's this right over here.

46
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:38,945
28 solar panels were installed.

47
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:42,665
So 28.

48
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:44,786
So this is, once again, in a charity game.

49
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:47,001
How many points of Kevin scored third quarter.

50
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:51,848
So Kevin in the third quarters he scored nine points.

51
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:53,209
Maybe one more – just for fun.

52
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:57,543
So how many points did Gabriella score in the third quarter?

53
00:01:57,543 --> 00:01:58,697
Well, same idea.

54
00:01:58,697 --> 00:02:01,475
[Find] 'Gabriella.' [Find] 'third quarter.'

55
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:03,899
She scored five points.
