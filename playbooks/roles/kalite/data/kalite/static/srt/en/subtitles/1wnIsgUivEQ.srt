1
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:03,600
in the last video we proved that

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,133
the sum of all of the positive integers, up to and including n

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:12,067
can be expressed as n(n+1)/2

4
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:14,944
and we proved that by induction

5
00:00:14,944 --> 00:00:17,800
what I want to do in this video is show you that there is actually a simpler proof of that

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,667
but it's not by induction

7
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:22,867
so it wouldn't be included in that video, but I'll show you that it exists.

8
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:25,467
just so that you know that induction isn't the only way to prove it

9
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:27,800
so we defined that fuction s(n)

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:35,067
as the sum of all of the positive integers up to n including n

11
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:37,467
so this is equal to by definition

12
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:45,467
1+ 2+ 3 all the way to + (n-1) + n

13
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:48,200
so it's all the integers up to and including n

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,067
this is how we're defining it

15
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,000
well we can re-write it again

16
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:56,485
we can say that the sum S(n); we can write the same thing

17
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,000
but we can write it differently order

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
we can say that this is the same thing as n +( n -1 )+( n - 2 )

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,200
plus all the way down to + 2 + 1

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,000
well what does this do for us

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,333
we can actually add these two rows

22
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:21,533
if we add S(n) + S(n) we're going to get 2 times the sum

23
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:23,467
so we're just adding on the left

24
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,800
and then we can add on the right

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,867
so we're really just doing this sum twice

26
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:30,067
and what's interesting is how we're going to add it

27
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:33,667
we're going to add this term to this term; this term to this term

28
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,782
we're just trying to add these two things

29
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:37,333
we can pick any way we want to add them

30
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:44,267
(1 + n) is going to be( n + 1)

31
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:49,800
and then we're going to add 2 +( n - 1)

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,200
so what's that?

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Let me write that over here

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,133
2 +( n - 1)

35
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,067
is the same things as 2 + n - 1,

36
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,400
which is the same thing as n + 1

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,400
so this is also going to be n+1

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,267
and this term over here, 3 + n - 2

39
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:13,133
or n - 2 +3

40
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,733
that again is going to be n +1

41
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:19,200
and you're going to do that for every term until you get over here

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,267
n -1 +2; that's also going to be n+1

43
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:32,985
and then finally you have n+1 right over here

44
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:36,179
so what's this whole sum going to be

45
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:39,056
well how many of these n + 1's do we have?

46
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:40,892
well we have n of them

47
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:43,179
for every term in each of these sums

48
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:46,995
So there's 1, 2,3 count all of the way to n

49
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:51,748
So you have n of these n+1's

50
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:54,467
so if you add something to its self n times

51
00:02:55,482 --> 00:02:58,385
So you really have, this is exactly equivalent to

52
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:02,067
n times (n+1)

53
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:07,800
so two times the sum of all of the positive integers

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,800
up to an including in is going to be equal to n(n+1)

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,667
so if you divide both sides by 2 we get an expression for the sum

56
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:21,733
so the sum of the integers is going to be equal to

57
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:26,067
n(n+1) over 2

58
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:29,733
so here's a proof where we didn't have to use induction

59
00:03:29,733 --> 99:59:59,999
it's really a pure algebraic proof
