99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Part B

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Find the slope of the tangent line to the path of the particle time t = 3

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the slope of the tangent line is just going to be equal to

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
rate of change of y with the respect to x at that point

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is the same thing as dy dt over dx dt

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and dealing with differentials is a little bit strange.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Especially when you want to deal with them rigorously, but you can view them as very little small changes

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in y, small changes in t, small changes in x, small changes in t

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when you view it this way, you can say, "Oh look, if I just multiply both the numerator and the denominator

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by dt over dt, which if you do the same small changes, then they would cancel out and you'd get back

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the dy over dx

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the reason why I wrote it this way is that they actually give is these values

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they give us dy dt and they give us dx dt.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, if you wanted to find the slope at time equals 3,

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we just have to find dy dt at time equals 3 and dx dt and time equals 3.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So dy dt at time equals 2, why this is dy dt right over here,

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's just going to be sine of 3 squared, or sine of 9.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and dx dt at time 3, that's just going to be, it tells us what dx dt is,

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as a function of time, four times three plus one

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, that's thirteen. And we can just get out calculator out and evaluate this.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We kinda did alot of this work in the first problem, so let's just actually take the values.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have sine of nine divided by thirteen.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That gets us zero point zero three one seven (0.0317)

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're done, and that's the slope of the tangent line

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the path of the particle at time t is equal to three.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think we have time to crank out part C as well.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Part C: Find the position of the particle at time t is equal to three.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they give us x prime of t and they give us y prime of t.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is x-prime of t and this is y-prime of t. We need to figure out x of three and y of three.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's write x of t and y of t, and then evaluate them at three.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see. So x of t is going to be equal to the anti-derivative of this right over here.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the anti-derivative of four t is going to be two t squared.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Take the derivative here and you just get 4t.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Anti-derivative of one is t, plus t, and your going to have, well, plus a constant.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We just took that indefinite integral of this side of 4t plus 1,

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you get your constant here,

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
'cause if you take the derivative of this constant, the constant will obviously disappear,

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you'd like that information.
