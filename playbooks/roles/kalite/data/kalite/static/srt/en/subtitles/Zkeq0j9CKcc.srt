1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,410
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,530
We're now going to start section eight in test four.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,020
Let's start with problem number one.

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:14,470
Problem number one-- if 3 times n minus 4 is equal to 18,

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,310
what is n?

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,350
n is equal to what?

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,480
Let's divide both sides by 3.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,700
You get n minus 4 is equal to 6.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,970
Add 4 to both sides and you get n equals 10.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,460
And that is choice D.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,070
Problem number two. Right?

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,050
It was divided by-- well you know what I did.

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,220
Hopefully you know what I did.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,980
Two, for a class ring,

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,030
each senior can choose from 4 types of stones

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,770
and 3 types of metal.

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,230
How many combinations of a stone and metal are there?

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,360
Well, for each stone they can pick 3 different metals, right?

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,520
So there's 4-- because there's 4 different types of stones--

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,550
and each of them can have 3 different metals.

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:07,070
So it's 4 times 3 combinations which is choice D.

22
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,190
Next problem. Problem three.

23
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,400
If you ever doubt yourself on the first one or two problems

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,540
because it seems too easy,

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,340
you probably shouldn't doubt yourself,

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,570
because the first couple of problems tend to be

27
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,530
reasonably straightforward.

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,390
I was just doubting myself because I was like,

29
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,170
was I missing something? All right.

30
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:26,980
Problem number three.

31
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,070
The sum of 3a and the square root of b

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,500
is equal to the square of the sum of a and b.

33
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,530
Which of the following

34
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,520
is an expression for the statement above?

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,980
Well, I just wrote it out. It's choice B.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,620
But hopefully, as I talked it out, you saw what I was doing.

37
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,600
I said the sum of 3a and the square root of b--

38
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,870
this is the sum of 3a and the square root of b--

39
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,560
is equal to the sum of a plus b squared.

40
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,610
Or they said, equal to the square of the sum of a plus b.

41
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,770
Next problem. Problem four.

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,410
Carrie has a cordless telephone receiver

43
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,260
that can operate within a range of 1,000 feet.

44
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,200
1,000 foot range from the telephone's base.

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,640
Carrie takes the receiver from the base

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,740
and walks 800 feet due north. So this is the base and--

47
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,270
I don't know if Carrie is a boy or girl's name--

48
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,540
but Carrie walked 800 feet due north.

49
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,550
From that point she walks due east and stops

50
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,000
at the maximum range of the receiver.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,160
In which of the following directions can Carrie walk

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,280
and still be within range of the receiver?

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,320
So the range is essentially that

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,410
you can go 1,000 feet from this point b. Right?

55
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,290
And actually, let me draw it as a circle.

56
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,780
So I can go, at most-- so let me draw the circle here--

57
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,480
so let's say that this is the point b, that's the base.

58
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,040
Let's say Carrie's a guy.

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,840
Carrie can get at most 1,000 feet away from the receiver.

60
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,480
So the furthest distance that

61
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,730
Carrie can get from the receiver is 1,000 feet.

62
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,990
So this radius right here is 1,000 feet.

63
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,390
And in the problem, Carrie walks 800 feet due north.

64
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,790
So maybe right there. That's 800.

65
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:50,320
And then he walks due east to the range of the receiver.

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,580
So then walks east, which is this direction,

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,640
to the range of the receiver, which is right there.

68
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,230
And what they want to know is,

69
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,970
in which of the following directions can Carrie walk

70
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,430
and still be in range of the receiver?

71
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,170
Well, we know Carrie can't walk north because then

72
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,160
he or she will be out of range of the receiver.

73
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,520
Can't walk east.

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,010
It would be out of the range of the receiver.

75
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,680
But he or she can walk south or can walk back west, right?

76
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,420
So they can walk south or west.

77
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,270
And those are choices 2 and 3, which is choice E.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,490
Choice E is 2 and 3, which is due south or due west.

79
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,100
They can walk this way, south,or west, that way.

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:38,290
Next problem. Whoops. Problem five.

81
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:50,140
If x over 4 is equal to 2x over a, and x does not equal 0,

82
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,250
what is the value of a?

83
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,270
Well, we can divide both sides by x

84
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,640
because we know x doesn't equal 0,

85
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,560
because you can't divide by 0.

86
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,010
So this and this would cancel out, right?

87
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,560
We're dividing both sides by x.

88
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,600
So you get 1/4 is equal to 2 over a.

89
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,180
And you could eyeball this,

90
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,960
but if you want to do it mathematically,

91
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,530
you could say 1 times a is equal to 4 times 2, which is 8.

92
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,050
And you could have said, well 2 is 1/4 of what number?

93
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,380
Well it's 8. So a is equal to 8. Choice A.

94
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,980
Problem number six.

95
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,310
And we have a little drawing here to do.

96
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,860
Let's see, problem number six.

97
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,800
So we have a parallel line like that,

98
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,060
actually I don't know if they're parallel yet,

99
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,890
because they haven't told me.

100
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,490
But it kind of looks like that, although I shouldn't assume.

101
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,130
We have a transversal, if those are parallel.

102
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,110
Let me switch colors. OK.

103
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,710
So they're saying that this angle right here is r.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,650
This is u, s, t. And this is line l. This is line m.

105
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,460
In the figure above,l is parallel to m.

106
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,290
So l and m are parallel. I was right. And r is 50 degrees.

107
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,260
So r is equal to 50 degrees.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,280
What is the value of s plus t plus u?

109
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,300
Well, what are the angles that are corresponding to r?

110
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,040
If r is 50, the corresponding angle here is,

111
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,160
so this is kind of the same-- if you don't remember this,

112
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,480
you might want to review the geometry module where I do this

113
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,110
the corresponding angle here is u.

114
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,030
And so this angle is also going to be equal to 50 degrees.

115
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,280
Let me do a different color.

116
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,190
So that equals 50,

117
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,950
and that's because they kind of take the same role

118
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,070
where the transversal intersects the parallel lines.

119
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,220
And if this is 50, this is the opposite angle, right?

120
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,850
So that angle is also going to be 50.

121
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,560
And t and u are supplementary,right?

122
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,150
So t plus u is going to be 180.

123
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,000
Or you could say that this is 130, right?

124
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,520
So what's 50 plus 50 plus 130?

125
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
It's 100 plus 130.

126
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,010
It's 230 degrees, which is choice A.

127
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,910
Next problem. Invert colors. Problem number seven.

128
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,550
In the x-y coordinate plane,

129
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,670
line l is perpendicular to the y-axis

130
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,590
and passes through the point 5, negative 3.

131
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:28,830
So let me-- those are my axes. y. x.

132
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,450
And this line-- I'll draw it in green--

133
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,400
it passes through the point 5, negative 3.

134
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,060
So that's like here someplace.

135
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,030
And it's perpendicular to the y-axis.

136
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,180
This is the y-axis, so perpendicular to it.

137
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,330
So it forms a 90 degree angle.

138
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,260
And we know this is a 90 degree angle.

139
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:54,680
And it passes through the point 5, and then minus 3.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,330
So this is the point right here.

141
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,010
This is 5 comma minus 3.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,700
Which of the following is an equation of the line l?

143
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,150
OK, well what is the slope of this?

144
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,720
It's a flat line.

145
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,160
As much as you run-- as much as you have a change in x--

146
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,920
there's no change in y, right?

147
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,770
So the slope is 0. And what's the y-intercept?

148
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,460
The y-intercept is where you intersect the y-axis.

149
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,440
Well, you're going to intersect it at y equals negative 3.

150
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,520
So b is minus 3.

151
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,990
And if you don't-- I'm saying this from the form--

152
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,470
y equals mx plus b m is the slope of a line.

153
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,080
m is 0, b is 3, so we know the slope is y equals negative 3.

154
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,540
That's the equation.

155
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,060
y equals negative 3,that's choice C.

156
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,950
And in general, if you just drew this line,you're like,well,

157
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,860
no matter what x is,y is equal to negative 3.

158
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,240
And you could say, well that's the equation.

159
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,960
y is equal to negative 3.

160
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,760
I have a minute left.

161
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,170
I don't think that's enough time to do a problem.

162
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,900
It might be, but I don't want to rush things.

163
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,630
So I'll do the next problem in the next video.

164
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,930
I'll see you soon.
