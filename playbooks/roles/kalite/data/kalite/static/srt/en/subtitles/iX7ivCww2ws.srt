1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,590
So far, when we were dealing
with radicals we've only been

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,370
using the square root.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,190
We've seen that if I write a
radical sign like this and put

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,180
a 9 under it, this means the
principal square root of 9,

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,690
which is positive 3.

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,880
Or you could view it as the
positive square root of 9.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,840
Now, what's implicit when we
write it like this is that I'm

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,360
taking the square root.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,670
So I could have also written
it like this.

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,640
I could have also written the
radical sign like this and

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,040
written this index 2 here, which
means the square root,

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,570
the principal square
root of 9.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,680
Find me something that
if I square that

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,130
something, I get 9.

16
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,330
And the radical sign doesn't
just have to

17
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,750
apply to a square root.

18
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,210
You can change the index here
and then take an arbitrary

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,660
root of a number.

20
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,390
So for example, if I were to
ask you, what-- You could

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,040
imagine this is called the cube
root, or you could call

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,780
it the third root of 27.

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,980
What is this?

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,120
Well, this is some number that
if I take it to the third

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,910
power, I'd get 27.

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,420
Well, the only number that if
you take it to the third

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,540
power, you get 27
is equal to 3.

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,420
3 times 3 times 3
is equal to 27.

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,040
9 times 3, 27.

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,720
So likewise, let me
just do one more.

31
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,760
So if I have 16-- I'll do
it in a different color.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,780
If I have 16 and I want to take
the fourth root of 16,

33
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,840
what number times itself
4 times is equal to 16?

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,030
And if it doesn't pop out at
you immediately, you can

35
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,920
actually just do a prime
factorization of 16

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,250
to figure it out.

37
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:45,440
Let's see.

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,830
16 is 2 times 8.

39
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,120
8 is 2 times 4.

40
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,340
4 is 2 times 2.

41
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,010
So this is equal to the fourth
root of 2 times 2

42
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,910
times 2 times 2.

43
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,510
You have these four 2's here.

44
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,450
Well, I have four 2's being
multiplied, so the fourth root

45
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,039
of this must be equal to 2.

46
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,750
And you could also view this
as kind of the fourth

47
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,750
principal root because if these
were all negative 2's,

48
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,100
it would also work.

49
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,890
   

50
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,360
Just like you have multiple
square roots, you have

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,540
multiple fourth roots.

52
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,020
But the radical sign implies
the principal root.

53
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,530
Now, with that said, we've
simplified traditional square

54
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,510
roots before.

55
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,940
Now we should hopefully be able
to simplify radicals with

56
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,155
higher power roots.

57
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:39,980
So let's try a couple.

58
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,790
Let's say I want to simplify
this expression.

59
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,140
The fifth root of 96.

60
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,860
So like I said before, let's
just factor this right here.

61
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,080
So 96 is 2 times 48.

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,000
Which is 2 times 24.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,640
Which is 2 times 12.

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,160
Which is 2 times 6.

65
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,970
Which is 2 times 3.

66
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,790
So this is equal to the fifth
root of 2 times 2 times 2

67
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,040
times 2 times 2.

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,090
   

69
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,310
Times 3.

70
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,520
Or another way you could view
it, is you could view it to a

71
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,540
fractional power.

72
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,540
You could view it to
a fractional power.

73
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,720
We've talked about
that already.

74
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,980
This is the same thing as 2
times 2 times 2 times 2 times

75
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,780
2 times 3 to the 1/5 power.

76
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,330
Let me make this clear.

77
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,270
Having an nth root of some
number is equivalent to taking

78
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,560
that number to the 1/n power.

79
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,510
These are equivalent statements
right here.

80
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,640
So if you're taking this to
the 1/5 power, this is the

81
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,220
same thing as taking 2 times
2 times 2 times 2

82
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,640
times 2 to the 1/5.

83
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,150
Times 3 to the 1/5.

84
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,760
Now I have something
that's multiplied.

85
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,630
I have 2 multiplied
by itself 5 times.

86
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,280
And I'm taking that
to the 1/5.

87
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,180
Well, the 1/5 power of this
is going to be 2.

88
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,570
Or the fifth root of this
is just going to be 2.

89
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,220
So this is going to
be a 2 right here.

90
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,899
And this is going to be
3 to the 1/5 power.

91
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,860
2 times 3 to the 1/5, which is
this simplified about as much

92
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,750
as you can simplify it.

93
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,790
But if we want to keep in
radical form, we could write

94
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:39,020
it as 2 times the fifth
root 3 just like that.

95
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,270
Let's try another one.

96
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,320
   

97
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,480
Let me put some variables
in there.

98
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:53,850
Let's say we wanted to simplify
the sixth root of 64

99
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,570
times x to the eighth.

100
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,420
So let's do 64 first.

101
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:06,230
64 is equal to 2 times 32,
which is 2 times 16.

102
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,980
Which is 2 times 8.

103
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,610
Which is 2 times 4.

104
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,860
Which is 2 times 2.

105
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,730
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

106
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,900
So it's essentially 2
to the sixth power.

107
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,880
So this is equivalent to the
sixth root of 2 to the sixth--

108
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,530
that's what 64 is --times
x to the eighth power.

109
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,500
Now, the sixth root of 2 to
the sixth, that's pretty

110
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,140
straightforward.

111
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:39,290
So this part right here is just
going to be equal to 2.

112
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:47,460
That's going to be 2 times
the sixth root of x

113
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,710
to the eighth power.

114
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,230
   

115
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,300
And how can we simplify this?

116
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,310
Well, x to the eighth power,
that's the same thing as x to

117
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,860
the sixth power times
x squared.

118
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,630
You have the same base, you
would add the exponents.

119
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,050
This is the same thing
as x to the eighth.

120
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,960
So this is going to be equal to
2 times the sixth root of x

121
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,940
to the sixth times x squared.

122
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,500
And the sixth root, this part
right here, the sixth root of

123
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,770
x to the sixth, that's just x.

124
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,270
So this is going to be equal to
2 times x times the sixth

125
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,900
root of x squared.

126
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,810
Now, we can simplify this
even more if you

127
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,570
really think about.

128
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,990
Remember, this expression right
here, this is the exact

129
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:44,130
same thing as x squared
to the 1/6 power.

130
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,100
And if you remember your
exponent properties, when you

131
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,620
raise something to an exponent,
and then raise that

132
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,800
to an exponent, that's
equivalent to x to

133
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,490
the 2 times 1/6 power.

134
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,720
Or-- let me write this --2 times
1/6 power, which is the

135
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,010
same thing-- Let me not forget
to write my 2x there.

136
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,080
So I have a 2x there
and a 2x there.

137
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,300
And this is the same thing as
2x-- it's the same 2x there

138
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,810
--times x to the 2/6.

139
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,220
Or, if we want to write that in
most simple form or lowest

140
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:26,710
common form, you get 2x times
x to the-- What do you have

141
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,870
here? x to the 1/3.

142
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,320
So if you want to write it in
radical form, you could write

143
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:38,180
this is equal to 2 times 2x
times the third root of x.

144
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,720
Or, the other way to think about
it, you could just say--

145
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,650
So we could just go from
this point right here.

146
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,580
We could write this.

147
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,190
We could ignore this,
what we did before.

148
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,120
And we could say, this is the
same thing as 2 times x to the

149
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,090
eighth to the 1/6 power.

150
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,650
x to the eighth to
the 1/6 power.

151
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,570
So this is equal to 2
times x to the-- 8

152
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,710
times 1/6 --8/6 power.

153
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,360
Now we can reduce
that fraction.

154
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,780
That's going to be 2 times
x to the 4/3 power.

155
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,610
And this and this are completely
equivalent.

156
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,660
Why is that?

157
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,530
Because we have 2 times x or 2
times x to the first power

158
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,320
times x to the 1/3 power.

159
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,470
You add 1 to 1/3, you get 4/3.

160
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,350
So hopefully you found this
little tutorial on higher

161
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,585
power radicals interesting.

162
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:35,570
And I think it is useful to kind
of see it in prime factor

163
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,640
form and realize, oh, if I'm
taking the sixth root, I have

164
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,330
to find a prime factor that
shows up at least six times.

165
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,210
And then I could figure out
that's 2 to the sixth.

166
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,600
Anyway, hopefully you found
this mildly useful.
