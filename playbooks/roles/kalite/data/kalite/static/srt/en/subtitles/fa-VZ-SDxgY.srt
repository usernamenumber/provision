1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,250
   

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,960
I've had enough requests by now
for videos on investing,

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,910
that I thought I would make
some videos on investing.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,640
   

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,280
And the way I'm going to go
about it is, over the next few

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,580
videos, I'm going to give people
the vocabulary of at

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,830
least how do you think
about investing?

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,950
And what are the terms and
the ratios people use?

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,210
And why do they make sense?

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,540
Or why do they not make sense?

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,680
And when do they apply?

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,950
And when do they not apply?

13
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,260
And then we're going to use
those tools later on, and then

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,060
hopefully we'll look at some
particular companies.

15
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,020
And my goal isn't to do what
they do on CNBC and tell you,

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,940
buy, buy, buy, and
sell, sell, sell.

17
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,510
Because frankly that's
not a thoughtful way

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,460
of going about things.

19
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,010
What I want to do is really give
you the tools to come to

20
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,200
the conclusions yourself.

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,130
And maybe through the videos,
we'll come to conclusions.

22
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,720
But I don't want to be too
strong about them, because if

23
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,870
I'm wrong I don't want you
to lose your 401(k).

24
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,970
So the first thing that I guess
you could say bugs me a

25
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,680
little bit, is I go to these
family gatherings, and some

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,850
uncle or aunt will come
up to me and says, hey

27
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,800
I just made a killing.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,710
I bought Citibank.

29
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,590
It's so cheap.

30
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,200
I don't know what it was at the
time, but it's only $1.

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,600
It's a cheap stock.

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,880
As opposed to implicitly there,
there's the assumption

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,340
that a $10 stock would
be expensive.

34
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,760
And I think this is very obvious
to you, but let me

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,550
write that down.

36
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,950
So price per share.

37
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,750
   

38
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,300
So when someone tells me that
a $1 stock is expensive,

39
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,780
they're implicitly saying, well
that's just because it's

40
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,080
a low number, as opposed
to, say, a $10 stock.

41
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,330
Let's call this Stock A.

42
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,930
   

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,130
And Stock B.

44
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,940
And I think this is very obvious
to anyone hopefully

45
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,630
who's spent any time investing,
or thought about

46
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,230
what a stock even represents.

47
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,290
But you'd be surprised.

48
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,860
I've had family members
who are doctors and

49
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,920
engineers tell me this.

50
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,130
So I thought it's a good
place to start,

51
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,010
to clarify any confusion.

52
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,480
So my question to you is, is
something that is $1, is that

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,870
cheap relative to something
that is $10.

54
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,150
In the everyday world it is.

55
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,010
If I could buy an apple for
$1, that's cheaper than an

56
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,560
apple that costs $10,
or any good, really.

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,380
And the twist here is that
a share is just a share.

58
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,650
It doesn't somehow represent
the entire company.

59
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,650
It's a fraction of
the company.

60
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,290
It's just a share.

61
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,230
And all companies don't have
the same amount of shares.

62
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,810
For example, if I have one
company-- and actually maybe

63
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,900
that's a good point to introduce
a balance sheet--

64
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,910
let's say one company whose
assets, because I want to do

65
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,610
this throughout our
discussion.

66
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,440
Whose assets are worth,
let's say, $1 million.

67
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,280
That's its assets.

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,380
All its buildings and its
employees and its brand.

69
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,630
It's worth $1 million.

70
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,030
Let's say it doesn't
have any debt.

71
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,780
And we'll introduce debt later,
because that's another

72
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,090
variable that a lot of people
don't think about when they

73
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:12,800
look at stocks.

74
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,220
They just look purely at the
equity value or the market

75
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,990
capitalization.

76
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,480
And all these terms we'll
hopefully get very familiar

77
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,040
with over the course
of these videos.

78
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,690
But let's say its assets
are worth $1 million.

79
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,380
It has no liabilities.

80
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,800
So the asset value
is all in equity.

81
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,860
So this is all equity.

82
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,210
Sometimes called stockholders'
equity.

83
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,830
And the equity is really, the
people who own the company.

84
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,020
what is their stake?

85
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,100
So in this case, they never
borrowed any money to buy

86
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,080
these assets.

87
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,630
So the owners of the company
own all $1 million, if you

88
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,560
believe that this is really
worth $1 million.

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,260
Now you could have
this scenario.

90
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,560
Let me actually draw the same
scenario over again.

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,426
Let me copy and paste this.

92
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:01,930
soon.

93
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,450
So these are two equivalent
companies.

94
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,470
Completely equivalent
companies.

95
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,960
But this company over here,
they might have decided to

96
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,600
have 10 shares.

97
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:22,570
So if I were to draw that, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

98
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,480
I think that's 10 shares.

99
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,360
Well that's my intention.

100
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,840
They have 10 shares.

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,610
So what is the value
per share?

102
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,070
Each share in this case-- once
again, if you believe that the

103
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,930
assets are worth $1 million--
are going to be $1 million.

104
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,080
And the equity's $1 million,
because there's no debt, so

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,600
all of the assets are held
by the equity holders.

106
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,255
So each share would be worth
$1 million divided by 10,

107
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:49,260
which is equal to $100,000.

108
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,280
Obviously you never see $100,000
shares out there, or

109
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,380
at least not in the great
majority of examples.

110
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,520
So this is a bit of an
artificial example.

111
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,180
More likely a company might
have a million shares, in

112
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,560
which case this would
be a $1 stock.

113
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,110
But anyway, this is
a case where they

114
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,960
only have 10 shares.

115
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,720
It's $100,000.

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,870
Now let's say this company
right here says, well

117
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,140
$100,000, that's
kind of a crazy

118
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,480
number for a share price.

119
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,740
It'll keep a lot of people
from buying our shares.

120
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,960
So let's just divide it
into a million shares.

121
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,220
So they have times one
million shares.

122
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,750
So in this situation, the
company is worth what?

123
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,370
Or the shares are worth what?

124
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,200
They're worth $1 million divided
by one million shares,

125
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,280
or $1 per share.

126
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,430
So going back to the idea where
my family member would

127
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,220
come to me at a party, they
would say oh, look how cheap

128
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,720
this company is compared
to this company.

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,450
Even more, let's say for
whatever reason, because not

130
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,650
so many people could afford this
stock, because just to

131
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,050
get in the game, you've
gotta put up

132
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,470
$100,000 to buy a share.

133
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,670
Let's say this stock
trades down, and

134
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:03,560
it's trading at $50,000.

135
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,290
And their assets
are identical.

136
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,675
So obviously there's no two
companies that are identical

137
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:10,150
in this way, but let's
say that they are.

138
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,100
Let's say in both cases the
assets of this company are

139
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,300
worth the exact same thing as
the assets of that company.

140
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,910
So here investors are valuing
this company at $1 times a

141
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,730
million shares.

142
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,560
They're valuing these assets
at $1 million.

143
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,350
In this case, the investor is
saying, OK, I'm willing to pay

144
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,690
$50,000 per share.

145
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,940
And there's only 10 shares.

146
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,720
So they're valuing the
assets at $500,000.

147
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,330
And this is of course the market
value of the assets.

148
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,570
And we'll talk more about
market versus

149
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,560
book value of assets.

150
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,180
But the market value or assets
is essentially, what is the

151
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,220
market saying the assets
are worth?

152
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,320
The book value of the assets, or
what the accountants within

153
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,710
the company are saying
the assets are worth.

154
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,070
And there's a whole methodology
to how one would

155
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,090
account for that.

156
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,600
But this is the market
value of the assets.

157
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,340
And I already told you that
these assets are identical.

158
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,760
They generate the same
earning stream with

159
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,240
the exact same risk.

160
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,340
So in this situation, you're
paying $500,000 for the same

161
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,610
asset that over here you're
paying $1 for.

162
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,570
I don't care what the actual
share price is.

163
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,110
This is what you're
valuing it at.

164
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,260
So the person who says that $1
here is cheap, relative to

165
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,010
$50,000 here.

166
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,850
And they might even say, oh well
they're the same company.

167
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,300
And I get it here for $1 a
share, and I get it there for

168
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,335
$50,000 a share, this
is a cheap company.

169
00:07:29,335 --> 00:07:32,700
But that's completely
180 degrees in the

170
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,370
wrong direction wrong.

171
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,010
Because you're actually paying
more for this company.

172
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,080
You're paying $1 for one
millionth of this company,

173
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,050
while you're paying $50,000
dollars for one

174
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,190
tenth of this company.

175
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,030
So this one is actually
the better deal.

176
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,930
So in general, when you're
trying to figure out relative

177
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,900
price of a company-- and we're
going to talk a lot more about

178
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,953
ratios and how do you know if
something is inherently cheap,

179
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:58,760
you relative to its earnings or
what it could earn, or its

180
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,420
growth or anything like that--
but the first cut is, you

181
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,350
can't just look at the price.

182
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,350
The price is almost a
meaningless number.

183
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,330
It matters to some degree
for trading purposes.

184
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,270
Where a lot of institutional
funds won't look at a stock

185
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,900
that's below $5.

186
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,055
A lot of stocks that go
into the penny stocks.

187
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:19,290
   

188
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,470
There's a lot of frictions in
investing in penny stocks,

189
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,790
because obviously if you have a
$10 stock, a $10 stock could

190
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,410
go from $10 to $10.01.

191
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,130
Or if could go to $9.99.

192
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,140
And this is only a 0.1% move.

193
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,789
But let's say you have
a penny stock.

194
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:44,410
Let's say you have a stock
that's at $0.05, it can only

195
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,980
move by a penny in
one direction.

196
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,690
And before it was actually
an eighth.

197
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,390
So if you move only by a penny
you can only go to $0.06 or

198
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,010
you could go to $0.04.

199
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,670
And so in either direction
you're looking at a 20% move,

200
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,470
while here you're looking at a
1/1000th move or a 0.1% move.

201
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,250
So that's one reason why
price might matter

202
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,450
a little bit here.

203
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,740
There's huge frictions if you
were to buy and sell, there's

204
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,180
20% every time.

205
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,350
And we'll talk about things
like bid-ask spreads and

206
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,220
liquidity and things like
that in the future.

207
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,250
But that's where the price
really starts to matter.

208
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,710
And obviously if you have a
really huge price, like

209
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,850
$100,000, that makes it
difficult for people to buy

210
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,480
even one share.

211
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,020
But that's the only place
where price matters.

212
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,770
Inherently, when you're talking
about value, you have

213
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,630
to take the price per share and
you multiply it times the

214
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,880
number of shares.

215
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,970
   

216
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,760
So these Stock A and Stock B,
these are different than the

217
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,000
ones I drew down here.

218
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,940
So let me draw a little dividing
line right there.

219
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,060
And let me erase some of this.

220
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,380
   

221
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,590
So if in this example-- let
me actually erase more.

222
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:06,160
   

223
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,320
So in this example, it's
important to write down the

224
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,260
number of shares you have. And
you could look this up on

225
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,070
Yahoo Finance.

226
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,060
And we'll do this in the future

227
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,910
with a bunch of companies.

228
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,840
We'll just go through the
motions of figuring out all of

229
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,660
the metrics.

230
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,290
Just because that's a good
starting point just to get a

231
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,100
sense of what the company's
all about.

232
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,060
So let's say that this company
has ten million shares.

233
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:34,745
And this company right here
has 500,000 shares.

234
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:37,940
So what you do is you multiply
these numbers to figure out,

235
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,480
what is the market value or the
market capitalization of

236
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:41,950
the company?

237
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,190
So that's a word.

238
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,320
Let me write that down.

239
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,740
Sometimes called
the market cap.

240
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,143
Market capitalization.

241
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:58,450
   

242
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,380
And it's essentially, what
is the market saying

243
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,060
the equity is worth?

244
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,650
In this case where you don't
have debt, they're actually

245
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,450
saying what is the
asset worth?

246
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,140
So if I took this, $1 per share
times 10 million shares.

247
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,270
The market is saying, this
company's worth $10 million.

248
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,360
Or that the equity of this
company's worth $10 million.

249
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,470
In this case, they're
saying $10 per share

250
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,330
times 500,000 shares.

251
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,960
They're saying it's
worth $5 million.

252
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,260
That's the market capitalization
of the company.

253
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,020
That's what the people are
saying the company is worth.

254
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,610
And actually I'm running
out of time from there.

255
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,220
So in the next video we'll talk
a little bit about how do

256
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,710
people actually determine
what something is worth?

257
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,250
And that obviously can be an
infinitely deep discussion.

258
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,480
But we'll try to get our
feet wet a little bit.

259
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,730
See

260
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:54,900
