1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:02,760
Good morning.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,715
im a nerd

3
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:04,660
Actually I don't know what time it is for you,

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,670
it's morning for me.

5
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,480
Welcome to the presentation on slope and y-intercept.

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,740
This presentation isn't going to teach you how to solve for

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,750
slope and y-intercept, but hopefully it will give you

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,650
a good intuition of what slope and y-intercept is.

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,370
And we're going to do something a little bit different

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,790
this time as opposed to what we normally do.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,870
We're not going to use the chalkboard, we're actually

12
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,470
going to go on to the Khan academy website and use the

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,200
graph of a line exercise to get a little bit of an intuition

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,810
for what slope and y-intercept is.

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,410
So when the application starts off, it starts with the

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,350
equation y equals onex plus one.

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,810
So that's the same thing as y equals x plus one.

18
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,780
But we see that the slope here is one.

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,560
If you looked at the introduction to graphing that

20
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,420
I talked about, the slope is the same thing is the

21
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,300
coefficient on the x term.

22
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,900
And if you see here, whenever we move over

23
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,590
by one, we move up by one.

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,700
And I'm going to do another module on that slope is

25
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,060
actually rise over run.

26
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,500
So it's for every amount you rise, how much do you

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,970
have to run to get that?

28
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,930
And rise just means how much do you change in y, run means

29
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,300
how much do you change in x.

30
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,060
So here rise over run is just one, and y-intercept is where

31
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,540
you intercept the y-axis.

32
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,140
Now, as I change the slope and the y-intercept for this graph,

33
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,750
I think it's going to make a little bit more sense to you.

34
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,430
Watch what happens when the slope goes from one to three / two.

35
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,960
So three / two is the same thing is one and one / two.

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,810
So notice it got steeper.

37
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,440
And if I increase the slope more it gets steeper even

38
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,520
more, and y equals twox.

39
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,950
If I increase any more five / two is two and one / two.

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,190
So the more I increase the slope, I think you

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,930
see what's happening.

42
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,360
This thing jumps around.

43
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,020
I should fix that.

44
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,090
Let me move it back.

45
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,390
And actually, the goal is to make the line go through

46
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,480
those two blue points.

47
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,890
That's the goal of I guess you'd call it the game.

48
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,060
I don't like how this thing jumps around though.

49
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,820
That was interesting, let me go back there.

50
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,450
y equals zerox plus one.

51
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,790
We could have rewritten this as just y equals one, because zerox

52
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,680
is the same things as zero.

53
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,720
And notice it's a completely flat line.

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,180
No matter what x is y is one.

55
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,570
And that makes sense because this equation would

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,740
just be y equals one.

57
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,180
Now I've been showing you what happens to the slope.

58
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,380
Now notice we have a negative slope.

59
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,550
The slope is now downwards sloping.

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,610
It's downward sloping at a slope of one / two.

61
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,010
Because let's say the rise in this situation is negative

62
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,800
one, and the run is two.

63
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,490
So that's why we get negative one over two.

64
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,870
And we had just been doing slope so far and I think you

65
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,150
get the idea that as we decrease slope, it's going to

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,620
push the line further and further-- it's going to

67
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,710
slope downward even more.

68
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,480
I hate to use a word in its own definition, but I think you

69
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,020
see that now in the picture.

70
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,520
Now let's put up the y-intercept a little bit.

71
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,450
And this is even more interesting.

72
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,970
So y-intercept-- oh boy, how did that happen, that was

73
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,750
strange --y-intercept--

74
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,810
Notice, negative onex plus two, so the slope is negative one but it

75
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,400
intersects the y-axis at two.

76
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,600
Now if we increase y-intercept by one more it's just going

77
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,560
to push this line up one.

78
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,650
Let's do that.

79
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:17,930
See.

80
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,100
Oh, this is actually increasing it by increments of one / two.

81
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,680
Let's do another one, I just want to see what happens

82
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
on another graph.

83
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,660
It actually depends on the actual problem.

84
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,340
OK, this is interesting.

85
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,120
OK, this is the same thing.

86
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,590
We start at the same point.

87
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,020
Let's actually try to figure out the equation of a line that

88
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,120
goes through these two points.

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,150
Well, let's see.

90
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,880
It looks like the y-intercept if is going to have to

91
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,960
be a little bit lower.

92
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I do not get why it would do that.

93
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,230
It just brings the line down as we lower the y-intercept.

94
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,520
And let's see I think the slope needs to be higher, because

95
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,090
those two points, the line that goes through them is

96
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,260
definitely steeper.

97
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,970
I apologize for this thing acting up like.

98
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,520
That looks like about the right slope.

99
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,310
The slope is like that, and these two points are connected.

100
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,230
Yeah, I think that looks like the right slope, but the

101
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,460
y-intercept has to be lower.

102
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,860
Almost there, I think.

103
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,680
There you go!

104
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,960
So the equation of this line is seven / fourx.

105
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,400
So 7/4, that's the same thing as like 1.75.

106
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,350
So the slope of this line slopes faster than one / one and

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,540
you can kind of see that.

108
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,290
I'll show you how to figure out all this, I just want to give

109
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,980
you an intuitive sense of what sloping and y-intercept is.

110
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,510
And it intersects the y-axis at negative thirteen / four.

111
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,190
That's a little more than three, which you can-- negative

112
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,850
three --which you can see right there.

113
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,880
Let's see if we can do another one.

114
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,110
And if you want, we can assign this module to you and you can

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,370
play with it just like I'm doing right here.

116
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,280
So let's see, the line that we want to get will go

117
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,310
something like that.

118
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,530
Looks like the current line's slope is a little too high.

119
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,120
Let me lower the slope a little bit.

120
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,410
That looks about right.

121
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,130
seven / eight, so that means for every eight you move to the right

122
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,560
you're going to move seven up.

123
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,780
And I'm going to draw that better in another module.

124
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,470
This module I'm kind of doing on the fly, so I apologize.

125
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,910
I do every model on the fly so I guess I really

126
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,380
should apologize.

127
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,340
But you're not paying for this, so I shouldn't apologize.

128
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,230
Oh, I distracted very easily.

129
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,170
Let's see, let's move this line up.

130
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,660
And you do that just by the y-intercept.

131
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,850
You can see shifting the y-intercept up just shifts

132
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,880
the line straight up.

133
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,190
It doesn't change the inclination of the line.

134
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,090
The slope changes the inclination of the line.

135
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,180
There we go.

136
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,370
The equation of this line is seven / eightx plus thirteen / four.

137
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,050
Let's see if what I said about slope is right if we move.

138
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,630
If we run eight, we should rise seven.

139
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,030
So let's see.

140
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,070
Run eight.

141
00:05:53,070 --> 00:06:02,070
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

142
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,780
So that gets us right there.

143
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,660
And then we should rise seven.

144
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:14,920
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

145
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,740
Well that actually gets us those exact points.

146
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,240
And we're back on the line again.

147
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,170
I'm going to draw another thing like that for you so if you get

148
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,230
confused don't lose heart.

149
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,360
Let's do one more.

150
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,800
OK.

151
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,080
Where's the other dot?

152
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,550
I don't know.

153
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,610
Let me see.

154
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,860
The other dot doesn't exist.

155
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,170
I gotta fix all these bugs in this thing.

156
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,540
Oh there.

157
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:37,820
Good.

158
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,430
It showed up.

159
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,000
It showed up.

160
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,840
Excellent.

161
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,080
OK, so look.

162
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,510
We have to make the line go through these two points.

163
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,900
It looks like the slope is negative, definitely.

164
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,110
Not that negative, it's like a fractional negative slope.

165
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,720
And it'll intercept the y-axis somewhere around here.

166
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,390
The y-intercept is going to be like seven and something.

167
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,350
seven and change.

168
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,910
So first of all let's get this slope down.

169
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:57,100
Oh boy.

170
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,410
This thing is going to jump around again.

171
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,410
Notice y equals zero, x plus one.

172
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,010
If we increase the slope.

173
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,290
This thing is doing all sorts-- I haven't seen this application

174
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,120
in a while, so I must've written it when I had inferior

175
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,170
programming skills, let me keep --OK, that slope

176
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,160
might be right.

177
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,950
Let's bring the line up higher.

178
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,190
No, it still seems like my slope-- see the y-intercept,

179
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,200
I'm raising the line.

180
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,820
Oh good, I got it exactly right.

181
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,610
And I was right.

182
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,300
The slope is negative, because you can see it slopes downward.

183
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,700
But it's not sloping downward that fast.

184
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,120
And that make sense, that the slope is negative one / three.

185
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:49,840
And that makes sense because if we run three, one, two, three, we rise

186
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,050
negative one, we rise negative one.

187
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,540
Right there.

188
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,930
So that's why the slope is negative one / three.

189
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,510
And then the y-intercept is twenty-two / three.

190
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,160
Well that's seven and one / three.

191
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,640
And right there, we intercept the y-axis one / three of the

192
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,840
way between seven and eight.

193
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,010
Well I think that should at least give you a little bit of

194
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,590
an intuition on what slope and y-intercept are and you can

195
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,830
have this module assigned for you, so you could play

196
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,530
with it yourself.

197
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,930
And I'm going to do some more models where you actually

198
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,630
calculate slope and y-intercept and hopefully give you even

199
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,810
though further intuition on what they are.

200
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,840
So I hope you have fun playing around with this stuff.

201
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,990
I remember I was very excited when I first learned

202
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,880
this stuff, because it's very visual.

203
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,860
So, have fun.
