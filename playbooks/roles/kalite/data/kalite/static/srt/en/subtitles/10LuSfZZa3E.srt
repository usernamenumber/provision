1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,900
Let's do a slightly more involved Snell's Law example

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,220
I have this person over here sitting at the edge of this pool

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,440
And they have a little laser pointer in their hand

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,760
and they shine their laser pointer 1.7 m above the surface of the pool

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,380
And they shine it, so it travels 8.1 m to touch the surface of the water

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,660
And then the light gets refracted inwards

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,610
It's going into a slower medium. If you think about the car analogy

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,530
the outside tires get to stay outside a little bit longer so they move faster

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,510
So it gets refracted inwards and then it hits

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,090
the bottom of the pool at some point right over here

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,920
and pool they tell us is 3 m deep

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:49,970
What I want to figure out is how far away does this point hit?

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:56,640
So what is this distance right over here?

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:03,940
To figure that out, I need to figure out what this distance is, right over here

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,110
and then figure out what that distance is and then add them up

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,920
I can figure out this part, this part right until we hit the surface of the water

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,770
and then figure out this incremental distance just like that

18
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,340
And hopefully a little bit of trigonometry and maybe Snell's Law will be able to get there

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,100
So let's start with the simplest thing. Let's just figure out this distance

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,350
And it looks like it will pay off later on as well

21
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,970
So let's figure out this distance right over here along the water

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,970
the surface of the water to where the laser point actually starts touching the water

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,260
And this is a straight up Pythagorean Theorem problem

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,860
This is a right angle

25
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,970
This is the hypotenuse over here. So this distance, let's call it x

26
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,000
X^2 +1.7 m ^2 = 8.1 ^2

27
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,670
just a straight up Pythagorean Theorem

28
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:03,860
X^2 +1.7 m ^2 = 8.1 ^2

29
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,000
Subtract 1.7 squared from both sides

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,010
we get X squared is equal to 8.1 squared -1.7 squared

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,700
If you want to solve for x, x = the positive square root of this

32
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,760
because we only care about positive distances

33
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:27,410
X is going to be equal to the principal root of 8.1 squared -1.7 squared

34
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,140
Let's get our calculator out for that, so x is going to be equal to

35
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:42,630
the square root of 8.1 squared -1.7 squared

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,530
And I get 7.92

37
00:02:50,050 --> 00:03:02,390
So x is about 7.92. That is x

38
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,880
Now to figure out this incremental distance right over here

39
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,920
add that to this x and then we know this entire distance. Let's see how we can think about it

40
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,740
Let's think about what the incident angle is and what the angle of refraction

41
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,740
I'll drop the perpendicular to the interface or to the surface

42
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:29,770
So our incident angle is this angle right over here

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,420
And remember Snell's Law, we care about the sine of this angle

44
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,410
actually let me just write down what we care about

45
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,500
So we know this is our incident angle

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,150
This is our angle of refraction

47
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,450
We know that the index of refraction for this medium here--this is air--

48
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,950
the index of refraction for air

49
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:59,890
times the sine of theta 1--this is just Snell's Law--times our incident angle right here

50
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:08,380
is going to be equal to the index of refraction for the water

51
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,470
times the sine of theta 2, times the sine of our fraction angle

52
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,970
Now we know we can figure out these n's from this table here

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,290
I actually got this problem from ck12.org flexbook as well as the image for the problem

54
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,690
And so if you want to solve for theta 2

55
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,560
or if we know theta 2, we can then solve for this

56
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,330
We'll do that with a little bit of trigonometry

57
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:41,220
If we know the sine of theta 2, we'll be able to solve for this

58
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,220
Either way. Actually I'll solve for this angle. If we know this angle

59
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,130
then we're able to use a little bit of trigonometry to figure out this distance over here

60
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:57,890
So to solve for that angle, we have to figure out what the sine of theta 1 is

61
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,540
Let's put in all of the values

62
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:11,670
Our index of refraction of air 1.00029

63
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,000
times sin theta. Maybe you'll say, how to do that? We don't even know what that angle is

64
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:23,430
But remember this is basic trigonometry, soh cah toa

65
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,660
Sine is opposite over hypotenuse

66
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:32,950
If you have this angle here, let's make this part of a right triangle

67
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,070
opposite over hypotenuse is the ratio of this side to the hypotenuse

68
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:46,720
This distance over here is the same as x, which is 7.92

69
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,830
So the sine of theta 1 is going to be the opposite of the angle over the hypotenuse

70
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,450
That comes from the definition of sine

71
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,830
We don't have to know what theta 1 is

72
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:13,940
It's going to be 7.92/8.1

73
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:32,380
And that's going to be equal to the index of refraction of water which is 1.33

74
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,880
times sine of theta 2

75
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,470
If we want to solve for theta 2, we just divide both sides of this equation by 1.33

76
00:06:41,790 --> 00:07:06,000
So if we divide both sides by 1.33, we get 1.00029 times 7.92/8.1 divided by 1.33

77
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,970
That is going to be equal to this sine of theta 2

78
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:19,590
So let's do that with the calculator

79
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:25,830
So we have 1.00029 times 7.92--

80
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:35,250
I can say second answer here. This is the exact value, not even rounding

81
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:43,970
and then divide it by 1.33 and 8.1

82
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:51,920
And we get that and that's going to be equal to the sine of theta 2

83
00:07:51,940 --> 00:08:00,750
So let me write this down. So we have 0.735 is equal to the sine of theta 2

84
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,910
Now we could take the inverse sine of both sides of this equation to solve for theta 2

85
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,200
Theta 2 is equal to the inverse sine of this value

86
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,770
So I take the inverse sine of our last answer

87
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:34,440
So this is 47.34 degrees. So we're able to figure out what theta 2 is. 47.34 degrees.

88
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,120
So now we'll just have to use a little bit of trigonometry to actually figure out

89
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,660
to actually figure out this distance over here

90
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,150
So we know this angle

91
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:49,300
we want to figure its opposite side; we want to figure out the opposite side to that angle

92
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,950
And we know the adjacent side, which is 3

93
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,990
So what trig identity deals with opposite and adjacent?

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,260
Tangent, toa. Tangent is opposite over adjacent

95
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,490
is going to be equal to this opposite side over here--I'll call that y--

96
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,110
It's going to equal y over our adjacent side and that's just 3 m

97
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:26,080
To solve for y, we multiply both sides of this equation by 3

98
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:34,090
You get three times the tangent of 47.34 degrees is equal to y

99
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,440
Let's get the calculator out

100
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:43,150
So 3 times the tangent of that 47.34 degrees. I'll use the exact answer

101
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,470
3 times the tangent of that is 3.255

102
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:58,480
So this distance right here y is equal to 3.255 m

103
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,610
Now our question was what is this total distance

104
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,100
So it's going to be this distance X plus Y, plus the 3.255

105
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,460
X was 7.92

106
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:19,280
I'll round here. So it's literally going to be 7.92 + our answer just now

107
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:28,680
So we get about 11.18 meters

108
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:35,020
So this right here is the distance that we want to figure out

109
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:42,240
the point on the bottom of pool where the actual laser pointer hit

110
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:54,560
the surface of the pool will be approximately 11.18 m from this edge

111
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,080
Anyway, hopefully you found it useful. It's a little bit more involved

112
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,680
But really the hard part was just in the trigonometry

113
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,980
recognizing that you didn't have to know this angle

114
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,800
because you have all the information for the sine of that angle

115
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,500
You can actually figure out that angle now

116
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,340
Now that you know it's sine, you can figure out the inverse sine of that

117
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,290
But that's not even necessary. We know the sine of the angle

118
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,940
using basic trigonometry

119
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,790
we can use that and Snell's Law to figure out this angle right here

120
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,390
And once you know this angle, use a little bit more trigonometry to

121
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,760
figure out this incremental distance
