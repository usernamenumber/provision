1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,010
   

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,880
In the last several videos we
talked about the difference

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,120
between the book value
and the market value

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,610
of a company's equity.

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,660
And in this example here, where
I said this is some type

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,850
of a financial institution.

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,170
And these are its assets.

8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,329
And at least on its books, it
had $1 billion of government

9
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,120
bonds. $10 billion of very
highly rated corporate bonds,

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,790
so these are loans to
corporations that are very

11
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,940
likely to pay back. $10
billion of commercial

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,940
mortgages, those would be loans
for someone to buy an

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,750
office building, or build
an office building, or

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,830
something like that.

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,090
And then we focused in a little
bit on this piece, this

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,990
green piece here, residential
CDOs.

17
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,010
And I explained what
those are.

18
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,310
Those are essentially derivative
securities that are

19
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,950
derived from mortgage
backed securities.

20
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,660
Which are just a bunch
of mortgages that

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,760
are packaged together.

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,090
And we focused on that because
this is really the crux of

23
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,160
everything that everyone's been
focusing on since the

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,040
credit crunch started.

25
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,950
Although, I'll throw it out
there, this is just the first

26
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,840
wave. This is what's
deteriorated so far.

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,450
Housing prices have gone down,
you had all of these people

28
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,290
with these liar loans where you
could make up your income

29
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,120
and get a million-dollar loan
with no money down.

30
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,130
So this was just
the first wave.

31
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,120
But you can imagine, if the
economy gets bad enough, then

32
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,030
a lot of these commercial
mortgages are going to to

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,430
start looking not
so great either.

34
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,740
And actually, there was an
article that I read this

35
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,150
morning where they talked about
because of all of the

36
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,170
turmoil in the financial system,
because of this piece,

37
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,550
that the commercial vacancies
actually going up.

38
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,580
And a lot of the people who
own commercial mortgages,

39
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,170
they're actually getting a
little bit worried right now

40
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,550
because a lot office space
is going free.

41
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,430
But anyway that's not
the focus of this.

42
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,900
What we should focus on now is
well, fine, this bank has a

43
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,040
shady asset.

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,730
And that makes it look a little
uncertain as far as

45
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,980
what its equity is worth.

46
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,970
If we said this asset was worth
$4 billion, we said we

47
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,150
have $3 billion of
equity here.

48
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,190
Because everything would have
added up to $26 billion.

49
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,650
And we have $23 billion
in liabilities.

50
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,300
And so liabilities plus equity
is equal to assets.

51
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,330
Or assets minus liabilities
is equal to equity.

52
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,780
So 26 minus 23 is equal to 3.

53
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,560
And I gave you the example of
well what if the stock market

54
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,440
is actually valuing this thing
at an equity of $1.5 billion.

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,820
And the way you get that is,
they're saying $3 a share and

56
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,200
there are half a
billion shares.

57
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,880
So what if the stock market is
saying no, I think that this

58
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,970
company's equity is only
worth $1.5 billion.

59
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,070
And a rationale for that could
be that they just think that

60
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,850
this asset right here is worth
$1.5 billion less.

61
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,030
Anyway, I just wanted to make
that point because a lot of

62
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,650
people often get confused
between book and market value.

63
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,200
But now, let's think about
why this matters.

64
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,010
Why is Hank Paulson, and Ben
Bernanke and George Bush, and

65
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,970
seemingly everyone
else, so scared?

66
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,790
The logic goes, well if this
is just one bank and maybe

67
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,740
these things are worth zero,
what's the problem?

68
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,250
If these things are worth zero,
this one bank declares

69
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,000
bankruptcy, and it just
gets resolved in

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,090
the bankruptcy process.

71
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,300
And I'll do another
video on how the

72
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,290
bankruptcy process works.

73
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,670
Or, there's another scenario
where you say, oh well this

74
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,340
one bank, maybe this
isn't worth zero.

75
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,040
Maybe this is worth
$4 billion.

76
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,300
And as long as people just
continue to loan it money, it

77
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,490
should be able to be fine and
it'll weather out the storm.

78
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,420
And that's the crux
of the issue.

79
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,900
Whether people will continue
to loan them money.

80
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,740
So, corporate loans, or loans
to corporations or banks.

81
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,090
Most of the loans we're familiar
with in our personal

82
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,750
lives, maybe a mortgage, where
it's a fixed term, 30 years,

83
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,300
at the end of it you've paid all
of the interest and you've

84
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,660
completely paid off the loan.

85
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,110
Corporate loans tend to be for
simplicity purposes, interest

86
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,620
only loans.

87
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,530
There might be a little bit
of paying down the equity.

88
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,690
But for the most part they're
interest only loans.

89
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,570
So for example, this
Loan A over here.

90
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,290
   

91
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,840
It'll have some interest rate,
let me make something up,

92
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,120
maybe it's a 7% loan.

93
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,850
And maybe its term, they'll give
you the money for some

94
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,620
period of time, let's say
it's for three months.

95
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,520
   

96
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,240
So that says that whoever lent
this money to you, they'll

97
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,570
give you $10 billion.

98
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,570
Every year you pay 7% but on I
guess a monthly basis, you'll

99
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,670
pay roughly 1/12.

100
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,300
We know that that's not the
exact math, but you'll pay

101
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,790
it's actually 1.07 to the
1/12 power, but it's

102
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,390
roughly 1/12 of this.

103
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,970
And then at the end of three
months, you pay that lender

104
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,840
back the $10 billion.

105
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,450
You might say, well that's
a strange way

106
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,730
of financing yourself.

107
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,630
Because every three months
you're going to have to go and

108
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,390
get another loan.

109
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,310
And that's absolutely true.

110
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,370
But in a normal credit
environment, most companies

111
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,870
can say, OK I'll borrow this $10
billion for three months

112
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,850
at an annual rate of 7%.

113
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,890
And then when three months pass,
I'll just got another

114
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,190
loan, maybe from the same
lender, maybe from another

115
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,440
lender, that has maybe similar
terms. Pay off the old loan,

116
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,910
and get a new loan.

117
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,200
You can kind of say they keep
on renewing those loans.

118
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,310
They're able to keep keep
getting new loans that can

119
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,120
replace the old ones.

120
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,270
What's happening now is you have
these short term loans,

121
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,290
let's say three months, and then
when it comes to renew,

122
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,500
the bank or whoever lent you
this money says, I'm not so

123
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,130
sure anymore.

124
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,835
Because one, your stock price
has been tanking.

125
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:47,980
   

126
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,090
And if anything, we know that a
lot of these hedge funds out

127
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,800
there, they're doing more
homework than me, the bank, or

128
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,690
the lender is doing, or
at least these ratings

129
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,740
agencies are doing.

130
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,770
So maybe they see
something fishy.

131
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,020
And I know that you have some
type of assets, you have some

132
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,990
of these residential mortgage
backed securities, or you have

133
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,640
some of these derivative
assets there.

134
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,490
And you don't really give a
lot of transparency to me.

135
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,930
In fact, seldom you'll actually
even see this much

136
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,880
transparency on a company's
balance sheet.

137
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,885
They'll often say just like a
big bucket of, they'll call

138
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:19,310
them level three assets.

139
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,740
And those are assets that really
the management of this

140
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,080
bank can decide what
they're worth.

141
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,090
So if I'm the person who lent
them the money, I'll be like,

142
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,470
you know what, I saw Bear
Stearns go down.

143
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,530
And Bear Stearns looked
a lot like you.

144
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:38,520
I saw Lehman Brothers go down
and Lehman Brothers looked a

145
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,940
lot like you look now.

146
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,870
You know what?

147
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,210
I just want my money back.

148
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,630
Just pay me the $10
billion loan.

149
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,460
And then you go out, if you're
this bank, you say, OK well

150
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,410
let me look and find
someone else.

151
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,950
And no one's willing to lend
you the money because

152
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,430
everyone's gotten a
little bit irked.

153
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,930
   

154
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,410
And they go for another
guy for loans.

155
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,770
And they're like look, I'm not
going to give you a loan, but

156
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,490
here's some advice.

157
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,300
If you really think these assets
are worth enough, why

158
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,880
don't you sell these assets, and
maybe some other assets,

159
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,990
and then you can be good
for your money?

160
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,920
You don't even need the loan.

161
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,650
You don't need to hold
these assets.

162
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,800
   

163
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,180
So what you do when this comes
due, since you can't get any

164
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,120
other loans, let's say
that you sell these.

165
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,960
So you sell these AAA
corporate bonds.

166
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,300
Those are very valuable.

167
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,170
So you get $10 billion
for them.

168
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,980
   

169
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,060
So now you have $10
billion in cash.

170
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,230
   

171
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,810
And you're able to pay
off this loan.

172
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,000
   

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,090
And actually, what I've just
described, this is called

174
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,310
deleveraging.

175
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,340
Actually, I'll probably save
it until the next video on

176
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,900
what leverage and
deleverage is.

177
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,750
But just think of it this way,
leverage is the ratio of how

178
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,280
much assets you have over how
much equity you have. And so

179
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,230
if you think about someone who
has a lot of assets, but

180
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,840
they're controlling it with very
little equity, they have

181
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,700
huge leverage.

182
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,540
If you're controlling $10 of
assets and you only have $1 of

183
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,820
equity, you have
10:1 leverage.

184
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,290
Now, I just reduced my assets,
but I didn't change my equity.

185
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,040
So I've deleveraged.

186
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,180
I'll do that more in
the next video.

187
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,900
But that's fine, so I was
able to cover that.

188
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,460
I didn't have to declare
bankruptcy or anything.

189
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,500
But let's say when this
loan comes due,

190
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,650
I'm in the same situation.

191
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,420
This person, everyone's a
little scared after Bear

192
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,620
Stearns and Lehman Brothers and
they say, I'm not prepared

193
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,420
to renew this loan to you.

194
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,900
And you go out into the credit
markets and no one else is

195
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,120
willing to give you this loan,
but you're like, OK fine, I

196
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,549
have these commercial
mortgages.

197
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,580
And I can sell them.

198
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,429
They're fairly liquid
securities.

199
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,340
Liquid securities means that
there's a market in them and

200
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,289
that you can find buyers who
are willing to buy them.

201
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,050
But let's say since you have
to kind of do it in a fire

202
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,030
sale type of situation, since
you have to do it very quickly

203
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,150
and everyone's a little scared,
let's say you only get

204
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,960
$9 billion for these.

205
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,000
They're worth $10,
or so you say.

206
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,970
But then when you actually try
to sell them in the market,

207
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,220
you get $9 billion.

208
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,450
   

209
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,530
And let's say you have to sell
your government bonds as well.

210
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,760
So you get another billion.

211
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,780
So that gives you $10 billion.

212
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,670
And then you could pay off
this guy right there.

213
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,720
So now it's getting
interesting.

214
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,190
Notice, the book value of my
equity, well it might have

215
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,770
changed a little bit.

216
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,660
Because I had $10 billion
of assets.

217
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,120
and I had to essentially write
them down to $9 billion,

218
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,170
because that's what
I got for them.

219
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,900
So let's actually recalculate
our new book value.

220
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,470
So if I'm the company, remember
this $4 billion was

221
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,050
what the company said it was
worth, the $2.5 billion was

222
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,600
what the market said
it was worth.

223
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,410
So they have $4 billion plus
$1 billion, so we have $5

224
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,470
billion now in assets.

225
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,180
And what's our liabilities?

226
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,760
We have $3 billion in loans.

227
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,810
   

228
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,950
And now the book value
of our equity is now

229
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,640
going to be $2 billion.

230
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,210
And just to think about it,
why did our book value of

231
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,840
equity go from $3 billion
to $2 billion?

232
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,450
Well, because I actually thought
that these commercial

233
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,030
mortgages were worth $10
billion, but when I had to

234
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,950
sell them really fast, I only
got $9 billion for them.

235
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,070
So I essentially had to write
down those assets and then

236
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,890
sell them and turn
them into cash.

237
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,910
So that's why the book
value of the

238
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,030
equity is now $2 billion.

239
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,950
And now notice something here,
the book value of this

240
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,080
residential mortgage backed
security, at least what this

241
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,400
bank management says the book
value is, is $4 billion.

242
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,390
I shouldn't have crossed it out,
let me write it again. $4

243
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,340
billion, the $2.5 is what
the market was saying.

244
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,300
Which is larger than
my total equity.

245
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,400
So if this is worth zero,
then I actually

246
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,260
have negative equity.

247
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,660
If this is worth $2 billion
instead of $4 billion, then I

248
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,340
have zero equity.

249
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,600
So now I'm getting into a very
interesting situation.

250
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,350
And I wonder what's going to
happen when Loan C comes due.

251
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,300
And we'll explore that
in the next video.

252
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,500
