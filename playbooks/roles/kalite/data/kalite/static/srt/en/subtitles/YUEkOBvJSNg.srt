1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,550
For all the cyclic molecules
we've dealt with so far, we've

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,000
just drawn them as rings.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,250
For example, for cyclohexane
we've literally just drawn it

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,900
as a hexagon.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,420
So we've drawn cyclohexane
like that.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,570
Now, we know from the last
several videos that all the

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,520
bonds for carbon don't sit
in the same plane.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,430
If we take the example
of methane, that's

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,360
the simplest example.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,020
You have your carbon sitting
in the middle.

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,180
You'll have kind of a hydrogen
popping out like that, another

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,000
hydrogen that's in the plane
of the screen, another one

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,240
that's behind the screen,
and another one

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,210
that is straight up.

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,570
So you kind of have this
tetrahedral structure, and in

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,990
the case of methane you have
that 109.5 degree bond angles.

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,410
Carbon likes to form bonds
of this shape.

19
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,740
It won't always be
109.5 degrees.

20
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,390
It'll be something close to
it, depending on what the

21
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,010
different atoms or molecules
are that it is bonded to.

22
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,150
So given that, what would a
cyclohexane molecule actually

23
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,480
look like if we try to
visualize it in three

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,420
dimensions?

25
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,340
So to think about that, let's
think about these two bonds

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,400
first. I'll try my best to
draw it in one of its

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,780
three-dimensional shapes.

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,890
So those bonds right there,
I will draw like that.

29
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,260
And then this down here, in
orange, I will draw like this.

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,230
And then this up here,
in magenta, I

31
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,010
will draw like that.

32
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:32,730
And then, let me see, in, in
purple, I'll do these two

33
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,560
right over here, and I'll
draw them like this.

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,010
So you have that
and like that.

35
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,940
This hopefully makes clear that
over there is that end

36
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,060
over there, this end over here
is this end over here, and

37
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,170
this way that I've drawn the
cyclohexane is called a chair

38
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,420
configuration.

39
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,530
   

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,710
Chair shape.

41
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,730
And it might be obvious.

42
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,620
It looks like a chair.

43
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,740
That's the back of the chair,
this is where you would sit

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,050
down on the chair, and I guess
the back of your calves would

45
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,570
go against here.

46
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,560
Your knees would sit on it
someplace like that.

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,310
That's called the chair
configuration.

48
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,860
Now another configuration that
it could be in is called the

49
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,949
boat configuration.

50
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,150
And so if I were to put this
exact one in the boat

51
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,630
configuration, if I take it
from a slightly different

52
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,450
perspective, if I'm looking at
it, kind of, head on, it would

53
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:24,700
look something like this in
the boat configuration.

54
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,440
It would look like this.

55
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,800
   

56
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,710
Now I want to use the purple.

57
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,390
It would look like that.

58
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,770
Now, the first thing you're
probably saying is, Sal, you

59
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,690
said that the reason why it
looks like this is because

60
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,000
carbon likes to form these kind
of tetrahedral, or this

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,880
tripod shaped bonds.

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,120
I don't see the tripod shaped
bonds either here or here.

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,480
Let me draw that boat a little
bit, at least this end of the

64
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,880
boat a little bit better.

65
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,720
There you go.

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,610
And you say, well I don't see
that tripod shape over there.

67
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,270
And to see the tripod
shape, you just

68
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,330
have to draw the hydrogens.

69
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,900
So let me draw some
hydrogens here.

70
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,520
So let me draw a hydrogen
here that will go

71
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,525
straight down like this.

72
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:16,840
A hydrogen that goes straight
down over here, a hydrogen

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,030
that goes straight up over here,
straight up over here,

74
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,430
straight down over here,
straight up over there.

75
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,420
I've now drawn one hydrogen
on every carbon.

76
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,290
And now let me draw
some hydrogens.

77
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:40,540
Let me draw a hydrogen here that
goes straight up, not up

78
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,510
really-- to the side
over here.

79
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,900
So a hydrogen there, let me draw
a hydrogen over here that

80
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,960
does the same thing.

81
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,415
So those guys have
their hydrogens.

82
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:53,520
A hydrogen right over here.

83
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,840
And then, let's see, this guy
needs his hydrogens still, so

84
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,810
he'll have a hydrogen that goes
down like that, and a

85
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,280
hydrogen and it goes
like that.

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,650
And this guy will have a
hydrogen that goes like that.

87
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,230
And when you see it like this,
if you look at any one carbon

88
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,180
on this molecule, if you look at
any one carbon, you can see

89
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,430
that's forming the same
tetrahedral shape that has a

90
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,320
tripod at every one.

91
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,410
Over here, you have that close
to, roughly 109 degree, 110

92
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,290
degree angle between each of
the constituents that are

93
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,090
bonding to the carbon.

94
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,210
Now, I've drawn the different
hydrogens that are coming off

95
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,770
of these carbons in different
colors, and I've

96
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,940
done it for a purpose.

97
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,650
The ones that are going straight
up or straight down,

98
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,160
we call those axial hydrogens.

99
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,980
   

100
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,460
And the ones I drew in orange
that are kind of going to the

101
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,880
side in some level, we call
these equatorial.

102
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,420
   

103
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,410
These are equatorial
hydrogens.

104
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,940
And the reason why it's useful
to know that name is when we

105
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,100
talk about the different
configurations, the different

106
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,800
chair and boats, whether
something is equatorial or

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,920
axial can change if this were to
flip up, or vice versa, and

108
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,360
things like that.

109
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
And we'll talk more about
that in the next video.

110
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,510
And the reason why they're
called equatorial is if you

111
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,060
think about it, and it's
sometimes hard to visualize,

112
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,880
this bond right here is parallel
to this bond right

113
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,640
over there.

114
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,810
And this bond right over here
is parallel to that.

115
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,080
It's parallel, the equatorial
bonds are parallel, to some

116
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,020
part of the ring.

117
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,390
So that one is parallel to
that right over there.

118
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,020
Actually I should even, I could
even color-code that.

119
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,700
This, well, I don't want
to use that same color.

120
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:44,300
This is parallel to this and
this is parallel to that.

121
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,090
And we could do it for all
the equatorial bonds.

122
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,440
So for example, I don't
want to-- I'm running

123
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,650
out of colors here.

124
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:57,840
So this right here is parallel
to this, and this, and that

125
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,440
over there.

126
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,370
So we could keep doing
it for all of them.

127
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,710
I could do it for the other
set right here.

128
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,060
This guy right here
is parallel to

129
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,600
that guy over there.

130
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,230
I didn't quite draw it like
that, but hopefully it makes

131
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,880
the idea clear.

132
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,580
And I'll do one more of
these just to show

133
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,760
what's parallel to what.

134
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,710
This bond is parallel to that.

135
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,310
So the ones that are parallel to
some part of the ring we're

136
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,910
calling equatorial.

137
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,990
And the ones that kind of jump
out of the ring, that aren't

138
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,960
parallel to any other part
of the ring, we're

139
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
calling those axial.

140
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,940
And the way I've drawn it here,
the axials are the ones

141
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,880
that point up and point
straight up and

142
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,050
point straight down.

143
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,620
We can do the same thing on
a boat configuration.

144
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,200
Now, one question you might ask
is, well, there's these

145
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,090
two configurations.

146
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,740
Both of these would result in
tetrahedral type shapes at

147
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,500
each of the carbons.

148
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,530
In fact, let me draw
it for you.

149
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,540
So this axial hydrogen is
pointing straight down, this

150
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,370
one is pointing straight down.

151
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,930
Here, this hydrogen is actually
going to point

152
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,480
straight down because
we flipped it up.

153
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,820
And then over here you would
have a hydrogen point straight

154
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,180
up, and then one that's
kind of pointing down.

155
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,920
This gives a tripod there.

156
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,520
To have the tripod over here,
you'll have to have a hydrogen

157
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,540
that points a little bit like
that, one that's pointing a

158
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,790
little bit like that, along,
well, you can kind of view it

159
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,870
along the same plane as this
guy would be parallel.

160
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,180
It's hard to see it in
this, but he would

161
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,760
actually parallel to that.

162
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,060
This guy would be out like this,
and then this guy would

163
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,240
have an axial hydrogen, and
then he would have one

164
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,520
equatorial one just like that.

165
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,910
So you could draw the tripod
shapes in either the chair or

166
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,320
boat configuration.

167
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,820
But one question is, well,
what's more stable?

168
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
That's actually one of the main
points of being able to

169
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,650
visually think about the three
dimensional structure of any

170
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:47,020
of these hydrocarbons, or in
this case cyclohexane.

171
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,890
So in this situation, we know
from past videos, that all of

172
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,320
these carbons with their
hydrogens around them, these

173
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,240
bonds, these have electron
clouds around them.

174
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,130
The electron clouds are
negative, and so they want to

175
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,780
get as far away from each
other as possible.

176
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,020
In this chair configuration, you
have this carbon up here,

177
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,750
the ch2 we could consider it,
has two hydrogens and is

178
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,240
connected to the rest
of the ring.

179
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,410
It's as far as possible from
this ch2 as possible.

180
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,280
So in that situation, we have
a lower potential energy, or

181
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,780
it is a more stable shape.

182
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,270
Or more stable configuration.

183
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,120
In the boat configuration,
this ch2 up here is much

184
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,799
closer to this ch2, I mean,
that's really the main

185
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,210
difference between the two.

186
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,919
And they want to get away
from each other.

187
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,059
They want to repel ech other.

188
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,080
So this one will have higher
potential energy, or it will

189
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,330
be less stable.

190
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,280
   

191
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,740
So this is just a starting
point of how to visualize

192
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,900
cyclic hydrocarbons and we'll
use this information in the

193
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,050
next video to think a little
bit more about, maybe, the

194
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,420
different chair configurations
that a molecule could have,

195
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,990
and what could be more stable.

196
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,530
In this situation, in the case
of just cyclohexane, the two

197
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,430
chair configurations
are equally stable.

198
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,320
And let me just touch
on that a second.

199
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,290
So you have, well,
I don't have to--

200
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,220
actually, let me see.

201
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,250
I won't copy and paste.

202
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,770
I'll just redraw
the other chair

203
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,420
configuration for this guy.

204
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,520
Actually let me just do it
separately over here because

205
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,860
I've made the colors
here so confusing.

206
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,230
Let me draw two, the same
cyclohexane, but in two

207
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,790
different chair configurations
that it could

208
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,790
be equilibrium in.

209
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:34,570
So you could have this one, you
could have this one, so

210
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,920
this could be one chair
configuration, and I'll draw

211
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,450
it like this.

212
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,090
And then the same hydrocarbon
could be in-- or the same

213
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,450
cyclohexane could be in
equilibrium with the this

214
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,850
other chair configuration
that looks like this.

215
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,520
   

216
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,800
Let me have a little
more space here.

217
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,655
So it looks like this.

218
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:58,050
Let me do the pink.

219
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,640
It goes up like that,
like that.

220
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,544
Let me make sure I'm-- no,
I want to do it actually.

221
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:14,940
This pink guy goes like this.

222
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,320
And then the blue guy is going
to be just like this.

223
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,370
So notice, in this situation
this carbon appears kind of at

224
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,250
the top of the chair, and this
carbon is at the bottom, and

225
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,210
then they've flipped.

226
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,440
But these are equally stable
configurations.

227
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,500
But one way to think about is
all of the axial guys on this

228
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,070
carbon here turned into
equatorial on this carbon and

229
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,900
vice versa on the two.

230
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,640
Let me show it to you.

231
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,270
Let me just draw the hydrogens
on this carbon.

232
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:47,560
This carbon's hydrogens has an
axial hydrogen, and has an

233
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,040
equatorial hydrogen, whose bond
would be parallel to that

234
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,320
just like that.

235
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,080
And this guy would have an
equatorial hydrogen whose bond

236
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,440
is parallel to actually
both of these guys.

237
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,690
And an axial hydrogen.

238
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,190
   

239
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,690
But when it flips, and I'm
just drawing those guys'

240
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,190
hydrogens, but when this
structure flips like that,

241
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,390
what happens?

242
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:14,330
Well, this hydrogen over here
goes into this position, and

243
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,720
this yellow hydrogen over here
goes into this position.

244
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,850
So over here, it was
equatorial, and

245
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,500
now it becomes axial.

246
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,900
The same argument can
be made over here.

247
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,990
This equatorial hydrogen, when
it flips-- when this whole

248
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,030
blue part flips down--
now becomes axial.

249
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,740
   

250
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,230
And this axial hydrogen, when
you flip it down, becomes

251
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,480
equatorial.

252
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,860
   

253
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,040
And you can actually do that
for all of the hydrogens.

254
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,970
Over here you have an
axial hydrogen.

255
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,180
Once you flip it, you have an
axial hydrogen, and then you

256
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,140
have an equatorial hydrogen.

257
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,050
When you flip it, these
two equatorial

258
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,970
hydrogens become axial.

259
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,190
So they become axial and then
both of these guys become

260
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,050
equatorial.

261
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,790
So let me do that in yellow.

262
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,480
Both this guy and this guy
become equatorial So this and

263
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,830
that become equatorial.

264
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,880
They become parallel
to the other end.

265
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,440
And you could do it for these
two hydrogens, as well.

266
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,990
So that's another interesting
to think about.

267
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,630
And this is really just practice
on visualizing what's

268
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,610
going on when we when
we visualize--

269
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,200
