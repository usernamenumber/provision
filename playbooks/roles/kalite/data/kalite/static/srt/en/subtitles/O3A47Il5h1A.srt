1
00:00:01,912 --> 00:00:06,569
Keeping in mind how much salt you should be taking if you're on a low-sodium diet,

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,774
I'm just gonna write that here: "Low sodium diet".

3
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:14,179
I was thinking, of all the food that I typically like to consume

4
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:18,497
and where that fits in the amount that I'm allowed in a given day.

5
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:27,887
If I'm on a low sodium diet the amount was about 1500mg of sodium per day.

6
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:32,501
This is sodium – not salt, remember.

7
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:40,200
If I go through a few foods that'll be fun to figure out how much sodium is in these foods.

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,814
Let's start out with something I had not too long ago:

9
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:50,276
I was recently on a road trip and I stopped off on the side of the road

10
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:59,607
and I picked up one of my favourite little snacks which was a large carton of fries.

11
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:04,002
I had some fries and they were delicious.

12
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:06,246
These are large fries.

13
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:11,274
I actually love to eat fries with ketchup,

14
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:16,831
so I had 5 ketchup packets, so this is one food item.

15
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:19,920
Another food item I've had many many times,

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,037
especially when I’m in a big rush and I don't have time to go out and get a proper lunch,

17
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:30,222
I'll sit down and grab a cup of noodles.

18
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:32,519
I'll grab a cup of noodles and if you had these,

19
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:37,551
they are dehadrated noodles that are in here.

20
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:42,704
If you like me you'll love them.

21
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:44,903
This is a cup of noodles.

22
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:49,584
This was another item that I thought would be good to look at.

23
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:54,177
The next item or the last item is similar to the cup of noodles.

24
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:58,707
It's another cup of noodles but the kind that you might take when you're sick.

25
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:03,603
Whenever I'm sick one of the things I always reach for is a pot of water.

26
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:09,697
I like to boil up the water and cook a block of noodles inside of it.

27
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:14,994
Put the flavoring packet there and these are dehydrated noodles.

28
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:21,039
I like to eat those, so these are my dehydrated noodles in a pot of water.

29
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:27,660
I call that a block of noodles and I usually eat one whole block at a time with the flavoring.

30
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:33,658
I've gotta a few things here: block of noodles, cup of noodles and also my large fries with ketchup.

31
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:37,109
I know my limit is 1500mg in a day,

32
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:40,174
so how far along do these things get me?

33
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:41,773
One by one, let me just tell you the answer.

34
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:48,178
The large fries with packets of ketchup – 5 packets, is about 900mg of sodium.

35
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:53,259
The cup of noodles is about 1200mg of sodium.

36
00:02:53,767 --> 00:03:00,897
You can see I'm going up-up-up, so my block of noodles is actually 1600mg of sodium.

37
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:05,175
This one puts me over the amount that I'm allowed in a whole day

38
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:08,171
and that is usually what I would have just for lunch.

39
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:14,551
It's an immense amount of sodium, tonnes of sodium and it got me thinking:

40
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:20,323
how in the world, and I'm not actually on a low sodium diet, but if I was...

41
00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:22,924
How in the world would I be able to do it?

42
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:28,940
I was browsing the Internet and I came across a website which I'm gonna share with you.

43
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,286
It's from the Mayo Clinic.

44
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,769
I don't want to say this is the only website,

45
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,501
there'are tonnes of great websites out there,

46
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,743
but this one website actually got me thinking.

47
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,801
What I thought is, why don't I figure out what kind of food I could actually get?

48
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:47,273
If I was on a low sodium diet, what would make sense?

49
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:50,045
I picked out a few things from there

50
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:51,880
that I thought would be tasty.

51
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:57,642
They have one thing that's a roasted salmon – this is my salmon.

52
00:03:57,735 --> 00:04:06,568
If I eat a roasted salmon with all of oil and chives, the amount of sodium is 60mg.

53
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,779
Not bad, right?

54
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:15,158
Let's say I wanna eat that with some potatoes – I've got some roasted potatoes over here

55
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:19,191
which I love, so does my dad.

56
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:29,140
These roasted potatoes get me 7mg of sodium.

57
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:38,963
Potatoes are great, salmon is great but I like my vegetables.

58
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:41,838
What if I get some asparagus in there?

59
00:04:41,838 --> 00:04:47,401
Some roasted asparagus and other recipe for mushrooms with a roasted asparagus.

60
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:55,232
This meal is looking better and better and if I get some asparagus with the mushrooms

61
00:04:55,371 --> 00:05:00,984
that's an additional 11mg of sodium, so that's pretty reasonable.

62
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,157
Since since I'm doing so well

63
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:11,338
I was tempted to go to their 'Dessert menu' and I grabbed one of the recipies for apple pie.

64
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:15,943
Apple pie is an American favourite, certainly one of my favourites.

65
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:22,416
I love to make apple pie and that gets me about 16mg of sodium.

66
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:35,074
If I'm totaling all of this up, I've got 60+7+11+16.

67
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:38,071
That total comes to...

68
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:44,826
94mg of sodium.

69
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:52,668
It's 94mg of sodium is well within my limit of 1500mg of sodium per day.

70
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:56,612
This is one place you can go to get some good food recommendations.

71
00:05:56,612 --> 00:06:00,000
As I said there are many many others as well.
