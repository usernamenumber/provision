1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,084
So we have matrix D and matrix B and they ask, is DB defined?

2
00:00:05,084 --> 00:00:07,813
Is the product D times B defined?

3
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:11,299
D times B is going to be defined, is if--

4
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:13,637
Let me make this very clear.

5
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:14,962
This is how I think about it.

6
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:18,029
Let me copy and paste it, so I can do this on my scratch pad.

7
00:00:18,737 --> 00:00:20,738
To answer that question--

8
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:22,886
Let me get out my scratch pad over here.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,498
Let me paste the question right here.

10
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:30,442
Let's think about these 2 matrices.

11
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:33,465
First, we have matix D.

12
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:36,721
I'll do it as a nice bold D here.

13
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:38,884
It has three rows and three columns.

14
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:41,346
It is a three by three matrix.

15
00:00:41,346 --> 00:00:45,228
Then you want to multiply that times matix B.

16
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:51,595
Matrix B is a two by two matrix.

17
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:55,217
The only way that we know to define matrix multiplication

18
00:00:55,217 --> 00:00:58,167
is if these middle two numbers are the same.

19
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:01,926
If the number of columns D has is equal to

20
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:03,911
the number of rows B has.

21
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:06,442
In this case they clearly do not equal each other,

22
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:10,187
so matrix multiplication is not defined here.

23
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:15,097
Let's go back there and say no, no DB is not defined.

24
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:18,151
Let's do a few more of these examples.

25
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:23,198
We have a two by one-- We could view this as a two by one matrix,

26
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:25,223
or we could view this as a column vector.

27
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:27,484
This is another two by one matrix, or column vector.

28
00:01:27,484 --> 00:01:28,967
Is C plus B defined?

29
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:34,209
Matrix addition is defined if both matrices have the exact same dimensions,

30
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:36,972
and these two matrices do have the exact same dimensions.

31
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,741
The reason why is because with matrix addition

32
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,659
you just add every corresponding term.

33
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,055
With the sum the top--

34
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:44,722
It will actually be 4+0 over -2+0,

35
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:48,030
which is still going to be the same thing as this up here.

36
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,448
But what their asking is just to find absolutely

37
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:54,178
that these both are two by one matrices.

38
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:56,295
So yes it is defined.

39
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:57,649
Let's do one more.

40
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:02,308
Once again their asking us is the product A times E defined?

41
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:06,432
Here you have a two by two matrix.

42
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:08,726
Let me copy and paste this so we can make

43
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:11,692
sure we know what we are talking about.

44
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,578
Let's get my scratch pad out.

45
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:22,711
This top matrix right over here, matrix A,

46
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:25,449
is a two by two matrix.

47
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:30,884
Matrix E-- Were gonna multiply it times matrix E,

48
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,398
which has one row and two columns.

49
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:39,669
In this scenario, once again, the number of columns

50
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:44,589
matrix A has is two and the number of rows matrix E has is one.

51
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:47,044
This will not be defined.

52
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:49,706
These two things have to be the same for them to be defined.

53
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:52,318
Now, what is interesting is, if you did it the other way around--

54
00:02:52,318 --> 00:03:00,742
If you took E times A-- Let's check if this would be defined.

55
00:03:00,742 --> 00:03:05,629
Matrix E is one by two, one row by two columns.

56
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:11,526
Matrix A is a two by two, two rows and two columns.

57
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,453
This would have been defined.

58
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:16,567
Matrix E has two columns which is exactly

59
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:19,410
the same number of rows that matrix A has.

60
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,193
This really hits home that the order matters when you multiply matrices.

61
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:27,017
For the sake of this question, is AE defined, no it isn't.

62
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:29,869
We can check our answer, no it isn't.
