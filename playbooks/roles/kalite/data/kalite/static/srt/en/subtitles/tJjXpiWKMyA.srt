1
00:00:08,827 --> 00:00:12,144
That entire set of 23 human chromosomes

2
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:14,195
is called a genome.

3
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,481
The human genome is composed of

4
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:21,884
3 billion base pairs.

5
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:29,850
Variation at a single base pair is called a SNP,

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,076
or single nucleotide polymorphism.

7
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:39,300
When the body makes new cells,

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,383
it doesn't make many mistakes,

9
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:43,833
but nobody is perfect.

10
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:48,184
Sometimes, when the genome is copied, to make a new cell,

11
00:00:48,184 --> 00:00:53,716
a single base pair gets lift out, added, or substituted.

12
00:00:56,147 --> 00:01:01,122
Single base pair substitutions create SNPs.

13
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:09,334
There're around 10 million SNPs in the human genome,

14
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:14,749
which account for many of the genetic differences

15
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:18,146
between you and everyone else on the planet.

16
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:24,068
Some SNPs account for differences in appearance,

17
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:29,296
others can affect how we develop diseases,

18
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:31,245
or respond to drugs.

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,800
Most SNPs, however, seemed to lead to

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,849
no observable differences between people at all.

21
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,987
Since variance are passed down

22
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:46,210
from one generation to the next,

23
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,026
the number of differences between your DNA,

24
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,293
and your neighbors can tell you how closely

25
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:54,476
you're related to each other.
