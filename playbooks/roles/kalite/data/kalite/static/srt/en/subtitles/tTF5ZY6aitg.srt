00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:13,085
We're in the antique collection in Munich, and we're looking at a small drinking cup by an artist whose name is Ezekias from Ancient Greece.

2
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:20,590
It's funny that you call it a small drinking cup because imagine if you drank all the wine that you could put into this bowl, you would be quite drunk.

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,596
It's true. Actually in terms of our wine glasses now, it's pretty big.

4
00:00:24,596 --> 00:00:29,640
The shape is a kylix. You'll notice that it's quite shallow - it's got a little bit of a base,

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,837
a little bit of a pedestal, and it's got two handles that you're meant to hook your thumbs around.

6
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:38,945
It seems to me, as you drank down your wine,

7
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:42,658
the decoration at the bottom of the bowl would be revealed.

8
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:47,951
Well, that's right. It's a little bit unusual but the bowl itself is a canvas for this cup,

9
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:55,757
and we have marvellous scene that shows this Ancient Greek boat occupied by the god Dionysus, the god of wine.

10
00:00:55,757 --> 00:00:58,594
When you just look at it, you can see a few unusual things.

11
00:00:58,594 --> 00:01:02,472
First of all, you've got these playful dolphins that seem to be swimming around the boat.

12
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:06,527
We can imagine the field that would be the water and the sky.

13
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:12,310
It's all red. There's no differentiation, but I've always liked to think that the dolphins of either side of the boat

14
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,849
are jumping out of the water.

15
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,286
There's a sense of joyousness.

16
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:24,318
This is a cup by the great Greek vase-painter Exekias, who we've got thirty-five vases from by this artist.

17
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:28,344
so this a really special object. 
He both painted and potted,

18
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:31,428
and he often signed his work, and that is case here.

19
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:38,509
If you look closely, you can see another unusual element which is that there's a grapevine growing right beside the mast,

20
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:42,605
and there's all these wonderful bunches of grapes and grape leaves that almost function as

21
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:44,809
some kind of harbour over the boat.

22
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:52,882
And the story was that Dionysus was fleeing pirates and, in order to hide from them, he made the grapevine

23
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:57,451
grow from the boat itself and turned the pirates into dolphins.

24
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:07,970
I see how Exekias is trying to fill that circular space of the kylix by making the vines grow out horizontally

25
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,155
and the dolphins jumping all around, so he's using that whole space.

26
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:14,170
It's not an easy space for the artist to fill.

27
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:22,344
No, that's right. And actually there's a gentle curve that almost every element in this composition that seems to be responding to the curvature of the cup itself.

28
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:28,823
There's the arc of the vines, there's the elegant and beautiful arc that's created by the wind-filled sail,

29
00:02:28,823 --> 00:02:31,919
and you can just see it billowing, pushing the boat forward,

30
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,259
and of course, the arcs of the dolphins and of the hull of the ship,

31
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:39,804
and the circular forms of the grapes that mirror the circular shape of the bowl.

32
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:48,347
I love Dionysus. He's lying back as if he's at a dinner party, perhaps he's speaking, but there's a wonderful sense of relaxation.

33
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:53,509
And I like the stars on the cloak that he wears and the leaf-shapes on the crown.

34
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:59,185
This is Attic Black Figure painting. It's a style of painting from the Archaic period.

35
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:04,343
The artist would paint with slipware and then would scratch into it with a kind of needle

36
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:13,763
to incise the lines and create those very delicate patterns that we can in the woodwork of the ship, for example, or in the grapes above Dionysus.

37
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:20,602
You can see in the ship there's quite a bit of ornamentation not only does the prow of the ship have a face carved into it,

38
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:25,450
but you can see a sort of swan's head by its stern. Really, my favourite part is that if your thumb

39
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:31,382
was hooked over the upper handle and this was filled with red wine it would obscure the boat

40
00:03:31,382 --> 00:03:35,719
until you raised it and began to drink it and at one point at least, the boat would seem

41
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:41,021
as if it were floating on a sea of red wine, and you might feel as relaxed as Dionysus.
