1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380
   

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,340
Let's say I have two
transformations.

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,350
I have the transformation S,
which is a function or a

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:13,100
transformation from Rn to
Rm, and I also have the

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,000
transformation T,
which is also a

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,210
transformation from Rn to Rm.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,120
I'm going to define right now
what it means to add the two

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,010
transformations.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,330
So this is a definition.

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,930
Let me write it as
a definition.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,320
I'm going to define the
addition of our two

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,260
transformations.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,470
So if I add our two
transformations, the addition

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,430
of two transformations operating
on some vector x,

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,340
this is a definition.

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,400
I'm going to say this is the
same thing as the first

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,880
transformation operating on the
vector x plus the second

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,880
transformation operating
on the vector x.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,190
And obviously, this is going
to end up being a vector in

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,810
Rm, so this whole thing is going
to be a vector in Rm.

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,680
   

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,300
By definition, this S plus T
transformation is still a

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,910
transformation because it
takes an input from Rn.

24
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:22,380
It's still a transformation
from Rn to Rm.

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,760
Now let me make another
definition.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,730
Let me define -- I'll
do it in green.

27
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,430
Maybe I'll do it in purple.

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,270
I'm going to define a scalar
multiple of a transformation.

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,010
So I'm going to define, let's
say c, where c is just any

30
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,010
real number.

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:44,870
c times the transformation S of
some vector x, I'm going to

32
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,050
say that this is equal to c
times the transformation of x.

33
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:55,080
   

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,290
And so similarly, the
transformation of x obviously

35
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,050
is going to be in Rm.

36
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,240
So if you multiply any vector
in Rm times some scalar,

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,550
you're still going to have
another vector in Rm.

38
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,850
So luckily for us, this
definition of a scalar

39
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,010
multiple-- so if I have this
new transformation called c

40
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:23,590
times S, this is still a
mapping from Rn to Rm.

41
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,690
This is still a vector
in Rm and this is

42
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,220
still a vector in Rn.

43
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,050
Fair enough.

44
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,700
Now, let's see what happens if
we look at their corresponding

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,910
matrices for these
transformation.

46
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,400
We've seen in a previous video
that any linear transformation

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,900
can be represented as a
matrix vector product.

48
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,310
So let's say that S of a vector
x is equivalent to the

49
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,870
matrix A times that vector x.

50
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:58,460
And let's say that T of x is
equal to the matrix B times

51
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,320
the vector x.

52
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,560
And, of course, since both of
these guys are mappings from

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,100
Rn to Rm, both of these
matrices are

54
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,470
going to be m by n.

55
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,810
Both of these are
m by n matrices.

56
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,150
Now, let's just go back to these
definitions that I just

57
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,980
constructed.

58
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,505
What is S of T of x?

59
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:22,230
That can then be written as--
so let me write it this way.

60
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,390
I'll do it in that same color.

61
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,980
So you have S-- I was going
to do it in red.

62
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,460
   

63
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,950
Maybe I'll do it right here.

64
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,720
You have S plus T-- that's
a capital T.

65
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,060
S plus T of x-- I'm just
re-writing this up here -- is

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:49,020
equal to S of x plus T of x, or
the transformation T of x,

67
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,070
which we now know is equal
to these two things.

68
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,950
So this is equal to this
term right there.

69
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,350
The transformation S of
x is equal to Ax.

70
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,160
That's that one right there.

71
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,930
And then the transformation
T of x is equal to B, the

72
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,710
matrix B times x.

73
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,170
Now, what are these things?

74
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,130
Let me write our two matrices in
a form that you're probably

75
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,060
familiar with right now.

76
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,340
Let's say the matrix A is just a
bunch of column vectors: a1,

77
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,750
a2, all the way to an.

78
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,110
And similarly, the matrix
B is just a

79
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,830
bunch of column vectors.

80
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:39,260
The matrix B is b1, b2,
all the way to bn.

81
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,490
These are each column vectors
with m components, one for

82
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,050
each of the rows, and there's n
of these because there are n

83
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,170
columns in each of
these vectors.

84
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,540
So when you multiply this
guy times-- let me

85
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,410
make it very clear.

86
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,590
If I multiply an x, the vector
x is going to look like this.

87
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,960
The vector x is going
to be x1, x2, all

88
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,230
the way down to xn.

89
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,600
And we've shown this multiple,
multiple times.

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,580
It's a very handy way
of thinking about

91
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,790
matrix vector products.

92
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,500
But we know that this product
right here can be written be

93
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,450
as each of these scalar terms
in x times its corresponding

94
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,530
column vector in A.

95
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,420
I've done this, and it's
probably the fifth video that

96
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm doing this.

97
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:32,070
So this can be written as x1, x1
times a1 plus x2 times a2,

98
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,880
all the way to xn times
an is equal to this.

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,090
That's what ax can be rewritten
as, as kind of a

100
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,440
weighted combination of these
column vectors where the

101
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,380
weights are each of the values
of our vector x.

102
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,140
And I have to add
this guy to bx.

103
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,520
So bx, by the same argument, so
plus is just going to be--

104
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,590
let me do it in the blue.

105
00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:03,130
It's going to be x1 times b1
plus x2 times b2, all the way

106
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:08,650
to xn times bn.

107
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,460
Now, what is this equal to?

108
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,920
Well, we know that scalar
multiplication times vector

109
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,270
exhibits the distributive
property, so we can just add

110
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,760
these two guys right here
and factor out the x1.

111
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,590
And what do we get?

112
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,050
We get this is equal to-- this
whole expression right here,

113
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,420
let me draw a line here, because
I'm not saying this

114
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,470
matrix is equal to that.

115
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm saying that this is equal to
this, is equal to this term

116
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:43,380
plus this term, which is equal
to x1 times a1 plus b1, plus

117
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,070
x2 times a2-- I'm just adding
these two terms up-- x2 times

118
00:06:49,070 --> 00:07:01,650
a2 plus b2, all the way to
plus xn times an plus bn.

119
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,870
So what is this thing
equal to?

120
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,480
Well, this is equal to some new
matrix, and let's define

121
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,420
this new matrix.

122
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,010
This is equal to some new
matrix-- I'll make it pretty

123
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:20,820
big right here-- times
our vector x .

124
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,950
I'll do the vector x in green.

125
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:29,380
Vector x we know is x1, x2,
all the way down to xn.

126
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,060
But what is the new matrix
going to be?

127
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,440
Well, this product is going to
be each of these scalar terms

128
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,073
times the column vectors
of this matrix.

129
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:42,210
So these guys right here are
the columns of my matrix.

130
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,020
This thing is equivalent to a
matrix where the first column

131
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,470
right here is a1 plus b1.

132
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,050
We're essentially adding
the column vectors

133
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,190
of those two guys.

134
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,910
The second column right here--
let me draw a little line

135
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,430
right there to show you that
these are different

136
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:56,880
expressions.

137
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,480
The second one would be a2 plus
b2, and then we'll just

138
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,240
have a bunch of them, and
then the last one will

139
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,120
just be an plus bn.

140
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,200
So what happens is that, by
definition, when I added these

141
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,860
two transformations,
I just used their

142
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,850
corresponding matrices.

143
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,050
And I said you know what?

144
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,710
The addition of these two
transformations created a new

145
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:24,410
transformation that is
essentially some matrix times

146
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:30,300
my vector, and that matrix ended
up being the sum of the

147
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,010
corresponding column vectors
of our two original

148
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,590
transformation matrices,
right?

149
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,700
This new matrix that I got, and
I haven't defined matrix

150
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,120
addition yet, but we got
here just by thinking

151
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,789
about vector addition.

152
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,930
This matrix is constructed by
adding the corresponding

153
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,010
vectors of the matrices
A and B.

154
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,300
Now, why did I go through
all of this trouble?

155
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,470
Well, I can make a new
definition here that'll make

156
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,230
everything fit together well.

157
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,820
   

158
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:09,350
I'm going to define this matrix
right here as A plus B.

159
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,410
So my new matrix definition,
if I have two matrices that

160
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,020
have the same dimensions, and
they have to have the same

161
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:21,350
dimensions, I'm defining A plus
B to be equal to some new

162
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,870
matrix where you add up their
corresponding columns.

163
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,870
So a1 plus b1, just like what
I did here, I don't have to

164
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:33,000
rewrite it, all the way up to an
plus bn is the last column.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,360
And you've seen this before in
your algebra II class, but I

166
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,620
wanted here to do it, because
this shows you the

167
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,570
motivation for it.

168
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,340
Because now we can say
that the sum of two

169
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:50,530
transformations, So S plus T of
x, which is equal to S of

170
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:56,080
x-- this is a vector-- S of x
plus T of x, which we know is

171
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:04,530
equal to A times x plus B times
x, we can now say is

172
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,770
equal to, because it's equal to
some new matrix, which we

173
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:13,090
can now call A plus
B times x, right?

174
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,990
I just showed this part is from
the definition of our

175
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,680
transformations into some of
our transformation that I

176
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,140
defined earlier in this video.

177
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,110
And then when we just worked
this out and kind of expressed

178
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,230
these products as products of or
as weighted combinations of

179
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,680
the column vectors
of these guys, we

180
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,020
got to this new matrix.

181
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,630
And I defined this new
matrix as A plus B.

182
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,430
And I did that because it has
this neat property now because

183
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,270
now the sum of two linear
transformations operating on x

184
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,350
is equivalent to, when you think
of it is a matrix vector

185
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,250
product, as the sum of
their two matrices.

186
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,180
Now, let's do the same thing
with scalar multiplication.

187
00:10:52,180 --> 00:11:02,170
We know that c times our
transformation of x by

188
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,410
definition I'm saying is c times
the transformation of x.

189
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,700
So c times whatever vector
this is in Rm.

190
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,210
And so we know that S of x can
be rewritten as Ax, so this is

191
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,290
c times A times x.

192
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,050
And we know that Ax can be
rewritten as this is equal to

193
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:28,230
c times x1 times the first
column vector in a, so a1 plus

194
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:35,650
x2 times a2,xn all the way
to plus xn times an.

195
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,300
Now, what is this?

196
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,990
This is just scalar
multiplication.

197
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,070
We can just distribute this c.

198
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,670
and then what do we get?

199
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,630
We get x, and multiplication
is associative.

200
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,950
c is a scalar, x1 is a scalar,
so we can switch them around

201
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,390
if we want.

202
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,920
We know that scalar
multiplication is

203
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,180
distributive, so we can write
this as x1 times ca1 plus x2

204
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,150
times ca2, all the way
to xn times can.

205
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,710
   

206
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,680
Now, what is this equal to?

207
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,950
This is equal to some
new matrix times x.

208
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,450
This is equal to some new
matrix-- let me make that

209
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:23,586
here-- times x1, x2,
all the way to xn.

210
00:12:23,586 --> 00:12:25,060
And what is that new matrix?

211
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,470
What are the columns
of the new matrix?

212
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,360
Well, the columns are
now that, that,

213
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,340
all the way to that.

214
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:38,090
So the columns of this new
matrix are ca1, ca2, all the

215
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,130
way to can.

216
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,700
Now, why would I go through
this exercise?

217
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,670
Well, wouldn't it be nice,
I already said that by

218
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:55,900
definition a scalar multiple of
a transformation is equal

219
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,830
to the scalar times a
transformation of any vector

220
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,480
that you input into it.

221
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,060
And, of course, that is
equal to c times Ax.

222
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,330
Now, wouldn't it be nice if I
could define this thing as

223
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:15,190
some new matrix times
a vector x, right?

224
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,670
Because this should also be
a linear transformation.

225
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,490
And this new matrix I'm
going to define.

226
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,710
This is a definition again.

227
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:30,780
I'm going to define this new
matrix as being c times A.

228
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,340
So now we have this definition
that c times A, if I take any

229
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,590
scalar times any matrix A, it's
just equal to c times

230
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,280
each of the column vectors.

231
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,462
And we know what happens when
you take a scalar times each

232
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:44,420
of the-- just let
me write this.

233
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,810
This is equal to c times a1, c
times a2-- I'm just rewriting

234
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,920
what I just wrote there-- all
the way to c times an.

235
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,340
But what is this in effect?

236
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,780
We know that when you multiply c
times a vector, you multiply

237
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,490
the scalar times each of
the vector's elements.

238
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,220
So this is the equivalent of
multiplying c times every

239
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,720
entry up in this matrix
right here.

240
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,650
And with this video, you know,
you're probably saying, hey,

241
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,510
Sal, I already knew how to-- in
algebra II in tenth grade

242
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,870
or ninth grade, I already was
exposed to multiplying a

243
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,240
scalar times a matrix or adding
two matrices with the

244
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,940
same dimensions.

245
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,910
Why did you go through all of
this trouble of the defining

246
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,530
the sum of transformations
and the sum of matrices?

247
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,000
And I went through the trouble
because I wanted you to

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,670
understand that there's
nothing-- I mean, it is

249
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,390
natural, but there's nothing
about the universe that said

250
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,970
matrices had to be
defined this way.

251
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,990
Matrix addition, or matrix
scalar multiplication, or the

252
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,460
addition of two transformations.

253
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:47,560
I wanted you to see the
mathematical world has

254
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,300
constructed it in this way
because it seems to have nice

255
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,040
properties that are useful.

256
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,270
And that's what I've
done in this video.

257
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,180
In the next video, I'll
do a couple of scalar

258
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,780
multiplications and matrix
additions just to make sure

259
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,350
that you remember what you had
learned in your ninth or tenth

260
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,810
grade algebra class, but you'll
find that the actual

261
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,770
operations are almost
trivially simple.

262
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,099
