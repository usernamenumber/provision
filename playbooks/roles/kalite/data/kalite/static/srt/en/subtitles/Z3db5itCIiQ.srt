1
00:00:00,952 --> 00:00:05,457
We're asked to rationalize and simplify this expression right over here

2
00:00:05,457 --> 00:00:08,847
and like many problems there are multiple ways to do this.

3
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:15,526
We could simplify a little bit then rationalize, then simplify a little bit more, or we could just rationalize and simplify.

4
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:20,782
And just to make sure that you know what they are even talking about rationalize is just a fancy word,

5
00:00:20,782 --> 00:00:27,516
fancy way of saying we don't want to see any square roots of numbers in the denominator. Thats all it says.

6
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:30,627
So try to get these things outside of the denominator.

7
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:35,773
So the first thing we can do is just simplify then rationalize, then we can think about other ways to do it.

8
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:41,215
So what I'd like to do first is say the principle square root of 8 that can be simplified a little bit because

9
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:48,135
8 is the same thing as the square root of 4 times 2 which is the same thing as

10
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:53,944
the square root of 4 times the square root of 2. So we can rewrite this entire expression as,

11
00:00:53,944 --> 00:01:03,501
the numerator is still the same, 16 plus 2X squared. All of that over, we can rewrite this as the square root of 4 times the square root of 2.

12
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:14,681
The principle square root of 4 we know is just 2. So the square root of 8 we can rewrite as 2 times the principle square root of two.

13
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:21,057
And I've simplified a little bit, I've done no rationalizing just yet, and it looks like there is a little more simplification I can do first.

14
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:25,204
Because everything in the numerator and everything in the denominator is divisible by 2.

15
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:27,673
So lets divide the numerator by 2.

16
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:30,797
So if you divide the numerator by 2, 16 divided by 2,

17
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:34,436
or you could view it as multipying the numerator and denominator by one half.

18
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:37,965
So 16 times one half is 8.

19
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:49,319
2X squared times one half is just X squared. And then 2 times the principle square root of 2 times one half is just the square root of 2.

20
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,729
It is 1 square roots of 2.

21
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:58,306
So this whole thing has simplified to 8 plus X squared, all of that over the square root of 2.

22
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:01,930
And now lets rationalize this.

23
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:09,268
The best way to get this radical out of the denominator is just multiply the numerator and the denominator by the principle square root of 2.

24
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:16,646
So lets do that. So times the principle square root of 2 over the principle square root of 2.

25
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:22,116
Now just to show that it works on the denominator what is the principle square root of 2 times the principle square root of 2?

26
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:29,687
Well its going to be 2. And in our numerator, we are going to distribute this term onto both terms in this expression,

27
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:39,238
so you have 8 times the principle square root of 2 plus the square root of 2 times X squared.

28
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:45,010
And we could consider this done, we have simplified the expression, or if you want you could break it up.

29
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:58,166
You could say this is the same thing as 8 square roots of 2 over 2, which is 4 square roots of 2, plus the square root of 2 times X squared over 2.

30
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:04,020
So depending on your tastes, you might view this as more simple or this as more simple but both are equally valid.

31
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,240
Now I said there were multiple ways to do this.

32
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,779
We could have rationalized right from the get go. Let me start with our original problem.

33
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:17,697
So our original problem was 16 + 2X squared, all of that over the principle square root of 8.

34
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:28,097
We could have rationalized from the get go by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the principle square root of 8.

35
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:30,635
And so in our denominator we'll just get 8.

36
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:41,937
And then in our numerator we would get 16 times the principle square root of 8, plus 2 times the principle square root of 8X squared.

37
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:45,117
And now we could try and simplify this a little bit more.

38
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:57,113
You can say, well, everything in the numerator and denominator is divisible by 2, so the 16 could become an 8 if you divide by 2. The 2 becomes a 1. And this 8 becomes a 4.

39
00:03:57,113 --> 00:04:13,071
And then you get 8 square roots of 8 plus the square root of 8X squared. All of this over 4.

40
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:15,938
And then you say wait, this looks different from what we had over here.

41
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:19,436
And the reason is we still haven't simplified this radical.

42
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:27,759
We know that we can rewrite the principle square root of 8 as 2 square roots of 2.

43
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,800
And then we can see again that everything in the numerator and the denominator is also divisible by 2, so lets do that again.

44
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,871
So if you divide everything in the numerator by 2 you can get rid of this 2 and that 2.

45
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:41,574
And everything in the denominator by 2, this will become a 2.

46
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:53,639
So then you have 8 square roots of 2 plus the square root of 2X squared, all of that over 2.

47
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,476
Which is exactly what we had gotten here.
