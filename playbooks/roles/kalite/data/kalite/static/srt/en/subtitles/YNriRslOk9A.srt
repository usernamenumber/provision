1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,490
We're told methanol, which is
used as a fuel in racing cars

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,650
and fuel cells, can be made
by the reaction of carbon

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,840
monoxide and hydrogen.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,810
So this is the methanol
right there.

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,830
They're giving us 356 grams
of carbon monoxide.

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,280
So carbon monoxide we have
356 grams of it.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,390
And they're giving us 65
grams of hydrogen,

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,640
of molecular hydrogen.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,580
   

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,200
They're mixed and allowed
to react.

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,300
They say what mass of methanol
can be produced?

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,040
And then they say what mass of
the excess reactant remains

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,260
after the limiting reactant
has been consumed?

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,020
So that tells you this is a
limiting reactant problem,

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,800
that we have too much
or too little of one

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,320
of these two reactants.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,100
These are the two
reactants there.

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,190
The one that we have less of is
the limiting reactant and

20
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,740
that'll dictate how much of the
product we can produce.

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,260
And the one that we have more
of is the excess reactant.

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,230
But first we have to figure out
which is the limiting and

23
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,940
which is the excess.

24
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,960
And before we even do that, we
should always check that our

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,050
equation is actually balanced.

26
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,380
So let's just check that.

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,130
On the left-hand side of this
equation we have 1 carbon

28
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,270
right there.

29
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,760
On the right-hand side we also
have 1 carbon, so that looks

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,530
good so far.

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,330
On the left-hand side of the
equation we have 1 oxygen, and

32
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,080
on the right-hand side
we have 1 oxygen.

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,300
Looks good so far.

34
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,460
Left-hand side we have 4
hydrogens, 2 times 2.

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,400
On the right-hand side we have
4 hydrogens, 3 plus 1.

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,040
So this is balanced so we can
proceed to try to figure out

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,360
what the limiting reactant is.

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,360
So the way we want to do it is
to figure out how many moles

39
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,140
of each of these we're given,
and then figure out how many

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,840
moles the stoichiometric
ratio that's

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,770
required by this reaction.

42
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,760
We already know what it is.

43
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:56,690
We know that for every two moles
of hydrogen required, we

44
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,600
require-- you can see it right
here from the equation-- 1

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,265
mole of carbon monoxide.

46
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:06,980
   

47
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,419
This is what the equation tells
us, so let's see how

48
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,000
many moles of hydrogen and how
many moles of carbon monoxide

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,320
we have.

50
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,790
The first place to start--
we've done this several

51
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,610
times-- is what is
the molecular

52
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,860
weight of carbon monoxide?

53
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,770
So carbon monoxide molecular
weight-- let me write it

54
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:30,910
here-- molecular weight
for carbon monoxide.

55
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,620
It's a carbon, has a molecular
weight of 12-- it's good to

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,750
memorize that, carbons and
oxygens and hydrogens show up

57
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,690
so frequently.

58
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,930
And then oxygen is 16.

59
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,100
So it's equal to 28-- a
molecular weight of 28, which

60
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,060
tells us that carbon monoxide,
if we want to view it this

61
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,860
way-- so let's do the carbon
monoxide first. So we're

62
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,370
dealing with the carbon
monoxide.

63
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:04,150
So we have 356 grams of carbon
monoxide, and we want to write

64
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,970
this in terms of how many moles
of carbon monoxide do we

65
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,010
have. So what we want is how
many grams per mole-- but I

66
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,710
actually write-- 1 mole
has how many grams?

67
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:21,570
So 1 mole of carbon monoxide
has how many grams?

68
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,650
Well it's molecular weight
is 28 so if we

69
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,520
have a mole of them.

70
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,330
If we have that 6.02 times 10
to the 23rd molecules of

71
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,100
carbon monoxide.

72
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,610
That's going to weigh 28 grams.
So 1 mole of carbon

73
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,560
monoxide is 28 grams, or I
guess you have 1 mole per

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,120
every 28 grams. The reason why
I wanted to put the grams in

75
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,750
the denominator so it cancels
out over here.

76
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,870
So those cancel out
when we multiply.

77
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,300
And so we are left with 356
times 1 divided by 28 moles of

78
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,250
carbon monoxide.

79
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,100
So let's figure what that is.

80
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,910
That's 356 divided by 28--
right, that's essentially what

81
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:11,320
we're doing-- divided by
28 is equal to 12.71.

82
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,390
Let's just say it's 12.7 moles
of carbon monoxide.

83
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:25,430
   

84
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,300
Now let's do the same thing
for the hydrogen.

85
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,970
   

86
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,830
We have 65 grams of molecular
hydrogen.

87
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,840
What's the molecular
weight of hydrogen?

88
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,010
I'll do this in green
over here.

89
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,390
Molecular weight of hydrogen
is-- well each hydrogen atom

90
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,530
has a molecular weight of 1
times 2, which is equal to 2.

91
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,690
So we have 65 grams of a
molecular hydrogen, and the

92
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,310
same way, we want to
write it in moles.

93
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:58,860
So we're going to multiply it
times-- 1 mole of hydrogen is

94
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,540
equal to how many grams?

95
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,440
Well we just figured it out.

96
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,260
1 mole is equal to its molecular
weight is 2.

97
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,340
So a mole of it is going to have
a mass of 2 grams. You

98
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,110
can view this as 2 grams per
mole or 1 mole per 2 grams.

99
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,480
And we want the grams in
the denominator so it

100
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,890
cancels out over here.

101
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,230
So let's do the math.

102
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,120
That cancels out with that.

103
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,190
And we have 65 times
1 divided by 2.

104
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:41,040
65 divided by 2 is what--
32.5 moles of hydrogen.

105
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,520
Now we know exactly how many
moles of carbon monoxide and

106
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,270
how many moles of hydrogen
they've given us.

107
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,300
Let's figure out what
the ratio is.

108
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,710
And we'll do it in the exact
same way as we wrote up here.

109
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:57,910
So we have 32.5-- this is what
we're given-- moles of

110
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,730
hydrogen-- let me write
that a little bit

111
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:06,250
neater-- moles of hydrogen.

112
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,910
And we're given 12.7 moles--
I'll do that in the same

113
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,830
color-- 12.7 moles of
carbon monoxide.

114
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,190
So if we were to just divide
this, what is this?

115
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,920
I guess you could imagine,
divide the numerator and the

116
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,840
denominator by 12.7, or just
divide 32.5 divided by 12.7,

117
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,090
what do we get?

118
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,520
   

119
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:35,792
32.5 divided by 12.7--
no, that's not-- let

120
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:36,630
me write that again.

121
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,180
32.5-- man, these buttons are--
let me do it with the

122
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:47,015
keyboard-- 32.5 divided by
12.7-- that's a lot better--

123
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:53,960
is 2.5-- I'll just say 2.56.

124
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,430
So this can be re-written as--
so if I just re-write this-- I

125
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,490
should have written it here to
begin with-- I could write

126
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:11,690
this as we have 2.56 moles of
molecular hydrogen for every 1

127
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,646
mole of carbon monoxide.

128
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:18,340
   

129
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,910
So this is what we need for
a reaction to occur.

130
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,540
This is what the balanced
equation tells us.

131
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,030
It tells us that we need 2 moles
of hydrogen for every

132
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,800
mole of carbon dioxide.

133
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,070
Based on what they've given us,
we just figured out that

134
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,040
we have 2.56 moles of
hydrogen for every

135
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,550
mole of carbon dioxide.

136
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,480
So we have more than
enough hydrogen.

137
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,810
We only need 2 for every
mole of carbon dioxide.

138
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,160
We have 2.56.

139
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,070
So we have an excessive
amount of hydrogen.

140
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,690
So the excess reactant
is the hydrogen.

141
00:07:53,690 --> 00:08:01,360
Hydrogen is excess reactant.

142
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,420
And the other one's going to
be the limited reactant.

143
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,850
We don't have enough carbon
monoxide to react all of the

144
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,760
hydrogen, right?

145
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,400
We only have 1 for every 2.56.

146
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,390
We would actually, for this,
says you need 1.25 or whatever

147
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,400
for every, or 1.28
for every 2.56.

148
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,770
It should be a 1:2 ratio.

149
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,600
So we don't have enough
carbon monoxide to

150
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,760
react all of the hydrogen.

151
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:37,400
So carbon monoxide is the
limiting reactant.

152
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,700
Now given that this is the
excess reactant, we can use

153
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,320
the stoichiometric ratios to
figure out how much methanol's

154
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,020
going to be produced.

155
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,050
It's all going to be limited
by our carbon monoxide.

156
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,090
Did I just say-- hydrogen's
not the limiting reactant,

157
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,300
carbon monoxide is the
limiting reactant.

158
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,500
We have more than
enough hydrogen.

159
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,940
So how much carbon monoxide
do we have?

160
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,880
We already figured it out.

161
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,370
We have 12.7 moles of
carbon monoxide.

162
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,990
And we look at our-- let me
write this over here-- so we

163
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,840
have 12.7 moles of
carbon monoxide.

164
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,780
And looking at our original
equation, we see for every

165
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,675
mole of carbon monoxide, we
produce 1 mole of methanol.

166
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:28,710
So let's write that down.

167
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,240
Times-- and we want the carbon
monoxide in the denominator.

168
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:41,910
So for every 1 mole of carbon
monoxide used we have 1 mole

169
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:49,340
of methanol, which is, what,
CH3OH-- did I get that right,

170
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,750
yup-- produced.

171
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,880
We get that straight from
the balanced equation.

172
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
And this math is pretty
easy, but it gives

173
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,740
us the right unit.

174
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,980
Remember, we're using the
carbon monoxide, not the

175
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,380
hydrogen because the
carbon monoxide's

176
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,760
the limiting reagent.

177
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,680
That's what's telling us what's
going-- if we used

178
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,620
hydrogen as the limiting
reactant, then we wouldn't

179
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,440
have enough carbon monoxide
for the reaction to occur.

180
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,410
So this is what's kind of
capping off on how much this

181
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,040
reaction can move forward.

182
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,130
But the whole point of this was
to cancel that and that.

183
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:28,210
So, obviously, if we're using
12.7 moles of carbon monoxide,

184
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:34,700
we're going to produce
12.7 moles of

185
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,540
methanol will be produced.

186
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,130
   

187
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,520
And now we just have to figure
what is the mass of 12.7 moles

188
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,500
of methanol.

189
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,520
And we just think about what
the atomic weight.

190
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,340
So if you look at methanol,
CH3-- let me

191
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,490
put the H3-- H3OH.

192
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:05,090
Its atomic weight is 12 plus 3
times 1 plus 3 plus 16 plus 1.

193
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,730
So what is this?

194
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:14,150
This is 20 plus 2 is equal to
32, or if we think in moler

195
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,650
terms-- or not moler terms, I
should just say 32 moles--

196
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:24,940
this is its atomic weight.

197
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,090
So that tells us that if we have
a mole of it we're going

198
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:38,930
to have 32 grams of methanol
per 1 mole of methanol.

199
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,730
And once again, we got
that by figuring

200
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,310
out its atomic weight.

201
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,150
Now to convert the number of
moles that we have of methanol

202
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,260
to the number of grams, we just

203
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,420
multiplied that times that.

204
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,440
That units work out.

205
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,590
This is in the numerator, this
is in the denominator.

206
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,970
Let me just copy and paste it.

207
00:11:52,970 --> 00:12:00,180
So we have that, copy and
paste, and then we can

208
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,440
multiply it times that.

209
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,360
Let me copy and paste it.

210
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,430
You get that right there, and
I'll pick a different color,

211
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,660
maybe a blue.

212
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,620
Just like that, and then let's
multiply these two.

213
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:27,200
We have moles of methanol, and
we're left with 12.7 times 32

214
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,980
is equal to-- so let me just
keyboard again, let me clear

215
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:41,470
it out-- 12.7 times 32, 406.4.

216
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,650
I'm kind of adding an extra
significant digit there, but

217
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,510
let's just go with it.

218
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:50,610
406.4-- actually, I
should just stay

219
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,440
with significant digits.

220
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,230
So we'll say 406 grams-- I'm
rounding down-- 406 grams of

221
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:05,390
methanol-- let me write it with
the units-- so grams of

222
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:11,530
methanol-- I went off the
screen-- of methanol produced.

223
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,720
I could write the produced
down here

224
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,940
since we're all done.

225
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,880
So I think that was the first
part of our question.

226
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,190
How many grams of methanol.

227
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,560
What mass of methanol, that's
400-- I have a horrible

228
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,170
memory-- 406 grams. And then
they say what mass of excess

229
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,900
reactant remains after
the limiting

230
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,030
reactant has been consumed?

231
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,280
Now there's a couple of
ways you can do this.

232
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,320
The easiest way to think
about it is that the

233
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,650
mass has to be conserved.

234
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:53,510
So we started off over here with
65 grams of-- let me be

235
00:13:53,510 --> 00:14:00,250
careful-- we started off here
with 356 grams of carbon

236
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:07,260
monoxide, and 65 grams of
hydrogen, and we were able to

237
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,450
produce 406 grams of methanol.

238
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,020
And we figured out that
carbon monoxide was

239
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,190
the limiting reactant.

240
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,750
So all of this gets consumed,
and only some

241
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,560
of this gets consumed.

242
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,800
So if you do the math, what gets
consumed has to be equal

243
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,900
to 406 grams because that's
what gets produced.

244
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,440
So let's think about
it a little bit.

245
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,630
The left-hand side, how many
total grams do we have?

246
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:45,740
So if we have 356 plus 65, we're
starting off with 421

247
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,010
grams of reactant.

248
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:58,860
So we're starting with 421 grams
of reactant, and then we

249
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:09,810
end up with 406 grams of
product, of our methanol.

250
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,510
So that means that 421
minus 406 grams of

251
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,070
reactant was not used.

252
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,730
So that means that 421 minus
406, which is equal to what?

253
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:34,780
21 minus 6 is 15 grams
of reactant not used.

254
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,400
Now the reactant that's not
going to be used is the one

255
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,550
that you have an excess of.

256
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,296
And we figured out that we have
an excess of hydrogen.

257
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:45,480
   

258
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,270
So all of that 15 grams must
have been 15 grams of hydrogen

259
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,870
that was not used.

260
00:15:52,870 --> 00:16:00,020
So 15 grams of hydrogen
left over.

261
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,760
Now the other way you could
have done this exact same

262
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,260
problem is you could have said
look, we're starting with 12.7

263
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,410
moles of carbon monoxide--
that's the limiting reactant.

264
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,840
It's a 2:1 ratio-- you need 2
moles of hydrogen for every

265
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,670
mole of carbon monoxide.

266
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,410
So you said, OK, if we have
12.7 moles of this, I need

267
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,830
twice that many moles
of hydrogen.

268
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,470
So you would say well,
what's twice that?

269
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,820
That's 25.4.

270
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:38,600
You need 25.4 moles, you have
32.5, so you subtract the

271
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,255
difference-- you subtract 32.5
minus 25.4-- And that number

272
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,450
of moles of hydrogen
is left over.

273
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:53,310
You'd multiply it times the
grams per mole, which is 2,

274
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,330
and then you, once again, would
get the same thing.

275
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,040
You would get 15 grams.

276
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,730
Let's do that.

277
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,160
I just want to make sure
you understand.

278
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:11,490
So we're starting off with 12.7
moles of carbon monoxide.

279
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:17,770
And we know that we are required
that 2 moles of

280
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:24,150
hydrogen are required for every
1 mole of CO, of carbon

281
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,760
monoxide, that is required.

282
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,940
So you know that this cancels
with that, you know 12.7 times

283
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:42,070
2 is 25.4 moles of
H2 required.

284
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,560
And what is the mass of
25.4 moles of H2.

285
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,460
So let's write that.

286
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:54,160
25.4 moles of hydrogen
required.

287
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,080
Times-- well we know the
molecular weight of H2 is 2,

288
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,080
so 1 mole, we're going
to have 2 grams of H2

289
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,950
per 1 mole of H2.

290
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,260
This cancels out, mole
of H2, mole of H2.

291
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:19,050
So we're going to have
25.4 times 2 is what?

292
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,930
That is 50.8.

293
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:29,560
That is going to be 50.8
grams of H2 required.

294
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,710
   

295
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,940
That's how much we're going to
consume in the reaction.

296
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,450
Now they wanted to know
how much is left over.

297
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,680
So we're going to
consume 50.8.

298
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,910
We started with 65.

299
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:50,660
So if you subtract 50.8 from
65-- 65 minus 50.8-- you're

300
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,520
going to get what?

301
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:59,240
You're going to get 14.2
grams left over.

302
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:06,200
And that compares to the 16 we
got left over when we just

303
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,040
took the 421 minus the 406.

304
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,010
And the difference between the
14.2 and the 15 is really just

305
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,200
