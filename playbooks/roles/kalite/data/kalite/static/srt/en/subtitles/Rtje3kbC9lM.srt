1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,360
We're asked to find the height
of a cylinder with a volume of

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,520
16 pi n to the fifth and a
base whose radius is 2n.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,870
So just as a little bit of
review of how you find the

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,930
volume of a cylinder, let
me draw a cylinder here.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,300
So if that is the top of my
cylinder and that is the

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,560
height of-- I'm not drawing
it as straight as I could.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,790
If that is the height of my
cylinder and if this cylinder

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,530
was transparent and you could
see the base, which is just

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,730
like the top of it, It would
look something like that.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,330
I should draw that second one
with a dotted line to show you

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,950
that you would only see it if
our cylinder was transparent.

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,010
That's our cylinder.

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,430
The volume of a cylinder, if
the height is h-- So if our

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,760
height of our cylinder is h, and
that if you had an area of

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,610
either the top or the bottom,
either the base of the top of

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:01,240
it of a, the volume of your
cylinder is going to be equal

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,050
to the height times the area
of the top or the base.

19
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,890
Depending on if you turn this
over, this would be the base.

20
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,870
Times the area of the base.

21
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,610
Now, what do they
tell us here?

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,530
We want to find the height.

23
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,430
They say find the height.

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,230
So we need to solve for h.

25
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,350
This is what we don't know.

26
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,050
Of a cylinder with a volume
of 16 pi n to the fifth.

27
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,880
So they tell us the volume.

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,780
They tell us the volume is
16 pi n to the fifth.

29
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,490
So that right there is
16 pi n to the fifth.

30
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,460
And then they tell us a base
whose radius is 2n.

31
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,730
So they're not telling
us the area, they're

32
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,290
telling us the radius.

33
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,290
They're telling us that this
radius right here is 2n right

34
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,470
over there.

35
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,250
Now, if you know the radius of
a circle, you know the area.

36
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,050
This top and the bottom,
these are circles.

37
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,330
That's what makes
it a cylinder.

38
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,630
These are circles.

39
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,190
So if you know the radius,
you know this area.

40
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,370
Area is equal to pi r squared.

41
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,480
One of the first things
we learn in geometry.

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,539
And so in this situation,
it would be equal to pi.

43
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,640
Our radius, they
tell us is 2n.

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,110
So pi times 2n squared.

45
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,020
And we know this is the same
thing, so area is equal to,

46
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,040
what is this? pi times
2 squared, which

47
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,080
is 4 times n squared.

48
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,230
4n squared.

49
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,390
Or if we just rearranged
it, area is

50
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,950
equal to 4 pi n squared.

51
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,780
So that's the area, that
right over there.

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,020
And so now we can solve for h.

53
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,140
We have 16 pi n to the fifth.

54
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,490
That's our volume.

55
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,160
That is equal to our height
times the area.

56
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,140
Times the area of the base or
the top of our cylinder.

57
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,790
Times 4 pi n squared.

58
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,080
Now, a good place to start if
we're trying to solve for h or

59
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,900
actually, it'll get us right
there immediately, is let's

60
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,430
divide both sides of this
equation by 4 pi n squared.

61
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,330
So you divide the right side
by 4 pi n squared.

62
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,130
Divide the left side
by 4 pi n squared.

63
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,550
You have to do it
to both sides.

64
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,310
On the right-hand side,
these cancel out.

65
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,590
That was the whole point.

66
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,500
And you are left with h is equal
to this thing over here.

67
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,640
We can simplify this
a good bit.

68
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,270
We have a pi divided by a
pi, so those cancel out.

69
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:30,300
We have a 16 divided by 4,
that cancels out to a 4

70
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,080
divided by a 1, or just a 4.

71
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,470
And then you have n to the
fifth over n squared.

72
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,920
So when you have an exponent
in the denominator, you can

73
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,250
subtract it from the exponent
in the numerator.

74
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,750
So this is going to
be 4 right here.

75
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,750
Or 4/1.

76
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,010
I'll just write it as 4.

77
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,140
The pi's disappeared.

78
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,850
Times n to the 5 minus
2 power, which is 3.

79
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,930
n to the third power.

80
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,930
And we're done.

81
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,970
The height of the cylinder
is 4n to the third power.

82
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,466
