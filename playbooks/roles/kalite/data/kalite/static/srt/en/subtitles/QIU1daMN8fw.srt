1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,660
A couple of videos ago, we
learned that a function that

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:13,550
is a mapping from the set x to
the set y is invertible if and

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:19,070
only if-- and I'll write that as
a if with two f's --if and

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,160
only if for every y-- so
let me write this down.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,480
I'll do this in yellow.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:35,610
For every y that is a member of
our co-domain, there exists

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:46,260
a unique-- and I'll make that a
little bit bold --a unique x

9
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:56,730
that is a member of our domain,
such that f of this x

10
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,580
is equal to this y.

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,320
So that's just saying that if
I take my domain right here,

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,410
that's x, and then I take a
co-domain here, that is y, we

13
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,290
say that the function
f is invertible.

14
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,280
   

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,740
And we know what invertibility
means.

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,337
It means that there's this
other function called the

17
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:22,410
inverse that can essentially,
if you take that in

18
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,145
composition with f, it's like
taking the identity on x.

19
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:27,360
Or if you take f in composition
with it, it's like

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,850
taking the identity on y.

21
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,130
And we've done that multiple
times so I

22
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,330
won't repeat that there.

23
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,360
We know what invertibility
means, but we learned that

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,290
it's invertible, if and only if,
for every y here, so you

25
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,320
take any y here, any y that's
a member of your co-domain,

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,740
there exists a unique x,
such that f of x is

27
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,990
equal to that y.

28
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,270
   

29
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,908
Let me write it this way.

30
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:56,370
If this is an x, let's say
that's an x not, f of x not

31
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,020
would be equal to y.

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,390
So this y would be equal
to f of x not.

33
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,450
You apply the function here.

34
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,860
It's going to map it
to this point here.

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,670
It wouldn't be invertible
if you had this.

36
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,870
If you had two members
of x mapping here.

37
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,400
That would break invertibility
if you had this situation,

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,270
because then you wouldn't have
the unique condition.

39
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,980
You have to have a unique x
that maps to this thing.

40
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,050
And what I just drew here, this
other pink mapping, we

41
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,750
don't have a unique x that maps
to y, we have two x's

42
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,040
that map to y.

43
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,960
Now, based on what I just told
you on that last video, what

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,342
does this mean?

45
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:37,110
If we have a unique x
that maps to each y?

46
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,910
That means that we have to have
a one-to-one mapping.

47
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,200
That f has to be one-to-one.

48
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,820
Let me write that.

49
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,470
Another way of saying
this, is that f is

50
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,220
one-to-one, or injective.

51
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,500
   

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,210
If we have two guys mapping to
the same y, that would break

53
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,030
down this condition.

54
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,170
We wouldn't be one-to-one and
we couldn't say that there

55
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:09,440
exists a unique x solution to
this equation right here.

56
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,290
Now, the other part of this is
that for every y -- you could

57
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,560
pick any y here and there
exists a unique x

58
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,840
that maps to that.

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,540
There cannot be some y here.

60
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,640
Let's say that there's some y
here, and no one maps to that.

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,580
   

62
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,810
If that's the case, then we
don't have our conditions for

63
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,070
invertibility.

64
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,380
So that would be
not invertible.

65
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,550
Everything in y, every element
of y, has to be mapped to.

66
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,510
All of these guys have
to be mapped to.

67
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,110
And they can only be mapped to
by one of the elements of x.

68
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,940
Everything here has to be mapped
to by a unique guy.

69
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,100
Now, in the last video, what did
we call it went a function

70
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,350
maps to every element
of your co-domain?

71
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,940
So this every here, what is
another way of saying that?

72
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,220
That a function maps to every
element of your co-domain?

73
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,940
On the last video I explained
that notion is called a

74
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:19,730
surjective or onto function.

75
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,150
So the whole reason why I'm
doing this video is because I

76
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,360
really just want to restate
this condition for

77
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,280
invertibility using the
vocabulary that I introduced

78
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,020
to you in the last video.

79
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,800
So given that the statement for
every y that's a member of

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,370
our co-domain, there exists
a x that maps to it.

81
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,220
We could just say that
f is surjective.

82
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:49,510
   

83
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,450
If we just say that f is
surjective, that means that

84
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,070
everything here is mapped to.

85
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,440
But it could be mapped to, maybe
this person right here,

86
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,090
could be mapped to
by more than one.

87
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,150
Surjective doesn't, by itself,
make the condition that

88
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,830
there's a unique mapping
from a member of x to

89
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,895
that element of y.

90
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:09,130
So in order to get that, in
order to satisfy the unique

91
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,200
condition of this condition for
invertibility, we have to

92
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,665
say that f is also injective.

93
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:19,500
   

94
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,130
And obviously, maybe the less
formal terms for either of

95
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,950
these, you call this onto,
and you could call this

96
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,700
one-to-one.

97
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,280
So using the terminology that we
learned in the last video,

98
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,340
we can restate this condition
for invertibility.

99
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,290
We can say that a function that
is a mapping from the

100
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:48,820
domain x to the co-domain y is
invertible, if and only if --

101
00:05:48,820 --> 00:06:03,320
I'll write it out -- f is both
surjective and injective.

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,230
   

103
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,530
Or we could have said, that f is
invertible, if and only if,

104
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:18,200
f is onto and one-to-one.

105
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,110
And these are really just fancy
ways of saying for every

106
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,290
y in our co-domain, there's a
unique x that f maps to it.

107
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,850
There isn't more than one and
every y does get mapped to.

108
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:30,867
