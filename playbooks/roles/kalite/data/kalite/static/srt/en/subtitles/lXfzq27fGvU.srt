2
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:08,475
...the fourth floor of the Museum of Modern Art

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:13,119
and the room devoted to pop art and we're looking at a really great painting.

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,791
It's actually a really large painting.

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,556
It's not really a painting entirely.

6
00:00:16,556 --> 00:00:20,875
It's called "Gold Marilyn", as in Marilyn Monroe. It's from 1962.

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:26,494
And it's not only that it's big, but it feels expensive because most of the canvas is covered

8
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:30,999
with this kind of slightly metallic bronzish gold paint.

9
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:33,674
Marilyn's head sort of floating... in a rectangle in the center.

10
00:00:33,736 --> 00:00:38,708
Too small... I mean, really sort of weirdly isolated within the plane of the gold.

11
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:42,191
Look at Marilyn's head. First of all, this is interesting because it was from -

12
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:47,392
if I remember correctly - the last photo session that she vetted and sort of approved

13
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:50,457
and if you look at it it's actually terribly printed, it's not painted at all.

14
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:51,572
No, it's a print.

15
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:54,729
Yeah, from a newspaper. From a photograph from a newspaper that's been blown up,

16
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:59,002
printed in black and then really garishly overprinted with bad registration,

17
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:02,810
with these horrible colors that came right out of Dick Tracy comic strips.

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,711
This yellow on top of the black for the hair, and the red for the lipstick,

19
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,197
and the green eyeshadow.

20
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:10,194
Oh, God, this turquoise is just awful, isn't it?

21
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:15,720
And then really the most glamorously garish - the red of the lips over the black.

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,668
This was right after her suicide. So this is very powerful stuff.

23
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:24,017
So this is almost a memorial. I think it's got religious overtones, I think this is a kind of icon.

24
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,679
I think that the gold is functioning like the gold in a Byzantine painting

25
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:32,090
and she's replaced the Virgin Mary. She is in our consumer culture,

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,177
in our culture of glamor, of fame, which was incredibly important to Warhol,

27
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:37,756
she is now...

28
00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:39,660
That is our culture, that is who we are.

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,564
It is. And that's Warhol's brilliance.

30
00:01:41,564 --> 00:01:45,651
He's not thinking about the history of art so much as what is authentic to now.

31
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:50,852
In fact, let's go back to the printing issue. Warhol, I think, makes a really interesting assessment,

32
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:55,868
which is - the painting is no longer an entirely authentic process in 1962.

33
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:59,025
When we live in a world that is a world of manufacture, of mass production,

34
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:03,579
then he steps back and he stops painting, he starts making prints which are multiple,

35
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:07,016
he starts hiring people to make prints for him and he does this in a studio

36
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:08,318
which he calls The Factory.

37
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,283
This has got to have been upsetting to people who were looking for the craft of painting.

38
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:19,459
And worse than that, what pop's main issue was - turning the still life, the landscape,

39
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:24,567
traditional history painting, what was left of it - all of those, in a sense, ancient traditions,

40
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,843
on its head and looking to popular culture.

41
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:32,462
Painting no longer the Virgin Mary, but a pop icon, is an incredibly powerful,

42
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:34,552
aggressive statement against Western culture.

43
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:39,451
It was Lichtenstein who was asked in... I think it was 1961 or '62... what was pop art

44
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:44,328
and he said: you know, after Abstract Expressionism, we could take an oil-soaked rug,

45
00:02:44,328 --> 00:02:46,185
put it on the wall and somebody would call it a work of art.

46
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:48,507
We were looking for something that was still despicable.

47
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:50,365
And he said that the thing that was still really despicable

48
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:53,616
was popular visual culture, was the stuff of our commercial world.

49
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:54,683
The low culture...

50
00:02:54,836 --> 00:03:00,233
To me, this opens up a whole issue about identity and the way we assume identity.

51
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:04,274
This is not Marilyn. In fact, we don't have any access to who she actually is at all.

52
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:06,729
What we have here is her mask.

53
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,010
