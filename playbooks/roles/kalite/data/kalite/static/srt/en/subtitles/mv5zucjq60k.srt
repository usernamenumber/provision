1
00:00:00,257 --> 00:00:02,674
Whenever people talk about investing

2
00:00:02,674 --> 00:00:06,344
the terms risk and reward tend to come up a lot

3
00:00:06,344 --> 00:00:08,450
and they usually tend to come up

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,579
together, somehow implying that the more risk you take the more reward

5
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,995
that you might be able to get, and that's

6
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:15,553
actually what it is implying.

7
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:17,273
But what I want to do in this video

8
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:18,734
is give a little bit of an introduction to that

9
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,329
or a little bit context, a little bit more structure

10
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:23,363
on how do you think about risk and reward.

11
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:26,682
So let's say that we have $1,000

12
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:31,262
and we want to figure out what we can do with this $1,000

13
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:34,412
well, one option is we could just put it into a savings account

14
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:37,083
so here is one option,

15
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,620
so we could put it into a savings account

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,916
and in this situation our reward, I'll start with the reward first,

17
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:50,662
is we'll get, I don't know, 1% in interest per year

18
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:59,134
1% annual interest, so after a year we'll have roughly $1,010

19
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:01,603
we got 1% on our $1,000. So we get a little bit of reward

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,882
what's our risk?

21
00:01:03,882 --> 00:01:06,618
So the risk here, I'll write risk in a different color

22
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:09,800
what is the risk here?

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,907
We'll if I'm putting it into a saving account

24
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:14,970
and assuming I'm putting it into and FDIC insured savings account

25
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:17,952
let me put that over here,

26
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,865
if you do open a savings account it should be FDIC insured,

27
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:24,318
that means that it means it's being insured by the federal reserve

28
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:28,028
which means that if for whatever reason that bank were to fail

29
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:32,961
above, below some limit, the Fed will insure your money

30
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:36,658
so even if the bank fails, and it loses all of it's money and everything

31
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:39,166
you'll still get your deposit back.

32
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:43,411
So if you're investing, and you're putting money in an FDIC insured savings account

33
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:50,313
your risk is essentially 0. You are guaranteed to get that $1,000 back

34
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:53,940
regardless of what happens to that bank,

35
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,365
so you have very little risk there.

36
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,530
But you might say, look, this is a good risk

37
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,757
but I feel I can get more than 1% on my money

38
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:04,920
let me think about the other place that I could invest it.

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,526
Well you could, and obviously I'm not going to be exhaustive on all of the different

40
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:12,165
investment options, I just want to give you a sense of risk and reward,

41
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,550
you could say well maybe I could lend the money

42
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,521
to a very reputable company, so let me say

43
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:28,197
Lend Money to Reputable Company.

44
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:30,472
And maybe this company has, you know,

45
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:32,754
a ton, billions and billions of dollars in assets,

46
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:34,980
it's been around for hundreds of years,

47
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,404
it generates cash on a regular basis,

48
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:40,554
there's really very few circumstances in which you could imagine

49
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:44,818
that this company would not be able to pay off it's debt.

50
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:49,686
and you lend money to a reputable company by essentially buying their bonds.

51
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:54,016
When you buy a company's bonds, you are lending money to that company,

52
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:56,693
so that's just the way you should think about it.

53
00:02:56,693 --> 00:03:01,711
So the reward here, if you lend your money to this company

54
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:09,282
they will pay you 6% in annual interest on your $1,000

55
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:13,511
So, 6% on the first $1,000, on the first year,

56
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:17,220
you'd get $60, this is 6 times more than what you were getting

57
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,268
in the savings account. What's the risk here?

58
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:22,481
Well, it's not 0 anymore, it's not FDIC insured,

59
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:25,446
the Federal Reserve is not saying they'll either

60
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:27,051
give the money if the bank goes out of business,

61
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:29,154
or they'll print the money if they don't even have it,

62
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:33,000
here the risk is that the business defaults on the loan.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,015
So the Business Defaults on the Loan.

64
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:41,275
So the company itself might go bankrupt,

65
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:45,529
if it goes bankrupt, then all the people that the company owes money to

66
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,648
will go after that company's assets.

67
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,915
But maybe you are low on the pecking order,

68
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:52,225
maybe the company doesn't have enough assets to pay everyone back

69
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:55,044
so there is some risk, any business could go out of business

70
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:57,149
you never know what might happen,

71
00:03:57,149 --> 00:04:00,486
but since this is a very reputable company

72
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:03,262
and as we said it has a lot of assets, it has a very

73
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:06,633
stable business, it does good in boom times

74
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:10,186
and recessions, this is a low risk of business default,

75
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:13,330
so I'll write low risk right over here

76
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,296
because we're assuming it is a reputable company

77
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:19,193
that has a lot of assets and all the rest.

78
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:22,275
Now lets say that even that 6%, you know

79
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:26,149
it's alright, but you feel like you could get more,

80
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:31,002
you could do better, so let's say that you have a friend

81
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:35,482
who is a, let's say he's just starting his career as a

82
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:40,180
doctor, so he has a nice stable job,

83
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,520
so he's just starting his career as a doctor

84
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,737
so stable income

85
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:52,001
he's making $200,000 a year,

86
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,661
but he's just out of medical school

87
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:57,482
and he figures he wants to buy a house

88
00:04:57,482 --> 00:05:00,906
and so he's trying to find people, so he's just starting

89
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:04,166
he wants to find people who can help him with the downpayment

90
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:08,092
on the house. So here, your reward,

91
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:10,249
and he says anyone who is willing to lend to me

92
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:18,816
I will give them 8% annual interest on their money

93
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:21,666
annual interest, and it looks pretty good,

94
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,843
stable income, it's only $1,000, he's not buying

95
00:05:23,843 --> 00:05:28,416
an outlandishly expensive house, he's buying a $200,000 house

96
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,814
on which he wants to put $40,000 downpayment,

97
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:33,206
seems well within his means to pay it,

98
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:36,280
but there is always some risk, there is always some risk

99
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,509
that he doesn't pay.

100
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,591
Who knows? Hopefully this doesn't happen,

101
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:45,282
maybe something happens to him himself,

102
00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:46,957
maybe he's not able to work as a doctor, maybe

103
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:48,670
something happens to his health,

104
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,754
maybe he has some type of addictive personality

105
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:55,072
and he likes to drink away

106
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:57,137
all of his money, or he likes to gamble it away

107
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:59,285
and that's why he needs loans to begin with,

108
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:01,549
so there is some risk, so there's a risk he doesn't pay

109
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:05,616
but by all indications he looks like a pretty safe character,

110
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,499
but it's definitely riskier than this company

111
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:11,170
because you have no assets to go after if he doesn't pay

112
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,815
companies can't randomly be hit buy a bus,

113
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:15,432
a human being can,

114
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:17,416
so there are, companies for the most part

115
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,465
cannot become alcoholics, a human can.

116
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,793
Who knows? We don't know. But there are definitely

117
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:25,147
more risks associated with this individual doctor

118
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:27,617
who does not have assets you can go after.

119
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:30,237
But maybe this is also not enough reward,

120
00:06:30,237 --> 00:06:32,482
you're like, you know, I heard that I can do even better

121
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:35,354
I can do better than this in the stock market

122
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:40,187
so, you look at another option, so let's say you invest

123
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:42,768
invest the market.

124
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:49,030
Invest in Stock Market. And you're just going to invest

125
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:54,133
in a bunch of, a broad portfolio, kind of investing in the market as a whole,

126
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:57,315
the reward here would be the expected return of the market.

127
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:59,901
So you look at historical results in the market, and you say, hey look

128
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,036
it goes up and down every year, but over long periods

129
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:04,115
of time it looks like people and

130
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:06,640
this isn't the exact number, but it looks like people have

131
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,496
average, approximately 10% per year.

132
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:13,922
So that looks pretty good, but what's the risk?

133
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:17,337
Well the risk is is that, this expectation is

134
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:20,750
just based on historical, what the historical returns of the market were,

135
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,959
there are huge periods of time in the market

136
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,113
I'm talking 10, 20, 30 years, where the market

137
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,465
is flat, where the market could even go down,

138
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:31,284
people, in any given year, the market could go down in the double digits,

139
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:36,146
or, you know, 30% 40%, even really bad year,

140
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:38,700
that we really don't, you really aren't sure

141
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,530
whether you're going to get your 10% per year.

142
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,990
So I would say the risk here is volatility,

143
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,172
and volatility just means we go up and down,

144
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,490
it jumps up and down,

145
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,376
it's not going to be a constant upward trend

146
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:52,064
like your savings account will be,

147
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:56,862
volatility, and you have a good chance you could actually

148
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:59,416
lose the money that you're investing,

149
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,229
it could go down in any year, in any month

150
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:03,677
in any 5 years, in any 10 years, so once again

151
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:06,661
it seems like a kind of risky thing,

152
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:09,856
and you could very easily lose everything,

153
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,214
and let's say that even 10% isn't enough for you

154
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:13,965
You say, hey, I want to look at things that maybe I could get

155
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:16,161
even a better return.

156
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:19,230
So you have a, your brother in law, who's been out of work

157
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,615
for a little bit.

158
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:24,916
Let me write the brother in law over here,

159
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,698
your brother in law has been out of work

160
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:30,854
for a little bit, and he says that all he needs

161
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:34,534
to start his new guaranteed money-making

162
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:38,568
scheme, is $1,000 so he can buy the equipment

163
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:42,197
so he can start it up in his garage, and the reward

164
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:45,750
and there's multiple ways we could setup the reward,

165
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,688
we could make it so that he borrows the money from you

166
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:49,878
we could make it so that you own part of the business

167
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:53,649
so let's say the reward is you get a 50% stake in the business

168
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:59,124
50% stake in business

169
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:02,253
and let's say that your brother in law is right

170
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:11,249
and this becomes a million dollar business

171
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:15,333
so this is a very, very, very high reward,

172
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,190
if what you're brother in law is telling is correct

173
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,982
but what's the risk?

174
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:22,184
Well the risk here is obviously that he's not correct

175
00:09:22,184 --> 00:09:24,166
and that he squanders all of your money,

176
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,564
so lose everything,

177
00:09:27,564 --> 00:09:31,959
and not only could you lose the monetary money you put in

178
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,279
it could also ruin your relationship

179
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,217
with your brother in law, and maybe your spouse,

180
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:41,575
so risk relationships, maybe I should put your risk family

181
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:45,075
family happiness.

182
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:47,252
Once your brother in law loses all your money

183
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,227
it won't be so easy at thanksgiving

184
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:51,749
anymore to have a civil conversation.

185
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:54,363
So in general, the overlying, you know I probably did more of these scenarios

186
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:57,814
than I needed to, but I think you see the general trend

187
00:09:57,814 --> 00:10:00,289
the more risk that you take in general

188
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:04,250
the more of a reward you should expect to get

189
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,738
or the more reward you're expecting to get

190
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:08,306
there's probably some risk there,

191
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:11,337
and if there's something that looks like it's really safe

192
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:14,814
with really high reward, one of those 2 things

193
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,928
are probably not true. So if we were to plot all of these

194
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:22,687
and I haven't really quantified, I haven't kind of given you a way

195
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:25,965
of measuring risk, in future videos we can think about that

196
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:28,928
and academics have thought about ways of measuring risk

197
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,471
so that's risk and reward, if you plot it all over here,

198
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:37,769
so the savings account, it's zero risk, so this is the savings account over here,

199
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:43,593
and your reward is 1%. So this is 1% right over here.

200
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:45,801
The lending to a reputable company, it's a little

201
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:49,346
bit higher risk, so this is this one right over here,

202
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:52,083
it's a little bit higher risk, and your reward is 6%

203
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,070
so let's say this is 6% right over here.

204
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,165
So it's a little bit high risk,

205
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:58,170
I'm just saying risk is increasing.

206
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,233
If you lend to the doctor, so let me pick another color here that I haven't used

207
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:05,542
if you lend to the doctor, once again, risk is a little bit higher

208
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:08,182
than lending to that company, or the saving account

209
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:12,418
once again a little bit higher reward, a little bit higher reward,

210
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:15,927
you now have an 8% reward. Investing in the stock market

211
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:18,924
now let me pick a color I haven't used yet

212
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:21,767
investing in the stock market, once again,

213
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:24,014
higher risk, but also higher reward,

214
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:27,398
maybe 10% per year. That's 10% right over there.

215
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:29,941
Your brother in law, super high risk

216
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:30,992
probably off the charts over here,

217
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:33,005
but also super high rewards, so maybe it might be

218
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:34,351
like that.

219
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:38,643
But the general idea is the more risk the more reward.
