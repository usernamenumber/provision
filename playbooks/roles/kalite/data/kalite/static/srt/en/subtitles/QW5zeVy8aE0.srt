1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,000
   

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,000
Swirling spiral arms of galaxy M33

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,020
can be seen in visible light, but the true extent of these

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,030
spiral arms are revealed in ultraviolet light. Just as a dog

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,040
can hear a whistle just outside the range of human hearing,

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,050
bugs can see light just outside the range our eyes can see.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,060
A bug zapper emits this ultraviolet light to attract insects.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,150
Johann Ritter conducted an experiment in 1801 to find

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,280
out what, if any, electromagnetic waves are beyond violet.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,290
Ritter knew that photographic paper would turn black more rapidly

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,300
in blue light than in red light. So he tried exposing the paper

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,320
beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum. Sure enough,

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,330
the paper turned black proving the existence of light beyond violet, ultraviolet rays

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,340
These ultraviolet rays,

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,340
or UV radiation, vary in wavelength from

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,360
400 nanometers to 10 nanometers and can be subdivided into

17
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,370
3 regions: UV-A, UV-B and UV-C.

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,380
Visible light from the Sun passes through the atmosphere

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,380
and reaches the Earth's surface. UV-A,

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,390
long wave ultraviolet, is the closest to visible light.

21
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,400
Most UV-A also reaches the surface. But shorter

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,410
wavelengths, called UV-B, are the harmful rays that cause sunburn.

23
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,410
Fortunately, about 95% of these harmful UV-B

24
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,430
rays are absorbed by ozone in the Earth's atmosphere.

25
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,440
UV-C rays are the shortest and most harmful

26
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,450
and are almost completely absorbed by our atmosphere.

27
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,470
The Ozone Monitoring Instrument aboard NASA's Aura satellite

28
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,490
detects ultraviolet radiation to help scientists study and monitor

29
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,500
the chemistry of our atmosphere, including UV absorbing ozone.

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,520
While atmospheric protection from harmful UV radiation

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,540
is good for humans... it complicates the study of naturally

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,550
produced UV rays in the Universe, by scientists here on the Earth's surface.

33
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,570
Young hot stars shine most of their light beyond

34
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,580
the visible light spectrum at ultraviolet wavelengths.

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Scientists need telescopes in orbit above the Earth's UV absorbing atmosphere

36
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,620
to find and study these UV-bright regions of star formations

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,640
in distant galaxies. New young stars in the spiral

38
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,650
arms of galaxy M81 can be seen in this

39
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,690
Galaxy Evolution Explorer, GALEX, image from NASA.

40
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,700
Chemical substances, both atoms and molecules, interact

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
with UV light making this region particularly interesting to scientists.

42
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,740
An ultraviolet instrument aboard Cassini has

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,750
detected hydrogen, oxygen,

44
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,770
water ice, and methane in the Saturn system.

45
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,790
UV data have also revealed details

46
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,810
of Saturn's aurorae.

47
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,830
Scientists also use UV waves shining from distant stars to view

48
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,850
permanently shadowed regions of lunar craters. The Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project,

49
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,870
or LAMP, instrument aboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter

50
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,900
can use this faint star-shine to look for possible

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,920
water ice on the moon. Ultraviolet rays may be harmful

52
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,950
to humans, but they are essential to studying the health of our planet's

53
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,990
protective atmosphere and give us valuable clues to the formation and

54
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,980
composition of distant celestial objects.
