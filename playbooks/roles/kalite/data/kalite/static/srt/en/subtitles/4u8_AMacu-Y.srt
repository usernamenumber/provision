1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,520
I've been asked to make a video
on algebraic division or

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,770
algebraic long division.

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,780
So I'll make a video an
algebraic long division.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,930
I'm just going to
make up a problem.

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,760
Let's say we wanted to divide--
we wanted to see how many times

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,700
does-- I'll start with a fairly
straightforward problem.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:27,680
How many times does 2x plus 1
go into-- I don't know-- let's

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:41,720
say it's 8x to the third minus
7x squared plus 10x minus 5.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,730
So what we do is we just take--
actually, just the exact same

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,470
way that you would do with long
division, traditional long

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,390
division of multiple digits.

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,640
In the 2x plus 1 expression
you look at, oh, what is

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,880
the highest degree term?

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,860
And that's really all we're
going to pay attention

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,090
to most of the time.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,160
So the first step is you
say, OK, the highest

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,210
degree term is 2x.

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,450
How many times does 2x go into
the highest degree term of the

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,850
number-- not the number-- the
expression that we're

21
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,010
dividing into?

22
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:14,130
So you say, how many times does
2x go into 8x to the third?

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,950
Well, we could do a little
division on the side, but you

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,320
could imagine eventually this
is pretty straightforward.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,860
So if you have 8x to the
third divided by 2x, that

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,370
is equal to 4x squared.

27
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,990
So 2x goes into 8x to the
third 4x squared times.

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,090
And this is the key thing.

29
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,680
You don't want to write
the 4x squared here.

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,930
You want to keep everything
in the correct places.

31
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,730
So when you're dividing numbers
you think of the ones, the

32
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,160
tens, the hundreds, and the
thousands place et cetera.

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,860
When you're dividing
polynomials you can kind of

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,180
think of the x to the 0 space.

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,860
The x to the 1 space
or the x space.

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,050
The x squared space.

37
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,690
The x to the third space.

38
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:58,560
So, when we say that 2x goes
into 8x to the third 4x squared

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,752
times let's write that
in the x squared spot.

40
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:08,410
It goes into it 4x
squared times.

41
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,905
Now, we take that 4x
squared and we multiply

42
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:11,990
it by our expression.

43
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,740
I think you're already seeing
that this is very similar

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,180
to long division.

45
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,470
And actually, if x was a
ten, it would be identical

46
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,530
to long division.

47
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,460
And I'll let you
think about that.

48
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,360
If x was 10 this would
be the thousands place.

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,160
This would be 8,000 minus--
although you would have

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,140
negative digits, which doesn't
make a bunch of sense.

51
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,540
But I think you get
what I'm saying.

52
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,730
But anyway, back to this
algebraic long division.

53
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,350
Although I think it is
very important to see the

54
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,630
parallels between this and
traditional long division.

55
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,600
Well, anyway, we said that
2x goes into 8x to the

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,440
third 4x squared times.

57
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,080
Now what we can do is we
can multiply 4x squared

58
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,040
times 2x plus 1.

59
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,060
So 4x squared times 1,
that's 4x squared.

60
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,170
So we can write that in
the x squared's place.

61
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,370
We could write it 4x squared.

62
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,350
And 4x squared times 2x
is 8x to the third.

63
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,925
   

64
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:08,470
This is plus here.

65
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,590
And now, just like we do with
traditional long division, we

66
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,510
can subtract this from this.

67
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:26,755
So minus 7x squared minus 4x
squared is minus 11x squared.

68
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:29,990
   

69
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,205
And then 8x to the third minus
8x to the third is 0, so we

70
00:03:33,205 --> 00:03:34,680
can ignore that right there.

71
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,410
And if we want, we can bring
down the rest of the number,

72
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,990
but maybe just for fun we'll
bring down the next spot just

73
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,220
like we do in traditional
long division.

74
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,150
Actually, let me erase
this over here.

75
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,060
   

76
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,120
Because I think we might find
that real estate useful.

77
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,730
All right, I'm back.

78
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,970
Actually, it doesn't hurt to
bring down the whole thing.

79
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,540
Just so that you understand
what we're doing.

80
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,510
We're saying if you were to
divide 2x plus 1 to this entire

81
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,690
expression, and you say it
goes in 4x squared times.

82
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,540
Now you can kind of call
it our intermediate

83
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,910
remainder is what's left.

84
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,800
This is what's left.

85
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,950
You could almost imagine 4x
squared times 2x plus 1 is--

86
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,190
this is 8x to the third plus 4x
squared plus 0 plus 0 because

87
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,600
it doesn't contribute any
thing to these spots.

88
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,740
But then what's left over
is this expression.

89
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,920
If you take this minus this
whole expression, you

90
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,810
get what's left over.

91
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,790
Now we just do the
same thing over.

92
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,100
How many times does 2x--
we just look at the

93
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,510
highest order term.

94
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:47,180
How many times does 2x go
into negative 11x squared?

95
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,420
So let's write it here
on the side again.

96
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,010
Actually, let me do it here.

97
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:58,930
So if we were to take minus
11x squared divided by 2x,

98
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,780
that is equal to what?

99
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,488
That is equal to minus 11/2 x.

100
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:06,550
   

101
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:13,390
So 2x goes into minus 11x
squared minus 11/2 x times.

102
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,510
So we'll write that
in our x place.

103
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,870
So minus 11/2.

104
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,750
We could write that as 5.5.

105
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,890
I'll just write it
as a fraction.

106
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,460
Minus 11/2 x.

107
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,250
And now, what is minus
11/2 x times 2x plus 1?

108
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:36,020
So minus 11/2 x times
1 is minus 11/2 x.

109
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,220
And we'll want to write
that in the x position.

110
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,130
I'll switch colors just
to not be monotonous.

111
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:49,630
So minus 11/2 x times
1 is minus 11/2 x.

112
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,910
And then, minus 11/2
x times 2x, well, we

113
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,080
should know that is.

114
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,410
But you can multiply them out.

115
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,220
It'll be minus 11x squared.

116
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,310
   

117
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,840
I think you see
what we're doing.

118
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,600
After every step we're
canceling out the largest

119
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,740
degree of the polynomial
we're dividing into.

120
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,270
Fair enough?

121
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,570
Now let's subtract this
expression from this.

122
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,640
And we'll get kind of our
new intermediary remainder.

123
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,760
And maybe that'll be
the full remainder.

124
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,600
So let's see.

125
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,740
Minus 11x squared
minus 11x squared.

126
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,000
That's 0, so we don't have
to write anything there.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,790
10x minus negative 11/2 x.

128
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,070
Remember, we're subtracting
this negative number from 10x.

129
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,940
So if you're subtracting a
negative number it's like

130
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,130
adding a positive number.

131
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,330
So you could view this
as 10 plus 11/2.

132
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,890
So 10 plus 11/2, that's
20/2 plus 11/2.

133
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,030
That's 31/2 or 15.5.

134
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,940
I'll just write 31/2 x.

135
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,550
31/2 x.

136
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,830
And then you could say that
there was a 0 here and

137
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,190
when you subtract 0 from
minus 5 you get minus 5.

138
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:07,420
And now we say, how many times
does 2x go into 31/2 x.

139
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,920
Let's do a little work
on the side here.

140
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:15,900
So if I have 31/2
x divided by 2x.

141
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,785
Well, the x's will
just cancel out.

142
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:21,560
   

143
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,350
This is equal to 31/4.

144
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,730
This is the same thing
as 31 over 2 times 1/2.

145
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,420
So it's 31/4.

146
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,810
So 2x goes into this expression
31/4 times and I'll

147
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,596
switch colors.

148
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:35,990
I'll switch to green.

149
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,060
And that's a positive, right?

150
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,470
You're dividing a positive
into a positive.

151
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,700
So plus 31/4 times.

152
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,720
And I'm writing that in the--
you could view that in the

153
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,830
constant space or the
x to the 0 space.

154
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,680
Or the 1 space even.

155
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,070
So it goes into it 31/4 times.

156
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:59,230
31/4 times 1 is 31/4.

157
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,660
And 31/4 times 2x is 31/2 x.

158
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,740
   

159
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,690
And now we subtract.

160
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,850
This is a plus here.

161
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,340
We subtract the green
expression from the light

162
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,750
blue expression and
we're left with this.

163
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,110
When you subtract this from
this you're left with 0, so

164
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,320
nothing shows up there.

165
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,280
And we're left with
minus 5 minus 31/4.

166
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,470
And we can just do a little
bit of fraction work here.

167
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,090
That's equal to, let's see.

168
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:35,520
Minus 5 over 4 is
minus 20 minus 31.

169
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,700
All of that over 4.

170
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,860
So that is equal to what?

171
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,440
Minus 20, that's
equal to minus 51.

172
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,410
Minus 51/4.

173
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:53,990
So, our answer is 2x plus 1
goes into 8x to the third minus

174
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,140
7x squared plus 10x minus 5--
it goes into it 4x squared

175
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,100
minus 11/2 x plus 31/4 times.

176
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,320
But there is a remainder,
and this is the remainder.

177
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,460
And so a way to visualize this
or another way to think about

178
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,860
this problem so it's actually
useful when we're actually

179
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,270
solving real problems.

180
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,320
And that you just don't view
this as some kind of mechanical

181
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,650
way to get problems right
on a test that only tests

182
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,890
algebraic long division.

183
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,390
As another way to write this
relationship you could write

184
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,390
that-- let me do it
in another color.

185
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,820
I've used many of
my colors already.

186
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:40,800
So you can write that 2x plus
1 times this-- 4x squared.

187
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,000
That's an x.

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,950
Minus 11/2 x plus 31/4.

189
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,160
Plus the remainder.

190
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,580
So when you multiply these two
out, and then if you were to

191
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,980
add the remainder-- 51/4-- that
that would equal-- and let

192
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,880
me draw a dividing line.

193
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,720
I don't want to confuse you
with all this stuff here.

194
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,380
That would equal this.

195
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,700
That would equal 8x to the
third minus 7x squared

196
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,130
plus 10x minus 5.

197
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,430
Anyway, I hope that helps.

198
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,500
See you in the next video.

199
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:20,878
