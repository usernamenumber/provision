1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
In the last video, we took a look at what is

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,730
probably the simplest possible economy, and

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,109
it's not even clear that this economy is even

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,199
possible--this one person economy--but to make

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,305
it more analogous to the real world (where we have

6
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,395
households and we have firms). And in this one island,

7
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:21,085
this guy set up a firm and he essentially leased

8
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:23,578
out all the factors of production to that firm,

9
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:28,868
including his own labor (he leased it out,..the "rent" on his labour is essentially his wages), and then

10
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:31,708
he bought all of the goods and services he needed

11
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:36,945
from that same firm, so his payments would, his expenditures, would

12
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:39,555
be the revenue of that firm and then the revenue

13
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:42,205
of that firm would be turned into the expenses

14
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:44,625
and the profit of the firm. So, whatever wasn't

15
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,395
used in the expenses would end up being profit,

16
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,895
and then all of that went back to that one

17
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:53,115
household as income. And when we talked about

18
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:55,885
how would we measure the economic activity in

19
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:58,915
this island right over here--how would we measure its

20
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:01,435
gross domestic product (GDP)--we said, "well, look,

21
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:03,615
we could measure it in multiple different ways:

22
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:05,855
as it's leaving his hands, the dollars, and it's

23
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:07,615
going to the firm, you could view it as a

24
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:10,315
total expenditures, or as it's approaching the firm,

25
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:17,935
that's the same thing as the total revenue for this firm.Total revenue for this firm, simplified one firm-economy.

26
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:21,345
And that total revenue is the same thing as the

27
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:25,345
total expenses plus the profit for that firm and that's

28
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:30,905
the same as this one household's income.So let me write this down.The way we looked at the last thing,

29
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:32,125
In the very simple example,

30
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:45,025
GDP = Household expenditures which was = Firm revenues which was =

31
00:01:45,025 --> 00:02:00,795
= Firm expenses + profit which is = household income (I'll just write Inc. for Income) =

32
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:07,885
and of course household income is then (or at least in this case it ended up being equal to) household expenses.

33
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:10,775
What I want to do in the video now, is think about

34
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:13,525
it in more general terms. Let's extend it to a more

35
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:15,945
complex economy--to the world we live in--and with

36
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:18,575
that I want to look at the more formal definition for

37
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:26,155
GDP. So this is the more formal definition of GDP: --Or I just say the defintion of GDP-- and it's

38
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:29,417
the market value of ALL FINAL goods and services

39
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:46,867
(and we're going to talk about what each of these things mean) of all, of ALL THE FINAL GOODS AND SERVICES..I'll underline all seperately..and in a different color...ALL FINAL goods and services...

40
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:52,887
produced within a country in a given period.

41
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:58,487
So, you could have a GDP for a month you could have a GDP for a quarter of a year or you can

42
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:03,567
be three months or you could have the GDP in a given year. And I guess you could even have a GDP over a ten-years period.

43
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:17,077
But it tends to be..we always think of GDP in terms of annual or quarterly GDP or sometimes even some estimates of a monthly GDP but it tends to be annually or quarterly. But let's parcel it a little bit more, cause these terms can be interesting.

44
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:22,390
So the first one I'd like to parce is the idea of market value.

45
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,198
What this is saying is..we need some way to measure what we've produced and the best way we can do it is to

46
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:35,698
say: "Well, how much benefit are people getting?", what they're willing to pay for in the market is the best way that we can measure how much benefit they're actually getting out of it.

47
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:36,858
So for example:

48
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:56,258
If someone, if in the year...I don't know..someone...an avocado was produced..If an avocado is produced in some farm and also an orange is produced..

49
00:03:56,258 --> 00:04:02,328
We won't say that for each of these.."Oh GDP's increased by one fruit!" We look at the market-value for it.

50
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:04,618
So the market value of this avocado is

51
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:19,538
$1 and the market value of this orange is $0.5, then by producing this fruit the market-value, the GDP has increased by $0.50 by producing this avocado it's GDP has increased by $1.

52
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:26,778
Now in the next year maybe there's, whatever, demand for avocados goes down or whatever and people pay less for it.

53
00:04:26,778 --> 00:04:41,618
And the market value of this incremental avocado is $0.50 then, in the next year, even though the actual number of fruits that were produced is the same as the previous year, now all of a sudden the contribution from avocados might be the same as the contribution from oranges.

54
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:44,058
So it really depends on the market value.

55
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:50,938
And then we can focus on this all...The market value of all the goods and services.All goods and services.

56
00:04:50,938 --> 00:05:00,058
So we would do all the different avocados and oranges and but we would do computers, we would do cars, we would do tires and we're doing services.

57
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:10,104
So if you have a help at home, if you go to the doctor, the market value of all of those things are going to be put into GDP.

58
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:17,567
Now this won't include some thing, this does not include illegal things,

59
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:30,427
if someone sells someone else drugs, we're not keeping track of it, some would argue maybe it should be kept track of in some way but you have kind of this black market and things but you're not keeping track of illegal activities and

60
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:38,327
you're also not keeping track of goods and services that are produced within the household and consumed within the household. So for example:

61
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:56,067
If you hire an outside-person to babysit your children or your child they would be considered part of the GDP.That is a service that you are paying for but if you yourself are babysitting your children that is not going to be considered in GDP.

62
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:59,937
If I start a lawn-mowing business and I go mow other people's lawns,

63
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:07,297
or maybe before my wife I were dating, she used me to pay me to mow my lawns, then it would be included in GDP

64
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:15,067
but maybe once we get married I just mow her lawn out of..because it's my lawn..we're the same family now..then it will not be included in GDP.

65
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:27,117
But "all" does include pretty much anything that can be kept track of, anything where someone is ..there's exchange of money and some payment between two parties for that good or service.

66
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:32,327
Now the really interesting thing, this is something that I used to find confusing when I first got exposed to GDP,

67
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:35,167
is the whole notion of final goods and services.

68
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,767
And to understand it, let's think about

69
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:41,247
how jeans might be produced.

70
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:46,627
So you have a cotton farmer, and there's

71
00:06:46,627 --> 00:06:50,067
some service used to be performed, whatever,

72
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:52,977
you know, some farming, some labout that used to be performed,

73
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:54,577
and let's say that that is

74
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:56,467
$5 of labour

75
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:59,227
and let's say that some land has to be rented,

76
00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:05,237
so let's say that is $4 of land.

77
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:07,807
And there are other inputs, but we don't have to go into all the details.

78
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:13,977
And with that, there's gonna be some electricity and stuff, we won't count all of it..you can produce some cotton.

79
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:15,297
Just the plant cotton.

80
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:18,877
Some raw cotton.

81
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:22,877
And that raw cotton is worth the market value of the raw cotton,

82
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,507
is worth, let's say,

83
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:25,787
$10

84
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:28,667
So it's $10 worth of raw cotton.

85
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:36,817
And then you could take that raw cotton and you could combine in with some more labour

86
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:44,607
So let's say you combine that with another $6 of labor.

87
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:47,877
And it will probably also require some machines and electricity and things like that

88
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:51,347
but I won't factor in all those things right now, because we don't need them

89
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:52,527
to get the point across

90
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:57,047
and if I do that and combine the $10, this intermediate good,

91
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:58,607
with this $6 of labor

92
00:07:58,607 --> 00:07:59,887
then all of a sudden

93
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:05,095
I can produce cotton thread

94
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:09,055
And that cotton thread, the worth of the market value of that cotton thread

95
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:10,095
let's say is now..

96
00:08:10,095 --> 00:08:11,025
20$

97
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,155
...Is now $20..

98
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:13,855
And maybe there's another intermediate good there

99
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:15,815
maybe it's some dye.

100
00:08:15,815 --> 00:08:16,565
Let's say..

101
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:16,815
Oh well.

102
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:18,295
Let's put in the dye later.

103
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:20,495
I have a $20 thread.

104
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:26,515
Now let's say I can take this $20 thread and

105
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:28,645
--I'll stay with white--

106
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:32,645
I can take this $20 thread and I could throw in some more labor

107
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,445
Maybe I could take $10 of labor

108
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:36,605
$10 of labour

109
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:37,545
and then

110
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:43,365
I can essentially create $30 worth of

111
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:44,654
cotton fabric

112
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:46,844
$30 worth of cotton fabric.

113
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:51,824
And then I could take this $30 worth of cotton fabric

114
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:53,704
plus some more labor

115
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:57,894
so let's say another $5 of labor and

116
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:01,894
let's say, we also are goint to put in $1 dye..

117
00:09:01,894 --> 00:09:04,514
$1 of dye over here.

118
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:18,004
And in the process I can create the market value, let's say this is worth $50 of blue jeans..

119
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:22,004
And I do this all over the course of the year, so the period in question.

120
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:25,014
So as for the period in question, I'll assume it's a year.

121
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,564
So it's all happening over the course of

122
00:09:27,564 --> 00:09:28,484
the periods in question.

123
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,974
So maybe it's happening..

124
00:09:29,974 --> 00:09:31,304
We're talking about GDP in 2012,

125
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,704
this is all happening in 2012,

126
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,604
So what would be the contribution to GDP?

127
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:38,644
If we didn't have the word "final" here,

128
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,804
we just said that the market value of all

129
00:09:40,804 --> 00:09:41,854
goods and services, then we would have

130
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:45,854
this $5, to this $4, to this $10, to this $6..

131
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:48,294
and we would because of the production of this jeans

132
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:50,374
we would get a very, very large number

133
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,974
a very, very large contribution to GDP.

134
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:55,004
But that would not even be double counting..

135
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:59,174
That'd be triple or 4-5 times the value that's actually created.

136
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:04,444
Because all of this value is essentially being accounted for in this end- $50.

137
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:06,554
So the actual contribution to GDP,

138
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:08,934
you would only put the final good,

139
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:12,934
so you wouldn't include all of these other intermediate goods and services

140
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:14,004
you would just say

141
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:20,004
this whole chain of events results in a $50 increase in GDP.

142
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:21,864
And in another video we'll talk about

143
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:23,844
what happens if you don't get to this point

144
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:25,284
during the course of the year,

145
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:27,324
if we just kind of stop when we're at the intermediate good.

146
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:28,934
But assuming we get to this point,

147
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:32,044
you just include the final good in GDP.

148
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:36,651
Now this last part of it is produced within a country.

149
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:38,291
And this is,you know,

150
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,091
you might have heard of GNP,

151
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:41,221
Gross National Product,

152
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:42,381
and that's the main difference.

153
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:46,701
GDP says: If, let's say we're talking about the USA,

154
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,891
so that's my best attempt to draw the US,

155
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:54,071
GDP says: look, if it was produced inside the country,

156
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,021
we don't care who it's been produced by.

157
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:58,231
It could have been produced by someone from Mexico.

158
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:00,321
It could have been produced by someone from Canada.

159
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:07,391
It could have been a factory that's owned by the Chinese but it was produced within the borders of the US

160
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,231
it gets counted as GDP

161
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,171
If an American who's an American national goes oversees and produces something over there,

162
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:19,011
that is not counted as GDP,

163
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,061
if an American owns a firm in another country and

164
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:26,741
that firm in the other country produces something, that is not GDP.

165
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:28,791
When you focus on people's nationality,

166
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,561
that is GNP.

167
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:31,821
So, not to confuse things,

168
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:34,581
but if you want to focus on GNP,

169
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:37,771
then you do care about the earnings of American nationals.

170
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,871
So you wouldn't count the Canadian.

171
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:42,901
But you would include the American who's making money overseas.

172
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:45,411
So GDP fairly simple idea:

173
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:48,121
You say, what's being produced within these boundaries.

174
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:52,471
We don't care who's doing the producing and what their actual nationalities are.

175
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:58,200
And we're going to ignore production by that nationality outside of these borders.
