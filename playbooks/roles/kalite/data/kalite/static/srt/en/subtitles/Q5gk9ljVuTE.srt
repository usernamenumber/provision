00:00:00,827 --> 00:00:02,669
I have a statement here in yellow

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:09,278
which for the sake of this video, we will assume is true, that "Eating spinach makes you stronger."

3
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:12,820
And then after this, in white, I've written a bunch of other statements,

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,469
and I want to figure out if these are reasonable things to say,

5
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:19,162
given the assumption that this first statement is true:

6
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:23,155
"Eating spinach makes you stronger." We can even put it over here.

7
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:29,669
Eating spinach makes you stronger.

8
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:39,580
So hear this first sentence. "If you eat spinach, then you will get stronger." So this is just really a rephrasing of the first one. This is really just putting it in "if/then" form.

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,270
You have your "if", and your "then" but its really saying the same thing.

10
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:56,605
"If you eat spinach": That's the same thing as "Eating spinach". "then you will become stronger. "then you will be stronger", "you'll get stronger".

11
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:58,335
This is saying the exact same thing

12
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:01,869
i will say that if you assume that first statement is true

13
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:04,076
the second statement is definitely true.

14
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:05,940
Now that third statement
