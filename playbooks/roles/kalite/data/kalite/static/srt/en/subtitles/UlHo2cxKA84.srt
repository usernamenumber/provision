1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,840
We're on problem 7.

3
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,100
And they drew this graph, so I
guess I'll draw it as well.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,920
That's the x-axis.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,170
That's the y-axis.

6
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,690
   

7
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:20,010
Let's see, they draw 1, 2,
and they draw 1, 2, 3.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,640
And then the graph goes through
here and then curves

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,530
up like that and actually
goes through

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,060
this point right there.

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,320
It goes through y is equal
to 3, at least the

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,340
way they drew it.

13
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,630
On the graph before, when x
equals 1/2, y is equal to 2.

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,380
So they're saying that
this point right here

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,510
is 1/2 comma 2.

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,760
Fair enough.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,260
And when x is equal to
1, y is equal to 1.

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,480
So they're saying that this
point right here-- I'll do it

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,560
in a different color, just to
not make it too confusing--

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,830
that point right there is
the point 1 comma 1.

21
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,180
The graph is symmetrical with
respect to the vertical line

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,270
at x equals 2.

23
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,410
So that means that it's a
mirror image around that

24
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,340
vertical line.

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,910
According to the graph when
x is equal to 3, y

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,480
should be equal to?

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,850
So when x is equal to 3, we are
1 away from the line x is

28
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,010
equal to 2, or what the line is
a mirror image of, right?

29
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,750
So when we were 1 to the
left of it, that's when

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,360
x is equal to 1.

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,400
And we learned y
is equal to 1.

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,160
So for 1 to the right-- and this
is symmetric around this

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,430
line-- then we're going to have
the same height, right?

34
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,100
So when we were 1 to the
left, the height was 1.

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,350
When we're 1 to the right, the
height should also be 1.

36
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,710
So this should be the
point 3 comma 1.

37
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,350
So the choice is E.

38
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,010
All that other information was
kind of a waste of time.

39
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,470
Next problem.

40
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,250
Problem 8.

41
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:02,880
When 1/10% of 5,000--
I always like to

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,820
get these into decimals.

43
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,710
1/10% that equals this divided
by 100, so it's 1/1,000.

44
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,420
So it's 0.001.

45
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:19,840
So 0.001 times 5,000 is
subtracted from 1/10 of 5,000.

46
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,310
The difference is-- OK.

47
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:30,820
So they're saying 1/10 of 5,000
minus 1/1,000 of 5,000.

48
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,020
Right?

49
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,570
That's 1/10 of a percent
is 1,000.

50
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:39,430
So you get 500 minus 5, right?

51
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,400
That's 495, which is choice D.

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,080
Problem 9.

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,520
Which of the following is the
value of the square root of

54
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,990
the cube root.

55
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,270
   

56
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,200
So let's see.

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,420
How many 0's do they have?

58
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,250
1, 2, 3, 4.

59
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:12,340
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 4.

60
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:12,710
OK.

61
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,870
So there's-- how many
total numbers are

62
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,480
behind the decimal point?

63
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,630
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

64
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,320
So it's a cube root.

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,550
So some number times itself 3
times is equal to 0.0064.

66
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,590
And you know whenever you
multiply decimals, you add up

67
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,280
the number of spots behind
the decimal point.

68
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,170
If I have two numbers that have
two numbers to the right

69
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,495
of the decimal point and
I multiply them,

70
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:32,950
I end up with 4.

71
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,150
So if you just wanted to eyeball
this, you'd say, well,

72
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,520
first of all, what number
to the third

73
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,320
power is equal to 64?

74
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,000
Well 4 to the third power
is equal to 64, right?

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,640
It's equal to 16 times 4,
which is equal to 64.

76
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,900
So this should have a
4 some place in it.

77
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,890
It should look like a 4.

78
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,570
It's going to be a decimal
number because obviously the

79
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,270
number has gotten smaller
when I took the

80
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,650
exponent of this number.

81
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,050
And the clue is how
many places are

82
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,980
there behind the decimal?

83
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,610
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

84
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,430
And I'm multiplying whatever
this number is

85
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,330
times itself 3 times.

86
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,210
So in order to get 6 digits
behind the decimal point, that

87
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,440
original number probably
has two digits

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,760
behind the decimal point.

89
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,495
So my initial kind of
estimation is going

90
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:19,470
to have a 4 in it.

91
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,800
And it's going to be 0.04.

92
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,770
And I'm pretty sure
I'm right here.

93
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,040
Well, you could try it out for
yourself, but 0.04 times 0.04.

94
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,100
You say, oh, 4 times 4 is 16.

95
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,220
But I'm going to have now 1,
2, 3, 4 spaces behind the

96
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,020
decimal point.

97
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,960
And then if you multiply that
times 0.04, 4 times 16 is 64.

98
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,150
And now I'm going to have 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 spaces behind

99
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,850
the decimal point.

100
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,930
And I get 0.000064, which
is exactly there.

101
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:59,400
So the problem now boils down
to square root of 0.04.

102
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,030
And you use the exact
same logic.

103
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,820
That is equal to 0.2.

104
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,120
And try to square 0.2, you'll
get 0.04 right?

105
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,770
0.2 times 0.2.

106
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,510
You say 2 times 2 is 4.

107
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,930
And I have 1, 2 spaces behind
the decimal point.

108
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,820
   

109
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,690
0.04, and that's D.

110
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,350
Problem 10.

111
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,920
Raffle tickets numbered
consecutively from 101 through

112
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:34,480
350 are placed in a box.

113
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,800
What is the probability that a
ticket selected at random will

114
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,020
have a number with a hundreds
digit of 2?

115
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,290
So we're essentially saying,
out of this collection how

116
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,140
many of them have a hundreds
digit of 2.

117
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:55,940
So essentially it's going to be
anything from 200 to 299.

118
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,040
Well that's essentially
100 digits, right?

119
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,850
Those are 100 numbers
that have a

120
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,460
hundreds digit of 2, right?

121
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,800
Think about it.

122
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,020
200 by itself would be 1.

123
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,770
From 200 to 1 would be 2.

124
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,000
So 200 to anything would be
that anything plus 1.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,550
So there's 100 numbers
that satisfy it.

126
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,090
   

127
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,000
And then how many numbers
are we picking from?

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, if it was from 100 to
350 it be 250 numbers.

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,570
But since it's from 101 to 350,
we're picking from a pool

130
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:37,750
of 249 numbers.

131
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,120
Right?

132
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,200
Although let me think
about that.

133
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,450
Let me think about that.

134
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,960
   

135
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,170
Right, we're picking from
a pool of-- I just

136
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:52,540
want to make sure.

137
00:06:52,540 --> 00:07:01,370
If it was 101 to 102, we would
be picking from a pool of--

138
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,570
Right, we're picking from a pool
of 249 numbers, so the

139
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,510
odds of having a number with a
2 in the hundreds digit will

140
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:16,220
be 100/249.

141
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,210
So that is choice E.

142
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:26,530
I'm just making sure that I
haven't made a-- Actually no,

143
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,690
I'm going to take that back.

144
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,420
If I said from 300 to 350,
that's 51 digits.

145
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,625
If I say 101 to 350, that's
not 249 digits.

146
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,770
I made a mistake.

147
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,040
Because we're including
101, right?

148
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,600
So it would actually
be 250 digits.

149
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,020
Sorry, it's 250 numbers.

150
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,360
We're picking from a
bag of 250 numbers.

151
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,140
Think about it.

152
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,230
If it was from 101-- you have
to make sure you get your

153
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,730
boundaries right on these-- if
we said from 101 to 105, how

154
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,340
many are this?

155
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,490
This would be 101, 102,
103, 104, and 105.

156
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,260
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

157
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,950
It's 5 digits.

158
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,960
So it's 105 minus 101 plus 1.

159
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,040
So similarly, the bag, the
number of digits we can pick

160
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,400
from, is going to be 350
minus 101 plus 1,

161
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,430
which is equal to 250.

162
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,840
So anyway, out of the bag of
250, 100 numbers satisfy it.

163
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,820
So we're going to have 100 in
250 chance of picking the

164
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,840
right number.

165
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,240
And if we divide the top and the
bottom by 50-- that's the

166
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,789
greatest common divisor--
we get 2/5.

167
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,200
And that is choice A.

168
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,909
And I got a little cautious
because I saw that they had

169
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,860
all these choices that were
really close to each other.

170
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,720
And they all seemed to test,
like choices D and E, they all

171
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,970
seemed to test whether you got
the boundaries right, whether

172
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,180
you really counted the
pool correctly.

173
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,700
And whether you really
counted the

174
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,750
number of digits correctly.

175
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,810
And I always have to go through
the exercise of let me

176
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,430
make sure whether or not I need
to count 101, whether I

177
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,810
can just subtract them,
or whether it's the

178
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,890
fractions plus 1.

179
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,450
I always have to clarify
that in my own brain.

180
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,490
Maybe that was easier for you.

181
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,710
Question 11.

182
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,990
On Monday, a person mailed 8
packages weighing an average

183
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,560
of 12 and 3/8 pounds.

184
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,420
And on Tuesday, 4 packages.

185
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,100
So this is 8.

186
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,830
Weighed that much.

187
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:32,200
And on Tuesday, 4 packages
weighing an average of 15 and

188
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,160
1/4 pounds.

189
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,380
What was the average weight in
pounds of all packages the

190
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,400
person mailed on both days?

191
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,420
So essentially you have to take
the sum of the weights of

192
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,220
all of them and divide
by the total, right?

193
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,260
So what's the sum of the
weights of all of them?

194
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,490
So the sum of the weights of
these 8 packages-- we know

195
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,000
their average.

196
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,590
So the sum of the weights is
going to be 8 times 12 and

197
00:09:52,590 --> 00:10:01,100
3/8-- that's the sum of all of
these-- plus 4 times the

198
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,810
weight of these.

199
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,060
Plus 4 times 15 and 1/4.

200
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,350
And we're going to divide
that by the

201
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,490
total number of packages.

202
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,330
Divided by 12.

203
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,370
So this is equal
to, let's see.

204
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,110
What's 8 times 12?

205
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,230
8 times 12 is 96.

206
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,040
And what's 8 times 3/8?

207
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,980
So it's 96 plus 3.

208
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,170
You could view 12 and
3/8 as 12 plus 3/8.

209
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,170
So I kind of just did a
distributive property there.

210
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,330
You could turn this
into an improper

211
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,150
fraction, if that's easier.

212
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,730
And then plus-- what's
4 times 15?

213
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,410
It's 60, right?

214
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,100
And then 4 times 1/4 is 1.

215
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,830
All of that over 12.

216
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:47,420
And so we have 99 plus 61.

217
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,770
All of that over 12.

218
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,760
Which is equal to 160/12.

219
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,150
Let's see.

220
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,650
Does 12 go into 160?

221
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,210
12 times 12 is 144.

222
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,150
Let me think about this.

223
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,030
So let me just divide
top and bottom by 4.

224
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:11,020
So you get 40/3.

225
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,330
And let's see.

226
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,650
All of the answers they have
it in terms of fractions.

227
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,150
So 3 goes into 40
how many times?

228
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,760
It goes into 13, right?

229
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,950
13 times 3 is 39.

230
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,580
So it's 13 with remainder 1.

231
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,420
So 13 and 1/3 times,
so A is the answer.

232
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,860
So the average of all of the
packages on both days are 13

233
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,310
and 1/3 pounds.

234
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,130
See you in the next video.
