1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Drawing or color, which is most important?

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This was a burning question for artists and art critics in the 16th century.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And helped to divine the styles of entire city-states.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well we're here in the Academia, in Venice.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Looking at Bellini's Madonna and Child with St. John the Baptist and Saint.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And Looking at this painting, I would say that Bellini would have said that color was more important.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The reds, and the blues, and the greens, just glow.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They're spectacular. And that's of course because Bellini is using a new technique.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which has been perfected in the North, known as 'glazing.'

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's right. Taking their clue from the artists of the Northern Renaissance.
