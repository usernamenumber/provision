1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:07,733
Lets explore a bit how the price of an option can vary or how it can relate to the actual expiration date.

2
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,983
So what I’m going to do is compare two similar options

3
00:00:10,983 --> 00:00:13,667
with the underlying stock being General Electric

4
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,184
and they are going to be the same in every way

5
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:19,133
except one is going to have a further out expiration date.

6
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:20,643
So lets compare

7
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:22,800
lets compare this call option right here

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,533
so this is a call option on GE

9
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:28,677
with a $17.00 strike price

10
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:31,800
so it’s the option to buy GE stock at $17.00

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,867
and it has an April 2011 expiration

12
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:36,333
so its going to expire

13
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,867
or the last day of trading that you could trade this option

14
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:41,200
would be the third Friday in April.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,584
Lets compare that with the same

16
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:45,933
an option that has the same strike price

17
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:49,853
but has a December 2011 expiration

18
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:52,640
so we are going to look for a $17.00 strike price

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,265
right over here

20
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:56,819
and you can see right when you compare the options

21
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:01,333
that the one that has a further out expiration costs more.

22
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:07,872
This one costs $3.25 while this one only cost $2.36.

23
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:10,844
And the reason why it costs more is because you have

24
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:14,838
you get to retain the option for longer

25
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:17,267
so you can imagine $17.00

26
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,482
lets say that $ 17.00 is right over here

27
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:22,333
let me draw a hypothetical stock chart

28
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:26,169
so lets say that $17.00 is right over here.

29
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,655
And so you can imagine

30
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,067
lets say that you have both of those options

31
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:32,671
or you have the option to have either one of the options.

32
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:34,993
And lets say that the stock does something

33
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:37,919
lets say that the stock does something like that.

34
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:40,380
Well, its going to be in the money, you have the right

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,563
if you owned either one of those options

36
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:44,606
if you owned either one of those options

37
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:49,621
you have the option to buy the stocks at $17.00 and sell it at whatever price this is.

38
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:54,173
Maybe this price over here is like 20 something dollars so you would make money.

39
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:55,984
But if you have the option

40
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:57,238
with a closer

41
00:01:57,238 --> 00:01:58,677
with a closer expiration

42
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:00,733
with the April 2011 expiration

43
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:03,333
you have to exercise the option right now

44
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:07,176
you would have to exercise it right now and close out the option.

45
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:09,916
If you had the longer dated option you could do it

46
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:14,867
you could do the exact same thing with the owner of an April 2011 option has

47
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:19,600
or you can hold the option and maybe see if the stock continues to go up

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,990
or you could imagine a downside scenario.

49
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,569
Someone who has

50
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,519
maybe the stock does something like this

51
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,238
where it goes out of the money.

52
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:29,667
Someone who holds the closer dated option

53
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,603
the one that expires first

54
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:33,507
they’ll be completely out of the money

55
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:35,600
the option would be worthless on this stage.

56
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,637
But if you have the option if you have the longer expiration date

57
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:42,667
if your option does not expire until December 2011

58
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:45,071
then you could hold it and maybe

59
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:45,767
maybe

60
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,021
the stock would do something nice

61
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:50,272
there is some probability that it would one day become in the money.

62
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:51,933
And I want to make it clear

63
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:55,009
even if you have this situation here

64
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,656
and you hold the longer dated option

65
00:02:57,656 --> 00:03:01,325
you have the option that’s going to expire in December

66
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:03,507
you still would not want to exercise it

67
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:07,269
because there is someone who would still enjoy all of this

68
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,266
optionality of the futures.

69
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:10,334
So what you are better off doing

70
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:12,331
instead of exercising the option

71
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:15,442
you are better off selling the longer dated option right over there

72
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:18,507
and you should be able to capture at least as much profit

73
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:20,504
as you would from exercising the option

74
00:03:20,504 --> 99:59:59,999
plus capturing whatever value the buyer sees in the future optionality.
