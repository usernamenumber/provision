1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,300
Before we move on, I just wanted
to make sure that you

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,140
understood that last point that
I made at the end of that

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,440
last video.

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,000
We said that the pressure
inputting into this, that we

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,570
could view this cup with a hole
in it as essentially a

7
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,990
pipe, where the opening on the
top of the cup is the input to

8
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,200
the pipe, and this little
mini-hole is the output to the

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,270
pipe, and we said that
this is a vacuum.

10
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,380
Let's say this is vacuum
all around.

11
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,640
I know when I drew it last time,
I closed it, but we have

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,040
a vacuum everywhere.

13
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,440
Since there's a vacuum
everywhere, the pressure at

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,330
this point P1 is
equal to zero.

15
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,390
The point I wanted to make is
because we have a hole here,

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,970
the pressure at that point at
P2 is also equal to zero.

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,860
You can almost view it as maybe
the atmospheric pressure

18
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,730
at that point, but since
we're in a vacuum,

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,430
that pressure is zero.

20
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,150
That might have been a little
confusing to you, because you

21
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:55,680
said, well, wait, I thought at
depth, if I had a point at

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,220
that same height, that I would
actually have a pressure at

23
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,010
that point of rho gh.

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,040
That's true.

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,970
That's completely true.

26
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,000
You do have an innate pressure
in the liquid at that point of

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,750
rho gh, and actually, that's
what's causing the

28
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,120
liquid to come out.

29
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:20,790
But that's actually taken care
of in the potential energy

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,960
part of the equation.

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,160
Let me rewrite Bernoulli's
equation.

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,560
The input pressure plus rho g h1
plus rho v1 squared over 2

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:46,560
is equal to the output pressure
plus rho g h2 plus

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,360
PV2 squared over 2.

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,110
I think you understand that this
term is pretty close to

36
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,330
zero if the rate at which the
surface moves is very slow if

37
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,290
this surface area is much
bigger than this hole.

38
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,920
It's like if you poked a hole in
Hoover Dam, that whole lake

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,900
is going to move down very, very
slowly, like 1 trillionth

40
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,110
of the speed at which the
water's coming out at the

41
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,190
other end, so you could
ignore this term.

42
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,880
We also defined that the hole
was at zero, so the height of

43
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,580
h2 is zero.

44
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,320
It simplified down to the input
pressure, the pressure

45
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,540
at the top of the pipe, or at
the left side of the pipe,

46
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,070
plus rho gh1.

47
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,790
This isn't potential energy,
but this was kind of the

48
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,560
potential energy term when we
derived Bernoulli's equation,

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,750
and that equals the output
pressure, or the pressure at

50
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,120
the output of the hole, at the
right side of the hole, plus

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,660
the kinetic energy PV2.

52
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,830
It's the kinetic energy term,
because it doesn't actually

53
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,840
doesn't add up completely to
kinetic energy, because we

54
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,980
manipulated it.

55
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,780
I just wanted to really
make the point that

56
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,710
is definitely zero.

57
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,950
I think that is clear
to you, because we

58
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,450
have a vacuum up here.

59
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,800
The pressure at that point is
zero, so we can ignore that.

60
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,070
The question is what is
the pressure here?

61
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,220
This pressure is zero, because
we have a vacuum here.

62
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,520
If I were to say that the
pressure over here at this

63
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:32,470
hole is equal to pgh, then I
would have the situation where

64
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:39,810
pgh is equal to pgh plus
PV squared over 2.

65
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,810
What does that mean?

66
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,930
When I say that that pressure
at the output of the pipe is

67
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,310
pgh, that means that
I'm applying some

68
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,750
pressure into that hole.

69
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,800
Essentially, that pressure I'm
applying into the hole is

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,550
exactly just enough offset
to offset the

71
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,280
pressure at this depth.

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,230
Because of that, none of
the water will move.

73
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,170
You could imagine that if this
is the hole, let's say that's

74
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,760
the opening of the hole, and I
have some water particles, or

75
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,320
some fluid particles, let's say
that these are the atoms,

76
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:22,160
we're saying innately at any
point that there is a pressure

77
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,360
at this point that's equal to
rho gh, but this is P2.

78
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,830
How much pressure
am I exerting on

79
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,680
this end of the hole?

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,300
If I exert rho gh at this end,
then these molecules that were

81
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,900
just about to exit the hole
aren't going to exit, because

82
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,940
they're going to get the same
pressure from every direction.

83
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,370
What we said in the last video,
and I really want to--

84
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,880
because this is a subtle point--
is that the outside

85
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,270
pressure, being on the outside
part of the hole, is zero, and

86
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,550
because of that, we end up--
this term is zero, and we

87
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,410
essentially end up with that
the change in the potential

88
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,530
energy all becomes kinetic
energy, which is something

89
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,190
we're familiar with from
just our kinematics

90
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,520
and our energy equations.

91
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,530
With that out of the way, let
me do another problem.

92
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,260
Actually, I will do that next
problem in the next video,

93
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,360
just so we have a clean
cut between videos.

94
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,870
See you soon.

95
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,000
