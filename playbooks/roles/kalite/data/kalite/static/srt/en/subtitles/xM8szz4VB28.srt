1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,033
For us modern humans with our easy access to the local supermarket

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:07,974
it's easy to forget that throughout human history and even today

3
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:13,553
the amount of humans or human population has been limited by our ability to get calories

4
00:00:13,553 --> 00:00:19,144
or get human consumable food from the land, so what I want to do in this video is give us a little bit of

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,729
a framework for thinking about how humans have been gathering

6
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:28,102
calories from the land and how that's placed an upper limit on the number of humans

7
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:32,698
that can live in any given area, or the population density of humans.

8
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:38,890
So right over here you have some gentlemen looking for food, they are hunter-gatherers.

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,808
I'll say HG for short, and the H part, the hunter part that they might actually find some animals.

10
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:48,472
I think these guys are trying right over here are trying to trap some rabbits

11
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:51,371
and the gathering part, they're just literally looking for food

12
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:59,804
maybe they find fruit of some sort, or some nuts or maybe some roots that are edible by humans

13
00:00:59,804 --> 00:01:04,369
so literally just walk around either try to kill things or find things they can consume.

14
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:08,223
So I'll call this right over here stage one.

15
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:12,392
So this is hunter-gatherers, this is what most humans

16
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:15,974
have done through most of human history.

17
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:18,221
And just to give us a little bit of a framework

18
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:20,301
for how much they could get from the land,

19
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:25,062
I looked in some of the best sense of studying HG populations

20
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:29,109
in land like this maybe they can get about 200 calories.

21
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:35,895
I'll make this a whole column, this whole column is the amount

22
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:42,722
that they can get in terms of calories per square kilometre per day.

23
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:44,968
Now it's obviously going to be hugely dependent

24
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:47,226
on the number of animals that live there,

25
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:50,642
the type of land that's there, if they're next to a stream

26
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:52,809
where maybe fish are just jumping out of the stream

27
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:54,435
this number would be much higher,

28
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:55,727
if they were in some type of desert

29
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:57,217
this number would be much lower.

30
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,227
But this is actually fairly in line with

31
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:01,710
some of the studies of HG cultures.

32
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,226
Now if this the number of calories that they can get

33
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,810
from each square kilometre per day,

34
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,306
how many humans can live in a square kilometre per day?

35
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:10,975
What is the density of humans?

36
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:13,813
Well, to firgue that out we have know on average

37
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:17,227
how many calories does a human need to survive,

38
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:19,801
and for the sake of this video I'm going to make the assumption

39
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:26,557
that a human being needs 2,000 calories per day

40
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:29,642
to survive in a non-malnourished state.

41
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:31,722
And obviously it's hugely dependent on

42
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:35,055
how activ this person is or how large they are.

43
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,550
And one other note: this whole I will be using

44
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,477
Calories with the capital C.

45
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:42,218
The Calories with the capital C are the calories

46
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:44,638
that people are used to refering to when you go to the gym

47
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:47,052
and you run on the treadmill and it says how many calories you've burnt

48
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:50,074
or you look at the back of your candy bar and it says 200 calories.

49
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:52,440
These are tha calories I'm talking about.

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,526
They're slightly different notion than the calories

51
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:56,969
that you encounter in your chemistry class.

52
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,728
Those calories are calories with a lower case c.

53
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:05,729
And just so that you can be optimally confused it turns out that

54
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:16,453
1 Calory with an upper case C is equal to 1,000 calories with a lower case c.

55
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:20,556
And the lower case c calories are the amount of energy

56
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:25,136
needed to heat 1 gramme of water 1Â°C.

57
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:27,057
So this is what you see in your chemistry class

58
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:29,969
but this is not what we are going to be talking about in this video.

59
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,141
We're talking about the capital C Calories

60
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:35,143
that dietitians are always talking about.

61
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:39,144
So with this assumption that the average human eats 2000 Calories a day

62
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:41,971
to not get malnourished, and obviously man would eat more,

63
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,137
women would eat less, children would eat even less,

64
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:48,097
but with this assumption, what is the density of humans

65
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:50,807
that could be supported by this culture right over here?

66
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:56,804
Well, 200 Calories is 1 tenth of the average daily human requirement

67
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,387
if you believe this assumption.

68
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:05,305
The the population density, humans per square kilometre

69
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:10,303
you can always support 1 tenth of a human with this Calory output!

70
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:15,311
So you can only support 0.1 of a human per a square kilometre.

71
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:18,308
So 1 human would actually need 10 square kilometres

72
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:23,394
to hunt from and gather from in order to support just themselves!

73
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:26,058
They would need maybe 30 or 40 square kilometres

74
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,476
to support an entire family,

75
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,562
so they could wander around and kill the animals

76
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,559
and find whatever they need to find on that land.

77
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:36,309
Now let's go to kind of you can view as maybe the next stage

78
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,894
although it's now always the case that herding is going to be

79
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:41,392
more productive than HG, especially with that case

80
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:42,811
with the fish jumping out of the water,

81
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:45,309
but let's go to the scenario right over here.

82
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:51,149
So this is, we can call this a pastoral life-style.

83
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,136
So this is 2, I'll call it pastoral.

84
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:55,976
And over here is the realisation that,

85
00:04:55,976 --> 00:05:00,471
look, you have all of this vegetation that maybe humans can't consume

86
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:03,724
but there are other animals that can consume this vegetation

87
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:10,372
and they can turn those calories into calories that can be consumed by humans

88
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:13,141
and, namely, the calories are themselves!

89
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:14,770
So this gentleman right over here

90
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,081
after he gets these sheep to be nice and fat,

91
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:21,310
he can either eat the sheep or he can drink their milk,

92
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:27,098
so one way to think about this cattle or these sheep right over here

93
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:29,556
by herding them and letting them eat this grass

94
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:36,100
he is turning non-human-consumable calories into human-consumable calories.

95
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,723
And for the sake of our thought experiment let's tell we got

96
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:44,470
10 time increase in the human-consumable calories per square kilometre.

97
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,309
So now instead of 200 we're up to 2,000.

98
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:56,558
And so instead of one human per square kilometre per day to support one human ...

99
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:59,895
oh sorry, instead of 0.1 we can now support 1 human.

100
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:02,808
So in that 10 square kilometres we can now support 10 people,

101
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:06,366
in 100 square kilometres we can now support 100 people.

102
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,224
Now the next stage - and I'm skipping a bunch of stages

103
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:12,060
because we have things like subsistence agriculture

104
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,474
and various forms that are not going to be equally productive,

105
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:18,628
it depends what the land is like, it depends what tools at disposal,

106
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,561
but the next stage that I'll just kind of jump to

107
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:24,769
we can call traditional agriculture.

108
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:29,298
So this right over here, let's call that traditional agriculture.

109
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:34,031
And that's this one over here as well, so both of these I'm going to call traditional agriculture.

110
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:36,975
For the purposes of this video the difference between

111
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:39,069
traditional agriculture and modern agriculture -

112
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,560
in traditional agriculture you didn't have mechanisation,

113
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,562
so you had very primitive mechanisation,

114
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:48,474
you definitely didn't have fossil fuel based engines,

115
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,638
you didn't have modern pesticides,

116
00:06:50,638 --> 00:06:54,823
you didn't have modern genetically engineered crops,

117
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:58,226
but you have some of the basic science of breeding crop

118
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:01,228
and irrigating and using animals as tools.

119
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:04,805
So in this stage right over here, and once again,

120
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:07,637
it completely depends on where you are on the planet,

121
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:10,807
how fertile the land is, how good your tools are,

122
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:12,561
what crops you are actually producing.

123
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:16,228
Let's assume that we've got a hundredfold increasse in the productivity.

124
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:19,366
And looking in some of the historical records it looks like, it's depending on

125
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:22,479
once again where you are, that's not out of the realm of possibility.

126
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,229
So you have a hundredfold increase, so insdead of 2,000 calories per square kilometre per day

127
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:33,310
you can get 200,000 calories per square kilometre per day,

128
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,469
and now you can support 100 humans per square kilometre - if you wanna to!

129
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:41,035
So you might not have 100 humans,

130
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:44,142
one on all of the land, you might not be able to farm from,

131
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:50,057
or there are other limits on the population for whatever they might be,

132
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:53,226
but the important thing is to think about this upper bound.

133
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:57,219
In this traditional you are able to get type of productivity from your land

134
00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:01,774
and you are able to in theory support 100 people per 1 square kilometre,

135
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:04,768
that means if all of a sudden you have 200 people living there,

136
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:06,765
they maybe every once migrate to this land

137
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:08,432
because it seems as specially fertile

138
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:10,055
or there are really small farmers living there,

139
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:13,142
then all of a sudden not everyone is going to get 2,000 calories a day,

140
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:16,770
some people might get malnourished, other people might actually starve.

141
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,699
There is this upper bound on the actual number of people that can be there

142
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,642
based on how productive the land actually is.

143
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:27,224
Now let's move over to modern agriculture

144
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:32,397
and we want to talk a little bit about what exactly is modern agriculture.

145
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:36,475
You have machines like this combine over here

146
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,432
that does a lot of the human labour.

147
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:42,708
One human can... I'll talk about the different dimensions

148
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,433
because there are actually two dimensions here:

149
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:47,057
how much calories can you get from the land,

150
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:53,058
and how much energy and labour can one human input into the land

151
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:55,054
using tools at their disposal.

152
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:57,891
So in this case cattle, these oxen pulling this plough,

153
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:00,978
or in this case this combine that's fueled by fossil fuels.

154
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:04,560
But in modern agriculture, because all of the things,

155
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,558
you have these amazing tools, you have genetically engineered crops,

156
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:11,724
you have modern pesticides and ... not everyone is a fan of all of these things,

157
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:15,102
but they have hugely increased our productivity.

158
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:18,363
So you have modern agriculture.

159
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:21,563
Let's say that you have another factor of 10 from traditional agriculture.

160
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:26,561
so now you can get 2,000,000 calories per square kilometre per day,

161
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:34,149
or you can support 1,000 humans per square kilometre.

162
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:38,725
So once again this right over here is an upper bound.

163
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:43,305
And just to give a sense, I picked these numbers just so that nubmers would be clear

164
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:46,142
I looked in some historical records, these are completely out of line

165
00:09:46,142 --> 00:09:49,056
with what it looks like human have been able to do in the past,

166
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:53,230
but to give you a sense of what human populatin densities look like right now

167
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,891
and why this upper bound seems to be right about correct,

168
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:07,684
in a place like the U.S. the population density is 30 people per square kilometre,

169
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:11,895
in a more dense country or a significantly more dense country like India

170
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:17,561
the population density is 300 humans per square kilometre.

171
00:10:17,561 --> 00:10:21,048
And in the most population dense country in the world,

172
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:25,040
which is where I come from, or actually I was born in New Orleans,

173
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,730
but where some of my ancestors came from,

174
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,725
which is Bangladesh, so there's a lot of people like me, I guess,

175
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:41,398
Bangladesh has population density of 900 humans per square kilometre!

176
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:44,816
To some degree this is a testament to the fertility of the land and whatever else,

177
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:48,772
but this is pretty near the limits depending on

178
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:51,768
agricultural productivity in what now on the land

179
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:55,142
of modern technology, so it really makes you think

180
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:56,638
if you don't get population under control,

181
00:10:56,638 --> 00:11:01,558
you might end up with some of these kind of hitting the wall type of scenarios.

182
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:04,308
And so the last thing I want you to think about

183
00:11:04,308 --> 00:11:06,477
and this is why I reffered to a little bit more,

184
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:09,481
is just think about those two dimensions

185
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:11,640
because sometimes it get a little bit muddled.

186
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,434
One is the kind of the productivity of land

187
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:23,398
and at the other there is productivity of labour.

188
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:28,895
So right over here in HG, they're not getting many calories from their land

189
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,709
so they're right over there, and the humans have to do all the labour,

190
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:34,130
they don't have animals helping them in any way,

191
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,961
they definitely don't have robots or any types of engines helping them in any way,

192
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:42,981
and so there have to spend a lot of human time and a lot of human labour

193
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:45,807
doing the work, getting that productivity from the land.

194
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:50,150
But as progress with things that aid humans,

195
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,645
so for example if you all of a sudden have cattle helping you

196
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:57,227
or you have other tools that help you,

197
00:11:57,227 --> 00:12:01,147
you get more human productivity, so less and less of human labour

198
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:03,431
has to be used to get that productivity from the land

199
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,814
so maybe other humans can do other things

200
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:08,313
like paint pictures or become blacksmiths or whatever,

201
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:13,145
and in this direction you get higher productivity per unit of land

202
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:17,707
and so that comes from moving from HG to a pastoral life-style

203
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:20,898
to traditional farming with irrigation, to modern farming.

204
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:26,816
And so in this graph kind of tools for the individuals move us up,

205
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:28,975
getting productivity from the land moves us right,

206
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:32,226
modern argriculture gets us right over here.

207
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:36,140
So we're getting mach more calories per unit land

208
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,231
and we're getting much more calories per unit labour.

209
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:44,223
So you need much smaller percentage of the human population

210
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:47,226
actually involved in the farming.

211
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:50,726
Anyway, I let you go there, hopefuly that gives you at least an undesrtanding

212
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:53,891
of that food doesn't just come from nowhere,

213
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:57,891
it really is a rate-limiting factor on humanity's population.
