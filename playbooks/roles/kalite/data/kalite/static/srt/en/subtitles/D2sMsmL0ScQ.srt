1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,230
The mean emission of all engines
of a new design needs

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,570
to be below 20 parts per million
if the design is to

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,280
meet new emission
requirements.

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,020
10 engines are manufactured for
testing purposes, and the

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,910
emission level of each
is determined.

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,410
The emission data is, and they
give us 10 data points for the

8
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,450
10 test engines, and I went
ahead and calculated the mean

9
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,410
of these data points.

10
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,940
The sample mean of 17.17.

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,740
And the standard deviation of
these 10 data points right

12
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,480
here is 2.98, the sample
standard deviation.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,420
Does the data supply sufficient
evidence to

14
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,520
conclude that this type of
engine meets the new standard?

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,700
Assume we are willing to risk
a type-1 error with a

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,760
probability of 0.01.

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,570
And we'll touch on
this in a second.

18
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,920
Before we do that, let's just
define what our null

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,440
hypothesis and our alternative
hypothesis are going to be.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,780
Our null hypothesis
can be that we

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,690
don't meet the standards.

22
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,500
That we just barely don't
meet the standards.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,420
That the mean of our new engines
is exactly 20 parts

24
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,140
per million.

25
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,740
And you essentially want the
best possible value where we

26
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,239
still don't meet, or the lowest
possible value, where

27
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,380
we still don't meet
the standard.

28
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,160
And then our alternative
hypothesis says no, we do meet

29
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,710
the standard.

30
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,230
That the true mean for our
new engines is below

31
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,270
20 parts per million.

32
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,910
And to see if the data that we
have is sufficient, what we're

33
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,400
going to do is assume,
we're going to assume

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,650
that this is true.

35
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,730
   

36
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,440
And given that this is true, if
we assume this is true, and

37
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,660
the probability of this
occurring, and the probability

38
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,750
of getting a sample mean of that
is less than 1%, then we

39
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,810
will reject the null
hypothesis.

40
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:56,170
So we are going to reject our
null hypothesis if the

41
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,870
probability of getting a sample
mean of 17.17 given the

42
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:06,340
null hypothesis is true,
is less than 1%.

43
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,130
And notice, if we do it this way
there will be less than a

44
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,680
1% chance that we are making
a type-1 error.

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,400
A type-1 error is that
we're rejecting it

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,390
even though it's true.

47
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,550
Here there's only a 1% chance,
or less than a 1% chance that

48
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,040
we will reject it
if it is true.

49
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,870
Now the next thing we have to
think about is what type of

50
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,760
distribution we should
think about.

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,420
And I guess the first thing that
rings in my brain is we

52
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,040
only have 10 samples here.

53
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,630
We only have 10 samples.

54
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,320
We have a small sample
size right over here.

55
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,760
So we're going to be dealing
with a T-distribution and

56
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,680
T-statistic.

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,860
So with that said, so let's
think of it this way.

58
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,240
We can come up with a
T-statistic that is based on

59
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,680
these statistics right
over here.

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,660
So the T-statistic is going to
be 17.17, our sample mean,

61
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,920
minus the assumed population
mean-- minus 20 parts per

62
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:10,880
million over our sample standard
deviation, 2.98--

63
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,890
this is really the definition
of the T-statistic.

64
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,310
And hopefully we see now that
this really comes from a

65
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,360
Z-score and the T-distribution
is kind of an engineered

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,340
version of the normal
distribution using

67
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,610
T-statistics.

68
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,700
2.98 divided by the square
root of our sample size.

69
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,940
We have 10 samples, so
it's divided by the

70
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,630
square root of 10.

71
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,550
So this value right here-- let
me get the calculator out just

72
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,110
to get a value in place there.

73
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,530
   

74
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:46,800
So this is going to be 17.17
minus 20, close parentheses,

75
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:55,120
divided by 2.98 divided
by the square root--

76
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,320
that's not what I wanted.

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,120
Let me delete that.

78
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,820
Let me go back.

79
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,560
Divided by the square root
of 10, and then close

80
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,810
parentheses.

81
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,820
   

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,970
It is almost exactly
negative 3.

83
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,620
Our T-statistic is
almost exactly

84
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,360
negative 3, negative 3.00.

85
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,769
And what we need to figure out,
because T-statistics have

86
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,640
a T-distribution, so what we
need to figure out is the

87
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,260
probability of getting this
T-statistic or a value of T

88
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,570
equal to this or less than this,
is that less than 1%?

89
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,440
So the way we can think
about it is we have a

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,690
T-distribution.

91
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,980
   

92
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,320
And let's say we have a
normalized T-distribution.

93
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,550
The distribution of all the
T-statistics would be a

94
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,570
normalized T-distribution.

95
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,800
This is the mean of the
T-distribution.

96
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,510
There's going to be some
threshold T-value right here.

97
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,970
So this is our threshold
T-value.

98
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,820
   

99
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,290
My writing isn't that
easy to view.

100
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,680
This is some threshold T-value
right over here.

101
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,520
And we want a threshold T-value
such that any T-value

102
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,070
less than that, or the
probability of getting a

103
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,850
T-value less than that is 1%.

104
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:24,150
   

105
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,110
So that entire area
in yellow is 1%.

106
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,250
And we need to figure out a
threshold T-value there.

107
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,620
And this is for a T-distribution
that has n

108
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,300
equal to 10 or 10 minus 1 equals
9 degrees of freedom.

109
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,960
   

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,380
So what is that threshold
value over there?

111
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,360
And notice that this is a
one-sided distribution.

112
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,020
We care about this is 1% and
then all of this stuff over

113
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,450
here is going to be 99%.

114
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,550
And just the way most T-tables
are set up, they don't set up

115
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,620
a negative T-value that is
oriented like this, they'll

116
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,220
just give you a positive
T-value that's

117
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,800
oriented the other way.

118
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,710
So the way T-tables-- and I have
one that we're going to

119
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,840
use in a second right over
here-- the way T-tables are

120
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,370
set up is you have your
distribution like this, and

121
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:22,110
they will just give a positive
T-value over here, some

122
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,610
threshold value.

123
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,000
Where the probability of getting
a T-value above that

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,770
is going to be 1%, and the
probability of getting a

125
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:37,280
t-value below that is
going to be 99%.

126
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,700
And you can see that-- well,
we know T-distributions are

127
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,530
symmetric around their mean, so
whatever value this is, if

128
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,550
this number is 2 then this
value's just going to be

129
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,400
negative 2.

130
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,730
So we just have to keep
that in mind.

131
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,940
But the T-tables actually help
us figure out this value.

132
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,730
So let's figure out a T-value
where the probability of

133
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,420
getting a T-value below
that is 99%.

134
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:09,540
And once again, this is going
to be a one-sided situation.

135
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,680
So let's look at
that over here.

136
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,760
So one-sided-- this is just
straight from Wikipedia--

137
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,200
one-sided, we want the
cumulative distribution below

138
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,770
that T-value to be 99%.

139
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,940
We have it right
over here, 99%.

140
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,550
We have 9 degrees of freedom.

141
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,440
We have 10 data points,
10 minus 1 is 9.

142
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,630
9 degrees of freedom.

143
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,620
So our threshold T-value here
is 2.821, so our threshold

144
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,250
T-value in the case that we care
about is just flip this

145
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,010
over, it's completely symmetric
is negative 2.821.

146
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,950
So what this tells us is the
probability of getting a

147
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:53,970
T-value less than the negative
2.821 is going to be 1%.

148
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,310
Now we got a value that's
a good bit less that we.

149
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,540
Got a T-value of negative 3.

150
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,410
We got a T-value right here, our
T-statistic of negative 3

151
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,480
right over here.

152
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,820
So that definitely goes into
our-- I guess you could call

153
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,290
it our area of rejection.

154
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,340
This is even less probable
than the 1%.

155
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,720
We could even figure it out that
the area over here, the

156
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,680
probability of getting a
T-statistic less than negative

157
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,260
3 is even less than, it's a
subset of this yellow area

158
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,370
right over here.

159
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,070
So because the probability of
getting the T-statistic that

160
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:43,890
we actually got is less than 1%,
we can safely reject the

161
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:51,250
null hypothesis and feel
pretty good about our

162
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,570
alternate hypothesis right over
here, that we do meet the

163
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,550
emission standards.

164
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,550
And we know that we have a
lower than 1% chance of

165
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,210
actually making a type-1 error
in this circumstance.

166
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:03,667
