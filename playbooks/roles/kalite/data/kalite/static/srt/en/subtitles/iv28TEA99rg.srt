1
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:07,336
Let's draw a diagram of the human breast

2
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:11,663
and talk about some of the amazing functions of this organ.

3
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:15,217
Now, the human breasts in both males

4
00:00:15,217 --> 00:00:18,452
and females contains mammary glands.

5
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:22,910
And in females, around the time of puberty,

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,663
these mammary glands develop; in males, they usually remain

7
00:00:26,663 --> 00:00:30,419
remain undeveloped and the main function of this gland,

8
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:35,036
I'll just write in the name over here, these are called the mammary glands.

9
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:41,832
Mammary glands, and the main function of this gland is to secrete

10
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:45,944
milk to nourish the human infant. Now

11
00:00:45,944 --> 00:00:49,452
these mammary glands, each of them drains towards the nipple

12
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:53,504
by a little duct called the lactiferous duct

13
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,003
and I remember I was expecting my first baby and I remembered thinking,

14
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:00,625
"Where is the milk gonna come out from? I don't see a hole there!"

15
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:04,662
And the answer is, there isn't a single hole there. Many tiny holes

16
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:08,801
that are so small you can't actually see them with the naked eye.

17
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:12,280
And so these lactiferous ducts, and I'll just

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,276
label them for you here, these are the

19
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:20,913
lactiferous ducts

20
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:23,784
and the lactiferous ducts empty, or drain,

21
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:28,620
towards the nipple and towards that darker area of skin

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,494
that we see when we look at the human breast and that area

23
00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:35,028
of skin is called the areola and the reason

24
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:39,254
the areola exist is because when the newborn first

25
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:43,203
comes out, areola, the newborns

26
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:47,164
actually don't see very well and in order to help them find their source

27
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:50,309
of food, we have this darkened area of the breast that actually gets

28
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:53,417
quite a bit darker during pregnancy.

29
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:58,117
Ok, so now these mammary glands are lined with

30
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:02,165
what we called myoepithelial cells and let me just break

31
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:05,292
down that word for you. "Myo" is-is a

32
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:10,040
prefix that we use when we're talking about anything that has to do with muscles.

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,274
or anything that contracts. So these are

34
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:15,166
we know contractile cells

35
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:19,309
and they're also epithelial cells and epithelial cells in the body

36
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:23,340
are the cells that line things. So these cells, these red ones,

37
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,335
these myoepithelial cells

38
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,836
are cells that both line the

39
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:35,791
mammary glands and have the ability to contract, to eject

40
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:39,133
the milk out through the lactiferous ducts.

41
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:43,366
Now all of these structures are supported by quite a

42
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:47,752
bit of connective tissue and we're usually talking about in the breast.

43
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:51,603
The main ones are collagen and elastin

44
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:58,171
collagen... and... elastin

45
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:01,338
And all of these connective tissue

46
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:05,755
kind of this connective tissues framework, comes together

47
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:10,125
in these ligaments, strong ligaments, that anchor the breasts

48
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,248
to the chest wall and these ligaments are called

49
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:18,301
Cooper's ligaments. Cooper's...

50
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:21,638
ligaments. In medical school, we used to

51
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:26,376
remember this by saying the phrase, "Cooper's Droopers"

52
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:28,830
but after having had 3 children and breastfed for a

53
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,340
long time, I don't think that's so funny anymore. Anyway,

54
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,051
the only other thing in the breast that makes it kind of a soft and squishy organ

55
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,837
is the adipose tissue that also sort of

56
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:44,125
forms part of the framework or the structure and

57
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:47,134
supports actually all of the glands along with the connective tissue,

58
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:53,067
the collagen and elastin. So this is our adipose tissue

59
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,873
adipose...

60
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:59,082
and, we'll see in our next video

61
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:03,083
what happens how the body knows when to cause the

62
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,881
these myoepithelial cells to contract, to eject

63
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:10,000
the milk out of the mammary glands.
