1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
   

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,610
So where we left off, I had
given you the question-- these

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,340
types of equations are fairly
straightforward.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,910
When we have two real
roots, then this

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,685
is the general solution.

6
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:13,650
And if you have your initial
conditions, you can

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,420
solve for c1 and c2.

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,800
But the question I'm asking is,
what happens when you have

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,100
two complex roots?

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,890
Or essentially, when you're
trying to solve the

11
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,260
characteristic equation?

12
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,680
When you're trying to solve
that quadratic?

13
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,050
The B squared minus 4AC,
that that's negative.

14
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,610
So you get the two roots end up
being complex conjugates.

15
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,920
And we said OK, let's say that
our two roots are lambda plus

16
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,230
or minus mu i.

17
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,770
And we just did a bunch
of algebra.

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,710
We said, well if those are the
roots and we substitute it

19
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,640
back into this formula for
the general solution,

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,990
we get all of this.

21
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,810
And we kept simplifying it, all
the way until we got here,

22
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,505
where we said y is equal to e
to the lambda x, plus c1, et

23
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:52,300
cetera, et cetera.

24
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,830
And we said, can we simplify
this further?

25
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,740
And that's where we took out
Euler's equation, or Euler's

26
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,700
formula, or Euler's definition,
depending what you

27
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,350
want, which I'm always in
awe of every time I

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,290
see it or use it.

29
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,420
But we've talked a lot about
that in the calculus playlist.

30
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,100
We could use this to maybe
further simplify it, so I

31
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,610
wrote e to the mu xi as cosine
mu x plus i sine mu x.

32
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,250
And I wrote e to the minus mu xi
is cosine minus mu x plus i

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,510
sine minus mu x.

34
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,450
And now we could use a little
bit about what we know about

35
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,060
trigonometry.

36
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:33,320
Cosine of minus theta is equal
to cosine of theta.

37
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,300
And we also know that sine of
minus theta is equal to minus

38
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,740
sine of theta.

39
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,260
So let's use these identities
to simplify this

40
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,010
a little bit more.

41
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:54,355
So we get y is equal to e to
the lambda x times-- and we

42
00:01:54,355 --> 00:02:02,640
could actually distribute the c1
too-- so times c1 cosine of

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:18,760
mu x, plus i times c1 sine of mu
x, plus-- all of this is in

44
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,670
this parentheses right here--
plus c2-- instead of cosine of

45
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,430
negative mu x, we know
this identity.

46
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,390
So we can just write this as
cosine of mu x as well,

47
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,540
because cosine of minus x is the
same thing as cosine of x.

48
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:42,860
Plus i times c2-- sine of minus
mu x is the same thing

49
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,840
as minus sine of x.

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,900
So actually, let's take this--
take the minus sine out there.

51
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,630
So minus sine of mu x.

52
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,165
And let's see, it seems like
we're getting to a point that

53
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,240
we can simplify it even more.

54
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,280
We can add the two cosine terms.
So we get the general

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,700
solution, and I know this
problem requires a lot of

56
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,130
algebraic stamina, but as long
you don't make careless

57
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,390
mistakes you'll find it
reasonably rewarding, because

58
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,390
you'll see where things
are coming from.

59
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,680
So we get y-- the general
solution is y is equal to e to

60
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,770
the lambda x, times-- let's
add up the two cosine mu x

61
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:33,320
terms. So it's c1 plus c2
times cosine of mu x.

62
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,965
And let's add the two sine of
mu x terms. So plus i-- we

63
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:50,130
could call that c1i-- that's
that-- minus c2i

64
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,900
times sine of mu x.

65
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,400
And we're almost done
simplifying.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,010
And the last thing we can
simplify is-- well you know c1

67
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,230
and c2 are arbitrary
constants.

68
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,940
So let's just define this
as another constant.

69
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,730
I don't know, let's call it--
I'll just call it c3, just to

70
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,470
not confuse you by using c1
twice, I'll call this c3.

71
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,450
And now this might be a little
bit of a stretch for you, but

72
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,140
if you think about it, it
really makes sense.

73
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,790
This is still just a
constant, right?

74
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,890
Especially if I say, you know
what, I'm not restricting the

75
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,330
constants to the reals.

76
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,300
c could be an imaginary
number.

77
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,470
So if c is an imaginary number,
or some type of

78
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,510
complex number, we don't even
know whether this is

79
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,360
necessarily an imaginary
number.

80
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,450
So we're not going to make
any assumptions about it.

81
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,340
Let's just say that this is some
other arbitrary constant.

82
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,050
Call this c4, and we can worry
about it when we're actually

83
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,700
given the initial conditions.

84
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,370
But what this gives us, if we
make that simplification, we

85
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,910
actually get a pretty
straightforward, general

86
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,280
solution to our differential
equation, where the

87
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,860
characteristic equation
has complex roots.

88
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,370
And that I'll do it
in a new color.

89
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:05,000
That is y is equal to e to
the lambda x, times some

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,220
constant-- I'll call it c3.

91
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,740
It could be c1.

92
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,970
It could be c a hundred
whatever.

93
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,510
Some constant times cosine of
mu of x, plus some other

94
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,130
constant-- and I called it c4,
doesn't have to be c4, I just

95
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,120
didn't want to confuse it with
these-- plus some other

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,870
constant times the
sine of mu of x.

97
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,940
So there's really two things
I want you to realize.

98
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,560
One is, we haven't done
anything different.

99
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,110
At the end of the day, we still
just took the two roots

100
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,740
and substituted it back into
these equations for r1 and r2.

101
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,850
The difference is, we just kept
algebraically simplifying

102
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,020
it so that we got
rid of the i's.

103
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,760
That's all we did.

104
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,890
There was really nothing new
here except for some algebra,

105
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,040
and the use of Euler's
formula.

106
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:00,990
But when r1 and r2 involved
complex numbers, we got to

107
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,960
this simplification.

108
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,840
So in general, as you get the
characteristic equation, and

109
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,630
your two roots are mu plus
or minus-- oh sorry, no.

110
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,790
Your two roots are lambda plus
or minus mu i, then the

111
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,710
general solution is
going to be this.

112
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,960
And, if you had to memorize it,
although I don't want you

113
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,110
to, you should be able to
derive this on your own.

114
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,370
But it's not too hard to-- and
actually if you ever forget

115
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,320
it, solve your characteristic
equation, get your complex

116
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,010
numbers, and just substitute
it right

117
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,220
back in this equation.

118
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,680
And then with the real numbers,
instead of the lambda

119
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,740
and the mu, with the real
numbers, just do the

120
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,540
simplification we did.

121
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,400
And you'll get to the
exact same point.

122
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,730
But if you're taking an exam,
and you don't want to waste

123
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,760
time, and you want to be able
to do something fairly

124
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,740
quickly, you can just remember
that if I have a complex root,

125
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,860
or if I have complex roots to
my characteristic equation,

126
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,795
lambda plus or minus mu i, then
my general solution is e

127
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:07,000
to the lambda x, times some
constant, times cosine of mu x

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,070
plus some constant, times
sine of mu x.

129
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,250
And let's see if we can do
a problem real fast that

130
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,310
involves that.

131
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:22,760
So let's say I had the
differential equation y prime

132
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,600
prime plus the first
derivative plus

133
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,880
y is equal to 0.

134
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,150
So our characteristic equation
is r squared plus r plus 1 is

135
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,790
equal to 0.

136
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,780
Let's break out the
quadratic formula.

137
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,030
So the roots are going to be
negative B, so it's negative 1

138
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,920
plus or minus the square root
of B squared-- B squared is

139
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,820
1-- minus 4 times AC-- well A
and C are both 1-- so it's

140
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,510
just minus 4.

141
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,110
All of that over 2, right?

142
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,840
2 times A.

143
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,620
All of that over 2.

144
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,410
So the roots are going to be
negative 1 plus or minus the

145
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:11,010
square root of negative
3 over 2.

146
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,980
Or we could rewrite this
as, the roots r.

147
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:22,190
r is equal to negative 1/2 plus
or minus-- well we could

148
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,375
rewrite this as i times the
square root of 3, or square

149
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:31,292
root of 3i over 2.

150
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:34,049
Or we could write this is
as square root of 3

151
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,179
over 2 times i.

152
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,350
Actually, that's the best
way to write it, right?

153
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,419
You just take the i out.

154
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,280
So that takes the negative 1
out, and you are left with

155
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,880
square root of 3 over 2.

156
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,020
So these are the roots.

157
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,300
And now we if we want the
general solution we just have

158
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,120
to throw this right
back into that.

159
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,700
And we'll have our
general solution.

160
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,750
Let me write that
right down here.

161
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:01,010
So our general solution will be
y is equal to e to the real

162
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,100
part of our complex conjugate.

163
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,320
So e to the the minus
1/2 times x, right?

164
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,220
This is our lambda.

165
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:16,800
Times some constant-- I'll write
c1 now-- c1 times cosine

166
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:25,170
of the imaginary part without
the i-- so cosine of square

167
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:34,670
root of 3 over 2x, plus c2
times sine of square

168
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:40,250
root of 3 over 2x.

169
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,360
Not too bad.

170
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,880
We had complex roots and it
really didn't take us any more

171
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,320
time than when we had
two real roots.

172
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,510
You just have to realize this.

173
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,400
And then you have to just
find-- use the quadratic

174
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,390
equation to find the complex
roots of the

175
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,250
characteristic equation.

176
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,980
And realize that
this is lambda.

177
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,640
This minus 1/2 is lambda.

178
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,150
And that the square root of
3 over 2 is equal to mu.

179
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,780
And then substitute back into
this solution that we got.

180
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,440
Anyway, in the next video, I'll
do another one of these

181
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,900
problems and we'll actually have
initial conditions, so we

182
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,550
can solve for c1 and c2.

183
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,370
See you in the next video.

184
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:22,900
