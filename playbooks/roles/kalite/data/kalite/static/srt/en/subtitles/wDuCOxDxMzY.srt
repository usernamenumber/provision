1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:03,200
lets say we have two banks

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:10,960
bank a and bank b. and you might already know that banks, all banks, lend out the great majority of the

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,882
money that they get in as deposits, but they keep some of the money as reserves.

4
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:20,643
One just in case their depositors come and say "Hey can I have some of my money back?" and two, because

5
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:26,958
the central bank, the Federal Reserve, says you have to keep a certain amount of your deposits in reserve.

6
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:32,067
There is a reserve requirement. But you could imagine over the course of doing transactions

7
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:38,058
thousands of transactions a day, millions maybe, maybe bank b, more of its depositors come by

8
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:41,133
and say hey, "Give me some of my deposits back!"

9
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:45,667
Obviousl, he's lent out a lot of that money so he starts running low on reserves.

10
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,867
Maybe Bank A, the depositors haven't asked for the money, or for whatever reason,

11
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:51,223
maybe Bank A is sitting on a lot of cash

12
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:55,667
So in this situation, what you're going to have happen is Bank A is going to lend some reserves

13
00:00:55,667 --> 00:01:00,333
is going to lend some cash to Bank B.

14
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,000
So this is lending some cash.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,039
And they'll charge an interest rate for lending that cash.

16
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:07,333
Maybe it'll be 5% interest.

17
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:13,468
And that will be 5% per day (and usually these loans are on a per day basis),

18
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:17,800
and then the next day they will be renegotiated on a per day basis, but it's not 5% per day,

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,267
it'll be 5% per year, so it'll be some much smaller fraction.

20
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:25,891
But usually, as I mentioned, lending goes on a per day basis.

21
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:32,299
So we'll say "Hey this is your cash for tonight, if you need it for the next night, we'll talk again."

22
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,667
And maybe it'll be another 5% or maybe the interest rate can change again.

23
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:40,000
Now lets say that the Federal Reserve is sitting over here, and for whatever reason,

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,267
wants to stimulate the economy. So this is the Fed, and they want to stimulate the economy.

25
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:50,000
So they start printing some money. I should do money in green!

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,216
So the Federal Reserve here starts printing money. And they want to do two things:

27
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:01,394
they want to inject this money into the banking system, which essentially will, hopefully, find its way

28
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:06,333
into the economy, and they also want to lower the interest rate, especially the short

29
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,733
term interest rate, this overnight borrowing.

30
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:13,867
Remember, this is the annual interest rate but this is an overnight loan.

31
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:22,222
So when I talk about the short term interest rate I'm talking about the interest rate on loans that

32
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:29,667
are made over very short periods of time. So what the Federal Reserve will do is called

33
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:30,167
"Open Market Operations." They will go to the market, maybe directly to these banks,

34
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:36,467
or some other banks, and they will buy treasuries.

35
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:38,867
They will give this money to the market, and in exchange they will usually

36
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:44,000
buy treasury securities, sometimes something slightly different, but usually very safe securities.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,800
And maybe its temporarily buy (I'll talk about repurchase agreements in the future).

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,733
And what happens is, this cash goes into the hands of the people who just sold

39
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:55,218
these Treasury securities, and they have to deposit it in banks,

40
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:59,000
and so they might deposit it in this bank over here,

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
the might deposit it in this bank over here,

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,933
or other banks. But the net effect is that there's more cash now in the banking system.

43
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:09,800
And if there's more cash in the banking system this guy right over here needs less

44
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,885
This guy needs less cash, so it lowers demand.

45
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:16,467
It lowers the demand for cash.

46
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:19,622
And then this guy has more to give. so it raises supply.

47
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:25,333
It raises supply because some people maybe just took some of this cash and deposited it.

48
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,469
So if it raises the supply of cash, and this guy needs it less,

49
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:33,136
then the rate to borrow this cash is going to go down.

50
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:37,067
So maybe instead of 5%, it goes down to 4%.

51
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:41,960
So what that would do is it would lower the short term of the yield curve.

52
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,533
So let me draw a yield curve right over here.

53
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:51,600
So this is maturity on this axis, and this is yield.

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,333
And lets say that the yield curve before looked like this.

55
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:01,667
Lets say it looked like this where this over here is 5%.

56
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:09,963
And this is overnight. This might the yield on 1 year debt, and this might be the yield on

57
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:12,471
maybe 5 year debt.

58
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:18,667
But by doing this open market operation the Fed was able to do both of its goals.

59
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:27,000
It was able to inject cash, printed cash, into the economy, and its also able to lower the interest rate.
