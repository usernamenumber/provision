1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,030
We're now on problem number seven.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,500
Problem number seven says x equals 1/2, or if x equals 1/2,

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,070
what is the value of 1 over x plus 1 over x minus 1?

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:21,060
So 1 over x, well that's just 1 over 1/2 plus 1 over--

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,070
what's x minus 1? What's 1/2 minus 1?

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,000
That's minus 1/2, right?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,010
So this is x minus 1 is minus 1/2.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,590
And you could evaluate it.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,020
Or you could immediately see that these would cancel out,

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,010
because you could take this minus and put it right here

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,010
and make this a plus.

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,420
Or you could evaluate it and say well,

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,050
this is equal to 2 minus 2 and that equals 0.

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,290
So this is just kind of a speed question to see

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,080
how fast you can do it.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,080
How much time do you waste on this?

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,030
OK, problem number eight.

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,030
I'll do it in green. Let's see, let me draw that.

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,090
So we've got a coordinate axis.

20
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,030
Oh, my god.

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,090
Edit, undo.

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,420
It's a coordinate axis.

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,060
I didn't have my line tool on.

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,050
And then that's the x-axis.

25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,070
This is the y-axis.

26
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,050
Then let me draw some points here.

27
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,090
I have the point right here.

28
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,070
They say this is 1, 0.

29
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,020
Let's see, x-axis.

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,050
That's the y-axis.

31
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:39,050
So then I still use the line tool.

32
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,020
They have this going straight up like this.

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,020
It goes like that.

34
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,060
Right angle there.

35
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,070
Right angle there.

36
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,020
This is point S.

37
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,030
This is point T.

38
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,050
This is point R.

39
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:12,030
They say in the figure above R, S is equal to S, T.

40
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,090
That's just saying that their lengths are equal.

41
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:23,070
And the coordinate of s, right here, is k, 3.

42
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,040
So what does that tell us?

43
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,430
That means that the x value, right here,

44
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,070
this point right here is k.

45
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,050
And that this y value, right here, is 3, right? k, 3.

46
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,050
That's not t, 3.

47
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,040
I'm just saying the y value right here is 3.

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,070
What is the value of k?

49
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,030
Well we know that this length and this length

50
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,000
are the same, right? What is this length?

51
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,070
Actually, that was a very ugly curly bracket.

52
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,080
But we know the y value here is 3, right?

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,880
This intersects the y, intercepts at 3 right here,

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,050
so we know that distance is 3.

55
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,090
We know that this distance is 3.

56
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,050
That's also 3.

57
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,570
And we also know that this is equal to this,

58
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,090
so we also know that this distance is 3.

59
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,000
And if that distance is 3, we know that this distance is 3.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,090
But we're 3 to the left of the y-axis, right?

61
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,030
We've gone 3 units in the negative direction.

62
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,950
So the value of k, or the x-coordinate here

63
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,590
would be negative 3 because we went 3 to the left.

64
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,960
If it was out here it'd be positive 3,

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,070
but since it's here it's negative 3, and that's choice A.

66
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,090
Next question, number nine.

67
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,070
OK, let's see.

68
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,290
So they drew a table

69
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,680
and I'll just write it the way they did it.

70
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,060
So they did x and f of x.

71
00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:02,030
And then they say 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 10.

72
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,870
The table above gives the values

73
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,090
Which of the following defines f?

74
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,950
So it's a quadratic function,

75
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,990
so we know it's going to have the form--

76
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,030
f of x is going to be something like x squared--

77
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,080
well it could be ax squared plus bx plus c.

78
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,130
My suspicion though is it's going to be

79
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,080
something fairly you-- simple.

80
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,050
So let's see.

81
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,670
The way I would do it is I would play around with it.

82
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:37,090
So if I squared this x value and I still end up with a 1--

83
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,890
and this is actually the biggest clue right here,

84
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,010
because when x is 0, f of x is 1.

85
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,030
So we know that this constant term is going to be 1.

86
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,010
It's going to be something plus 1 because when x is 0,

87
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,020
these things are equal to 0, this ax squared plus bx.

88
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,460
And we still have it equal to 1.

89
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,080
So we know c is 1.

90
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,030
So we know that already, that's ax squared plus bx plus 1.

91
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,010
And then let's see.

92
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,030
We know that we have a plus 1 here, right?

93
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,400
So we know that this whole term is-- you can put it in here,

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,350
but when you get a plus 1--

95
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,050
well I'm explaining it in a very confusing way.

96
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,250
But your brain might just say hey,

97
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,030
if I square this and add this plus 1, I get 2.

98
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,390
If I square this and I add 1, I get 5.

99
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,350
If I square 3 and I add 1, I get 10.

100
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,990
And you would say well,

101
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,020
f of x must just equal x squared plus 1.

102
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,570
If your brain doesn't just stumble on that--

103
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,860
although it should. You should probably just say

104
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,600
well it's probably just something simple like I squared

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,660
and I add 1 or subtract one,

106
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,540
because they're never going to give you

107
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,840
something really complicated. But if they did,

108
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,740
or I guess if you're not doing this on the SAT,

109
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,730
hopefully you see how I immediately got that

110
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,030
the y intercept is 1, because when x is 0, f of x is 1.

111
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,650
And then you could have said well,

112
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,030
when x is 1, f of x is 2.

113
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,350
So you could have substituted here.

114
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:04,060
You could have said 2 is equal to ax-- sorry.

115
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,210
You could say 2 is equal to

116
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,080
a times 1 squared plus b times 1 plus 1, right?

117
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,220
Because I just substituted 1 for x,

118
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,090
and then I put f of x is equal to 2.

119
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,860
And then you would get-- if you subtract 1 from both sides,

120
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,060
you get 1 is equal to A plus D, right?

121
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,920
And you know on the SAT they're not going to

122
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,040
give some crazy fractional thing.

123
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,750
And I'm actually hesitant to even go in this whole direction

124
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,370
because I think it's just overcomplicating the thing.

125
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,200
Because you could then do the same thing with 2 and 5,

126
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,040
and then get a system of equations,

127
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,000
et cetera, et cetera.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And you would have wasted a lot of time.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,990
The big discovery here is that most of these on the SAT

130
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,070
are going to be really simple equations.

131
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,990
And frankly, more than doing this--

132
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,040
this is just multiple choice, I just realized--

133
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,020
you could just try out the equations that they give you.

134
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,030
And it's lucky that the first one works.

135
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,500
Actually, you should just try out all of them

136
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,040
and see which ones work.

137
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,060
Next problem.

138
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,220
Write me a message if you found

139
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,050
that last explanation a little confusing.

140
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,680
I just didn't want to show you the correct way to do it,

141
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,640
because that would take you forever

142
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,060
and it's not really the correct way to do it on the SAT.

143
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,590
Problem number ten.

144
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,430
How old was a person exactly one year ago if,

145
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,010
exactly x years ago, the person was y years old.

146
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,070
So this is just something to confuse you.

147
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,000
So x years ago the person was y years old.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,080
So let's put it this way.

149
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,070
Let me think of the best way to write this.

150
00:07:53,070 --> 00:08:00,060
So let's write their current age.

151
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,060
Well let's just write it as equal to a.

152
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,030
So we know a couple of things.

153
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,030
We know that a minus x is equal to y, or we know that

154
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,380
their current age is equal to x plus y, right?

155
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,020
This is their current age.

156
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,450
And what do we want to figure out?

157
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,490
We want to figure out their age 1 year ago.

158
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,080
So we want to figure out their current age minus 1.

159
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,020
So the current age minus 1?

160
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,070
Well their current age is x plus y.

161
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,650
So you just substitute that back in,

162
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:40,060
and you get x plus y minus 1 is how old they were 1 year ago

163
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,050
So x plus y minus 1, that's choice E.

164
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,010
Next problem.

165
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,370
Actually I only have a minute left,

166
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,070
so I'll do the next problem in the next video.

167
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,010
I'll see you then.
