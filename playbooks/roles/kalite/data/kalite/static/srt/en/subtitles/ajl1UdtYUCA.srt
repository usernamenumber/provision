1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
   

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,510
In the last video I constructed
a scenario where

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,480
we get all of the upside in an
investment and our downside

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,340
was limited to essentially
15% of our investment.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,930
Or in that case it was $25.50.

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,210
I think I made a slide
math error.

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,790
I kept saying $24.50.

8
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,010
It was really $25.50.

9
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,000
And I also apologize, I
realize I had my sound

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,750
settings a little off.

11
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,540
But hopefully you'll be
able to still listen

12
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,260
to that last video.

13
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,140
But just to review what we did
is instead of putting $30--

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,010
let's say the asset
price was $30.

15
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,260
Instead of just going out there
and paying $30 for it,

16
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,990
what we did is we put
$25.50 aside.

17
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,810
And then we used $4.50 to
participate in Geithner's

18
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,010
project, or his plan.

19
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,530
And we put in $4.50.

20
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,970
The Treasury puts in $4.50.

21
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,590
Then the Fed lends us $51.

22
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,360
And then we're able to buy $60
worth of security, or twice as

23
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,260
many as we would've
otherwise bought.

24
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,380
But we're splitting
the upside.

25
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,340
So essentially we're getting
the upside on the security.

26
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,470
And we saw in the last video
what the payoff looked like.

27
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,319
And let me draw that here.

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,750
So hopefully this'll be a
slightly cleaner version than

29
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,580
I did in the last video.

30
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,190
So this is going to
be the eventual

31
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,440
price of the security.

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,560
   

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,920
And let me make the y-axis
the eventual value of my

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,170
investment.

35
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,510
   

36
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,030
Now if I just straight up
invested in the thing then the

37
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,400
value of my investment is the
value of the security.

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,260
So it would just look
something like that.

39
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,730
   

40
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:49,210
So let's say if the value of
the security ends up being

41
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,710
$30, then the value of my
investment ends up being $30.

42
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,970
This is the scenario
where I just

43
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,630
straight up buy the thing.

44
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,940
If the thing ends up being worth
nothing, then the value

45
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,890
of my investment's nothing.

46
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,990
If the thing ends up being worth
$60, then the value of

47
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,180
my investment is $60.

48
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,200
This is my investment value.

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,420
Not too fancy there.

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,900
But what we saw in the last
video is, if we do this

51
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,440
scenario where I put $25.50
aside, and I only put $4.50 at

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,340
risk in this type of reality,
what we had is that if the

53
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:26,380
value of the security is
anything less than $25.50,

54
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,200
then the equity holders
here get wiped out.

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,120
My $4.50 is worth nothing.

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,900
My $4.50 is worth nothing.

57
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,070
But I still have that $25.50
that I put aside, the cash.

58
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,850
So my losses were limited to
essentially $4.50 or the

59
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,190
capital that I put at risk.

60
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,760
So the payoff diagram then
looks like this.

61
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,780
In an upside scenario, with my
$4.50 investment I'm able to

62
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,520
capture all of the upside that
I would have normally gotten,

63
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,540
and then my downside is
essentially capped to $4.50.

64
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,540
No matter what happens to the
security, I'm going to be

65
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,400
sitting with $25.50.

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,440
So the worst case is that I
really just lose $4.50,

67
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,350
assuming that my original price
that I pay is $30 for

68
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,810
the security.

69
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,010
This'll be my loss.

70
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,530
And then this is obviously
my gain, just like that.

71
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,350
Now let's see, if there was no
Geithner Plan, let's see if we

72
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,640
could set up the same type of
payoff using more conventional

73
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,750
securities, I guess we
could call them.

74
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,950
And if we can do that, then we
can try to price those more

75
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,000
conventional securities, and
then we have a good sense of

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,150
the subsidy or essentially what
the government is giving.

77
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,360
So instead of the Geithner
Plan, let's say that we

78
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,230
invested straight up
in the security.

79
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,570
And I'll just say, we invest
in the security for $30.

80
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,330
And then we also buy an
insurance contract.

81
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,090
So we buy the security
for $30.

82
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,530
And then we also buy
a put option.

83
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,250
And that sounds fancy, but all
it is is an insurance contract

84
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,120
essentially on a security.

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,370
So we buy a put.

86
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,240
   

87
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,210
And the put gives us the right,
it's a contract that

88
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,010
says that we can sell.

89
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:30,470
We have the right to sell
our security for $25.50.

90
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,780
And we don't have to sell
our security for $25.50.

91
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,310
Let's say it ends up
being worth $60.

92
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,610
We're out here.

93
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,710
Then we're just going
to take our put

94
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,920
contract and rip it up.

95
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,400
It's worthless.

96
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,770
We don't want it.

97
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,950
We didn't need the insurance.

98
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,070
Our house didn't burn
down, right?

99
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,040
But let's say we're down here.

100
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,590
The thing we bought, this toxic

101
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,560
asset, really is worthless.

102
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,950
Then wow, we have
this contract.

103
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,090
We got into a contract with
someone else who said that

104
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,370
they would agree to buy
that thing for us

105
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,510
from $25.50, right?

106
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,670
We have the right to sell it to
them, or to put it to them,

107
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,610
for $25.50.

108
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,240
And just so you get a little
bit of the lingo, although

109
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,180
many of you all are probably
familiar with this, this is

110
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,950
the strike price of
the put option.

111
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,960
And what would the payoff
diagram look like?

112
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,190
Well, I have the security.

113
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,920
So in all of the scenarios where
the security is worth

114
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,810
more than $25.50, my payoff is
going to look like this.

115
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,180
It's going to be just
along this line.

116
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:34,100
Now, in these scenarios down
here, what is my payoff?

117
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,760
Well if the value of the
security ends up being

118
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,020
something less than $25.50, well
I have this thing here

119
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,670
saying, you know, the market's
saying that they're only

120
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,270
willing to pay I don't know,
$12 for my security.

121
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,480
But I have this contract with
somebody that says hey,

122
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,620
they're willing to pay $25.50
for my security.

123
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,380
So in any of these scenarios,
I'm just going to exercise my

124
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,640
put option, and I'm just
going to sell it to

125
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,610
this guy for $25.50.

126
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,460
So, no matter in all of these
downside scenarios, I still

127
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,400
get $25.50, because I have
that put option.

128
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,730
So essentially, as you see,
this payoff diagram is

129
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,450
identical to what the
government gave us.

130
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,270
So throughout this whole
structure, this public private

131
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,740
partnership, all the government
is essentially

132
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,130
doing is giving us a
put option with a

133
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,340
$25.50 strike price.

134
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,240
And so to figure out how large
of a subsidy that is, we

135
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,940
really just have to figure out
what is a put option with a

136
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,520
$25.50 strike price.

137
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,880
And people have Nobel-- It's
actually not that easy to

138
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,830
calculate this type of thing,
because you have to know about

139
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,530
the volatility of the security
and its dividends, and

140
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,300
actually the math to originally
come up with this

141
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,270
came out of-- People have won
Nobel Prizes for this.

142
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,180
But it's a known problem.

143
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,060
What I'm going to do here--
And it's a little bit

144
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,520
theoretical.

145
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,440
What a lot of people do in
reality is, they look at what

146
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,610
the market is paying for these
options, and then they figure

147
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,870
out what the implied assumptions
are, the

148
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,440
volatility.

149
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,680
And that's really the
big assumption.

150
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,575
But I just did a little
bit of a web search.

151
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:01,210
And just to give proper
credit, this is

152
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,520
math.columbia.edu.

153
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,420
And this is a little tilde sign
~smirnoff\options13.html

154
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,170
But what he has here is a
little bit of an options

155
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,140
calculator.

156
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,980
And I'll take my chances with
this guy, who's probably a

157
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,190
Ph.D student or a professor at
Columbia, that he knows how to

158
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,610
calculate options, and that
his JavaScript is correct.

159
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,650
And the numbers make sense.

160
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,370
But let's say the security
in our case is $30.

161
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,840
The strike price is $25.50.

162
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,140
Let me make this larger.

163
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,200
The interest rate.

164
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,400
So this is the risk free
interest rate.

165
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,770
It could also be the interest
on the debt.

166
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,060
It depends.

167
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,110
But you know, it's
something small.

168
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,040
Interest is low right now.

169
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,850
Say 2%.

170
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,500
The dividend yield-- We're
buying these toxic assets that

171
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,530
essentially have a pretty
high yield.

172
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,570
And if you're buying it at
$0.30 on the dollar, your

173
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,030
yield's probably in the range
of 30% or something.

174
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,510
But you can play with
these assumptions.

175
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,980
I'm trying to be as favorable
as possible to this, to kind

176
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,570
of see how large the
subsidy could be.

177
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,830
And maybe we'll come
up a range.

178
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,150
And you could play with
this in your own time.

179
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,990
Volatility per year.

180
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,520
I think 30% is pretty fair.

181
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,910
That in any given year, the
perceived value of this could

182
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,650
fluctuate by 30%.

183
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,060
And the time to expiration.

184
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,180
These are long lived assets.

185
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,450
A lot of mortgage assets, their
average maturity is

186
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,390
around 10 years.

187
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,480
So instead of 365 days, let's
make it 10 years.

188
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,660
3,650 days.

189
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,090
And let's calculate it.

190
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,340
All right, and what we want
to worry about is

191
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,190
the American put.

192
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,289
In future videos, I'll talk
about the difference between a

193
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,360
European put and an
American put.

194
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,700
But an American put means you
can essentially exercise it at

195
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,520
any time you want
to exercise it.

196
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,950
While a European put just has an
exercise date, where that's

197
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,120
the only time where you can
exercise your option.

198
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,650
But the American put says that
the value of this, for the

199
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,420
assumptions we gave,
is about $19.50.

200
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,710
So it's a pretty big subsidy.

201
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,430
And of course, the numbers
change a good bit depending on

202
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,620
if we make the yield on
the security less and

203
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,010
we calculate it.

204
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,680
Whoops, I made a mistake here.

205
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,290
It becomes something less.

206
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,060
But no matter how you play with
the assumptions, you get

207
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,470
something in the
$15-$20 range.

208
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,810
So that option calculator told
us that the correct price or

209
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,630
the theoretical price for
something like this, for a put

210
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,350
option for a security like this,
with 30% volatility that

211
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,320
maybe has a 30% yield
on it, because it's

212
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
paying a lot of dividends.

213
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,650
People are paying their
mortgage payments.

214
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,020
That the option value of this
put, if you had to go buy it

215
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,880
on the market.

216
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,790
You know, it's a range.

217
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,920
It's maybe $15 to $20.

218
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,560
So a rational investor who would
have paid $15 to $20 for

219
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,920
the option, how much are they
willing to pay for the

220
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,330
security plus the option?

221
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,430
Well, that same rational
investor, we're saying was

222
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,090
willing to pay $30 for
the security before.

223
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,240
And now they're getting the
security and the option.

224
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,280
So now, if they had had to go
buy the option by themselves,

225
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,090
they'd have to pay $15 to $20.

226
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:10,050
So in theory, they would be
willing to pay up to $30 plus

227
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,200
the value of the option.

228
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,880
So they'd be willing to
pay up to $45 to $50.

229
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,560
Now I want to be
clear on this.

230
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,820
If the investor with this option
is, let's say they end

231
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,480
up paying $50, who
is benefiting?

232
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,400
If the private investor here
ends up paying $50 for the

233
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,410
security, because the government
is essentially

234
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,230
giving them a free option, if
they pay $50 they're actually

235
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,690
paying for the what the
government is giving them.

236
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,010
They're paying for the option.

237
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,570
So the real benefit is the
person selling the toxic

238
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,520
assets, which are these
banks that I'd argue

239
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,730
are probably insolvent.

240
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,810
So the subsidy wouldn't be
to the private investor.

241
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,950
It would be to the banks.

242
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,140
Only if the private investor
pays the same prices that they

243
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,080
would have already
paid, the $30.

244
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,360
And the bank's willing
to sell it for $30.

245
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,500
Then you could say that the
subsidy is going to that

246
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,490
private investor.

247
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,630
But this begs the
whole question.

248
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,180
The whole point of this exercise
was that the bid in

249
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,590
the market right now,
or what people are

250
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,020
willing to pay, is $30.

251
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,500
While the banks, essentially,
they can't sell for anything

252
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,830
less, because if they did then
the gig would be up.

253
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,590
People would know they're
bankrupt.

254
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,680
The offer is $60.

255
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,690
So even with this option that
the government is giving them,

256
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,750
and even if this investor were
to pay up for the entire price

257
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,290
of the option, we're kind of
getting that maybe they'll be

258
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,550
willing to pay up
to $45 or $50.

259
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,260
In which case the private
investor is really getting no

260
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,840
value from this whole gig.

261
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,860
So even then, you don't
get to this point.

262
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,900
And obviously if the private
investor's only paying in the

263
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,710
$30, range, then that's no
different than the reality

264
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,830
we're already into.

265
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,570
And so this goes back to
that Geithner 2 video.

266
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,980
That even with this option, a
rational investor is only

267
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,190
willing to pay up to maybe
$40 or $50, how

268
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,120
could this plan work?

269
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,330
Well it either won't work.

270
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,060
Because a rational investor
still won't pay the magic

271
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,780
number that the banks need
in order to be solvent.

272
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,980
Or the scenario that I described
in the Geithner Plan

273
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,750
2 video will happen, where the
banks have this huge incentive

274
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,850
to buy these for themselves.

275
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,910
They just create these kind
of shill hedge funds.

276
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,400
And maybe I'll do a bunch of
videos on all of the different

277
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,310
ways they can do that.

278
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,760
And banks are experts at this.

279
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,610
At creating kind of off-balance
sheet entities

280
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,210
that they really do control.

281
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,880
And then those things
participate with the

282
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,550
government and buy the
assets off of them.

283
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,100
So my general take on it is,
if when we see this program

284
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,730
start to happen, if we see
bids that are above $60.

285
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,170
If we see bids at $0.70 on the
dollar or $0.80 on the dollar,

286
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,880
then these bids are actually
coming from the banks

287
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,420
themselves.

288
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,290
Because there's no rational
reason, even with the put

289
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,080
option, why a regular investor
would pay in

290
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
excess of $40 or $50.

291
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,130
And then there is a whole
liquidity argument here, that

292
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,090
Geithner has made, that oh well
it's not just the subsidy

293
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,570
we're giving.

294
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,980
It's just also the
buying power.

295
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,680
That right now, you have all
these distress sellers, and

296
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,300
you don't have that
many buyers or

297
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,650
dollars that are buying.

298
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,330
And by kind of leveraging things
up, you're increasing

299
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,640
the buying power out there.

300
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,650
And in the next video, I'll kind
of address that question.

301
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,000
If that is the real problem that
Geithner wants to solve,

302
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,070
there's a much better way to
solve it than doing this

303
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,750
public private partnership.

304
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,490
And essentially allowing
the banks to

305
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,660
potentially set the price.

306
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,710
You're either letting the banks
set the price, which

307
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,430
would be a direct transfer of
wealth from taxpayers to banks

308
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,540
that made mistakes.

309
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,460
Or you're giving a put option,
which has a pretty good value,

310
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,780
to a bunch of hedge funds and
investors, who maybe aren't

311
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,460
the reason why we got into the
mess, but there's no reason

312
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,830
why you should be transferring
money from

313
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,920
taxpayers to hedge funds.

314
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,470
So in the next video, I'll
address that, and hopefully

315
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,450
this gave you a good sense of
what exactly the government is

316
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,780
doing, and how you
can value it.

317
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,560
See you in the next video.
