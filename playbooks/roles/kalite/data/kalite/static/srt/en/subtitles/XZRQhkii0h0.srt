1
00:00:00,739 --> 00:00:02,574
You already know that we can view

2
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:04,768
multiplication as repeated addition.

3
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:08,894
So, if we had 2 times 3 (2 × 3), we could literally

4
00:00:08,894 --> 00:00:11,828
view this as 3 2's being added together.

5
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:16,645
So it could be 2 + 2 + 2.

6
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:20,270
Notice this is [COUNTING: 1, 2] 3 2's.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,736
And when you add those 2's together, you get 6.

8
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:26,376
What we're going to introduce you to

9
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:30,659
in this video is the idea of repeated multiplication –

10
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:32,601
a new operation that really can be

11
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,336
viewed as repeated multiplication.

12
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:39,544
And that's the operation of taking an 'exponent.'

13
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:41,675
And it sounds very fancy.

14
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:42,958
But we'll see with a few examples

15
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,659
that it's not too bad.

16
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,635
So now, let's take the idea of

17
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:50,104
2 to the 3rd power (2^3) –

18
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:51,097
which is how we would say this.

19
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:52,045
(So let me write this down

20
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:53,713
in the appropriate colors.)

21
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:57,537
So 2 to the 3rd power. (2^3.)

22
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:59,026
So you might be tempted to say,

23
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,491
"Hey, maybe this is 2 × 3, which would be 6."

24
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:02,553
But remember, I just said

25
00:01:02,553 --> 00:01:04,527
this is repeated multiplication.

26
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:07,196
So if I have 2 to the 3rd power, (2^3),

27
00:01:07,196 --> 00:01:11,065
this literally means multiplying 3 2's together.

28
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:15,013
So this would be equal to,

29
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:18,510
not 2 + 2 + 2, but 2 × ...

30
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,538
(And I’ll use a little dot to signify multiplication.)

31
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:24,276
... 2 × 2 × 2.

32
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:27,202
Well, what's 2 × 2 × 2?

33
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:29,230
Well that is equal to 8.

34
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,365
(2 × 2 × 2 = 8.)

35
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:35,268
So 2 to the 3rd power is equal to 8. (2^3 = 8.)

36
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:37,813
Let's try a few more examples here.

37
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:45,598
What is 3 to the 2nd power (3^2)

38
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:47,183
going to be equal to?

39
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:48,970
And I'll let you think about that for a second.

40
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,454
I encourage you to pause the video.

41
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:52,829
So let's think it through.

42
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,084
This literally means multiplying 2 3's.

43
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,573
So let's multiply 3 –

44
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:02,810
(Let me do that in yellow.)

45
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,093
Let's multiply 3 × 3.

46
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:11,197
So this is going to be equal to 9.

47
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,979
Let’s do a few more examples.

48
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:19,938
What is, say, 5 to the – let's say –

49
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:23,421
5 to the 4th power (5^4)?

50
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:24,212
And what you'll see here is

51
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:25,378
this number is going to get

52
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,635
large very, very, very fast.

53
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:30,090
So 5 to the 4th power (5^4) is going to be

54
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,399
equal to multiplying 4 5's together.

55
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:38,649
So 5^4 = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5.

56
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:40,822
Notice, we have [COUNTING: 1, 2, 3] 4 5's.

57
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:42,110
And we are multiplying them.

58
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,971
We are not adding them.

59
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:44,416
This is not 5 × 4.

60
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,668
This is not 20.

61
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:47,962
This is 5 × 5 × 5 × 5.

62
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:49,658
So what is this going to be?

63
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:52,413
Well 5 × 5 is 25. (5 × 5 = 25.)

64
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:56,573
25 × 5 is 125. (25 × 5 = 125.)

65
00:02:56,573 --> 00:03:01,531
125 × 5 is 625. (125 × 5 = 625.)
