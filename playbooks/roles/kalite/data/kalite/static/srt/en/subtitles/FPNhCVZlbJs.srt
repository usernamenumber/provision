00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,950
In this video I want to talk about how we can convert repeating decimals into fractions.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,097
So let's give ourselves a repeating decimal.

3
00:00:08,097 --> 00:00:13,746
So let's say I had the repeating decimal zero point seven and sometimes it'll be written like that. [bar above the seven]

4
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:16,079
Which just means that the 7 keeps on repeating.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,544
So this is the same thing as zero point seven seven seven seven

6
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:24,856
And I could just keep going on and on and on, forever with those sevens.

7
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:33,398
So the trick to converting these things into fractions is to essentially set this equal to a variable.

8
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:35,530
And we will sort of do it step by step.

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,351
So let set this equal to a variable, let me call this x.

10
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:44,318
So x is equal to zero point seven and the seven repeats on an on for ever.

11
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:46,280
Now what would ten x be?

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,565
Well let's think about this, ten x would just be ten times this

13
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:54,906
so it would be, we can even think of it right over here.

14
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:56,861
it would be, if we multiplied this by ten.

15
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:59,364
We would be moving the decimal one to the right

16
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:04,351
it would be seven point seven seven seven, on and on and on forever.

17
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:08,165
Or we could say it is seven point seven repeating.

18
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:10,219
Now this is the trick here.

19
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:12,593
Let me make these equal to each other.

20
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:15,876
So we know what x is, it is point seven seven repeating forever.

21
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:19,052
Ten x is this. And it is another repeating thing.

22
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:22,735
Now the way we can get rid of the repeating decimals

23
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:25,969
is if we subtracting x from ten x, right?

24
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:29,355
Because x has all these repeating point seven seven seven.

25
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,178
If you subtract that from seven point seven seven seven,

26
00:01:32,178 --> 00:01:34,193
you are just going to be left with seven.

27
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:35,933
So let's do that.

28
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:38,197
Let me rewrite it here.

29
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:41,683
Ten, ten x is equal to seven point seven repeating.

30
00:01:41,683 --> 00:01:46,388
Which is equal to seven point seven seven seven on and on forever.

31
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:50,389
As we established earlier that x is equal to

32
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:57,331
zero point seven repeating; which is equal to seven point seven seven seven on and on and on forever.

33
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:00,669
Now what happens when you subtract x from ten x.

34
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:03,282
So we are going to subtract the yellow from the green.

35
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:08,198
Well ten of something minus one of something is just going to be nine of that something.

36
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:10,964
And then that is going to be equal to:

37
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:16,913
What's seven point seven seven repeating, minus point seven seven, going on and on, forever repeating?

38
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:19,241
Well it is just going to be seven.

39
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:22,677
These parts are going to cancel out, you are just left with seven or we could say,

40
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:26,024
these two parts cancel out and you are left with seven.

41
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:28,680
So you get nine x is equal to seven.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,615
To solve for x you just divide both sides nine.

43
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:36,204
Well I could do all three sides,

44
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:38,715
although these are all saying the same thing

45
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:43,046
and you get x is equal to seven ninths. [7/9]

46
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,439
Let's do another one.

47
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,257
I will leave this one here so you can refer to it.

48
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:55,429
So let's say I have the number one point two repeating.

49
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:59,593
So this is the same as one point two two two and on and on.

50
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:03,681
Whatever the bar is on top of, that is the part that repeats forever.

51
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:07,394
So just like we did over here, lets set this equal to x.

52
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:11,217
And let's say ten x -- let's multiply this by ten.

53
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:17,701
So ten x is equal to twelve point two repeating.

54
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:22,028
Which is the same thing as twelve point two two two on and on and on.

55
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,778
Then we can subtract x from ten x.

56
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:28,644
And you don't have to rewrite it but I rewrite it here, just so we don't get confused.

57
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:32,194
So we have x is equal to one point two repeating.

58
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:35,343
And if we subtract x from ten x what do we get.

59
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:38,220
On the left hand side we get x minus,

60
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,137
ten x minus x is equal to to nine x and

61
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:45,375
this is going to be equal to: Well the two repeating parts cancel out.

62
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,111
This cancels with that.

63
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:49,309
If two repeating minus two repeating that's just a bunch of zeros.

64
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:52,746
Twelve minus one is eleven.

65
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:54,931
You have nine x is equal to eleven.

66
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:56,830
Divide both sides by nine,

67
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:02,803
and you get left with x is equal to eleven over nine. [x=11/9]
