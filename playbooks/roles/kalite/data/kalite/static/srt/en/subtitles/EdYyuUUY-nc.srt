99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the last video we started with a star in its main sequence like the sun. And inside the core of that

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
star you had hydrogen fusion going on. So that is hydrogen fusion and then outside of the core

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you just had hydrogen. You just had hydrogen plasma.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we say plasma, its the electrons and protons of the idividual atoms

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
have been disassociated because the temaptures and pressures are so high.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they really just, kind of, its like this soup of electrons and protons

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as opposed to proper atoms that we associate with at lower temperatures.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is a main sequence star right over here.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we saw in the last video that this hydrogen is fusing into helium.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we start having more and more helium here.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And as we have more and more helium the core becomes more and more dense

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because helium is a more massive atom. It is able to pack more mass into a smaller volume.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this gets more and more dense until, at some point, while the core is becoming

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
more and more dense, that actually makes the fusion happen faster and faster

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because its more dense, more gravitational pressure, more mass wanting to get to it,

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
more pressure on the hydrogen that's fusing, it starts to fuse hotter.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So hydrogen fuses faster.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In fact we even see this in our sun. Our sun today is brighter and hotter.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Its fusing faster then it was when it was born 4.5 or 4.6 billion years ago.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But eventually its going to get the point where in the core you only have helium.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So at some point the entire core is all helium.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Its going to be way denser than this core over here.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All of that mass over there has been turned into helium.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Not all of it, a lot of it has been turned into energy, but most of it is now in helium.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Its going to be a much much smaller volume. The whole time the temperature
