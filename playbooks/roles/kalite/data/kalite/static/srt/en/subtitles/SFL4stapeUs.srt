1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:02,600
What i want to do in this video is to discuss

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,667
a special class of triangles called '30-60-90

3
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,667
triangles'. And I think you know why they're

4
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:08,600
called this.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,067
The measures of its angles are,

6
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:13,200
30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,867
And what we're going to prove in this video

8
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:16,733
and this tends to be a very useful result

9
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,533
at least for a lot of what you see in a

10
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,067
geometry class, and then later on in

11
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:21,200
Trigonometry class.

12
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,600
Is the ratio between the sides of a

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,533
30-60-90 triangle.

14
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:28,267
That if the hypotenuse has length x.

15
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:30,200
(so that's, remember the hypotenuse is

16
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,400
opposite the 90 degree side.)

17
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,200
If the hypotenuse has length x, what we're going

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,667
to prove is that the shorter side which

19
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:39,000
is opposite the 30 degree side has length

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
x/2, and that the 60 degree side...

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,800
the 60 degree side, or the side that's opposite

22
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,933
the 60 degree angle I should say is going

23
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:50,600
to be the (the square root of 3 x the shorter side.)

24
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,333
so the square root of 3 times (x/2)

25
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,600
that's going to be its length.

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,733
So that's what we're going to prove in this video.

27
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,000
and in other videos, we're going to apply this.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,800
We're going to show that this is actually a useful

29
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,000
result.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,733
Now lets start with a triangle that we're

31
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:06,000
very familiar with... so let me draw ourselves

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,267
an equilateral triangle... so drawing the

33
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,067
triangles is always the hard part.

34
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:16,133
So this is my best shot at an equilateral triangle.

35
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:22,200
And lets call this A, B, C

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,533
I'm just going to assume I've constructed an

37
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:24,733
equilateral triangle,

38
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:28,867
so Triangle ABC is equilateral.

39
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,867
and if it's equilateral, that means all

40
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:32,733
of it's sides are equal, and lets say that it has

41
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:41,600
an equilateral with sides of length x.

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,400
so this is going to be x

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,133
this is going to be x, and this is

44
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,333
going to be x.

45
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,667
we also know, based on what we seen from

46
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,933
equilateral triangles before, that the measures

47
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,800
of all of these angles are going to be 60 degrees.

48
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,667
So this is going to be 60 degrees

49
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:59,333
this is going to be 60 degrees, and then

50
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,267
this is going to be 60 degrees.

51
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:02,733
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to drop

52
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:05,933
an altitude from this top point right over here.

53
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,000
So I'm going to drop an altitude right down

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,667
and by definition when I'm constructing an

55
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,000
altitude it is going to intersect the

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,467
base right here... at a right angle.

57
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,267
So that's going to be right angle, and then

58
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:17,000
this is going to be a right angle.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,667
and it's a pretty straightforward proof to show

60
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,267
that this is not only an altitude,

61
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,067
that is perpendicular to this base.

62
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:24,667
But it's a pretty straightforward proof to show that it

63
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,108
bisects the base and you can pause it

64
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:28,867
if you like and prove it yourself.

65
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:30,533
But it really comes out of the fact that it's easy

66
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:33,333
to prove that these two triangles are congruent.

67
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,400
So let me... prove it for you.

68
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,733
So lets call this point D right over here.

69
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:42,179
So triangles ABD and BDC

70
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:44,667
they clearly both share this side, so

71
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:47,400
this side is common to both of them right over

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,333
here.

73
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,800
and then this angle right over here is

74
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,600
congruent to this angle over there.

75
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,533
This angle right over here is congruent to

76
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,133
this angle over here.

77
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:01,600
and so, if these two and congruent to each other.

78
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,067
The third angle has to be congruent to each other.

79
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:06,333
So this angle right over here needs to be

80
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,533
congruent to that angle right over there.

81
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,200
So these two are congruent.

82
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,067
And so you can use actually a variety of our

83
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,333
congruence postulates, we could say

84
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:20,000
SAS (side, angle side) congruents

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,600
we could use ASA (angle, side angle)

86
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,733
any of those to show that triangle ABD

87
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:36,133
is congruent to triangle CBD.

88
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,667
and what that does for us.

89
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,600
and we could use as I said (Angle,Side,Angle)

90
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,667
or (Side,Angle,Side)

91
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,133
whatever we like to use for this.

92
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:45,000
what that does for us is that it tells us that

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,667
the corresponding sides of these triangles

94
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:48,933
are going to be equal.

95
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:51,000
in particular... in particular,

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,795
the length AD is going to be equal to CD

97
00:03:57,795 --> 00:03:59,733
these are corresponding sides.

98
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,800
so these are going to be equal to each other.

99
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
and if we know that they're equal to each other.

100
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,467
that add up to x, remember this was an

101
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:07,467
equilateral triangle of length x.

102
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:09,733
we know that this side right over here is going

103
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:12,800
to be x/2... we know this is going to be x/2

104
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,031
not only do we know that, but also knew when

105
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:18,067
we dropped this altitude we showed that

106
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,133
this angle has to be congruent to that angle,

107
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,400
and their measures have to add up to 60.

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,267
So if two things are the same, they add up to 60.

109
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:26,200
this is going to be 30 degrees,

110
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,000
and this is going to be 30 degrees.

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,667
so we already shown one of the interesting parts

112
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,267
of 30-60-90 triangles.

113
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,667
That if the hypotenuse. Notice, and I guess I

114
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,467
didn't point this out that by dropping this

115
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,733
altitude I've essentially split this equilateral triangle.

116
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:42,267
into two 30-60-90 triangles.

117
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:43,800
30-60-90 triangles.

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,267
and so we're already shown that if the side

119
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,800
opposite the 90 degree side is x.

120
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,133
That the side opposite the 30 side is going to be

121
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:54,467
x/2. That's what we showed right over here.

122
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:57,067
Now we just have to come up with a third side,

123
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,733
the side that is opposite the 60 degree side.

124
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,867
the side opposite the 60 degree side...

125
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,133
right over there.

126
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:07,467
and lets call that length... well I'll just use

127
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:09,667
the letters we already have.

128
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:10,933
This is BD.

129
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:12,933
now we can just the Pythagorean Theorem

130
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:13,733
right here.

131
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:17,000
BD^2 + this length right over here ^2

132
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,600
+ (x/2)^2 is going to be equal to the

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,733
hypotenuse squared.

134
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:26,933
so we get BD... BD^2 + (x/2)^2

135
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:28,467
this is just straight of the Pythagorean Theorem.

136
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:32,133
+ (x/2)^2 is going to this hypotenuse ^2

137
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,133
it's going to equal x^2

138
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,333
and just to be clear... I'm looking at this

139
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,333
triangle right here...

140
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,733
I'm looking at this triangle over here in the right.

141
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,667
and I'm just applying the Pythagorean Theorem.

142
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:43,800
this side ^2 + this side ^2 is going to equal

143
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,467
the hypotenuse ^2.

144
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,667
The lets solve now for BD

145
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:54,467
you get BD^2 + (x^2)/4... (x^2/4)

146
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:57,800
is equal to x^2... is equal to x^2.

147
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,400
You would view this as (4x^2)/4 that's the same

148
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,733
obviously it's x^2.

149
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:05,000
And then if we subtract 1... if you subtract

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,313
(1/4)x^2 from both sides or (x^2)/4

151
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:09,338
from both sides. you get

152
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:12,267
BD^2 =

153
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:15,667
4x^2/4 - x^2/4 is going to be.

154
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,400
3x^2/4

155
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,667
so its going to be 3x^2/4

156
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,933
take the principle root of both sides.

157
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:28,333
you get BD is equal to... is equal to

158
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:34,067
square root(3 times x)... times x

159
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:36,267
the principle of 3 is the square root of 3

160
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:38,133
the principle root of x^2 is just x

161
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:41,200
over the principle root of 4 which is 2

162
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,200
and BD is a side opposite the 60 degree side

163
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,600
so we're done, if this hypotenuse is x,

164
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,733
the side opposite the 30 side is going to be

165
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,267
x/2

166
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:52,000
and the side opposite the 60 degree side

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,867
is going to be the

168
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:57,267
square root of (3x/2)

169
00:06:57,267 --> 99:59:59,999
depending on how you want to view it.
