1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,850
Where we left off in the last
video, we saw that things were

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,540
already starting to get ugly.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,687
As early as October of 1789,
we saw the Women's March,

4
00:00:10,687 --> 00:00:14,586
where there were these suspicions
that the royals were hoarding the grain.

5
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:18,186
So they marched to Versailles,
and they essentially stormed Versailles,

6
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:22,822
and forced the royals, 
forced Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette

7
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,460
to move back to Paris.

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,710
Then things continued to be tense.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,030
There were uprisings.

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,260
The king didn't know
what to do.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,270
He obviously didn't like
the situation.

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,020
People became more and more
suspicious of the king.

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,116
Nobles were leaving the country.
They were emigrating out of France.

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,720
The King and Queen themselves
started to get paranoid that,

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,860
"Gee, you know, maybe people have
even more radical notions

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,660
than a constitutional monarchy.

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,200
Maybe we ourselves
should escape.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,604
So then we saw in 1791â€“

19
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:56,900
(And let me write this all 
down in a timeline.)

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,365
We're now in 1791.

21
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:01,000
And this is review of
the last video.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,135
June, we saw the royals
try to escape.

23
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:09,070
Writing: Royals try to escape.

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,280
But they're captured in Varennes,
and they're sent back

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,470
to Paris to essentially
to be in house

26
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,170
arrest in the Tuileries.

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,375
This is the building
right here, it

28
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,400
doesn't exist anymore.

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,380
But if you go to Paris and if
you visit the Louvre, you'll

30
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,660
see the Louvre opens across
the street into

31
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,520
the Tuileries Garden.

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,410
And this is where that
building used to be.

33
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:36,070
So the royals end up in house
arrest at the Tuileries.

34
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,220
This was in June.

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:45,230
Then, in July in 1791, once
again, all review from the

36
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,340
last video.

37
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,740
People said, hey they tried to
escape, that's equivalent to

38
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,060
abdication of the throne.

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,880
They don't even want to be our
king and queen and we don't

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,840
need kings and queens
to begin with.

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,780
So the most radical elements,
the most radical leftist

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:05,140
elements, in particular the
Jacobins, they started getting

43
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:11,115
petitions in the Champ-de-Mars
to essentially get people to

44
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:12,760
say, we don't need a
royalty anymore.

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,860
We just need a republic.

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,550
We need a state without
kings and queens.

47
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,610
But then, the National Assembly
sent in some troops.

48
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,490
Things got ugly.

49
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,630
Rocks were thrown, shots were
fired, 50 people died.

50
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,495
And you have the Champ-de-Mars
Massacre.

51
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:37,260
So then you have the Champ-de-Mars Massacre.

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,840
So things are really,
really heating up.

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,730
And then we saw at the end of
1791, to make things even

54
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,070
worse, we're not even
at the end.

55
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:58,530
In August, we had the
Declaration of Pillnitz, which

56
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,740
we saw was the rulers of Austria
and Prussia saying

57
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,570
that they don't like
what's happening to

58
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,250
the royals in France.

59
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,330
And for obvious reasons.

60
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:14,020
Well one, Leopold II was the
brother of Marie-Antoinette.

61
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,000
But even more profound, they
didn't like this notion of

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,150
people rising up against
royalty.

63
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,010
That might give people in their
own empires, or in their

64
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,460
own countries ideas about
what to do with them.

65
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,220
So even though this might have
not been taken seriously, this

66
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,920
was just a declaration
by these guys.

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,440
This made people in France
even more paranoid.

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,580
Now, while all of this was
happening, you might have

69
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,990
remembered the Tennis Court
Oath that occurred

70
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,800
several years ago.

71
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,320
Where they said we promise
to create a constitution.

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,660
And so a constitution
does get created.

73
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,880
So in 1791, the National
Assembly, or the constituent

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:04:01,010
assembly, actually does create
a constitution of 1791, which

75
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,820
establishes France as a
constitutional monarchy.

76
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,480
So they're saying, yeah, we'll
still have a king.

77
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,870
But it'll be more of
a figure head.

78
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,910
Not necessarily someone
who can create laws.

79
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,050
The National Assembly will
be responsible for that.

80
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,410
The king will get a few
abilities to veto legislation

81
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:20,920
and whatnot.

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,795
But most of their powers
are removed.

83
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,810
So this was a constitutional
monarchy.

84
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:35,990
constitutional monarchy

85
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,400
And it's really along the lines
of what was already

86
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,360
going on in Great Britain.

87
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,610
But this, on some levels, it's
a major achievement.

88
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,610
They had that oath to create
a constitution.

89
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,300
But on a whole other level,
things are getting so ugly in

90
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,800
France, and in particular,
in Paris.

91
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,330
The Revolution was really
focused on what was going on

92
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,970
in Paris and Versailles.

93
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,370
Things were getting so ugly that
this is the starting to

94
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,190
become a sideshow.

95
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,430
And to some degree, the
revolutionaries have gone

96
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,690
beyond wanting just a
constitutional monarchy.

97
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,930
They're starting to think about
wanting a republic.

98
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,530
We saw that during the
Champ-de-Mars Massacre.

99
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,470
People started signing
signatures to

100
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,240
actually have a republic.

101
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,820
And then were fired on, which
probably makes them want to

102
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,020
have a republic even more.

103
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,660
Now the other thing you might
remember from the very first

104
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,620
video, is the thing that really
precipitated this whole

105
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,460
Revolution.

106
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,750
Or at least in my mind, one
of the main things that

107
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,180
precipitated this whole
Revolution is

108
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,345
that France was broke.

109
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:37,730
And people are going hungry.

110
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,950
This is happening the whole
time while all these

111
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,800
politicians and revolutionaries
and royalties

112
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,240
are moving around and
trying to kind of

113
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,040
strategize their position.

114
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,110
No one has solved
either of these

115
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,020
problems the entire time.

116
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,460
There is no money in France.

117
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,740
There is a famine, people
are going hungry.

118
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,010
And so pretty much everyone,
whether you look at Louis XVI,

119
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,660
let me look at him again, it's
always nice to remember what

120
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,420
he looked like.

121
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,340
Whether you're talking about
Louis XVI, who's now in house

122
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,480
arrest. Or whether you're
talking about many of the

123
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,040
revolutionaries, everyone starts
to say, gee, how can we

124
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,890
solve this problem?

125
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,500
People are going to throw us
out if we don't solve this

126
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,470
problem of hunger
and being broke.

127
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,500
So as you'll see in history many
times, the best solution

128
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,240
for that, or the perceived
best solution,

129
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,620
is to start a war.

130
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,790
So they declare war
on Austria.

131
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,380
And if you think about it from
Louis XVI's point of view, he

132
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,660
thought of it as kind of
a win-win situation.

133
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,530
If the war is successful, and he
kind of through his weight

134
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,450
behind the war.

135
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,480
And this happened-- let me
write down the dates.

136
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,640
That always helps me frame
where it happens.

137
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,110
So this was kind of ending 1791,
and then war is declared

138
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,860
in April, this is now 1792.

139
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,670
And then this, right
here, is in April.

140
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,700
And if you think about it,
this was a win-win, or at

141
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,120
least from Louis XVI's point
of view, it was a win-win.

142
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,630
If they did will well in the
war, it might make him more

143
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,380
popular, might make
him stronger.

144
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,890
They might be able to plunder
the wealth of other countries

145
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:18,000
to help to build France's
coffer.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,260
If the war goes badly and France
loses, then what's

147
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,860
going to happen?

148
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,110
Then you're going to have
Austria and probably the other

149
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,940
people you're at war with.

150
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,840
We'll see very quickly, France
is going to be at war with

151
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,580
most of the powers of Europe.

152
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,890
But if you lose the war, these
powers, which are controlled

153
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,160
by monarchs, they're going to
essentially get rid of the

154
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,640
revolutionaries and probably put
Louis XVI back in power.

155
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,220
So from Louis XVI's point of
view, it was a good idea.

156
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,380
And for a lot of the
revolutionaries, they wanted

157
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,570
to solve these two problems. So
they said, hey yeah, that

158
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,630
would be good if we could
plunder other countries.

159
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,710
If we could steal grain from
other countries to make at

160
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,310
least the French less hungry.

161
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,390
And maybe we can spread
the Revolution.

162
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,510
We can topple all of
these other kings.

163
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,225
This won't just be a French
Revolution, this will be an

164
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:05,210
all of Europe Revolution.

165
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,120
So they declared
war on Austria.

166
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,150
Very quickly, they tried
to attack the Austrian

167
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,140
Netherlands, which was
kind of disjoint

168
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,410
from the rest of Austria.

169
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,240
So they attacked right there
into the Austrian Netherlands.

170
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,230
Although they got kind
of bogged down there.

171
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,200
It wasn't as successful as
they thought it would be.

172
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,310
And Prussia, which as you might
remember, participated

173
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,470
in the Declaration of Pillnitz,
decided to enter the

174
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,830
war on the side of Austria.

175
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,289
So Prussia attacks and at first,
it's pretty, pretty

176
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:38,850
successful.

177
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,679
It's able to make some
headway into France.

178
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,650
And then the general in charge
of the Prussian army, the Duke

179
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:54,110
of Brunswick, he makes the
Brunswick Manifesto.

180
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,360
Let me write that down.

181
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,110
Brunswick Manifesto

182
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,020
Which is essentially just like
the Declaration of Pillnitz,

183
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,500
but it has a lot more
teeth behind it now.

184
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,960
Because this dude, the Duke of
Brunswick, he's actually, he's

185
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,820
got an army invading France.

186
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,320
And he declares, his manifesto
is saying, I intend to

187
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,810
overthrow this whole
revolutionary government.

188
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,710
And I intend to install
the King again.

189
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,195
Install the King

190
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,020
All of this happened
in April of 1792.

191
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,440
Declare war on Austria seemed
like a win-win for the King.

192
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,760
The revolutionaries wanted to
spread the Revolution and

193
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,250
plunder other countries.

194
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,640
And then immediately, Prussia
jumps in, starts attacking

195
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,790
France, and says we're going
to install the King.

196
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,640
So you could imagine, this is
making the revolutionaries

197
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,970
even more paranoid about
what the King is up to.

198
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,920
They think that the King has
some type of secret deal with

199
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,100
the Prussians, or with the other
enemies that they're

200
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,240
going up against. So in August
of 1792, it's only a few

201
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,090
months later, four or
five months later.

202
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,980
In August of 1792, you
essentially had

203
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,420
the Commune of Paris.

204
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,790
And when I say the Commune
of Paris, it's really the

205
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,590
government of Paris
at this time.

206
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,140
And it's been taken over by
even more revolutionary

207
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,650
people, mainly Jacobins.

208
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,190
And they storm where the royal
family is staying, at the

209
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:31,550
Tuileries, which is that
building right here.

210
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,950
And this painting right here
is a depiction of the

211
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,930
revolutionaries, mainly
Jacobins, who are actually

212
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,200
storming the Tuileries.

213
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,600
And they imprison Louis XVI
and Marie-Antoinette.

214
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,790
Because they're like, hey the
Prussians have an army, and

215
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,630
they've already declared the
intention to install the King.

216
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,090
We're going to imprison the
King because we don't know

217
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,740
what he's up do.

218
00:10:51,740 --> 00:11:04,742
So they imprison-- my spelling--
imprison Louis XIV

219
00:11:04,742 --> 00:11:07,480
and Marie-Antoinette.

220
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,380
And they're also able to do some
machinations within the

221
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,000
actual National Assembly.

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,970
And there's actually a rump
session of the National

223
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,800
Assembly, which means
that a lot of the

224
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,170
opponents weren't there.

225
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,720
So it was a session where it was
mainly the leftists, the

226
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,100
radicals, the Jacobins
were there.

227
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:31,200
And so in August at that rump
session, the assembly declares

228
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,450
a republic.

229
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,630
Which is equivalent to
saying that Louis XVI

230
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,930
is no longer King.

231
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,530
And this nation we have, or this
country we now have, will

232
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,510
never have a king.

233
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,590
It is now a republic.

234
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,990
It as a government
without a king.

235
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,450
And while all of this was
happening, you have these

236
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,640
gangs kind of going around
the region around Paris.

237
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,240
And they're just trying and
killing people that just seem

238
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,820
to be suspicious, seem to be
allied in some way with the

239
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,650
nobility or with the King, or
in someway a royalist. They

240
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,340
want eventually for the
monarchy to come back.

241
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:13,400
And in those riots, in those
arbitrary executions and

242
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,020
killings, they actually ended up
killing over 1,400 people.

243
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,910
1,400 executed at this time.

244
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,880
So you can see, things
are getting uglier

245
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,945
and uglier and uglier.

246
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:24,220
The King is imprisoned.

247
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,430
And you're going to see that
he's not going to be

248
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,140
imprisoned long.

249
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,910
But it's not going to
end well for him.

250
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,030
And essentially, the
revolutionaries have said

251
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,590
France is now a republic.

252
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,110
All while they're at war with
two major powers, with the

253
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,920
Austrians and the Prussians.

254
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:45,950
Now they are eventually able
to hold off, and when I say

255
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,740
they, I'm talking about
armies of France.

256
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,890
They are eventually able
to hold off the

257
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,590
invading Prussian army.

258
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,230
They call it the Stalemate of
Valmy, not clear who won.

259
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,960
The Prussians weren't that
eager to go into France.

260
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,190
So they didn't push too hard or
send too many more troops.

261
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,480
So for at least temporarily,
the external threat was

262
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,130
diffused, if you want
to call it that way.

263
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,270
And so the National Assembly
went forth and said-- they got

264
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,430
rid of-- I mean, they had
already declared a republic.

265
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,100
But they went even further.

266
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:24,890
So this is now, we're in
September of 1792.

267
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,480
You had the Stalemate
at Valmy.

268
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:34,970
Stalemate at Valmy

269
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,700
And then the National Assembly,
or the National

270
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,010
Convention said, hey, we're
going to create a new

271
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,780
constitution.

272
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,440
So that constitution of 1791
did not last too long.

273
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,900
It lasted about a year.

274
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,840
So a new constitution.

275
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,740
The intent to create
a new constitution.

276
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,480
Now, while all that's said,
this bloodshed that we saw

277
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,740
after they imprisoned Louis XVI,
these kind of riots in

278
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,320
Paris and these arbitrary
killings, this is just a

279
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,550
foreshadowing of much worse
that's going to come in the

280
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,410
very next year.

281
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:16,940
By 1793-- let me write this
down in a bloody color.

282
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,990
So 1793 we're in now.

283
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,760
So the National Assembly, the
first thing that they do, or

284
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,650
maybe I should say even
more particular.

285
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:35,480
In January of 1793, remember
they've already deposed the

286
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,080
King, they have him imprisoned,
they're at war

287
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,410
with these other countries that
have stated the intention

288
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,460
to put the King back
into power.

289
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:51,210
So the first thing they do is
they execute Louis XVI.

290
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,950
And this is a picture
of the execution.

291
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,820
He was guillotined.

292
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,810
And this right here is
Doctor Guillotine.

293
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,160
And it was actually invented,
this right here is the

294
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:08,430
guillotine, and it was actually
invented as a more

295
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,690
humane way to kill people.

296
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,310
At the time they said, when we
kill people, it's not for them

297
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,750
to feel pain, it's more
to just kill them.

298
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,270
So we'll use this very humane
instrument called the

299
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:20,800
guillotine.

300
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,710
Where you use a blade
to very quickly chop

301
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,720
off someone's head.

302
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,010
And it was invented by this
physician right here.

303
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,430
But, the one of the first
important people they got to

304
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,560
try it out was Louis XVI,
guillotined in January.

305
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,970
And then in February, remember
people are still going hungry,

306
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,920
they're still eager to spread
the Revolution, they still

307
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,400
want to plunder other
countries.

308
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,840
So in February, the National
Assembly, or the National

309
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,650
Council, the revolutionary
government, declares war on

310
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,905
Britain and the Dutch
Republic.

311
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:06,530
and Dutch

312
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,570
You don't know who this
is, I'm going to

313
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,200
tell you in a second.

314
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,145
And Dutch Republic.

315
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:15,730
Now you're probably saying, gee,
how does France, this one

316
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,930
country right here, how is it
able to have war against

317
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,460
Austria, Prussia?

318
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,740
Now declaring war against the
Dutch and Great Britain.

319
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,150
And actually the month before,
Spain and Portugal had

320
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,770
declared war, had kind of
jumped in on the side of

321
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,540
Austria and Prussia.

322
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,930
So how does this one country,
France, how does this one

323
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,500
revolutionary government fend
itself off against the armies

324
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,380
of so many nations?

325
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,250
And the answer to that is that
the revolutionary government

326
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,360
declared in February what they
called the Levee en Masse.

327
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,965
And I'm not French, so I'm
saying it wrong, I'm sure.

328
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:54,070
the Levee en Masse

329
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,160
Which was essentially the first
version of what we now

330
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,450
call the draft.

331
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,620
And they were able to actually,
they actually said

332
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,190
every able-bodied young man in
France who was unmarried will

333
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,710
now be in the army.

334
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,160
And so they were able to
immediately raise several

335
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,400
hundreds of thousands
of soldiers.

336
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,869
And actually within a couple
of years, there's several

337
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:18,410
accounts of it, but it might
have been over one million

338
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,550
plus soldiers.

339
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,220
Which is very different from
how many of these other

340
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,730
kingdoms would raise
their armies.

341
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,819
They would pay salaries to
professional soldiers.

342
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,410
So these at the time were
smaller armies than what

343
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,490
France was able to muster up
through the revolutionary

344
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,680
government saying look, this is
a government for the people

345
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,560
by the people.

346
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,180
So now you're not fighting
for a king, you're

347
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,860
fighting for yourself.

348
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,200
You're fighting for your own
representation so you don't

349
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,100
get so subjected by
foreign kings.

350
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,050
So everyone jumped in
the war effort.

351
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,220
So they essentially had the
largest army in Europe.

352
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,510
But I keep repeating, all of
this was in the context of

353
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,440
unrest throughout France.

354
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,640
There were royalists out there
wanting to be counter

355
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,500
revolutionaries.

356
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,780
People were going hungry.

357
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:08,990
So to kind of, I guess, clamp
down on things, in April of

358
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:16,580
1792, the National Assembly
created the Committee of

359
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,020
Public Safety, which sounds like
a very nice committee.

360
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:26,020
The Committee of Public Safety.

361
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,920
And they essentially become the
default government, or we

362
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:35,100
can say the de facto
government.

363
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,640
And it was put in the control of
this nice looking gentleman

364
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,610
right here, Maximilien
Robespierre.

365
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,390
Seems like a very civilized
fellow.

366
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:50,840
Maximilien Robespierre

367
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,530
But really what the Committee
of Public Safety was good at

368
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,510
was being hugely political,
hugely paranoid.

369
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,010
And under especially Maximilien
Robespierre's

370
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,460
control, who was especially
paranoid, anyone-- if they

371
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,290
just caught a whiff of someone
being not radical enough, or

372
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,360
maybe too radical, or someone I
just didn't like, or someone

373
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,760
who might help depose me--
they just started

374
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,190
guillotining people.

375
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,695
So this is really the start
of the Reign of Terror.

376
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:27,110
the Reign of Terror

377
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:33,910
So roughly over the next year,
on the order of, give or take,

378
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,960
16,000 people are guillotined.

379
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,350
They go to Doctor Guillotine's
humane invention.

380
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,520
And they are only estimates
of this.

381
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,750
There wasn't good accounting
of this.

382
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,100
But it's believed that as many
as 40,000 people were

383
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,330
summarily executed.

384
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,550
Which essentially means you're
guilty of this, I know you're

385
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,260
guilty, hey, you over there with
a gun, please shoot this

386
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,230
person for me.

387
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,190
So this was an extremely
bloody time.

388
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,150
And just so you imagine, most
of this was occurring in and

389
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,060
around Paris.

390
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,950
So all of a sudden, in one
little city, it was a major

391
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,940
city, but you have tens of
thousands of people being

392
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,480
massacred, just if this guy, or
the people who are plotting

393
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,640
with this guy, or the people who
are plotting against this

394
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,650
guy, thought or caught a whiff
of you being not completely

395
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,950
loyal to the Revolution.

396
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,220
Now eventually, people
eventually got suspicious of

397
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,540
Maximilien Robespierre.

398
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,950
They're saying, hey, all your
paranoia is hurting the

399
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,340
Revolution more than
helping it.

400
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,720
So then in the Thermidorian
Reaction-- it sounds like it's

401
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,580
some type of a refrigerator
or heater.

402
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:44,510
Thermidorian Reaction

403
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:54,330
Now this right here, this
is in July of 1794.

404
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,900
And it's called the Thermidorian
Reaction, and I

405
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,830
might do a whole video
on this, because the

406
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,830
revolutionary government,
they actually

407
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,220
created a new calendar.

408
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,140
Where they renamed the month
Thermidor, which was

409
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,490
essentially July, it was
shifted a little bit.

410
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,660
And actually, it changed the
number of hours in the day.

411
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,040
They would have 10 hours a day,
100 minutes an hour, 100

412
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,010
seconds a minute.

413
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,800
They would have three 10-day
weeks per month.

414
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,980
So they had this
whole calendar.

415
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,100
But Thermidor was the
month of July.

416
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,430
So it was really the July
Reaction, where people got

417
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,420
sick of Maximilien
Robespierre.

418
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,190
So in 1794, July 1794, he too.

419
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,120
So what goes around
comes around.

420
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,630
So this right here, this
is 1794, July.

421
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,720
This right here is this
nice-looking gentleman, and

422
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,330
he, too, gets guillotined.

423
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,010
Now, there's two other things
that I want to point out.

424
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,160
I'll take a few steps
back into 1793.

425
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,290
Just as a maybe a bit
of a footnote.

426
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:59,170
We saw that in January Louis XVI
was executed for, I guess,

427
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,530
depending on your opinion
whether it was a

428
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,730
good or a bad thing.

429
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:08,640
In October Marie-Antoinette
also executed.

430
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,330
Marie-Antoinette

431
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,800
So this is in 1793,
also executed.

432
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,670
So nine months after her
husband, executed.

433
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,520
And then as one kind of small
footnote at this point, as you

434
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,890
can imagine, all of France was
in unrest at the time.

435
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,930
And then in 1793, there
was a revolt.

436
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,730
This was in July of 1793.

437
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,450
So it's a year before the end of
the Reign of Terror, really

438
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,460
during the Reign of Terror.

439
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,170
In the port of Toulon, there
was a revolt against the

440
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,560
revolutionary government.

441
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,160
And it was put down, mainly with
the help of an aspiring

442
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,070
artillery captain.

443
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,710
An artillery captain is someone
who's essentially in

444
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,220
charge of the cannons.

445
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,670
And that artillery captain, who
was able to help put down

446
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,970
that revolt, and get a lot of,
I guess, cred with the

447
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,640
revolutionary government, his
name was-- I need to write it

448
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,750
someplace nice and new, and this
is for foreshadowing of

449
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:15,550
the next video-- so in July
of 1793, in Toulon, a new

450
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,740
artillery captain started to
look like he really knows what

451
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,640
he's doing.

452
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,400
And his name is Napoleon
Bonaparte.

453
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,670
And he's going to have a lot
to do with the next video.
