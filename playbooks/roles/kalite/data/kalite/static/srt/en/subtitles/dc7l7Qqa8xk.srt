1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,180
What we're going to do in
this video is think

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,660
about two wave sources.

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,890
But one of them is going to be
stationary and the other one

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,000
is going to be moving.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,890
And just to have a concrete
number, it's moving at 5

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,570
meters per second
to the right.

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,960
And what we're going to think
about is where are the crests

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,280
of the wave that it's
been releasing for

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,340
the last 3 or 4 seconds?

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,565
So let's say that in both cases,
they are releasing a

12
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:30,860
wave. So the velocity of the
wave is going to be 10 meters

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,450
per second.

14
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,420
You could visualize this, maybe,
as a sound wave, but

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,120
sound and air move much, much,
much, much faster than 10

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,050
meters per second.

17
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,890
But this'll make the
math work out easy.

18
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,040
Especially relative to this
guy, who is moving to the

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,220
right at 5 meters per second.

20
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,760
And that's the whole point, to
give you the intuition and

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,330
make the math really
simple here.

22
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,400
And both of these guys are going
to be, the wave that

23
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,040
they're emitting is at
10 meters per second.

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,110
And the period of the wave
is going to be at

25
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,370
1 second per cycle.

26
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,940
And if the period is 1 second
per cycle, you take the

27
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,430
inverse of that-- the frequency
of the source, I

28
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,570
guess you could call it, of the
wave, as being emitted is

29
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,710
going to be the inverse
of this.

30
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,100
The inverse of 1 is just 1.

31
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,680
But 1 cycle per second.

32
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,910
If it takes a second for a
cycle, it's also in 1 second,

33
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,180
you're also going to see 1
cycle, so 1 cycle per second.

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,740
So let's think about what's
happening here.

35
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,250
So let's think about where--
let's say it emitted a crest

36
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,810
of it's a wave exactly
1 second ago.

37
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,570
Where is that crest
going to be now?

38
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,750
Let's think about the stationary
character.

39
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,630
Well, this guy emitted
a crest 1 second ago.

40
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,850
It's moving outward.

41
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,760
So this is outward.

42
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,710
It's movie outward radially.

43
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,660
We need to give a direction if
I'm giving a vector quantity.

44
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,410
So it's moving outward at
10 meters per second.

45
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,260
So if it emitted it 1 second
ago, it's going to be 10

46
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,480
meters radially outward
from the source.

47
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,380
So maybe that is right
over there.

48
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,090
Well, let me draw it a little
bit neater like that.

49
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,420
   

50
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,880
So that's where that
crest will be.

51
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,730
Now what about this guy?

52
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,940
Where's the crest that this
guy emitted 1 second ago?

53
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,960
You might want to just draw a
radius 10 meters around this

54
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,460
guy as well.

55
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,070
But he wasn't here
1 second ago.

56
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,910
He was 5 meters to the left.

57
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,390
Remember, he's moving 5 meters
per second to the right.

58
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,810
1 second ago, he was 5
meters to the left.

59
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,680
So maybe that places him
right over there.

60
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,300
So the crest that he emitted 1
second ago isn't going to be

61
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,150
10 meters from this guy.

62
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,440
It's going to be 10
meters radially

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,690
outward from that guy.

64
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:48,670
   

65
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,090
So this is where he is now.

66
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,250
That's where he was 1 second
ago, where he emitted this

67
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,600
crest that has now traveled
10 meters away.

68
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,520
This a little inexact,
so I could draw it a

69
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,510
little bit like that.

70
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,360
This is 5 meters.

71
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,700
That's 10 meters away.

72
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,520
But you get the general idea.

73
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,350
Now let's keep going.

74
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,760
Let's think about the crest
that both of these guys

75
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,130
emitted 2 seconds ago.

76
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,700
This guy's been stationary
the whole time.

77
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,430
If he emitted it 2 seconds
ago, it's traveling at 10

78
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,860
meters per second.

79
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,580
It's going to be 20 meters
radially outward from the

80
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,030
center, from the source.

81
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,750
So it will look something
like that.

82
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,810
I'm just drawing the
crest of the waves.

83
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,335
If you think of water, a pebble
being dropped into the

84
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:38,010
pond, these are just the high
points on the wave that

85
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,240
spreads radially outward from
where the pebble was dropped.

86
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,510
Now this guy, once again, you
can't just draw a circle

87
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,520
around this because he wasn't
here 2 seconds ago.

88
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,770
He was right here.

89
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,650
He was right here
2 seconds ago.

90
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,870
1 second ago, he was 5
meters to the left.

91
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,990
A second before that, he was
5 meters more to the left.

92
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,060
So that wave that he emitted
then is going to be 20 meters

93
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,965
radially outward from
this point.

94
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:07,980
   

95
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,595
So the center isn't going
to be that or that.

96
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:14,055
It's going to be that point
where he was 2 seconds ago.

97
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:19,200
   

98
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,630
So what about the crest that
either of these of sources

99
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,020
emitted 3 seconds ago?

100
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,590
Well, it would be 30 meters
radially outward, so another

101
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,000
10 meters from the last one.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,110
So it will be out here.

103
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,920
It will be out there
just like that.

104
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,840
This guy has been stationary
the whole time.

105
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,250
But what about this guy?

106
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,310
He wasn't here 3 seconds ago.

107
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,980
He was here.

108
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,160
Right?

109
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,050
1 second ago, here.

110
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,060
2 seconds ago, there.

111
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,350
3 seconds ago, there.

112
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,000
So we're going to be
30 meters radially

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,320
outward from this point.

114
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,170
So once again, I can just copy
and paste this right here.

115
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,720
   

116
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,355
And it should be centered
around that point.

117
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:08,590
   

118
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,470
Now, let's think a little bit
about what the perceived

119
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,750
frequency of this wave would be
for a couple of observers.

120
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,880
So we could put an observer
here, really

121
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,930
anywhere around this guy.

122
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,770
We could put an observer
right here.

123
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,560
And then we could put another
observer right here.

124
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,550
Now, what's this guy
going to perceive?

125
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,670
Well, every second he's getting
a pulse-- well,

126
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,700
there's a couple of things
to think about.

127
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,240
First of all, what is the
wavelength of, at least this

128
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,580
wave right here.

129
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,520
Well, every second, he's
emitting a pulse.

130
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,460
So, a second ago, the pulses
out there would

131
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,430
have traveled 10 meters.

132
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,060
And then he emits
another pulse.

133
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,400
So the pulses are going to be 1
second apart, but since they

134
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,720
traveled 10 meters in that 1
second, they are also going to

135
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,340
be 10 meters apart.

136
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,740
So the wavelength,
in this case, is

137
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,000
going to be 10 meters.

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,340
The distance between these
crests are 10 meters.

139
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,600
Now what about this situation
right here?

140
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,640
It depends on what side, whether
the source is coming

141
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,080
towards you or whether it's
going away from you.

142
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,990
That's the situation
with this guy.

143
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,450
When it's moving towards you,
it's emitting a pulse-- so

144
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,550
let's say it emitted a pulse
right here-- and then, it

145
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,750
moves 5 meters to
the right before

146
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,290
emitting the next pulse.

147
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,920
So instead of them being 10
meters apart, in this case,

148
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,980
this guy has closed
the distance by

149
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,550
5 meters over here.

150
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,220
So these pulses are only going
to be 5 meters apart.

151
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,700
So over here, the wavelength
is only 5 meters.

152
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,730
You can see it visually.

153
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,340
This distance right here is
half of this distance.

154
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,530
These are 5 meters apart.

155
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,500
And on the left-hand side, if
you're on the side of the

156
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,480
source that the source is moving
away from, it would be

157
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,970
10 meters, but every second the
source is also moving 5

158
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,760
more meters away from you.

159
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,940
So this perceived wavelength
right here is

160
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,890
going to be 15 meters.

161
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,870
And we can see it visually.

162
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,980
That's the whole reason why
I drew it this way.

163
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,360
Now what's going to
be the perceived

164
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
frequencies for this?

165
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,530
Well, this guy has one crest
passing him right now.

166
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,270
It's going to take exactly 1
second for the next crest to

167
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,350
get to him because
it's traveling at

168
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,580
10 meters per second.

169
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:24,890
So he is going to perceive 1
crest, or 1 cycle per second,

170
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,080
or a frequency of 1 hertz,
which makes sense.

171
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,860
This is stationary.

172
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,880
They're both stationary relative
to each other.

173
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,590
And we're also talking about
classical physics.

174
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,390
We're not getting to relativity
and all that.

175
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,940
But the observed frequency is
the exact frequency that was

176
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,840
emitted by this guy
right there.

177
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,770
Now what about this situation?

178
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,660
Each of these crests are 5
meters apart for this guy.

179
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,230
If you imagined that this was
some type of a train coming

180
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,950
towards this guy, each of these
crests are only 5 meters

181
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,450
apart, but they're traveling
at 10 meters per second.

182
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,020
So how many crests are you
going to see in a second?

183
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,120
Well, you're going to
see two of them.

184
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,956
This one's going to take 1/2 a
second to return you, and then

185
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:06,230
in the next 1/2 a second, this
one's going to get to you.

186
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,300
Or you could say this one takes
1/2 second to reach you,

187
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,300
and this is going to take
1 second to reach you.

188
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,150
So you're going to see two.

189
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,230
So there's two ways
to think of it.

190
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,850
You could say your period in
this situation is 1/2 of a

191
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,500
second per cycle.

192
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,513
Or you could invert it and you
could say that the frequency--

193
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:26,140
I mean we could put the observed
frequency-- is going

194
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,810
to be 2 cycles per second.

195
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,840
And already notice, this guy's
experiencing a higher

196
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,760
frequency then this guy over
here, because these wave

197
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,520
fronts or these crests are
just passing by him more

198
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,000
frequently.

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,020
Because this guy is moving in
the same direction as this

200
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,770
guy, they are closer together.

201
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,470
Now this guy's going to
experience the opposite thing.

202
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,450
Let's say that this crest
is just passing him by.

203
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,890
How long will it take for
the next crest to

204
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,800
cover that 15 meters?

205
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,520
Well, they're going at
10 meters per second.

206
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:03,730
It's going to be 1.5 seconds per
crest. That's going to be

207
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,540
the observed period
for this guy.

208
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,230
You have to take the inverse of
that-- that's 1.5 is 3/2,

209
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,890
that's 2/3 of a --or you could
say crest or 2/3 of a cycle

210
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,150
per second.

211
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,300
So when the source is moving
away from this observer, the

212
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,270
frequency, or the perceived
frequency, is the lower than

213
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,520
the frequency of the actual
emitted wave. When the source

214
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,570
is moving towards the
observer, the

215
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,840
frequency is higher.

216
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,810
This might seem some like some
type of bizarre thing but

217
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,770
you've experienced it before.

218
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,230
It's called the Doppler
effect, which you've

219
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,360
probably heard of.

220
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,420
And that's exactly what you
experience when you sit at,

221
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,760
maybe, a train crossing.

222
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,410
Be careful not to
sit too close.

223
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,990
And as a train is approaching
you, you noticed-- say it has

224
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,320
its horn going on.

225
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,990
It'd be very high-pitched.

226
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,250
And then right when it passes
you, and it starts moving away

227
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,660
from you, it has a
much lower pitch.

228
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,680
And that perceived pitch, that's
your brain and your

229
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,660
ears' way of sensing
frequency.

230
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,800
So when the train is coming
toward you, it's a high pitch,

231
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,930
high frequency.

232
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,080
When it's going away from you,
low pitch, low frequency.

233
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,310
And hopefully, drawing it out
this way gives you a visual

234
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,710
understanding of why that is;
why these points on the cycle,

235
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,290
or these crests, are closer
together when it's moving in

236
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,660
your direction then when they're
farther apart-- when

237
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,020
it's moving away from you.

238
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,750
In the next video, we'll do
these with more abstract

239
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,670
numbers so we can actually
figure out generalized

240
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,040
formulas for relating the
observed frequency with the

241
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,680
emitted frequency.

242
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,000
