1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:04,667
We're now ready for Newton's third law of motion.

2
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:06,667
And something - once again, you've probably heard

3
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:08,133
you know, that people talk about

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,600
but in this video I want to make sure that

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,800
we really understand what Newton's talking about

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,333
when he says - and this is a translation

7
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,667
of the Latin version of it -

8
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,800
To every action - just to be clear,

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,400
Newton was English, but he wrote it in Latin

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,133
because people - at the time - wrote things in Latin

11
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,600
and [Latin] was viewed as a serious language.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,133
But anyway. To every action there is always an equal

13
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:33,733
and opposite reaction; or the forces of two bodies

14
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,800
on each other are always equal and are directed in

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,733
opposite directions. So what Newton is says is that

16
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:43,400
you can't just have a force on some object

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,800
without that object having an opposite force acting

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,267
on the thing that's trying to act on it! And just to

19
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:54,200
make it clear, let's say that we have a...and we'll

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,867
talk about these examples in a second. Let's say that

21
00:00:56,867 --> 00:01:01,733
I have a...some type of block right over here, and

22
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:04,800
that I move - and I press on the block and I try to

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,133
push it forward. So this is my hand, this is

24
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:12,133
my hand, trying to, trying to press on the block,

25
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:16,400
and exert a force - a net force in that direction. So

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,533
that the block moves to the right.

27
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:21,800
Maybe we...maybe the block is sitting on some

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,000
type of ice, so it can move.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
So let's say that I have some - that doesn't look like

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,400
ice! A little more ice-like color. So the block is sitting

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,467
on, maybe some ice like that.

32
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,333
So Newton's third law is saying,

33
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,067
"Look! I can press on this block, and sure, I'll

34
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,067
exert a net force on this block, and then the net force will

35
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,462
accelerate the block, assuming the block can overcome

36
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:47,133
friction - and since it's on ice, I can do that, but

37
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:50,333
the block is going to exert an equal and opposite force

38
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,800
on me!" An equal and opposite force on me.

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,000
And for direct evidence - this is something, that might

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,133
not be so intuitive when it's said -

41
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:01,000
this equal and opposite force, but direct evidence

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,267
says that about exerting equal and opposite force is

43
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:08,733
that I can feel my hand getting compressed! I

44
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:10,267
can feel the block pushing on me. Take your hand right now

45
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:14,400
and push it against your desk, or whatever you have near

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,667
by, and you are clearly exerting a force on the desk

47
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:22,400
so let me draw - so let's say I have a desk right here

48
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
and I try to push on the desk - so once again, this is

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,600
my hand right here, pushing on the desk, if

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000
I push on the desk - and I'm actually doing this right now

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,133
as I record this video, you'll see

52
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,933
you're clearly exerting a force on the desk - if I do

53
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,733
it hard enough I might even get the desk to shake or tilt

54
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,200
a little bit - I'm actually doing that right now, but

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,667
the same time, you'll see that your hand is getting

56
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,867
compressed! The palm of your hand is being pressed

57
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:52,067
down. And that's because the desk is exerting an equal

58
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:54,933
and opposite force on you.

59
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:57,667
If it wasn't, you actually wouldn't even feel it, you

60
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,667
wouldn't even feel the pressure - it would feel -

61
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,333
your hand would be completely uncompressed.

62
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,667
Another example of that. Say you're walking

63
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:08,067
in the beach. Say you're walking on the beach. And

64
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:11,067
you have some sand right here. If you were to step

65
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:14,733
on the sand; so let's say this is your shoe - do my

66
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:18,333
best attempt to draw a shoe - so this is a shoe; if

67
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:22,133
you were to step on the sand, clearly you are exerting

68
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:25,200
a force on the sand. You are exerting a force on the

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,800
sand. The force you are exerting on the sand is

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,933
the force of your weight, the gravitational attraction

71
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:34,200
between you and the Earth. You're exerting that on

72
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,000
the sand. The sand is also - and another evidence of that

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,867
is that the sand is going to be displaced - it's going

74
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,533
to create a footprint; the sand is going to move out

75
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,067
of the way, because it's being pushed down so hard.

76
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,867
So clearly you are exerting a force on the sand.

77
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:52,467
But the sand is also exerting an equal and opposite

78
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:55,533
force on you - is also exerting an equal and opposite

79
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:59,267
force on you. And what's the evidence of that? Well,

80
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:04,267
if you believe, if you believe Newton's second law,

81
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:08,267
if you have this gravitational force on you, you should

82
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:11,533
be accelerating downwards unless there's some other

83
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,667
force that balances it out.

84
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,867
And the force that balances it out is the force that

85
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:20,533
the beach, or the sand is exerting on you upwards.

86
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:24,533
And so when you net them out, there's a zero net force

87
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,333
on you. And that's why you get to stay there; you

88
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,533
don't start accelerating down towards the center of

89
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,267
the Earth. Other examples of this. This is maybe the

90
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:36,333
most famous example of, Newton's third law, is just

91
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,267
how rockets work. When you're in a rocket, you know,

92
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,600
trying to escape the atmosphere, or maybe you're in

93
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,733
space, there's nothing to push off of, nothing to push

94
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:49,000
off of to let you accelerate. So what you do is you keep

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,533
stuff to push off in your fuel tanks. And when you

96
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:55,133
allow the proper chemical reactions or the proper

97
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:58,933
combustion to take place, what it does is it expels

98
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:04,000
gases, ultra-high velocities out the back of your rockets.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And each of those particles, you're exerting a force

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,533
on them, enough force - even though they're super small

101
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,800
masses for each of them, its super high velocities.

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,867
So they're being accelerated tremendously.

103
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:17,800
So there's an equal and opposite force on the rocket.

104
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,733
The thing is actually expelling the gas, and so that's what

105
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,800
allows a rocket to accelerate, even when there's nothing

106
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,267
in this direct vicinity to push off of. It just expels

107
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:32,600
a bunch of things, it accelerates a bunch of things

108
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,400
at a super fast rate. It exerts a force on all these

109
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,600
particles and that allows it to exert an equal and

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,133
opposite force to accelerate the rocket, ahead. And

111
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,600
another example of this is if you ever find yourself

112
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
drifting in space, and this is an actual - useful - example,

113
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,467
so that you don't end up drifting in space forever.

114
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:51,133
Let's say you don't ever want this to happen this

115
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:54,267
astronaut by some chance, he loses his connection to

116
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:57,333
this little tool arm right here, connected to the space

117
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:01,333
shuttle, and he starts drifting away. He starts drifting

118
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:06,533
away. What can that astronaut do to change the direction

119
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,467
of his motion, so that he drifts back to the space shuttle?

120
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:13,067
Well, if you look around, there's nothing to push off of.

121
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:15,133
He doesn't have any wall to push off of, and let's just

122
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,533
assume that he doesn't have any rocket jets, or anything

123
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,933
like that. What could he do? Well, the one thing he

124
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:22,590
could do, and this is for the situation when you're

125
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,467
ever drifting in space, is you should find the heaviest,

126
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:29,000
or should I say, the most massive thing on you, and we'll

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,933
explain the difference between mass and weight in a

128
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,933
future video, you should find the most massive thing

129
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:37,867
you can carry, that you can take off of you, that

130
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:40,867
you can throw, and you should throw it in a direction

131
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,467
opposite yourself. So let me put it this way. If I

132
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:46,585
throw - let's say I'm in space and I'm floating - I'll just

133
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:49,623
show - I'll just make it look like the glove of a -

134
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:57,467
so let's say this is, this is the glove of the astronaut

135
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:01,047
uh...there you go, there's his hand, that's the astronaut's

136
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,800
hand, right over here, and let's just say he finds some

137
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,038
equipment, on his - or she finds some piece of equipment

138
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,000
on them, that they can throw, they can take off of

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,667
their toolset and that they could find the most massive

140
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,301
object that they could throw. So what's going to happen

141
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:20,134
is that for some period of time while they push the

142
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:23,333
object away, they will be exerting a force on that

143
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,288
object, they will be exerting a force on that object

144
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:29,213
for some period in time, while they have contact with

145
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:32,400
the object. And that entire time, that object, while it

146
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,867
is accelerating, while the astronaut is exerting a force

147
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:38,800
on it, will be exerting an equal and opposite force on the

148
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,733
hand of the astronaut, or the astronaut itself. So the

149
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,400
object accelerates in that direction, and while the

150
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,299
astronaut is pushing, the astronaut will accelerate,

151
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:52,294
will accelerate in this direction. So what you do is you

152
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:54,400
throw in the opposite direction, and that'll allow the

153
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,333
astronaut to accelerate towards the space shuttle, and

154
00:07:57,333 --> 99:59:59,999
and hopefully, grab onto something.
