1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,367
So we've got the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1,

2
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:07,287
I guess we could call it a relationship.

3
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:12,300
And if we were to graph all the points x and y that satisfy this relationship

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,290
we get a unit circle like this.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,168
And what I'm curious about in this video is

6
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:20,592
how we can figure out the slope of the tangent line

7
00:00:20,592 --> 00:00:23,286
at any point of this unit circle.

8
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:26,435
And what immediately might be jumping out in your brain

9
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:29,762
is well, a circle defined this way, this isn't a function

10
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:33,035
it's not y explicitly defined as a function of x

11
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:37,433
for any x value you actually have 2 possible y's

12
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:40,666
that satisfy this relationship right over here.

13
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,684
So you might be tempted to maybe split this up

14
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:46,597
into two separate functions of x.

15
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:52,967
You could say y is equal to the positive square root of 1-x^2

16
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:58,923
and you could say y is equal to the negative square root of 1-x^2

17
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:01,632
take the derivatives of each of these separately

18
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:04,113
and you would be able to find the derivative

19
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:07,010
for any x, or the derivative of the slope

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,102
of the tangent line at any point.

21
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,033
But what I want to do in this video,

22
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:13,103
is literally leverage the chain rule

23
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:15,240
to take the derivative implicitly

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,369
so that I don't have to explicitly define y as a function of x either way.

25
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,033
And the way we do that is literally just apply

26
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:26,597
the derivative operator to both sides of this equation

27
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:30,167
and then apply what we know about the chain rule.

28
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:34,103
Because we're not explicitly defining y as a function of x

29
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:37,694
and explicitly getting y = f'(x)

30
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:38,833
they call this,

31
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,436
which is really just an application of the chain rule,

32
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:47,820
we call it implicit differentiation - Implicit Differentiation.

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,500
And what I want you to keep in the back of your mind

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,099
the entire time, is it is just an application of the chain rule.
