1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,490
Use the quadratic formula to
solve the equation, negative x

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,189
squared plus 8x is equal to 1.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,300
Now, in order to really use the
quadratic equation, or to

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,920
figure out what our a's, b's and
c's are, we have to have

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,110
our equation in the form, ax
squared plus bx plus c is

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,490
equal to 0.

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,110
And then, if we know our a's,
b's, and c's, we will say that

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,060
the solutions to this equation
are x is equal to negative b

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:34,480
plus or minus the square root
of b squared minus 4ac-- all

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,730
of that over 2a.

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,910
So the first thing we have to
do for this equation right

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,505
here is to put it
in this form.

14
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:42,990
And on one side of this
equation, we have a negative x

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,850
squared plus 8x, so that looks
like the first two terms. But

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,220
our constant is on
the other side.

17
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,560
So let's get the constant on the
left hand side and get a 0

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,100
here on the right hand side.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,880
So let's subtract 1 from both
sides of this equation.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,800
The left hand side of the
equation will become negative

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,010
x squared plus 8x minus 1.

22
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,460
And then the right hand
side, 1 minus 1 is 0.

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,890
Now we have it in that form.

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,725
We have ax squared
a is negative 1.

25
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:17,900
So let me write this down.
a is equal to negative 1.

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,450
a is equal to negative 1.

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,695
It's implicit there, you could
put a 1 here if you like.

28
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:26,530
A negative 1.

29
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,030
Negative x squared is the same
thing as negative 1x squared.

30
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,210
b is equal to 8.

31
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,270
So b is equal to 8, that's
the 8 right there.

32
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,535
And c is equal to negative 1.

33
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:41,380
   

34
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,500
That's the negative
1 right there.

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,390
So now we can just apply
the quadratic formula.

36
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,290
The solutions to this equation
are x is equal to negative b.

37
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,910
   

38
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:06,190
Plus or minus the square root
of b squared, of 8 squared,

39
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:12,110
minus 4ac-- let me do it in that
green color --minus 4,

40
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,430
the green is the part
of the formula.

41
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,990
The colored parts are the things
that we're substituting

42
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,620
into the formula.

43
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,300
Minus 4 times a, which is
negative 1, times negative 1,

44
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,640
times c, which is
also negative 1.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,430
   

46
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,250
And then all of that-- let me
extend the square root sign a

47
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,080
little bit further --all
of that is going to be

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,570
over 2 times a.

49
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,280
In this case a is negative 1.

50
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,130
So let's simplify this.

51
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,710
So this becomes negative 8, this
is negative 8, plus or

52
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:49,650
minus the square root
of 8 squared is 64.

53
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,700
And then you have a negative 1
times a negative 1, these just

54
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,850
cancel out just to be a 1.

55
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,370
So it's 64 minus is 4.

56
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,670
That's just that 4 over there.

57
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,050
All of that over negative 2.

58
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,790
So this is equal to negative
8 plus or minus the

59
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,740
square root of 60.

60
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,850
All of that over negative 2.

61
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,730
And let's see if we can
simplify the radical

62
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,530
expression here, the
square root of 60.

63
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,500
Let's see, 60 is equal
to 2 times 30.

64
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,620
30 is equal to 2 times 15.

65
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,310
And then 15 is 3 times 5.

66
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,500
So we do have a perfect
square here.

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,600
We do have a 2 times
2 in there.

68
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,330
It is 2 times 2 times
15, or 4 times 15.

69
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,620
So we could write, the square
root of 60 is equal to the

70
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,000
square root of 4 times the
square root of 15, right?

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,810
The square root of 4 times
the square root of 15,

72
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,850
that's what 60 is.

73
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,420
4 times 15.

74
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,300
And so this is equal to-- square
root of 4 is 2 times

75
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,700
the square of 15.

76
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,220
So we can rewrite this
expression, right here, as

77
00:03:53,220 --> 00:04:01,000
being equal to negative 8 plus
or minus 2 times the square

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,010
root of 15, all of that
over negative 2.

79
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,480
Now both of these terms right
here are divisible by either 2

80
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,180
or negative 2.

81
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,380
So let's divide it.

82
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,920
So we have negative 8 divided
by negative 2, which is

83
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,669
positive 4.

84
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:21,029
So let me write it over here.

85
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,210
Negative 8 divided by negative
2 is positive 4.

86
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,340
And then you have this
weird thing.

87
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,680
Plus or minus 2 divided
by negative 2.

88
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,070
And really what we have
here is 2 expressions.

89
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,940
But if we're plus 2 and we
divide by negative 2, it will

90
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,400
be negative 1.

91
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,530
And if we take negative 2 and
divide by negative 2, we're

92
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,460
going to have positive 1.

93
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,380
So instead of plus or minus, you
could imagine it is going

94
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,400
to be minus or plus.

95
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,470
But it's really the same thing.

96
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:46,720
Right?

97
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,050
It's really now minus or plus.

98
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,570
If it was plus, it's now
going to be a minus.

99
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,595
If it was a minus, it's now
going to be a plus.

100
00:04:52,595 --> 00:05:00,110
Minus or plus 2 times the
square root of 15.

101
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,220
Or another way to view it is
that the two solutions here

102
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:14,090
are 4 minus two roots of 15,
and 4 plus two roots of 15.

103
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,420
These are both values of x
that'll satisfy this equation.

104
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,670
And if this confuses you, what I
did, turning a plus or minus

105
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,590
into minus plus.

106
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,550
Let me just take a little
bit of an aside there.

107
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,110
I could write this expression
up here as two expressions.

108
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,850
That's what the plus
or minus really is.

109
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:36,820
There's a negative 8 plus 2
roots of 15 over negative 2.

110
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,100
And then there's a negative
8 minus 2 roots of 15 over

111
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,060
negative 2.

112
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,030
This one simplifies to--
negative 8 divided by

113
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,260
negative 2 is 4.

114
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,680
2 divided by negative
2 is negative 1.

115
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,150
2 times a 4 minus the
square root of 15.

116
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,580
And then over here you have
negative 8 divided by negative

117
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,630
2, which is 4.

118
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,870
And then negative 2 divided by
negative 2, which is plus the

119
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,730
square of 15.

120
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,010
And I just realized I made
a mistake up here.

121
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,030
When we're dividing a 2 divided
by negative 2, we

122
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,270
don't have this 2 over here.

123
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,040
This is just a plus or
minus the root of 15.

124
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,580
We just saw that when
I did it out here.

125
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,300
So this is minus the
square root of 15.

126
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,300
And this is plus the
square root of 15.

127
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,540
So the two solutions for this
equation-- It's good that I

128
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,820
took that little hiatus there,
that little aside there.

129
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,220
The two solutions could be 4
minus the square root of 15,

130
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,430
or x, or and, x could be 4 plus
the square root of 15.

131
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:37,120
Either of those values of x
will satisfy this original

132
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,210
quadratic equation.

133
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:39,600
