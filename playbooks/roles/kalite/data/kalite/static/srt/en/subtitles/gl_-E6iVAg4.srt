1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,960
Rewrite the expression 4 times,
and then in parentheses

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,810
we have 8 plus 3, using the
distributive law of

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,960
multiplication over addition.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,880
Then simplify the expression.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,050
So let's just try to solve
this or evaluate this

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,080
expression, then we'll talk
a little bit about the

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,720
distributive law of
multiplication over addition,

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,100
usually just called the
distributive law.

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:34,250
So we have 4 times
8 plus 8 plus 3.

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,070
Now there's two ways to do it.

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,630
Normally, when you have
parentheses, your inclination

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,020
is, well, let me just evaluate
what's in the parentheses

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,430
first and then worry about
what's outside of the

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,110
parentheses, and we can do
that fairly easily here.

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,520
We can evaluate what
8 plus 3 is.

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,940
8 plus 3 is 11.

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,030
So if we do that-- let me do
that in this direction.

19
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,820
So if we do that, we get 4
times, and in parentheses we

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,120
have an 11.

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,090
8 plus 3 is 11, and then this
is going to be equal to--

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,820
well, 4 times 11 is just
44, so you can

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,880
evaluate it that way.

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,790
But they want us to use the
distributive law of

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,510
multiplication.

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,960
We did not use the distributive
law just now.

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,270
We just evaluated
the expression.

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,470
We used the parentheses first,
then multiplied by 4.

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,330
In the distributive law, we
multiply by 4 first. And it's

30
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,080
called the distributive law
because you distribute the 4,

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,040
and we're going to think
about what that means.

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
So in the distributive law, what
this will become, it'll

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,120
become 4 times 8 plus 4 times
3, and we're going to think

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,490
about why that is in a second.

35
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:52,620
So this is going to be equal to
4 times 8 plus 4 times 3.

36
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,920
A lot of people's first instinct
is just to multiply

37
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,680
the 4 times the 8, but no!

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,110
You have to distribute the 4.

39
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,250
You have to multiply it times
the 8 and times the 3.

40
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,040
This is right here.

41
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,200
This is the distributive
property in action right here.

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,139
Distributive property
in action.

43
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,770
And then when you evaluate it--
and I'm going to show you

44
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,190
in kind of a visual way
why this works.

45
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,680
But then when you evaluate it,
4 times 8-- I'll do this in a

46
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,010
different color-- 4 times 8 is
32, and then so we have 32

47
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,780
plus 4 times 3.

48
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:32,840
4 times 3 is 12 and 32 plus
12 is equal to 44.

49
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,040
That is also equal to 44, so
you can get it either way.

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,860
But when they want us to use
the distributive law, you'd

51
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,130
distribute the 4 first.
Now let's think

52
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,290
about why that happens.

53
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,670
Let's visualize just
what 8 plus 3 is.

54
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,400
Let me draw eight
of something.

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,930
So one, two, three,
four, five, six,

56
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,380
seven, eight, right?

57
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,790
   

58
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,380
And then we're going to add to
that three of something, of

59
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,710
maybe the same thing.

60
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,880
One, two, three.

61
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,760
So you can imagine this is what
we have inside of the

62
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,350
parentheses.

63
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,240
We have 8 circles
plus 3 circles.

64
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,900
Now, when we're multiplying this
whole thing, this whole

65
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,120
thing times 4, what
does that mean?

66
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,330
Well, that means we're just
going to add this to itself

67
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,690
four times.

68
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,750
Let me do that with
a copy and paste.

69
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,470
Copy and paste.

70
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,860
Let me copy and then
let me paste.

71
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,410
There you go.

72
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,240
That's two.

73
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:39,780
That's one, two, three, and then
we have four, and we're

74
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,460
going to add them
all together.

75
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,690
So this is literally what?

76
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,020
Four times, right?

77
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,290
Let me go back to the
drawing tool.

78
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,630
We have it one, two, three, four
times this expression,

79
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,750
which is 8 plus 3.

80
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,750
Now, what is this
thing over here?

81
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,270
   

82
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,120
If you were to count all of this
stuff, you would get 44.

83
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,710
But what is this thing
over here?

84
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,140
Well, that's 8 added to
itself four times.

85
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,800
You could imagine you're
adding all of these.

86
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,120
So what's 8 added to
itself four times?

87
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,279
That is 4 times 8.

88
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:22,780
So this is 4 times 8,
and what is this

89
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,710
over here in the orange?

90
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,030
We have one, two, three,
four times.

91
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,330
Well, each time we have three.

92
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,620
So it's 4 times this
right here.

93
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,580
This right here is 4 times 3.

94
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,620
So you see why the distributive
property works.

95
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,170
If you do 4 times 8 plus 3, you
have to multiply-- when

96
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,570
you, I guess you could imagine,
duplicate the thing

97
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,450
four times, both the 8 and the
3 is getting duplicated four

98
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,000
times or it's being added to
itself four times, and that's

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,290
why we distribute the 4.

100
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:55,667
