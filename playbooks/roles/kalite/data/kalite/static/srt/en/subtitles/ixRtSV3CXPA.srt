1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940
   

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,750
The goal in this video is to
essentially prove a pretty

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,920
simple result.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,710
And that's that the ratio
between the volumes-- let me

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,850
write this down-- that the ratio
between the volume at

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,580
state B and the volume at state
A-- so the ratio of that

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,930
volume to that volume-- is equal
to, in our Carnot cycle,

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,620
is equal to the ratio between
the volume at state C.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,860
So this volume and
that volume.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,920
So volume at C to
the volume at D.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,930
So this is what I'm about
to embark to prove.

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,720
A fairly simple result, that
maybe is even, if you look at

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,090
this, that looks about right.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,780
So if you're happy just knowing
that, you don't have

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,850
to watch the rest
of the video.

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,440
But if you are curious how we
get there, I encourage you to

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,400
watch it, although it gets
a little bit math-y.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,460
But I think the fun part
about it, even, it will

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,420
one, satisfy you.

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,090
That this is true.

21
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,150
But the other thing is, we'll
be able to study adiabatic

22
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,890
processes a little bit more.

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,820
So just kind of launching off
of that, the whole proof

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,250
revolves around to this step
right here and this step right

25
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,850
here. when we go from D to A.

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,090
So by definition, an adiabatic
process is one where there's

27
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,060
no transfer of heat.

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,530
So our heat transfer in an
adiabatic process is 0.

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,010
So if we go back to our original
definitions-- let me

30
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,650
show you that here.

31
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,150
Right here, at the step
and this step, we have

32
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,470
no transfer of heat.

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,565
So if we go back to there.

34
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:28,680
Adiabatic-- we're completely
isolated from

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,550
the rest of the world.

36
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,220
So there's nothing to transfer
heat to or from.

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,660
So if we go to our definition,
almost, or our first law of

38
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,540
thermodynamics, we know that the
change in internal energy

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,500
is equal to the heat applied to
the system minus the work

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,660
done by the system.

41
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,530
And the work done by the
system is equal to the

42
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,420
pressure of the system times
some change in volume.

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,720
At least, maybe it's a very
small change in volume, while

44
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,790
the pressure is constant.

45
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,580
But if we're doing a
quasi-static process, we can

46
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,670
write this.

47
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,710
Pressure, you can view it as
kind of constant for that very

48
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,920
small change in volume.

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,300
So that's what we have there.

50
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,165
Now, if it's adiabatic, we
know that this is 0.

51
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:14,960
   

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,650
And if that's 0, we can add P
delta V to both sides of this

53
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,645
equation, and we will get that--
this is only true if it

54
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:27,000
were adiabatic-- that delta U,
our change in internal energy,

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,530
plus our pressure times
our change in

56
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,095
volume, is equal to 0.

57
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:36,530
And let's see if we can do
this somehow, we can do

58
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,020
something with this equation to
get to that result that I'm

59
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,450
trying to get to.

60
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,100
So a few videos ago, I proved
to you that U, the internal

61
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,050
energy at any point in time--
let me write it here.

62
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:54,890
The internal energy at any point
in time is equal to 3/2

63
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,400
times n times R times T.

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,440
Which is also equal
to 3/2 times PV.

65
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,520
Now, if I have a change in
internal energy, what can

66
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,460
change on this side?

67
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,000
Something must have changed.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,980
Well, 3/2 can't change.

69
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,850
n can't change.

70
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,190
We're not going to change the
number of molecules we have.

71
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,990
The universal gas constant
can't change.

72
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,050
So the temperature
must change.

73
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,930
So there you have it.

74
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,636
You have delta U could be
rewritten as delta-- let me do

75
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:26,930
it in a different color-- delta
U could be written as

76
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,810
3/2 n times R times our
change in temperature.

77
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,880
And that's why I keep saying
in this-- especially when

78
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,770
we're dealing with the situation
where all of the

79
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,440
internal energy is essentially
kinetic energy-- that if you

80
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,925
don't have a change in
temperature, you're not going

81
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:42,620
to have a change in
internal energy.

82
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,520
Likewise, if you don't have a
change in internal energy,

83
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,030
you're not going to have a
change in temperature.

84
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,620
So let me put this
aside right here.

85
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,850
I'm going to substitute
it back there.

86
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:56,000
But let's see if we can do
something with this P here.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,920
Well, we'll just resort to
our ideal gas equation.

88
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,470
Because we're dealing with an
ideal gas, we might as well.

89
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,720
PV is equal to nRT.

90
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,970
This should be emblazoned in
your mind, at this point.

91
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,150
So if we want to solve
for P, we get O is

92
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,700
equal to nRT over V.

93
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,250
Fair enough.

94
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,840
So let's put both of these
things aside, and substitute

95
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,730
them into this formula.

96
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,580
So delta U is equal
to this thing.

97
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:38,910
So that means that 3/2 nR delta
T plus P-- P is this

98
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:50,740
thing-- plus nRT over V times
delta V is equal to 0.

99
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,810
Interesting.

100
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,670
So what can we do
further here?

101
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,080
And I'll kind of tell you where
I'm going with this.

102
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,570
So that tells me, my change in
internal energy over a very

103
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,660
small delta T-- this tells me
my work done by the system

104
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,330
over a very small delta V.

105
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,380
And we're saying that, you know,
over each little small

106
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,160
increments, they're going
to add up to zero.

107
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,740
So let me just go back to
the original graph.

108
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,090
So this is over a very small
delta V right there.

109
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,060
Let me do it in a more
vibrant color.

110
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,560
A very small change,
as we go from there

111
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,730
to, let's say, there.

112
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,700
We're going to have some
change in our volume.

113
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,590
And you don't see the
temperature here.

114
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,030
So don't try to even imagine,
when we do the integral, that

115
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,970
we should think of it in
some terms of area.

116
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,410
But we're going to integrate
over the change in

117
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,820
temperature, as well.

118
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,180
The temperature changes
a little bit

119
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,400
from there to there.

120
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,540
So what I want to do--
this is, right here,

121
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,360
over a small change.

122
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,250
I want to integrate eventually
over all of the changes that

123
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,470
occur during our adiabatic
process.

124
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,650
So let's see if we can simplify
this before I break

125
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,110
out the calculus.

126
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,970
So if we divide both sides
by nRT, what do we get?

127
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,130
So let's divide it by nRT,
let's divide it by nRT.

128
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,770
And we have to do it to both
sides of the equation. nRT.

129
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,850
Well, on this term, the n's
cancel out, the R cancels out.

130
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,110
Over here, this nRT cancels
out with this nRT.

131
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,950
And what are we left with?

132
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,820
We're left with 3/2-- we have
this 1 over T left-- times 1

133
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:30,130
over T delta T plus 1 over V
delta V is equal to-- well,

134
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,650
zero divided by anything
is just equal to 0.

135
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,910
Now we're going to integrate
over a bunch of really small

136
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,470
delta T's and delta V's.

137
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,250
So let me just change those to
our calculus terminology.

138
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,740
We're going to do an infinite
sum over infinitesimally small

139
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,410
changes in delta
T and delta V.

140
00:06:49,410 --> 00:07:01,030
So I'll rewrite this as 3/2 1
over T dt plus 1 over V dv is

141
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,750
equal to 0.

142
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,860
Remember, this just
means a very, very

143
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,690
small change in volume.

144
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,840
This is a very, very, very,
small change, an

145
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,580
infinitesimally small change,
in temperature.

146
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,540
And now I want to do the total
change in temperature.

147
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,240
I want to integrate over the
total change in temperature

148
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,960
and the total change
in volume.

149
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,880
So let's do that.

150
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,620
So I want to go from always
temperature start to

151
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,870
temperature finish.

152
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,010
   

153
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,060
And this will be going
from our volume

154
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,350
start to volume finish.

155
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,630
Fair enough.

156
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,250
Let's do these integrals.

157
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,790
This tends to show up a lot
in thermodynamics, these

158
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,620
antiderivatives.

159
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,800
The antiderivative of 1 over
T is natural log of T.

160
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:57,190
So this is equal to 3/2 times
the natural log of T.

161
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,870
We're going to evaluate it at
the final temperature and then

162
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,370
the starting temperature, plus
the natural log-- the

163
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,340
antiderivative of 1 over V is
just the natural log of V--

164
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:17,120
plus the natural log of V,
evaluated from our final

165
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,310
velocity, and we're going
to subtract out

166
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,300
the starting velocity.

167
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,400
This is just the
calculus here.

168
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,540
And this is going to
be equal to 0.

169
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:23,790
Right?

170
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,610
I mean, we could integrate both
sides-- well, if every

171
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,010
infinitesimal change is equal to
the sum is equal to 0, the

172
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,039
sum of all of the infinitesimal
changes are also

173
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,840
going to be equal to 0.

174
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,460
So this is still equal to 0.

175
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,640
See what we can do here.

176
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,670
So we could rewrite this green
part as-- so it's 3/2 times

177
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,170
the natural log of TF minus the
natural log of TS, which

178
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,320
is just, using our log
properties, the natural log of

179
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,900
TF over the natural log of TS.

180
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,610
Right?

181
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,030
When you evaluate, you get
natural log of TF minus the

182
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,180
natural log of TS.

183
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,160
That's the same thing as this.

184
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,820
Plus, for the same reason, the
natural log of VF over the

185
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,760
natural log of VS. When you
evaluate this, it's the

186
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,890
natural log of VF minus the
natural log of VS, which can

187
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,380
be simplified this to this,
just from our logarithmic

188
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,560
properties.

189
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,220
So this equals 0.

190
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,940
And now we can-- this
coefficient out front, we can

191
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,320
use our logarithmic
properties.

192
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,990
Instead of putting a 3/2 natural
log of this, we can

193
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:34,150
rewrite this as the natural log
of TF over TS to the 3/2.

194
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,110
Now we can keep doing our
logarithm properties.

195
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,350
You take the log of something
plus the log of something.

196
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,530
That's equal to the log
of their product.

197
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,520
So this is equal to-- I'll
switch colors-- The natural

198
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:56,870
log of TF over TS to the 3/2
power, times the natural log

199
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:03,090
of VF over VS. And this
is a fatiguing proof.

200
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,830
All right.

201
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,730
And all that is going
to be equal to 0.

202
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,010
Now what can we say?

203
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,040
Well, we're saying that e to the
0 power-- the natural log

204
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,470
is log base e-- e to the 0 power
is equal to this thing.

205
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,410
So this thing must be 1.

206
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,830
E to the 0 power is 1.

207
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:28,020
So we can say-- we're almost
there-- that TF, our final

208
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,900
temperature over our starting
temperature to the 3/2 power,

209
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,860
times our final volume
over our starting

210
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,400
volume is equal to 1.

211
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,280
Now let's take this result that
we worked reasonably hard

212
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,530
to produce.

213
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,430
   

214
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,940
Remember all of this, we just
said, we're dealing with an

215
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,450
adiabatic process, and we
started from the principle of

216
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,890
just what the definition
of internal energy is.

217
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,150
And then we substitute it with
our PV equals nRT formulas.

218
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,090
Although this was kind of PV--
this is internal energy at any

219
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,290
point is equal to
3/2 times PV.

220
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,920
And then we integrated over all
the changes, and we said,

221
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,240
look, this is adiabatic.

222
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,410
So the total change-- the sum
of all of our change in

223
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,780
internal energy and work done
by the system has to be 0,

224
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,560
then we use the property of
log to get to this result.

225
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,850
Now let's do these for both
of these adiabatic

226
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,890
processes over here.

227
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,110
So the first one we could do is
this one where we go from

228
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,690
volume B at T1 to
volume C at T2.

229
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,370
Watch the Carnot cycle video,
if you forgot that.

230
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,860
This was the VB All of these
things up here were at

231
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,690
temperature 1.

232
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,206
All of the things down here were
at temperature 2 So we're

233
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,480
at temperature 1 up here,
and temperature 2 down

234
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,940
here, volume C.

235
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,840
So let's look at that.

236
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,850
So on that right part, that
right process, our final

237
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,880
temperature was temperature 2.

238
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,900
So let me write it down.

239
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,710
Temperature 2.

240
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,875
Our initial temperature was
temperature 1, where we

241
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:09,110
started off at point
B to the 3/2.

242
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,660
Times-- what was our
final volume?

243
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,040
Our final volume was our volume
at C divided by the

244
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,680
volume at B.

245
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,460
And that's going to
be equal to 1.

246
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,600
Neat.

247
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,260
That's the result we got from
this adiabatic process.

248
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,370
We got that formula saying, this
is adiabatic, we did a

249
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,380
bunch of math, and then we
just substitute for our

250
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,990
initial and final volumes
and temperatures.

251
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,310
Let's do it the same way, but
let's go from D to A.

252
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:42,760
So when you go from D to A,
what's your final temperature?

253
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,330
Don't want to get you
dizzy going up.

254
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,320
Well your final temperature,
we're going from D to A.

255
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,150
So our final temperature
is T1.

256
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,940
and our final volume
is the volume at A.

257
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,480
Go back down.

258
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,580
So our final temperature
is T1.

259
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,690
Our initial temperature is T2.

260
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:06,430
We're going from D to A to the
3/2 power is times-- let me

261
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,520
write our form formula there.

262
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,250
Our final volume is
the volume at A.

263
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,630
That's where we moved to.

264
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,380
And we moved from
our volume at D.

265
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,580
And this is going to
be equal to 1.

266
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:16,990
OK.

267
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,110
We're almost there,
if your eyes are

268
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,310
beginning to glaze over.

269
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,280
But this is interesting.

270
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,490
And if anything, it's a little
bit of fun mathematics to wake

271
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,760
you up in the morning.

272
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,910
So let's see.

273
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,890
We can almost relate
these two things.

274
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,880
We could set them equal to each
other, but it's not quite

275
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,690
satisfying yet.

276
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,670
Let's take the reciprocal of
both sides of this equation

277
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,710
right here.

278
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:44,890
So obviously if we take the
reciprocal of this-- and we

279
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,990
could just say, this is T2
over T1 to the minus 3/2

280
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:53,670
power, which is the same
thing as T1 over

281
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,580
T2, to the 3/2 power.

282
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:56,780
Right?

283
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,000
That's just the reciprocal.

284
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,540
And we're taking both sides to
the negative 1 power, so we're

285
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,990
going to have to take this
to the negative 1 power.

286
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,635
VB over VC.

287
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,390
And when you take the reciprocal
of 1, that just

288
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,530
equals 1, That still equals 1.

289
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,230
Which this also equals, so we
could say, that equals this

290
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,560
thing over here.

291
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,550
So that is equal to T1 over
T2, to the 3/2 power,

292
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,180
times VA over VD.

293
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,600
Now, these things are
equal to each other.

294
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,500
We can get rid of the 1.

295
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,120
These two-- actually, let me
just erase some of this.

296
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,580
I don't want to make it
say not equal to.

297
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,540
They're equal to each other.

298
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,980
They both equal 1.

299
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,960
So they both equal each other.

300
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,070
   

301
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,960
This thing and this thing
are the same thing.

302
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,700
T1 over T2 to the 3/2, T1
over T2 to the 3/2.

303
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,370
So let's just divide
both sides by that.

304
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,750
Those cancel out.

305
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,190
And what are we left with?

306
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,380
I think you can see
the finish line.

307
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,140
The finish line is near.

308
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:02,730
We have VB over VC is
equal to VA over VD.

309
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,740
Now that's not quite the result
we wanted, but it takes

310
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,300
a little bit of simple
arithmetic to get there.

311
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,240
Let's just cross-multiply.

312
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:18,160
And you get VB times VD is
equal to VC times VA.

313
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:30,710
Now if we divide both sides by
VBVC-- actually, let's do it

314
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,070
the other way.

315
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,350
Let's divide both
sides by VDVA.

316
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:40,010
   

317
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,340
What do we get?

318
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,780
These cancel out, and
these cancel out.

319
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:53,870
And we are left with VB over
VA is equal to VC over VD.

320
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,800
All that work for a nice and
simple result, but that's

321
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,620
better than doing a lot
of work for a hairy

322
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,140
and monstrous result.

323
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,440
So that's what we set
out to prove.

324
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,960
That VB over VA is equal
to VC over VD.

325
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,190
And we got it all from the
notion that we're dealing with

326
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:13,220
adiabatic process, that our
change in heat is 0.

327
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,080
and we just went to our formula,
or our definition of

328
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,260
our change in internal energy,
the first law of

329
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,130
thermodynamics, that if we have
any change in internal

330
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,450
energy, it must be equal
to the amount of

331
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,470
work done by the system.

332
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,880
Or at least a negative of the
work done by the system.

333
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,720
When you add them up,
you get to 0.

334
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,120
Then we use that result from a
few videos ago, where we said

335
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,660
the internal energy at any
point is 3/2 times nRT.

336
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,490
So the change in internal energy
is that times delta T,

337
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,210
because that's the only
thing that can change.

338
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,890
We used PV equal nRT.

339
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,430
And then we just integrated
along all of the little

340
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,290
changes in temperature
and volume, as we

341
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,030
moved along this line.

342
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,700
As we moved along the line,
we took the integral.

343
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,110
We said that had to
be equal to 0.

344
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,110
And we ended up with this
formula over here, and then we

345
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,010
just applied it to our two
adiabatic processes.

346
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,580
And we went from B to C, and
we went from D to A.

347
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,695
And we got these results.

348
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:05,849
And we got to our finish line.

349
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,619
See you in the next video.
