1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,720
We're told to factor 4x to the
fourth y, minus 8x to the

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,230
third y, minus 2x squared.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,160
So to factor this, we need to
figure out what the greatest

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,190
common factor of each
of these terms are.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,030
So let me rewrite it.

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,790
So we have 4x to the fourth y,
and we have minus 8x to the

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:27,390
third y, and then we have
minus 2x squared.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,790
So in the other videos, we
looked at it in terms of

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,630
breaking it down to its simplest
parts, but I think we

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,830
have enough practice now to be
able to do a little bit more

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,420
of it in our heads.

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,460
So what is the largest
number that

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,940
divides into all of these?

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,700
When I say number I'm talking
about the actual, I guess,

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,320
coefficients.

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,840
We have a 4, an 8, a 2.

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,950
We don't have to worry about the
negative signs just yet.

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,290
And we say, well, the largest,
of, the largest common factor

20
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,400
of 2, 8 and 4 is 2.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,180
2 goes into all of them, and
obviously that's the largest

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,120
number that can go into 2.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,860
So that is the largest number
that's going to be part of the

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,110
greatest common factor.

25
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,460
So let's write that down.

26
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,090
So it's going to be 2.

27
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,490
And then what's the greatest,
I guess, factor, what's the

28
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,640
greatest degree of x that's
divisible into

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,290
all three of these?

30
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,820
Well, x squared goes into all
three of these, and obviously

31
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,590
that's the greatest degree of
x that can be divided into

32
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,830
this last term.

33
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,550
So x squared is going to be the
greatest common x degree

34
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,450
in all of them.

35
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,450
2x squared.

36
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,630
And then what's the largest
degree of y that's divisible

37
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,080
into all of them?

38
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,050
Well, these two guys are
divisible by y, but this guy

39
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,130
isn't, so there is no
degree of y that's

40
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,560
divisible into all of them.

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,520
So the greatest common factor
of all three of these guys

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,480
right here is 2x squared.

43
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,020
So what we can do now is we can
think about each of these

44
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,320
terms as the product of the 2x
squared and something else.

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,610
And to figure that something
else we can literally

46
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,500
undistribute the 2x squared, say
this is the same thing, or

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,020
even before we undistribute the
2x squared, we could say

48
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,840
look, 4x to the fourth y is the
same thing as 2x squared,

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,740
times 4x to the fourth
y, over 2x squared.

50
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,060
Right?

51
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,810
If you just multiply this
out, you get 4xy.

52
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,910
Similarly, you could say that
8x to the third y-- I'll put

53
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,530
the negative out front-- is the
same thing as 2x squared,

54
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,510
our greatest common factor,
times 8x to the third y, over

55
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,340
2x squared.

56
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,120
And then finally, 2x squared
is the same thing as if we

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,560
factor out 2x squared-- so we
have that negative sign out

58
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,140
front-- if we factor out 2x
squared, it's the same thing

59
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,450
as 2x squared, times 2x squared,
over 2x squared.

60
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,670
This is almost silly what I'm
doing here, but I'm just

61
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,330
showing you that I'm just
multiplying and dividing both

62
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,970
of these terms by 2x squared.

63
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,030
Multiplying and dividing.

64
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,420
Here it's trivially simple.

65
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,500
This just simplifies to 2x
squared right there, or this

66
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,510
2x squared times 1.

67
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,920
That simplifies to 1, maybe
I should write it below.

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,560
But what do these simplify to?

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,220
So this first term over here,
this simplifies to 2x squared

70
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,860
times-- now you get 4 divided
by 2 is 2, x to the fourth

71
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,080
divided by x squared
is x squared.

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,140
And then y divided by 1 is
just going to be a y.

73
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,420
So it's 2x squared times 2x
squared y, and then you have

74
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:35,382
minus 2x squared times,
8 divided by 2 is 4.

75
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,880
x to the third divided
by x squared is x.

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,400
And y divided by 1, you can
imagine, is just y.

77
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,010
And then finally, of course,
you have minus 2x squared

78
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,080
time-- this right here
simplifies to 1-- times 1.

79
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,260
Now, if you were to undistribute
2x squared out of

80
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,840
the expression, you'd
essentially get 2x squared

81
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,250
times this term, minus this
term, minus this term.

82
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,140
Right, if you distribute this
out, if you take that out of

83
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,520
each of the terms, you're going
to get 2x squared times

84
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:27,160
this 2x squared y, minus 4xy,
and then you have minus 1,

85
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,130
minus 1, and we're done.

86
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,760
We've factored the problem.

87
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,220
Now, it looks like we
did a lot of steps.

88
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,310
And the reason why I kind of of
went through great pains to

89
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,820
show you exactly what we're
doing is so you know exactly

90
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,770
what we're doing.

91
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,660
In the future, you might
be able to do this

92
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,490
a little bit quicker.

93
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,190
You might be able to do many
of the steps in your head.

94
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,190
You might say OK, let me
look at each of these.

95
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,690
Well, the biggest coefficient
that divides all of these is a

96
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,060
2, so let me put that 2,
let me factor 2 out.

97
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,690
Well, all of these are divisible
by x squared.

98
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,960
That's the largest
degree of x.

99
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,130
Let me factor an
x squared out.

100
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,360
And this guy doesn't have a y,
so I can't factor a y out.

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,700
So let's see, it's going to be
2x squared times-- and what's

102
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,480
this guy divided
by 2x squared?

103
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,815
Well 4 divided by 2 is 2.

104
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:12,450
x to the fourth divided by
x squared is x squared.

105
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,720
y divided by 1, there's no
other y degree that we

106
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,830
factored out, so it's just
going to be a y.

107
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,540
And then you have minus
8 divided by 2 is 4.

108
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,740
x to the third divided
by x squared is x.

109
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,960
And then you have y divided
by say, 1, is just y.

110
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,720
And then you have minus
2 divided by 2 is 1.

111
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,170
x squared divided by x squared
1, so 2x squared divided by 2x

112
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,570
squared is just 1.

113
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,815
So in the future, you'll do it
more like this, where you kind

114
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:41,280
of just factor it out in your
head, but I really want you to

115
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,480
understand what we did here.

116
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,370
There is no magic.

117
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,840
And to realize that there's no
magic, you could just use the

118
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,450
distributive property to
multiply this out again, to

119
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,070
multiply it out again, and
you're going to see that you

120
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,710
get exactly this.

121
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,200
