00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:04,042
Let's try to compute 6 times 37.

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:07,033
And I'll show you one way of doing this and then in future videos

3
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:11,380
we can look at other ways of doing this and think about why this is actually working.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,024
So what I'd like to do (and this is often called the standard method) is take the larger of the two numbers.

5
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:19,600
It doesn't matter if you're doing 6 times 37 or 37 times 6. They're equal each other.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,361
6 times 37 is the same thing as 37 times 6.

7
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:27,030
So what I'd like to do is I take the larger of the two numbers and I write it on top.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:33,624
So I'll write 37 and then the smaller of the two numbers (which is 6) I'll write on the bottom

9
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:36,271
and I'll line by the correct place.

10
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:44,027
It has one digit, it's in the ones place obviously, so I can write the 6 right over here

11
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:46,674
and I'll write the multiplication symbol like that.

12
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:51,875
And this is just another way of expressing 37 times 6 which is the same thing as 6 times 37.

13
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:57,541
Now what we do is we go at the first place in this lower number

14
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,049
(there's only one place here so in the number 6 right over here)

15
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:03,346
and we're going to multiply that times each of the digits up here.

16
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:11,194
So first we will start with 6 times 7. So we're going to first multiply 6 times 7.

17
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:17,696
Well, you remember from your multiplication tables 6 times 7 is equal to 42.

18
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:22,200
Now, we don't just write 42 here, at least not in the standard method we wouldn't write 42 here,

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,798
we'd write the 2 in 42 in the ones place (so we'd write that right over there)

20
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:32,139
and then we'd carried the 4 in 42 up to the tens place.

21
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:36,968
Now we need to think about what 6 times 3 is.

22
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:44,259
Well, once again we know 6 times 3 is equal to 18,

23
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:48,300
but we can't just an 18 down here, we still have this 4 to deal with.

24
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:54,801
So 6 times 3 is 18 but we've got to then add the 4.

25
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:57,367
So 6 times 3 is 18, plus 4 is 22.

26
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:03,207
So 6 times 3 and then we were adding that 4 right over there.

27
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:07,207
And that's how we get our answer.
So 222.
