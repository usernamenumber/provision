1
00:00:00,869 --> 00:00:08,053
When the Federal Reserve does traditional Open Market Operations

2
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:11,887
what they do is the Fed over here

3
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:17,102
will literally print money, so it prints money

4
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:18,982
it doesn't necessarily have to be cash,

5
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:20,470
it could be electronic money,

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,779
and it uses that money to buy usually short-term treasury securities

7
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:29,881
in the open market. That's why it's called open market operations.

8
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:34,471
So in exchange it gets treasury securities.

9
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:37,549
Treasuries. Now the whole purpose of this,

10
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:40,074
it does increase demand for treasuries,

11
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,500
and therefore increase the price on treasuries,

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,983
and lower the interest rate,

13
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:46,658
but the main point is is it takes this printed money

14
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:48,936
and it puts it in the banking system.

15
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:52,700
Because it buys treasuries, just from people or from banks or from institutions,

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,373
and then those people take that cash

17
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:56,553
that they just got for these treasuries,

18
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:59,348
and they'll deposit it in banks.

19
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:03,952
So they'll go and they'll deposit it in maybe bank 1 over here,

20
00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:06,536
then over here in bank 2,

21
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:09,736
and since there's more money in bank 1 and bank 2

22
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,537
you have the supply of money going up

23
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:14,804
supply going up

24
00:01:14,804 --> 00:01:17,698
and also the demand for reserves is going up

25
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:20,899
this cash right here, these are reserves.

26
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:25,637
These are reserves. So you have the demand for reserves going down.

27
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:27,303
Maybe before this money entered the system,

28
00:01:27,303 --> 00:01:29,418
maybe bank 2 was running low on reserves,

29
00:01:29,418 --> 00:01:31,814
but now people have deposited money in bank 2

30
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:34,287
so bank 2 doesn't need it as much.

31
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:36,611
So if you have the supply of money going up

32
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:38,640
you have the demand for money going down

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,025
and in particular I'm talking about reserves,

34
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:42,969
I'm talking about base money right over here

35
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,387
then the overnight borrowing rate between banks

36
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:49,636
will go down. The price of money will go down,

37
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:52,820
that's what the federal funds rate is, it's the target rate,

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,086
so I'll say Fed Funds Rate,

39
00:01:57,086 --> 00:02:00,326
it's the target rate that the Fed sets for the

40
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:02,825
overnight borrowing of reserves between banks,

41
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:05,387
that's the Federal Funds Rate, and it will go down

42
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:08,297
and that's how the Fed tries to set the Federal Funds Rate.

43
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:12,424
Now, fast forward to a situation like we are right now

44
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:16,002
and the Federal Funds Rate is already at zero.

45
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:20,068
But the Fed still wants to pump more money into the economy

46
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:22,658
and it wants to do it in a more directed way

47
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:25,065
so now what it's doing is it's still printing money

48
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:28,652
but it's using that money to buy other things

49
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:30,566
it could buy longer-term debt,

50
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:34,269
so it could buy longer-duration treasuries,

51
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,702
longer, so things that are maybe going to

52
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:38,423
maybe 10 year treasury bonds, or further out

53
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:42,388
than even that. Or, it could even buy completely

54
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:43,912
different assets, it could maybe buy

55
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:47,453
mortgage backed securities,

56
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:51,936
and the point here isn't just to increase the money supply

57
00:02:51,936 --> 00:02:55,306
the point in quantitative easing is maybe to kind of

58
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:58,921
smooth over what's happening in certain parts of the market

59
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:01,049
and so they thing that there's log jam in the

60
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,313
mortgage backed security market

61
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:04,403
that's why they're participating there.

62
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:06,970
So this right over here, that is

63
00:03:06,970 --> 99:59:59,999
Quantitative Easing.
