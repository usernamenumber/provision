1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
   

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,940
When you're studying chemistry,

3
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,900
you'll often see reactions.

4
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,090
In fact, you always
see reactions.

5
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,530
For example, if you have
hydrogen gas, it's a diatomic

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,550
molecule, because hydrogen
bonds with itself in the

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,630
gaseous state, plus
iodine gas, I2.

8
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,010
That's also in the
gaseous state.

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,460
It's very easy to say, oh,
you know, if you put them

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,630
together, they're going to react
and form the product.

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,900
If you have 2 moles of hydrogen,
2 moles of iodine,

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,940
so it's going to form 2 moles
of hydrogen iodide.

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,910
That's all nice and neat, and
it makes it seem like it's a

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,760
very clean thing that happens
without much fuss, but we know

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,010
that that isn't the reality.

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,090
And we also know that this
doesn't happen just instantly.

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,400
It's not like you can just take
some hydrogen and put it

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,040
with some iodine and it
just magically turns

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,230
into hydrogen iodide.

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,920
There's some process going on
that these gaseous state

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,890
particles are bouncing around,
and somehow they must bounce

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,380
into each other and break bonds
that they were in before

23
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,580
and form new ones.

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,150
And that's what we're
going to study now.

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,700
This whole study of how the
reaction progresses and the

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,140
rates of the reactions is called
kinetics, which is a

27
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,530
very fancy word, but you're
probably familiar with it

28
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,850
because we've talked a lot
about kinetic energy.

29
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:23,340
Kinetics, which is just the
study of the rate of

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,820
reactions, how fast do they
happen and how do they happen.

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,140
So let's just in our minds come
up with an intuitive way

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,000
that hydrogen and iodine
can combine.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,750
So let's think about what
hydrogen looks like.

34
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,810
So if we get our Periodic Table
out, hydrogen's got one

35
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,820
valence electron, so if they
have two hydrogen atoms, they

36
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,230
can share them with
each other.

37
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:47,680
And then iodine has seven
valence electrons so if they

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,880
each share one, they'd get
complete as well, so let's

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,650
just review that right now.

40
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,000
So hydrogen, this hydrogen,
might have one.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,200
Well, it will have one
electron out there.

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,790
And then you could have another
hydrogen that has

43
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,180
another electron out there.

44
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,880
And then if they form a
bond, they share this.

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,260
This hydrogen can pretend like
he has this electron.

46
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,284
This hydrogen can pretend like
she has that electron, and

47
00:02:09,284 --> 00:02:10,020
then they're happy.

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,730
They both feel like they've
completed their 1s shell.

49
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,780
Same thing on the iodine side
where you have two iodines.

50
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,470
They both have seven
valence electrons.

51
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,070
They're halogens.

52
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,330
You know that already.

53
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,040
Halogens are the Group
7 elements, so

54
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,000
they have seven electrons.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,240
This guy's got one here.

56
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,390
This guy's got one here.

57
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,770
If this guy can pretend
like he's got that

58
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,780
electron, he's happy.

59
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,160
He has eight valence
electrons.

60
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,020
If this guy can pretend like
he's got that one, same thing.

61
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,770
So there's a bond right here,
and this is why hydrogen is a

62
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,230
diatomic molecular gas,
and this is why

63
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,930
iodine is the same.

64
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,540
Now, when they're in the gaseous
state, you have a

65
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,510
bunch of these things that are
moving around, bumping into

66
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,450
each other.

67
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,300
I'll do it like this, so
the hydrogen might look

68
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,120
something like this.

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,650
The hydrogen has these
two atomic spheres

70
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,100
that are bonded together.

71
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,280
They have these electrons
in between that are

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,520
keeping them bonded.

73
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,210
The iodine might look
something like this.

74
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,280
It's a much bigger molecule
where it's bonded

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,040
together like this.

76
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,400
It's also sharing some electrons
in a covalent bond

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,910
and everything's
probabilistic.

78
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,830
So in order for these two
molecules to turn into this,

79
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,050
somehow these bonds have
to be broken and new

80
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,560
bonds have to be formed.

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,830
And what has to happen is that
these guys-- there's a ton of

82
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,490
these guys.

83
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,840
I could draw a bunch of them,
or I could copy and paste.

84
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,750
So there's a bunch of hydrogen
molecules around, and some of

85
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,040
these iodine gas molecules
around.

86
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,120
   

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,040
So what has to happen in order
for us to get the hydrogen

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,150
iodide is they have to collide,
and they have to

89
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,730
collide in exactly
the right way.

90
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,690
So let's say this guy--
actually, I can show it.

91
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,790
Let's say he's moving.

92
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,300
This is neat.

93
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm just dragging
and dropping.

94
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,690
But he's moving.

95
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,140
He has to hit this hydrogen
molecule just right.

96
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,000
And maybe just right, if he
just happens to hit it and

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
bounce at it with enough energy,
then all of a sudden,

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,660
let's say we get to this
point right here.

99
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,830
These electrons are going to
say, hey, you know, it's nice

100
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,860
to be shared this way.

101
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,330
We're in a stable
configuration.

102
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,130
We're filling this 1s shell,
but look at this.

103
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,829
There's this iodine that's
close by and

104
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,220
they really want me.

105
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,820
They're much more
electronegative than me to

106
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,160
hydrogen, so maybe they're
kind of attracted here.

107
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,000
They don't know whether they
want to be here between that

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,210
hydrogen and this right here
between that, and so they kind

109
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,960
of enter this higher
energy state.

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,340
And similarly, these guys, they
say, hey, wouldn't it be

111
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,100
nicer-- I don't have
to be here.

112
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,300
I could kind of go back home
to my home atom if this guy

113
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,250
comes in here, because then
we're going to have eight

114
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,700
valence electrons, and the same
thing's happening here.

115
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,940
And this complex right here,
right when the collision

116
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,180
happens, this is actually
a state.

117
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,110
It's the high energy state,
or the transition

118
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,060
state of the reaction.

119
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,210
And this is called an
activated complex.

120
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:12,420
   

121
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,350
You know, I just drew it kind
of visually, but you could

122
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,060
draw it like this.

123
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,240
So hydrogen has a covalent bond
with another hydrogen.

124
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,610
And then here comes along some
iodine that has a covalent

125
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,630
bond with some other iodine.

126
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,310
But all of a sudden, these guys
like to bond as well, so

127
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,530
they start forming-- so there's
kind of a little bit

128
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,900
of an attraction on
that side, too.

129
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,250
So this is another
way of drawing

130
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,390
the activation complex.

131
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,780
But this is a high energy state,
because in order for

132
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,910
the electron, the way you can
think of it, to kind of go

133
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,750
from that bond to this bond, or
this bond to that bond, or

134
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,920
to go back, they have to enter
into a higher energy state.

135
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,070
A less stable energy state
than they were before.

136
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,440
But they do that if there's
enough energy, because you can

137
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,810
go from both of these
things separate.

138
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,630
Let me just draw
them separate.

139
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,670
You have both of
them separate.

140
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,340
You have the hydrogen separate
plus the iodine separate.

141
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,320
They go to this, which is a
higher energy state, but if

142
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,100
they can get to that higher
energy state, if there's

143
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,480
enough energy for the collision
and they have enough

144
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,730
kinetic energy where they hit in
the right orientation, then

145
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,220
from this activated complex or
this higher energy state, it

146
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,740
will then go to the lowest
energy state.

147
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,770
And the lowest energy state
is the hydrogen iodide.

148
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,170
Whoops!

149
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,485
I want to draw iodide and
then the hydrogen.

150
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:39,190
   

151
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,150
This is actually a lower
energy state than this.

152
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,060
But in order to get here, you
have to go through a higher

153
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,660
energy state.

154
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,550
And I could do that with
an energy diagram.

155
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,240
So if we say that the x-axis
is the progression of the

156
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:03,060
reaction, and actually, we
don't know how fast it's

157
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,710
progressing, but you could kind
of view it as time in

158
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,030
some dimension, and let's say
this is the potential energy.

159
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,770
I don't want to draw
thicker lines.

160
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,930
This is the potential
energy right there.

161
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,630
Let me make this line
thicker as well.

162
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,800
   

163
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,180
This is the potential energy.

164
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,110
So initially, we are at this
reality, and you can kind of

165
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,080
view it as the combined
potential energy.

166
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,200
So essentially, we start
off here, and this

167
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,950
is the H2 plus I2.

168
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,810
And a lower potential energy is
when we're in the hydrogen

169
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,680
iodide, so this is the lower
potential energy down here.

170
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,550
   

171
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,720
This is the 2HI, right?

172
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,260
But to get here, we have to
enter this higher activation

173
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,970
energy, where the electrons
have to get-- they have to

174
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,470
have some energy to kind of be
able to at least figure out

175
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,080
what they want to do
with their lives.

176
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,910
And so you have to add
energy to the system.

177
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,790
You don't always have to add it,
but if it doesn't happen

178
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,750
spontaneously, you're going to
have to add some energy to the

179
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:16,260
system to get to this activated
state, right?

180
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,830
So this is when we're at
this thing right here.

181
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,070
We're there, so some energy
has to be in the system.

182
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,710
And this energy, the difference
between the energy

183
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,910
we were at when we were just
hydrogen molecules and iodine

184
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,110
molecules, and the energy we
have to get to get this

185
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,860
activated state-- this distance
right here-- this is

186
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,110
the activation energy.

187
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,950
   

188
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,070
If we're able to somehow put
enough energy in the system,

189
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,420
then this thing will happen.

190
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,500
They'll collide with enough
energy and bonds will be

191
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,020
broken and reformed.

192
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,550
Activation energy.

193
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,350
Sometimes it's written is Ea,
energy of activation.

194
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,870
And in the future, we'll maybe
do reactions where we actually

195
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,900
measure the activation energy,
but the important thing is to

196
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,100
conceptually understand
that it's there.

197
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,230
That things just don't
spontaneously go

198
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,860
from here to here.

199
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,180
And I won't go deeply into
catalysts right now, but

200
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,790
you've probably heard of the
word catalyst, or something

201
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,970
being catalyzed.

202
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,990
And that's some other
agent, some other

203
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,280
thing in the reaction.

204
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:23,720
So right now, we
have H2 plus I2

205
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,190
yielding 2 hydrogen iodides.

206
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,770
Now, you could have a
catalyst, and I'll

207
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,210
just say plus C.

208
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,960
And I actually don't know what
a good catalyst would be for

209
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,900
this reaction.

210
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,010
And how a catalyst operates is
it can actually operate in

211
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,630
many, many different ways, so
that's why I don't want to do

212
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,600
it in this video.

213
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,570
But what a catalyst is is
something that doesn't change.

214
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,540
It doesn't get consumed
in the reaction.

215
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,350
The catalyst was there
before the reaction.

216
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,230
The catalyst was there
after the reaction.

217
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,150
But what it does is it makes
the reaction happen either

218
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,960
faster, or it lowers the amount
of energy for the

219
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,070
reaction to happen, which is
kind of the same thing.

220
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,410
So if you have a catalyst, then
this activation energy

221
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,400
will be lower.

222
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,740
What it does is it might be some
molecule that allows some

223
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,450
other transition state that has
less of a potential energy

224
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,920
so that you require less heat
or less concentration of the

225
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,110
molecules for them to bump into
each other in the right

226
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,840
direction to get to that
other state, so you

227
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,630
require less energy.

228
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,070
So given how we understand how
these kinetics occur, or these

229
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,140
molecules interact with each
other, what do you think are

230
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,990
the things that will
drive whether a

231
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,540
reaction happens or not?

232
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,060
We already know that if we
have a positive catalyst,

233
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,570
there's something called a
negative catalyst that will

234
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,260
actually slow down a reaction.

235
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:45,770
But if we have a positive
catalyst, obviously, it lowers

236
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,000
the activation energy so this
makes a reaction faster.

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,600
   

238
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,050
More molecules are going to
bump into each other just

239
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,420
right to be able to get over
this hump because the hump

240
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,640
will be lower when you
have a catalyst.

241
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Also, if you increase the
concentration, right?

242
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,350
If you increase your
concentration of molecules, if

243
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,490
the concentration goes up, then
you just have more stuff

244
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,940
to bump into each
other, right?

245
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,180
There's just the likelihood.

246
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,390
Everything is probablistic.

247
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,770
When people write these reaction
equations, it all

248
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,470
seems nice and simple and very
clear, and it happens.

249
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,250
But no, in the real world, you
just have things bumping into

250
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:26,570
each other.

251
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,390
And when we do biology videos,
it will be fascinating to talk

252
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,450
about, because every biological
process is really

253
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,100
just a chemical process, and
it's really just the byproduct

254
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,660
of all of these things bumping
into each other.

255
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,080
And you can imagine, the more
concentration you have of the

256
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,740
things that need to bump into
each other, the more likely

257
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,190
you're going to get just that
perfect bump and that perfect

258
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,410
amount of kinetic energy for
the reaction to happen.

259
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,780
Actually, I'll make a little
other note here.

260
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,130
This reaction, you might say,
OK, I have some-- let's see,

261
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,330
I'm at this energy.

262
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,470
How do I ever get over this?

263
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,740
How does this ever react?

264
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,330
Well, remember, in a gas, the
kinetic energies of all of the

265
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,600
molecules, they're
not uniform.

266
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,485
Some molecules will have higher
kinetic energy; some

267
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:07,030
will have lower.

268
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,650
Temperature just gives
you the average.

269
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,400
So there's always some
probability that two maybe

270
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,140
high kinetic energy molecules
will bump into

271
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,170
each other just perfectly.

272
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,620
Surpass the kinetic-- so they
have enough kinetic energy to

273
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,470
get into the activation state,
and then they can go to the

274
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,420
lower state, which is
the hydrogen iodide.

275
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,280
At all temperatures this will
occur, but obviously if you

276
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,010
increase the temperature, that
reaction is more likely.

277
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,880
So that's the other one.

278
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,130
So, temperature.

279
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,790
   

280
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,940
Temperature is probably the
single biggest thing that will

281
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,570
make the reaction
happen faster.

282
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,920
So all of these things, you
want higher temperature,

283
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,550
higher reaction.

284
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,290
And then if you just want to
think about the molecules

285
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,330
itself, if you have molecules
where their original bonds are

286
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,210
weak, they're more likely
to be able to interact.

287
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,540
And there's other things you
could talk about: the

288
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,880
molecular shape, how available
certain atoms are to interact

289
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,200
with other atoms. That really
becomes significant when we

290
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,110
start going into biology.

291
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,750
And the last one, and you
probably realize this, is just

292
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,880
the surface area.

293
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,140
If you increase the surface
area-- so we were just doing

294
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,720
gas-gas interactions, which
almost by definition have

295
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,220
pretty good surface
area interactions.

296
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,170
But if the surface area goes
up, then the reaction also

297
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,170
goes up, the reaction rate.

298
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,300
And how do you think
about that?

299
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,480
Well, think about the reaction
of-- you know, we've done this

300
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,200
multiple times.

301
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:40,130
Sodium chloride-- solid-- so
solid salt, plus liquid water,

302
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,250
leads to sodium-- well, we could
think of it a lot of

303
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,410
different ways, but we could
think of it as sodium ion

304
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,840
aqueous plus chloride anions--
this is a cation and anion--

305
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,570
aqueous, so it gets dissolved.

306
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,540
And how does that happen?

307
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,050
If you have a big block of ice--
no, not ice, of salt.

308
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,690
I'll do salt in grey.

309
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,910
If you have a big block of salt
in there, so there's a

310
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,420
bunch of sodium and chloride
atoms in it.

311
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,230
And you have water all around
it, the water is only going to

312
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,900
be able to interact with the
surface molecules and slowly

313
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,140
dissolve away the salt, slowly
make polar bonds.

314
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,770
These are actually polar
dipole bonds with the

315
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,710
different sodium or
chloride ions.

316
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,200
But if you were to break this up
into smaller cubes, if you

317
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,500
were to break it up or really
crush it into really small

318
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,860
pieces, then all of a sudden
the surface area that the

319
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,240
water molecules can interact
with, it can actually interact

320
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,100
with more of the sodium
chloride, so the reaction will

321
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,820
happen faster.

322
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,670
So surface area, if you increase
the surface area of

323
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,030
interaction, then you'll also
increase the reaction rate.

324
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,350
If you're trying to do it with
two fluids, what you could do

325
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,840
is you can kind of spray one
fluid into the other, so you

326
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,240
have little droplets,
so you also

327
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,610
increase the surface area.

328
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,485
So anyway, this is kind of an
introduction to the idea of

329
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:07,720
kinetics, but hopefully, it
gives you a sense that these

330
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,420
reactions-- and I want you
to really think about

331
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,310
chemistry this way.

332
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,520
Not think about it is as, oh,
it's just some formula I have

333
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,880
to remember, that these really
are bumps and bruises between

334
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,460
atoms. It's probabilistic
and it's messy.

335
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,410
And we really have to think
about what will make it more

336
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,930
likely that these things collide
in just the perfect

337
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,420
way for the reactions
to happen.
