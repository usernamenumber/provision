1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:08,440
Let's think about what might happen in the United States, if the dollar is allowed to weaken relative to the yuan.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,305
So, the most obvious thing is that Chinese imports will become more expensive.

3
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:20,133
[Chinese imports will become more expensive].

4
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:27,121
A less obvious effect is whether that will reduce the demand for Chinese imports or whether that will

5
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:31,115
have any impact on American inflation. The reason why that is not as clear as when you go buy

6
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:39,427
your cell phone carrying case at your cell phone store and you pay $30 for it.

7
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:44,397
That $30 is not the cost that some Chinese manufacturer is getting for.

8
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:49,784
The Chinese manufacturer is probably charging on the order of 60 cents or may be 80 cents

9
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:55,790
or a dollar to produce that cell phone case. The rest of the money that you pay is really going to the retailer,

10
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:05,349
to the suppliers, or essentially pay for the shipping cost from China to the US. So, this 60 cents which was how much it costs to make in China.

11
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:14,350
This, if this now goes upto 80 cents or if this goes upto a dollar, it is not clear whether

12
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:20,062
this price even has to change. Or, if it were to change from $30 to $31, it is not clear whether that would affect the demand much.

13
00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:25,635
Now, if the impact that this weakening of the dollar would have on inflation

14
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:31,022
is that the idea is that all the imports will become more expensive.

15
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:35,109
[All imports will become more expensive].

16
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:39,381
Potentially, this would impact on how other countries react to the weakening dollar. But, [all imports could become more expensive].

17
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:45,902
Probably, the most important import is once again this depends on

18
00:01:45,902 --> 00:01:52,431
how these currencies would react to some of the oil producing currencies or oil producers actually

19
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:57,029
pegged to the dollar, so it might not be as dramatic as one would think.

20
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:01,765
But, in general, when you have weakening dollar, the most important from an American point of view

21
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:08,721
the most important import of all will probably on the margin become more expensive. [That is, Oil.]

22
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:14,400
We also potentially will have one less buyer going out there and motivating

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,467
either directly buying or motivating other people to buy US debt.

24
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:26,461
The debt might become more expensive. [So, debt could become more expensive in the United States].

25
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:32,067
When I say, debt becomes expensive, interest rates would go up. Of course, this is hugely dependent on what the US FED does.

26
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:37,347
what the US FED does. It could step in, it could continue to print more money and essentially could

27
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:44,026
keep debt cheap. It doesn't look as good optically. Now, the last and probably most important question is

28
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:51,363
to some degree, once again not a clear cut answer. [What happens to US manufacturing?]

29
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:57,255
The argument has been that essentially China has been able to produce cheaper than they would have

30
00:02:57,255 --> 00:03:01,133
naturally would have able to produce, by keeping their currency devalue.

31
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:11,351
That essentially steal the industrial base from the United States. Will this come back or will some of this come back from China or other countries?

32
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:17,277
It is true that the weaker US currency will help the US exports.

33
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:24,289
What's less clear is whether the industries that are labor dependent and require may be huge amount of skill.

34
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:32,207
Whether those are going to come back from Asia? I suspect, like as I said in video on China. Those are either probably going to stay in Asia or where

35
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:32,707
they might move if the Chinese currency got stronger. I would think that other parts of Asia. May be South Asia, may be Latin America, if they could get their act together.

36
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:50,760
Those are may be more natural places to go, as they have the cheap labor and lower standards of living right now.

37
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,751
What they would need to compete with China in particular is essentially have the infrastructure,

38
00:03:56,751 --> 00:04:02,533
the systems, the efficiency, the scale in place to compete effectively. So, these are probably the people

39
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:07,757
that China has to worry about the most if they revalue their currency, not so much the United States,

40
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:12,215
although it will help the US manufacturing on the margin to have a weaker currency.

41
00:04:12,215 --> 99:59:59,999
