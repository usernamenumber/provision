1
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,881
We are faced with a fairly daunting looking

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:07,832
indefinite integral of pi over x natural log of x dx.

3
00:00:07,832 --> 00:00:11,380
Now what could we do to address this?

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,700
Is u-substitution a possibility here?

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,810
Well, for u substitution, we want to look for an expression and its derivative.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,776
Well, what happens if we set u equal to the natural log of x?

7
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,445
Now what would "d u" be equal to in that scenario?

8
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:32,967
"du" is going to be the derivative of the natural log of x with respect to x

9
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:37,767
which is just 1 over x d x.

10
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:44,833
This is an equivalent statement to saying that d u d x is equal to one over x.

11
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:50,157
So do we see the one over x anywhere in this original expression?

12
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:51,300
Well, it's kind of hiding

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,200
it's not so obvious, but this x in the denominator is essentially

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,167
one over x and that's being multiplied by dx.

15
00:00:57,167 --> 00:01:00,500
Let me rewrite this original expression to make a little bit more sense.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,138
So the first thing I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna take

17
00:01:02,138 --> 00:01:04,233
the pi - I should do that in a different color

18
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,411
since I've already used...

19
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:08,547
let me take the pi and just take it out front.

20
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:11,633
Imma just take the pi right in front of the integral.

21
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:13,795
And so this is gonna become the integral of -

22
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:16,967
and let me write the one over the natural log of x first.

23
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,950
one over the natural log of x

24
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,550
times one over x

25
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,454
dx

26
00:01:23,454 --> 00:01:24,300
Now it becomes a little bit clearer.

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,167
These are completely equivalent statements.

28
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:30,967
But this makes it clear that yes,

29
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:33,700
u substitution will work over here.

30
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,922
We set our u equal to natural log of x.

31
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:39,337
Then our d u is one over x d x.

32
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:41,473
One over x d x.

33
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:44,633
Our d u is one over x d x.

34
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:46,535
Let's rewrite this integral.

35
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:47,603
It's going to be equal to

36
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:52,386
pi times the indefinite integral of

37
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:54,567
one over u

38
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:57,402
natural log of x is u

39
00:01:57,402 --> 00:01:59,445
we set that equal to natural log of x

40
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:02,046
times du

41
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:04,972
times du

42
00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:06,179
Now this becomes pretty straightforward.

43
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,594
What is the antiderivative of all this business?

44
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:09,801
And we've done very

45
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:11,798
similar things like this multiple times already.

46
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,470
This is going to be equal to

47
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,606
pi

48
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:17,700
times the natural log

49
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,551
the natural log of the absolute value

50
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:23,455
of u

51
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:26,380
so that we can handle even negative values of u

52
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,284
the natural log of the absolute value of u

53
00:02:28,284 --> 00:02:30,189
plus c

54
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:32,139
ok, so we have a constant factor out here.

55
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:33,857
plus c

56
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:36,876
And we're almost done, we just have to un-substitute for the u.

57
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:38,700
U is equal to natural log of x.

58
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,900
So we end up with this kind of neat looking expression.

59
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,888
The anti of this entire indefinite integral, we have simplified

60
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:44,967
we have evaluated it

61
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:46,833
and it is now equal to pi

62
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,033
times the natural log

63
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:53,100
of the absolute value of u

64
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,148
but u is just the natural log of x

65
00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:57,727
the natural log of x

66
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:02,046
and then we have this plus c

67
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:03,033
right over here.

68
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:04,967
And we could've assumed that from the get-go

69
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,633
this original expression

70
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:10,100
was only defined for positive values of x

71
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,938
because you have to take the natural log here

72
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:13,053
and there wasn't a absolute value.

73
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:17,233
So we can leave this as just a natural log of x

74
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,700
But this also works for the situations now

75
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,737
cause we're taking the absolute value of that

76
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:25,033
where the ln of x might have been a negative number.

77
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,613
for example if it was a natural log of

78
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:31,396
.5 or who knows whoever it might be.

79
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:33,100
But we are all done.

80
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,900
We have simplified what seemed

81
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,900
like a kind of daunting expression.
