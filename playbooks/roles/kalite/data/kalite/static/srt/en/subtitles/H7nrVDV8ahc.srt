1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870
   

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,150
SAL: The notion of a half-life
is useful, if we're dealing

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,950
with increments of time that are
multiples of a half-life.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,980
For example, where time
equals zero, we

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,190
have 100% of our substance.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,580
Then after time equals one
half-life, we'd have 50% of

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,550
our substance.

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,350
At time is equal to two
half-lives, we'd have 25% of

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,440
our substance, and so
on and so forth.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,300
So if I say that three
half-lives have gone by-- in

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,740
the case of carbon that would
be, what, roughly 15,000

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,840
years-- I can tell you roughly,
or almost exactly,

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,030
what percentage of my original
element I still have. In the

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,390
case of carbon-14, I'll tell
you what percentage of my

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,570
original carbon-14 has not
decayed into nitrogen, as yet,

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,880
nitrogen-14.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,110
And that's useful, but what if I
care about how much carbon I

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,460
have after 1/2 a year, or after
1/2 a half life, or

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,510
after three billion years,
or after 10 minutes?

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,980
What if I want a general
function.

21
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,190
A general function, as a
function of time, that tells

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,430
me the number, or the amount,
of my decaying substance I

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,670
have. So that's what we're going
to do in this video.

24
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,460
And it's going to be a little
mathy, but I think the math is

25
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,180
pretty straightforward,
especially if you've taken a

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,030
first-year course in calculus.

27
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,650
And this is actually a pretty
neat application of it.

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,050
So let's just think a little bit
about the rate of change,

29
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,090
or the probability, or the
number particles that are

30
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,390
changing at any given time.

31
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,910
So if we say, the difference
or change in our number of

32
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,750
particles, or the amount of
particles, in any very small

33
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,140
period of time, what's this
going to be dependent on?

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,850
This is the number particles
we have in a

35
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,860
given period time.

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,160
This is our rate of change.

37
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,420
So one thing, we know that our
rate of change is going down.

38
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,960
We know it's a negative
number.

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,390
We know that, in the case of
radioactive decay, I could do

40
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,150
the same exercise with
compounding growth, where I

41
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,470
would say, oh no, it's not a
negative number, that our

42
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,680
growth is dependent on how much
we have. In this case the

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,800
amount we're decaying is
proportional, but it's going

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,400
to be the negative of how much
of the actual compound we

45
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,229
already have.

46
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,800
Let me explain that.

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,620
So what I'm saying is, look,
our amount of decay is

48
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,830
proportional to the amount of
the substance that we already

49
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,200
are dealing with.

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,700
And just to maybe make that a
little bit more intuitive,

51
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,270
imagine a situation here
where you have 1

52
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,320
times 10 to the 9th.

53
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,750
You have a billion carbon atoms.
And let's say over here

54
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,020
you have 1 times 10 to the 6th
carbon atoms. And if you look

55
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,260
at it at over some small period
of time, let's say, if

56
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,250
you look at it over one second,
let's say our dt.

57
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,800
dt as an infinitesimally small
time, but let's say it's a

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,670
change in time.

59
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,610
It's a delta t.

60
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,080
And let's say over one second,
you observe that this sample

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,720
had, I don't know, let's say you
saw 1000 carbon particles.

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,970
You really wouldn't see that
with carbon-14, but this is

63
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,840
just for the sake of
our intuition.

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,910
Let's say over one second you
saw 1000 carbon particles per

65
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,020
second here.

66
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,990
Well here you have 1000th of the
number particles in this

67
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,600
sample as this one.

68
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,340
So, for every thousand particles
you saw decaying

69
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,810
here, you'd really expect to
see one carbon particle per

70
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,380
second here.

71
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,260
Just because you have
a smaller amount.

72
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,570
Now I don't know what the
actual constant is.

73
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,040
But we know that no matter what
substance we're talking

74
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,060
about, this constant is
dependent on the substance.

75
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,510
Carbon's going to be different
from uranium, is going to be

76
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,810
different from, you know,
we looked at radon.

77
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,400
They're all going to
have different

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,710
quantities right here.

79
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,390
And we can see that.

80
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,670
We'll actually do it in the next
video, you can actually

81
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,170
calculate this from
the half-life.

82
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,930
But the rate of change is always
going to be dependent

83
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,380
on the number of particles
you have, right?

84
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,950
I mean, we saw that here
with half-life.

85
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,340
When you have 1/2 the
number of particles,

86
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,270
you lose 1/2 as much.

87
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,180
Here, if we start with 100
particles here, we went to 50

88
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,070
particles, then we went to 25.

89
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,115
When you start with 50, in a
period of time you lose 25.

90
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:06,230
When you start with
100, you lose 50.

91
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,700
So clearly the amount you lose
is dependent on the amount you

92
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,400
started with, right?

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,270
Over any fraction of
time, and here it's

94
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,840
a very small fraction.

95
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,279
So what I set up here is really
fairly simple, but it

96
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,940
doesn't sound so simple to a lot
of people if you say it's

97
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,400
a differential equation.

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,600
We can actually solve this using
pretty straightforward

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,860
techniques.

100
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,750
This is actually a separation
of variables problem.

101
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,490
And so, what can we do?

102
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,162
Let's divide both sides by N.

103
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:39,920
We want to get all the N's on
this side and all the t stuff

104
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,200
on the other side.

105
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,460
So if we have 1 over
N, dN over dt is

106
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,910
equal to minus lambda.

107
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,560
I just divided both sides
of this by N.

108
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,230
And then I can multiply both
sides of this by dt, and I get

109
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:05,520
1 over N dN is equal
to minus lambda dt.

110
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,530
Now I can take the integral of
both sides of this equation.

111
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,110
   

112
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,740
And what do I get?

113
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,200
What's the antiderivative?

114
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,370
I'm taking the indefinite
integral or the

115
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:16,540
antiderivative.

116
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,930
What's the antiderivative
of 1 over N?

117
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:29,460
Well that's the natural log of
N plus some constant-- I'll

118
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,400
just do that in blue--
plus some constant.

119
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,050
And then that equals-- What's
the antiderivative of just

120
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,570
some constant?

121
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,880
Well it's just that
constant times the

122
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,980
derivative, the variable.

123
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,360
We're taking the antiderivative

124
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,725
with respect to.

125
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:48,840
So minus lambda, times t,
plus some constant.

126
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,630
These are different constants,
but they're arbitrary.

127
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,930
So if we want, we can just
subtract that constant from

128
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,130
that constant, and put them all
on one side and then we

129
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,120
just get another constant.

130
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,260
So this boils down to our
solution to our differential

131
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:06,490
equation is the natural log of
N is equal to minus lambda-t,

132
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,410
plus some other constant, I call
it c3, it doesn't matter.

133
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,110
And now if we want to just make
this a function of N in

134
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,460
terms of t, let's take both of
these, or both take e to the

135
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,920
power of both sides of this.

136
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,350
You can view that as kind of
the inverse natural log.

137
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,150
So e to the power of ln of N,
ln of N is just saying what

138
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,420
power do you raise
e to to get to N?

139
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,720
So if you raise e to that
power, you get N.

140
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,120
So I'm just raising both
sides of this equation.

141
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,220
I'm raising e to both sides
of this equation.

142
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,650
e to the ln of N is just N.

143
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:50,570
And that is equal to e to the
minus lambda-t, plus c3.

144
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,770
And now this can be rewritten
as, N is equal to e to the

145
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,350
minus lambda-t, times
e to the c3.

146
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,630
And now once again this is an
arbitrary constant, so we can

147
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,450
just really rename that as,
I don't know, let me

148
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,700
rename it as c4.

149
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,200
   

150
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,660
So, our solution to our
differential equation, N, as a

151
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,870
function of t, is equal to
our c4 constant, c4e

152
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,030
to the minus lambda-t.

153
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,330
Now let's say, even better,
let's say is N equals 0.

154
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,400
Let's say that N equals 0.

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,130
We have N sub 0 of our sample.

156
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,680
That's how much we're
starting off with.

157
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,830
So let's see if we can
substitute that into our

158
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,990
equation to solve for c4.

159
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:45,510
So we said N sub-0 is equal to,
let's put 0 in here, so

160
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,930
let's see, that's equal
to N sub naught.

161
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:56,750
And that's equal to c4 times e
to the minus lambda, times 0.

162
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,770
Well, minus anything
times 0 is 0.

163
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,300
So it's e to the 0.

164
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,710
So that's just 1.

165
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,760
So c4 is equal to N naught,
our starting

166
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,770
amount for the sample.

167
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,020
So we've actually got
an expression.

168
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,560
We have the number of particles,
or the amount as a

169
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,080
function of t, is equal to the
amount that we start off with,

170
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,220
at time is equal to 0,
times e to the minus

171
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,190
lambda, times time.

172
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,010
And we just have to be careful
that we're always using the

173
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,610
time constant when we solve
for the different

174
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,590
coefficients.

175
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,830
So this seems all abstract.

176
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,049
How does this relate
to half-life?

177
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,390
Well let's try to figure out
this equation for carbon.

178
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,190
This'll be true for
anything where we

179
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,200
have radioactive decay.

180
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,150
If we actually had a plus sign
here it'd be exponential

181
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,039
growth as well.

182
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:57,260
We know that carbon, c-14, has
a 5,700-year half-life.

183
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,060
So the way you could think about
it, is if at time equals

184
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:08,240
0 you start off with t-- So time
equals 0. t equals-- let

185
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,020
me write that down.

186
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,000
If at N of 0 is equal to--
and we could write

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,240
100 there if we want.

188
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,090
Actually why don't we do that?

189
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,530
If N of 0 we start
off with 100.

190
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:25,800
And then at N of 5,700 years--
so we're going to take t to be

191
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,620
in years, you just have to be
consistent with your units--

192
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,740
how much will we have left?

193
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,440
We'll have 50 left.

194
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,096
We could have written x and x
over two here, and it would

195
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:35,690
have all have worked
out in the end.

196
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,980
So let's see, let's apply that
to this equation and try to

197
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,460
solve this for lambda.

198
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,770
So we know N of 0
is equal to 100.

199
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:51,060
So we immediately know that we
can write this equation as N

200
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:57,520
of t is equal to 100e, to the
minus lambda-t, at least in

201
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,080
this exact circumstance.

202
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,800
   

203
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,450
And we also know that N of
5,700-- so that means, N of

204
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,600
5,700-- that is equal to,
we just said, that's one

205
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,450
half-life away.

206
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,020
So we have 1/2 as much
of our compound left.

207
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:25,560
That's equal to 50, which is
equal to the 5,700th power

208
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,830
times lambda.

209
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,500
So it's equal to 100 times
e, to the minus

210
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,770
lambda, times 5,700.

211
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,940
And now we just solve
for lambda.

212
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,240
Then we'll have a general
equation for how much carbon

213
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,470
we have at any given
moment in time.

214
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,850
So if you divide both sides
of this by 100.

215
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,160
What do we get?

216
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,230
We get 0.5, we have 1/2, is
equal to e to the-- let me

217
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,200
just write minus 5,700 lambda,
and then we could take the

218
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,010
natural log of both sides.

219
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,350
So then we get-- scroll down a
bit-- the natural log of 1/2

220
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,140
is equal to the-- the natural
log of this is just minus

221
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,890
5,700 lambda.

222
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,510
To solve for lambda, you get
lambda is equal to the natural

223
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:16,210
log of 1/2, over minus 5,700.

224
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,990
So let me see what that is.

225
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,980
Let's see what that is.

226
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:30,980
So 0.5 natural log is that,
divided by minus 5,700.

227
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:38,456
5,700 negative is equal to 1.2
times 10 to the negative 4.

228
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:43,410
Is equal to 1.21 times
10 to the minus 4.

229
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,370
So there you have it, we
figured out our lambda.

230
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,440
So the general equation for
how much carbon-14 we can

231
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,340
expect at any moment in time,
t, where t is in years, is N

232
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,340
of t is equal to the amount of
carbon we start off with,

233
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,280
times e to the minus lambda.

234
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,780
The minus lambda is 1.21
times 10 to the minus

235
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,350
4, times t in years.

236
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,500
So now if you say after 1/2 a
year, you just plug it in and,

237
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,630
you have to tell me how much you
started off with, and then

238
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,870
I can tell you how much you
have after 1/2 a year, or

239
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,060
after a billion years, or
after a gazillion years.

240
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,360
And we'll do a lot
more of these

241
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,350
problems in the next video.

242
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,400
