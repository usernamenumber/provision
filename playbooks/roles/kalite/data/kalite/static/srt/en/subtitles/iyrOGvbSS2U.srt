You might be wondering why the exchange might be willing to

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
take on counter party risk for people exchanging

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these kind of standardized future contracts

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and tthe first reason is that exchange actually.... to make a lot of money

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what he can do is, tell these people who want to buy apples in the future

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Say for example... Hey...

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can enter into a futures contract with a settlement price of 22 cents per pound

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So thats what they are going to have to come to the table with.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's 22 Cents per pound...

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And he can tell the people who are going to deliver the apples that

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When you deliver the apples the settlement price is 20 cents per pound

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so essentially when the settlement occurs,

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he is going to be able to make a 2 cent profit

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he is going to make, a 2 cent profit

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me review that again,

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He only has to pay these guys 20 cents per pound for the apple,

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and these guys are paying 22 cents per pound for the apple,

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and, may be I should let this arrow go in this direction, cos this is the actual flow of the money

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if these guys are gonna pay 22 cents for the apple

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and as the exchange, he is gonna give only 20 cents to the farmer,

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he is going to make 2 cents profit, on future contracts,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on.. on thousand pounds of apple...

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's going to be 20 dollars for each of those contracts

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So thats gonna be 20 dollars....

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
20 dollars... per... 20 dollars per contract

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and he is going to be doing this night and day,

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
trading with all of the different farmers and all of the different customers

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and even some speculators, who might want to do this

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so may be if the, spread... if he can maintain this 2 cent spread,

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he'll keep making 20 dollars, every time one of these future contracts exchange hands,

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now the other way he is going to protect himself against losses,

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is, he is going to make each of these parties set aside some money,

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in case... In case the future contracts price moves against them,

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this money that they have to set aside is called margin...

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll explain this in more detail in future video

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but what it essentially is, the amount of money that this guy,

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or the amount... the largest amount that this guy...

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thniks that the future price might move by,

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the contract price move by on any given day,

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so he has a cushion, he can actually use margin as kind of insurance.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So he can make sure that on the settlement day, both parties

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will kind of be able to meet their obligations

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I will go into more detail about that in next video,

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on exactly how margin works.
