1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,738
Let's think about how hydrogen bromide might react

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:05,920
with this thing right here.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,390
Let's think about what this would be called.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,210
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 carbons.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,896
It has a double bond right here

6
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:13,457
if we start numbering at this end

7
00:00:13,457 --> 00:00:15,228
because that's where the double bond is

8
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:19,276
then this would be pent.

9
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:22,510
the double bond starts at the number 1 carbon, pent-1

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,080
and it's obviously an alkene.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,330
It has a double bond, so it's pent-1-ene.

12
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,490
Sometimes this is called 1-pentene, either way.

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,044
So let's think about how these two characters

14
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:36,930
might react with each other in some type of solvent.

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,953
Usually when a solvent's not specified

16
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:40,880
it's usually water or alcohol.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,885
If this was water

18
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:45,136
then we would have a solution of hydrobromic acid

19
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:46,135
but let's not worry about that right now.

20
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:49,204
Let's just worry about how these two characters

21
00:00:49,204 --> 00:00:50,920
might react with each other.

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,567
Now, the first thing we might look at

23
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,500
is this hydrogen bromide right there.

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,552
And as you get more experience there

25
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:57,447
you'll say, well, you know

26
00:00:57,447 --> 00:01:00,434
bromine is much more electronegative than hydrogen.

27
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:02,762
It likes to hog electrons much more.

28
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:05,792
If that's a completely foreign concept to you

29
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,140
I'll do a little bit of a review.

30
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,688
This is the Periodic Table.

31
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:11,900
Electronegativity increases from the bottom left

32
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,337
to the top right of the Periodic Table.

33
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:20,119
Electronegativity.

34
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,687
And really, that's just a fancy way of saying

35
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:26,780
how much does an atom like to hog electrons.

36
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,850
So, for example, fluorine loves to hog electrons

37
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,350
and calcium doesn't like to hog electrons so much.

38
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,435
So if we think about hydrogen bromide

39
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:38,821
hydrogen's way up here

40
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:41,105
on the left side of the Periodic Table

41
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:43,680
bromine's all the way to the right.

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,460
Bromine is much more electronegative.

43
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,735
So in this situation

44
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:49,485
since bromine is more electronegative

45
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,890
it will hog the electrons in this bond.

46
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,640
And since it's hogging the electrons in this bond

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,799
you'll have a partial negative charge

48
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,627
on the bromine end

49
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:04,367
and you'll have a partial positive charge

50
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,133
on the hydrogen end.

51
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,779
And, whenever you do these reactions

52
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:09,789
it's actually useful to draw all the valence electrons.

53
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:14,120
So bromine right here has an atomic number of 35

54
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,980
which means it has 35 electrons in its neutral state.

55
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,610
And we don't have any charge here

56
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,160
so it's in a neutral state.

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,010
But you can look at its group.

58
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,540
It's in Group Number 7.

59
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,693
If you just count from here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

60
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,729
or has 7 valence electrons. Let me draw that.

61
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:32,470
Seven electrons in its outermost shell.

62
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,100
Let me draw them right here.

63
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,330
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

64
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,530
and then the 7th is in the bond with the hydrogen.

65
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,684
Hydrogen obviously has one electron.

66
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:46,915
It's right there.

67
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:48,692
So these two guys are bonding with each other

68
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:50,128
and they both allow each other

69
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,095
to pretend that they're part of a pair.

70
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:54,070
And that's what gives it a lower energy level

71
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,770
or makes it a little more stable.

72
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,910
That's why the bond forms in the first place.

73
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,780
But anyway, let's think about what might happen here.

74
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,483
This guy is really electronegative

75
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:05,590
so maybe he wants to take this electron away

76
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,720
this green hydrogen electron.

77
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,822
And maybe that happens. Let me just draw it out.

78
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:16,360
So he takes that electron, that green electron, away.

79
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,780
It's just getting closer and closer.

80
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,273
If there was only some other place

81
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:22,703
that this hydrogen could get an electron from

82
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,844
then this guy could just go to the bromine

83
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:27,008
which is what bromine really wants to happen

84
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:28,410
because it's so electronegative.

85
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,961
So where can the hydrogen get an electron

86
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,320
to replace the one that it's about to lose?

87
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,820
Well, we have a double bond here.

88
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,020
And maybe one of these carbons lose an electron.

89
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,491
And in future videos, we'll talk more about

90
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:43,287
which one is more likely to give up the electron

91
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,650
at this stage of the reaction.

92
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,488
But just for simplicity, let's assume that

93
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:52,880
this carbon right here gives up an electron.

94
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,410
Where are its valence electrons?

95
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,726
And just as a bit a review

96
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:57,710
here's a carbon on the Periodic Table.

97
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:03,202
it has 6 protons and 6 electrons in its stable state.

98
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,956
Two are sitting in its first shell

99
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:08,043
and then the other 4 are its valence electrons.

100
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:14,208
And you can see that. It's in Group 4, right? 1, 2, 3, 4

101
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,556
We can ignore these for now

102
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,291
and usually you're not going to be dealing with

103
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,751
well, we'll ignore those for now.

104
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:20,670
It has four valence electrons.

105
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,219
Most of what you're going to deal with

106
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:23,890
you just have to count the group numbers like this.

107
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,290
We won't worry too much about all of the metals

108
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,930
and all of those right now.

109
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,063
That's 4 valence electrons and you see it right here.

110
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:34,470
It has 1, 2, 3, 4 valence electrons.

111
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,700
It has 2 in its one shell, so it actually has 6

112
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,720
but you only draw the 4 out there.

113
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,270
So what we're saying is

114
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,819
this green electron can go to the bromine

115
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:45,637
as long as the hydrogen can take an electron

116
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:47,710
maybe from this carbon right here.

117
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,333
So let's draw that. So this electron right here

118
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,070
is going to go to the hydrogen.

119
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,160
And when that electron goes to the hydrogen

120
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,168
simultaneously that will allow this electron

121
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:57,962
to go to bromine.

122
00:04:57,962 --> 00:05:00,080
And obviously, they won't be this far when it happens.

123
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,471
There would be some type of collision

124
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,874
that would have to occur in just the right way

125
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:06,510
with just the right level of energy for this to occur.

126
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,004
Maybe the hydrogen is getting really close to this part

127
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:11,348
right at the right moment, when this electron

128
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,150
is being sucked away from the bromine

129
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,141
so this has a partial positive charge

130
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:16,233
attracted to the electron.

131
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,630
That electron goes over there.

132
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,773
It won't always happen

133
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:21,010
but this is a potential reaction mechanism.

134
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,730
But this whole step happens at once.

135
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,028
This electron goes from this character

136
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:26,905
to the hydrogen, at the same time

137
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:31,600
as hydrogen loses its electron to the bromine.

138
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,068
So what's going to happen right after this step?

139
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:39,161
So right after that happens

140
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:41,459
what will everything look like?

141
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:46,540
Well, the bromine will have gained the electron

142
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,806
so it's now a bromide ion.

143
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,700
So let me draw it like this.

144
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,524
So it had its original 7 valence electrons

145
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:57,268
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

146
00:05:57,268 --> 00:06:00,728
and now it just stole an electron from the hydrogen.

147
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,950
It was able to swipe an electron off the hydrogen.

148
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,250
That's the electron it swiped off the hydrogen.

149
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,282
And now what will this thing

150
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,797
that was 1-pentene or pent-1-ene

151
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:11,080
what will this look like now? Let me draw it.

152
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,710
So we have a carbon and a hydrogen and a hydrogen

153
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,710
and then you have a carbon, and then a hydrogen

154
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:27,918
then you have the rest of the chain right over here.

155
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:29,400
But this double bond was broken.

156
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,442
This carbon lost an electron, went to the hydrogen.

157
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:34,825
So this bond right here now forms

158
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:36,730
between this carbon and that hydrogen.

159
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,994
So let me draw that bond.

160
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:42,490
You have this electron right there.

161
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,640
That electron will now be with the hydrogen.

162
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,270
So let me draw the electron.

163
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,340
And now we have that orange hydrogen.

164
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,843
I'll try to keep the colors consistent

165
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,490
so that we know where things came from.

166
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,070
And then we have this bond now to the hydrogen.

167
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,580
Now, this carbon now only has 3 valence electrons.

168
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,881
1, 2, 3. It has two sitting in its first shell

169
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,000
so it actually has a total of five electrons.

170
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,350
It has 6 protons, so it has a positive charge.

171
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,900
This carbon right here has a positive charge.

172
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,337
And another way to think about it is

173
00:07:15,337 --> 00:07:17,780
it was completely neutral and then it lost an electron.

174
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,290
So now it will have a positive charge right over there.

175
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:25,621
So this's what we're left after that step of the reaction.

176
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:26,754
Oh, and of course, we can't forget.

177
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,730
Bromine over here was neutral.

178
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,328
It had seven valence electrons

179
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:31,550
and that's when bromine is neutral.

180
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,621
But now it has eight

181
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:38,037
so now this will have a negative charge

182
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:39,769
because it gained an electron.

183
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:41,599
And in general, your total charge

184
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,539
over here our total charge is 0

185
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:45,490
so our total charge will still be 0.

186
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,737
We have a negative and we have a positive.

187
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:50,240
They would cancel out, so our total charge is still 0.

188
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,855
So what's likely to happen

189
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,675
for the next step of our reaction?

190
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,340
Well, we have this positive thing here.

191
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,538
Maybe bromine just bumped, just the right way

192
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:03,020
to let go of this guy and steal his electron.

193
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,106
But now you have this guy who's negative

194
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:06,828
and this guy who's positive.

195
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:08,400
Maybe they'll be attracted to each other.

196
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,240
Maybe they'll just bump into each other

197
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,340
at the exact right way.

198
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,681
And if they bump in the exact right way

199
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:16,820
maybe this guy can swipe the electron

200
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,957
from the bromide ion

201
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,841
from this negative ion right here.

202
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:22,505
And you might say, hey,

203
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:25,190
isn't bromine more electronegative than carbon?

204
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,500
Well, it might be, but this guy's electron rich.

205
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,253
It's not just a regular bromine atom.

206
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:33,190
This is a bromine plus an extra electron.

207
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,774
So he's already hogged an electron

208
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:36,750
so he's electron rich.

209
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,194
So in this situation, he's negative. He's positive.

210
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:42,360
He can give this guy an electron.

211
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,629
So if they bump in just the right way, this electron

212
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:52,070
can be swiped by this carbon right over here.

213
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,223
And this positive carbon

214
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:54,515
just so it gives you a little terminology

215
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:57,315
and we'll go over it in more detail in future videos

216
00:08:57,315 --> 00:08:59,510
is actually called a carbocation.

217
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,370
It's a positive ion of carbon.

218
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,160
That's where the word comes from.

219
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,801
But anyway

220
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:06,781
if this electron gets swiped by this carbon

221
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:07,720
it will then form a bond.

222
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,164
Because remember, this was the electron

223
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:12,730
that was originally in a bond with this hydrogen.

224
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,295
It's still going to be, you could imagine, paired up with

225
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:19,000
this other purple or magenta electron right over there.

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,370
So if that happens, then we're going to be left with

227
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,556
so the next step is going to be

228
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:26,184
so on this end of the molecule

229
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:29,687
we have C, carbon, hydrogen, hydrogen.

230
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:31,562
Then we have this orange hydrogen

231
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:34,270
that we stole from the hydrogen bromide.

232
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:39,440
Then we have this carbon right here.

233
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,700
It has a hydrogen.

234
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:47,174
You have the rest of the chain, CH2-CH2-CH3.

235
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:49,379
And now, since this guy stole an electron

236
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,034
a bond will form with the bromine.

237
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:59,780
Let me draw it. So he's going to steal this

238
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,943
So a bond will form.

239
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:02,105
He's stealing this electron

240
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:04,019
so now this electron is with this carbon

241
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,422
so I can do it as one end of the bond.

242
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:06,385
The other end of the bond will be

243
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:10,340
that magenta electron right there on the bromine.

244
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,490
Now the bromine lost an electron. So it's neutral.

245
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:19,481
It once again has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 valence electrons.

246
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:21,920
Carbon is now neutral, because it gained an electron.

247
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,982
It once again has 1, 2, 3, 4 electrons.

248
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:27,650
So now everyone is happy again.

249
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,360
In this video, we were able to get a mechanism.

250
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,479
We can talk in the future about

251
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,693
how likely it is to happen

252
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,060
how quickly it might happen.

253
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,175
We were able to start with hydrogen bromide

254
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:40,720
and 1-pentene, or pent-1-ene, and get to this thing

255
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,117
just by pushing around electrons

256
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:43,969
and just thinking about what is likely to happen

257
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:45,514
based on what's electronegative

258
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,243
and what might be able to gain or lose an electron.

259
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:49,372
And just a bit of a review

260
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:50,580
what is this thing right here?

261
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,809
This might be-- This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 carbons, still.

262
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:56,743
So it's going to be a pent.

263
00:10:56,743 --> 00:11:01,974
It's now an alkane, no double bond. So it's pentane.

264
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:03,474
And it has one group on it

265
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:04,899
so we'll start numbering closer to the group.

266
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:12,074
So 1, 2. It's 2-bromopentane.

267
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:13,939
So we were able to figure out a reaction mechanism

268
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:18,121
to get us from hydrogen bromide and 1-pentene

269
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:21,199
to 2-bromopentane.
