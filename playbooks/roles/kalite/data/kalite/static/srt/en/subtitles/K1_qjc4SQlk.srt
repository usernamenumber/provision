1
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:10,419
So, we thought we'd talk about Picasso's
great painting, called "Guernica,"

2
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:12,902
which actually, I remember seeing very many times,

3
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:14,886
because it used to be in the Museum of Modern Art

4
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:16,752
before it was sent back to Spain.

5
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:20,603
- Yeah, it was. I kind of feel like I grew up with this painting.

6
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,602
- Yeah, me too.

7
00:00:21,602 --> 00:00:23,087
- It was always such a powerful presence at MOMA.

8
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:25,919
- Yeah. And it was in a very small little room, so it was very intense.

9
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:28,520
- It was. It was. You know what was interesting is that actually,

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,401
in Picasso's will, he lent it to MOMA

11
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:35,117
until such time as Spain became a democracy again.

12
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:38,350
And remember, Franco lived for a very long time.

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,653
And this painting was made as a response to Franco -

14
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:45,001
- Well, to a specific event, the Spanish Civil War -

15
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,216
- A terrible, terrible event -

16
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:48,434
and this is such a loaded and powerful painting

17
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:51,318
and has had such an impact, both when it was made

18
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,901
and long afterwards.

19
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:55,800
- Yes, we can talk about two . . .

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,700
So, maybe we should talk about the historical circumstances

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,568
in which it was made.

22
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:04,183
It's a gigantic painting, and it was made by Picasso in Paris

23
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:07,600
at the request of one of two Spanish governments

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,050
that existed at that moment.

25
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,617
Remember, there was a civil war going on in Spain,

26
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:15,300
and on one side were the Fascists, led by Franco,

27
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,551
who would win the Spanish Civil War.

28
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:22,134
But on the other side were what were called the Republicans.

29
00:01:22,134 --> 00:01:25,715
It has nothing to do with American 
Republicans versus Democrats.

30
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:29,167
But these were people who wanted a democracy,

31
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:31,016
and they tended to be a bit more on the left,

32
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:33,299
whereas Franco tended to be very much on the right

33
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,726
of this political spectrum, in a much more extreme sense

34
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:39,874
than we have today. And what happened was that

35
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:42,859
Franco was trying to intimidate the population.

36
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:46,125
You have to remember, this is . . . we're talking about 1937 now.

37
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,958
This is before the second World War.

38
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,225
There had been the horrors of the First World War,

39
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:55,126
and there had been the rise of Fascism in Spain,

40
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:57,659
in Italy, in Russia -

41
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,177
-and Germany.

42
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:02,294
-and Germany, absolutely.

43
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:04,943
-and what happened was, was that Franco decided

44
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:08,976
to unleash violence directly on a civilian population

45
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:12,944
in order to really cow that population,

46
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:14,309
and to assert his power.

47
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:15,642
- and to consolidate his power.

48
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:17,229
- Absolutely. And so what he did is,

49
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:20,379
he actually was in touch with Hitler in Germany,

50
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:25,247
and he allowed Hitler to test out some of his bombers

51
00:02:25,247 --> 00:02:26,763
on the city of Guernica.

52
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:28,012
-Hard to believe.

53
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:30,196
-It's really incredible. And Picasso was so horrified by this-

54
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:33,729
- the world was horrified by this - by the bombings,

55
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:37,279
and the mass civilian casualties that resulted.

56
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,528
Guernica was not a military target.

57
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:40,811
-Guernica's a little town.

58
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:45,661
-It's a little town. And this is a painting that was Picasso's

59
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:48,162
sort of, visceral response to this, that was made

60
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:52,744
specifically for an international exhibition in Paris,

61
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:54,179
a kind of World's Fair.

62
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:58,295
So, maybe we should talk about what we see.

63
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:01,828
-Yeah, it's a . . . it's a very powerful image against

64
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:05,061
the horrors of wars, I think in the tradition of

65
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,912
Goya's "Third of May."

66
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:09,745
- or David's "The Oath of the Horatii."

67
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:12,744
But you know, those were really old paintings.

68
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:14,595
And when you think about the 20th century,

69
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,161
when this was made, history painting,which is

70
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:18,078
what we were just referring to,

71
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:20,011
it didn't exist, really, anymore.

72
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:22,811
So a lot of people have credited Picasso with

73
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,811
almost single-handedly re-establishing the importance

74
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:29,411
of grand history painting. And I think for him,

75
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:34,710
this event required that kind of solemnness, that kind of import.

76
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,278
-Of the tradition of history painting. There are so many things

77
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:40,711
that remind me of Goya.

78
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:43,362
The figure in the foreground, for example, who's all

79
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:47,512
splayed out with a knife in his hand,

80
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:51,111
like the Spanish peasants in Goya,

81
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:53,144
Christlike in their martyrdom.

82
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:55,461
-The other thing that really reminds me of Goya here

83
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:59,295
is Picasso's choice to do this painting in black and white -

84
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:00,960
- black, white and grays, right.

85
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,661
- and, you know, Goya's painting is in color,

86
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:07,128
but it's all so starkly lit that it might as well be -

87
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:09,262
- Right, and it's about the forces of darkness,

88
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:11,044
and the forces of good.

89
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:13,012
- It is, and the contrasts between light and darkness,

90
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:14,344
both in this painting and in the Goya, I think

91
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:17,111
it's very consciously Picasso, another Spaniard

92
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:20,061
recalling that great example of history painting. Yeah, yeah.

93
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:23,528
And that image of the mother and the child on the left,

94
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:24,578
- That's so effective.

95
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:26,845
-I look at this painting and I can almost hear the bombs,

96
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:31,442
and the sirens, and the screaming. It's so palpable.

97
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:33,174
-On the extreme right, you have the woman

98
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:35,274
who's fleeing the burning building, her burning home.

99
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:38,608
And of course this painting is full of symbolism.

100
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,725
There's the horse, of course, screaming

101
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:42,506
There is the broken sword as you had mentioned,

102
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:45,306
And then, I think, really potent and really curious and

103
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:49,439
interesting is the light source itself, that lamp.

104
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,291
You know, people have said it looks like a human eye.

105
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,372
Perhaps the eye of God.

106
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:55,990
But you have an electric light bulb there.

107
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,824
And also it could function as an explosion.

108
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:00,455
That could be the explosion of the bombs.

109
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:03,602
-I think that's always sort of how it felt to me,

110
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:06,901
looking at that, was like the lights flickering on and off,

111
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:08,985
and explosions, and lights, and the way that lights . . .

112
00:05:08,985 --> 00:05:13,353
you know, explosions sort of make lights flicker,

113
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:18,635
and it has this feeling of the chaos of that moment.

114
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,036
- It really does. It really does.

115
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:23,769
It also kind of vilifies modernity, in the sense of

116
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:26,635
the possibility of having airplanes drop bombs.

117
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:41,936
You know, because it's an electric light bulb, after all.

118
00:05:41,936 --> 00:05:44,352
Something else that I find really interesting here

119
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:46,401
is the cross-hatching. Do you see that,

120
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,869
especially in the body of the horse?

121
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,552
Some art historians have talked about that

122
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:53,235
as a reference to the newsprint that Picasso

123
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:57,303
used to put into his paper collages.

124
00:05:57,303 --> 00:06:00,651
But here, it's actually painted to look like

125
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,019
a little hatching, as if it might be print.

126
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,335
But it's not. So it's sort of self-reference.

127
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:08,801
But also, a reminder that this is a current event.

128
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:17,252
Like Gericault's "Raft of the Medusa,"
this is a tragedy that has just taken place.

129
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,235
And it's a pretty extraordinary painting.

130
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:23,019
And we know that when Colin Powell went to the UN,

131
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,801
to make the case for the war in Iraq,

132
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:29,635
by saying, claiming that, he believed at the time

133
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:33,202
that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,

134
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:39,219
or the Bush administration believed it, and Colin Powell went to make that case at the United Nations

135
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:41,601
they didn't want to take pictures in front of this image.

136
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:47,101
-Well traditionally, the press sessions are in front of

137
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:51,452
a tapestry that was donated to the UN.

138
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,418
-It's a copy of this image.

139
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:55,800
And you're right, he did not want to be seen

140
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,850
in front of that.

141
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,585
-Right, because he was making a case for war.

142
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,601
And here we have this very, you know -

143
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:06,635
-Stark reminder of the price of war.

144
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,101
-Right, and I think it's really important to say

145
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:12,638
that this is represented in a sort of abstract,

146
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:15,121
Cubist kind of representation that, I think,

147
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:16,554
makes it more powerful.

148
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:18,904
I think if this had looked photographic,

149
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:21,122
I don't think it would have the power that it does.

150
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:24,682
I think the ways that the forms are exaggerated,

151
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:28,032
the hands moving up, and across, and all of the ways

152
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:30,583
that we have a kind of exaggeration here

153
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,415
are there to serve the emotional point of the image,

154
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:36,266
of the horrors of war.

155
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:38,647
-And because was brilliant, I think
at doing that.

156
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:43,301
- That formal language of expressing
those emotions.

157
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:47,383
- Yeah, but it form that is used, that
is folded into such a powerful political

158
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,916
and sort of humanistic message.

159
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,867
- Yeah, and it's interesting also because so
much of the history of the 20th century

160
00:07:53,867 --> 00:08:00,364
and of art history is really looking at art
in a way that is very separate

161
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:02,095
from the political arena.

162
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:03,629
- A sanitized formalism.

163
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:08,829
In fact, much of Picasso's other work is
really dealing with the way vision

164
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:12,128
can be represented in a very, very
kind of formal way.

165
00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:15,246
And it's so interesting to see such a 
powerful statement.

166
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:21,012
I mean, there were other examples of Picasso's work,
but here is sort of the great example of the 20th century,

167
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:26,428
of a deeply political painting from an artist who
spent a good deal of his career, you're absolutely right,

168
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:32,095
really focusing on the way we see and the way we
represent what we see.

169
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:37,214
And art historians have written art history
very much in that way for much of the 20th century.

170
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:40,348
- So here is a really successful marriage that does
not separate ...

171
00:08:40,348 --> 00:08:42,080
- Art that is engaged, right?

172
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,080
- In the world, in the most direct way.
