1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,700
Now that we have a general layout in our minds of

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,640
how all of the mechanics are fitting together,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,669
what I want to do in this video is discuss a little bit about

4
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:09,560
why the different actors would do what they are.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,010
How they could benefit or get hurt from this cycle.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,560
And really, why it's so hard to unwind each of the actors,

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,235
why it's so hard for them to unwind themselves from the scenario.

8
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,578
Where I finished off this last video,

9
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:28,920
I talked about more cash being in American pockets

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,158
because of essentially, debt being cheaper,

11
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:33,120
government can spend more money, lower taxes.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,175
And I said that's more money to buy Chinese products,

13
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:42,022
but it's in general more money just for Americans to spend on each other.

14
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:44,800
They might buy each other's houses

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,175
or buy each other's services.

16
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,610
So in a lot of ways, it does stimulate the economy.

17
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,950
For any Keynesians out there, the more you spend,

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,150
that will stimulate the economy, lower taxes.

19
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,770
For more conservatives, that also can stimulate the economy.

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,810
And in general, debt being cheaper, lowers interest rates,

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,470
all of these things stimulate the economy.

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,360
Now, normally when you're stimulating the economy like this,

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,590
and you have all of these factors,

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,150
you have the risk of higher inflation.

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,770
But remember, inflation, or at least price inflation,

26
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,050
is just the price of all of your goods.

27
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,310
But notice, we're buying more and more cheaper goods,

28
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,280
and interest rates are low.

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,760
So to some degree this whole cycle also keeps--

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,461
I guess you could say,

31
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:28,592
the surface growth that the average American consumer experiences

32
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:30,210
looks very positive

33
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,358
and inflation stays slow,

34
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:44,300
so we can also save money to buy each other's services.

35
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,670
Now with that said, let's think about

36
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,970
why the different actors want to do this.

37
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,831
So let's think about it from the Chinese perspective.

38
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:58,820
So if you are China and you're starting off,

39
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,110
you are a real Communist country maybe 30 years ago.

40
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,190
And then you start to have market-based reforms

41
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,510
and you really want to enter the developing world.

42
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,398
But you don't have the industrial base in the late '70s or early '80s

43
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:15,835
to really compete with the Germanys, and the Americas, and the Japans--

44
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,400
and when I say Americas, I mean United States-- on their terms.

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,810
So one advantage of export-led growth is

46
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,170
when you're just beginning to develop, you have a less-developed society,

47
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,170
you have less of an industrial base.

48
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,550
So when you have export-led growth, you can actually build,

49
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,720
you actually will encourage investment in factories

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:48,125
that can go and produce things for the developed world.

51
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,068
And by keeping your currency low--

52
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:53,701
by artificially keeping your currency low-- and let me be clear.

53
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:59,030
With just standard free trade, labor costs are going to be cheaper

54
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,976
in a place like China or India that has a lower standard of living.

55
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:07,352
So there would be just straight-up free trade with no manipulation of currency.

56
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,200
You would have things that would move offshore,

57
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,850
manufacturing and services that move offshore.

58
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,163
But if you super charge it,

59
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:18,273
if you make it even cheaper to manufacture,

60
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:19,943
to do business in China,

61
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:23,090
it'll just accelerate the investment in production in China.

62
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,968
So this export-led growth--let me put it this way.

63
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:35,280
Artificially suppressed currency--

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
and this also happened with Japan after World War II--

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,640
artificially suppressed currency, and to some degree we wanted that,

66
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,166
because we want to Japan to become intertwined with the United States.

67
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,440
We wanted it to be successful.

68
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,430
We saw what happened to Germany after World War I,

69
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,540
where it was so economically unsuccessful

70
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,840
that it was very easy for a character like Hitler to come to power.

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,930
So we learned our lesson.

72
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,990
We said, you know, it's never good for another country

73
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,400
to not have an economic recovery.

74
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,520
So we actually, to some degree, many people think,

75
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,650
encouraged it in Japan.

76
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,160
But anyway, you artificially suppress a currency,

77
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,357
it makes your exports cheaper,

78
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:24,504
and which then encourages more investment in production at home.

79
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:25,989
And in this case, when I'm talking about home,

80
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:27,760
I'm talking about China or Japan.

81
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,280
And more production at home means more investment at home.

82
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,100
More investment.

83
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,820
If you're producing more in China,

84
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:41,885
you're going to have to build more factories.

85
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:46,060
And this means literally more jobs and, to a large degree,

86
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,600
capital for the Chinese people.

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:57,342
More jobs and capital.

88
00:04:57,342 --> 00:05:00,220
And as you become more efficient

89
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,704
and as you go down that development curve,

90
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:05,600
you'll become more and more competitive over a whole series of industries.

91
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,590
And the idea is, once your people get developed enough,

92
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,820
you will have enough capital at home.

93
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,700
You will have enough of a consumer base at home that

94
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,105
some of this extra capacity can then be turned back to your own people.

95
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:26,240
That you can then use these goods to sell to your own people

96
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,340
to increase their standard of living.

97
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,106
So at first, you are building washing machines and refrigerators

98
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:35,140
for the United States and Europe.

99
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,450
And because you're building those washing machines,

100
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,440
those are jobs for Chinese and eventually, once they have enough money,

101
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,800
once there's a critical mass of a middle-class Chinese,

102
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,880
that same capacity could be used to

103
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,470
sell washing machines and refrigerators to the Chinese,

104
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,560
and it would raise their standard of living.

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,780
So it builds a manufacturing base and a home market.

106
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,600
Let me put it that way.

107
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,330
So from China's point of view, it looks unambiguously good.

108
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:22,686
It builds manufacturing base, and a domestic consumer market--

109
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,550
which just means people in China,

110
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,690
once they have jobs and they have capital,

111
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:31,320
will be able to buy the goods themselves-- and domestic consumer market.

112
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,640
Now where is the negative here?

113
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,662
You could imagine, if you are the developed country that is buying these goods,

114
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:39,974
they would be cheap to begin with,

115
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:41,330
but now they're even more artificially cheap.

116
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,760
Well you lose your manufacturing base.

117
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:52,000
So if you look at it from the U.S. point of view,

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,450
you lose the manufacturing base.

119
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,060
And it's very clear that this has been happening,

120
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,460
whether you want to point to Japan or in general,

121
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,890
we've been losing our manufacturing base to other countries.

122
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,610
And some people view this as a good thing.

123
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,602
Some people say, hey, we are further down the development curve.

124
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,100
We shouldn't focus on manufacturing,

125
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,235
since manufacturing always tends to go to

126
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:15,576
whoever can do it for the cheapest price.

127
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:17,470
We should focus on knowledge things,

128
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,380
whether it's pharmaceutical industry or the IT industry.

129
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,190
So there's maybe an argument there.

130
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,270
But the other reason why this is maybe compelling to the United States

131
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:35,329
is its lower costs.

132
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,522
So this looks like a negative, and it is really a negative on some level,

133
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:40,120
but the one I guess you could call it a superficial positive

134
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:49,700
is lower cost for American consumers.

135
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,477
So if you're not one of the people who lost their jobs at the manufacturing plant,

136
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:57,559
and you are the great majority of the rest of Americans,

137
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,920
it seems like a good thing.

138
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,695
Things are cheaper for you,

139
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:01,610
it's cheaper to buy clothes for your kids.

140
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,516
It's cheaper to buy a car.

141
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,080
It's cheaper to buy a refrigerator.

142
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,870
It's cheaper to buy an air conditioner.

143
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,390
Now the problem is, when and how does this end?

144
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,730
Because this whole cycle that we create,

145
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,730
it might sound good for China.

146
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,090
In theory it sounds good.

147
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,560
You suppress you currency, your goods are cheap,

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,310
more production at home, more investment at home,

149
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,803
more capital and jobs eventually,

150
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,410
point that capital, point that investment back at your own home market

151
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,210
and now you are a developed country.

152
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,310
Seems to make a lot of sense,

153
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,890
but it's easier said than done.

154
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,620
In particular, it's not a trivial thing

155
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,159
to make that whole market be as consumptive or as consumer-driven

156
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,539
as maybe some of these developed markets abroad.

157
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,700
The other problem is this whole time,

158
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,220
remember what's happening.

159
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,768
You're just accumulating this mass of, in this case, U.S. dollars

160
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:53,480
and you're using it to go essentially lend to Americans,

161
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,920
to lend to the government,

162
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,640
and it essentially gets lent to the American people.

163
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,010
And the minute that you stop doing it,

164
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,420
think about what happens.

165
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,080
The minute that you stop, let's not even talk about unwinding this,

166
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,670
let's say the minute that you stop buying dollars,

167
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,430
your currency will inflate and the holdings--

168
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:22,520
these trillions of dollars of assets-- will drop in value,

169
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,250
because the minute you stop buying dollars,

170
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,704
the currency markets will allow the yuan to appreciate,

171
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:39,568
the dollar to drop and so stopping buying leads to drop in value.

172
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:41,310
And that's just if they stop buying.

173
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:46,430
If they actually ever tried to unwind this situation,

174
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,660
as soon as they start selling these, that would drop the value of

175
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,032
whether you want to call it the dollar or the U.S. Treasuries even more,

176
00:09:52,032 --> 00:09:53,442
and so everything else they're holding

177
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,450
would drop in even more value.

178
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,400
So the whole time, in order to keep their currency propped up,

179
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,650
they've been buying these assets,

180
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,560
they've been buying these dollars.

181
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,730
But the very act of unwinding it will-- I won't say make it worthless--

182
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:12,143
but it will make the value of their holdings go down dramatically.

183
00:10:12,143 --> 00:10:14,160
So you have a very hard situation for the Chinesese.

184
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,700
It's a hard situation to even get out of.

185
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,770
And it's just as hard for the U.S. because if you think about it,

186
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,160
a lot of people in the U.S. would look at this

187
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,910
and they'd say, hey, this is horrible.

188
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,590
This is why our manufacturing base has gone away

189
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,650
and it is partially true.

190
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:33,769
And so they'd say hey, let the currencies just do what they will.

191
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:36,060
No more artificial distortions,

192
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,480
no more manipulation by government.

193
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,070
Let the currencies be freely trading.

194
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,900
But what would happen then to the United States?

195
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,970
The minute that China stops doing this,

196
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,760
stops artificially supporting their currency, or even worse,

197
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,146
the minute they start unwinding all of these dollars that they've accumulated,

198
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:56,670
what's going to happen?

199
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,015
They're going to start selling U.S. Treasuries,

200
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:01,640
there's going to be lower demand for U.S. Treasuries

201
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,610
because they're not even buying it, they might be selling it.

202
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,829
Interest rates are going to go up,

203
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:14,390
long-term interest would go up in the United States.

204
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,190
Now when long-term interest rates go up,

205
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,504
that means that borrowing is harder,

206
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:22,815
that people will want more interest to lend you money,

207
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,480
that credit card rates will go up

208
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,020
and in general, the entire United States economy will go down.

209
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,400
Why are we in this recession right now?

210
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,280
Because it is harder to borrow.

211
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,420
We were so dependent on cheap debt,

212
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,160
and when that debt got a little less cheap, everything kind of ground to a halt.

213
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,250
That would be even worse

214
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,240
if the Chinese stopped buying our debt and allowed interest rates to go up.

215
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,000
So we are kind of locked in this very perverse cycle,

216
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,320
where although it looks like the Chinese are unambiguously I guess,

217
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,730
benefiting from this, they are accumulating these assets

218
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,711
and the minute that they try to stop accumulating those assets,

219
00:11:57,711 --> 00:11:59,411
the value of those assets are going to go down.

220
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,620
And even though the United States looks like

221
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,970
it's getting their manufacturing base depleted-- and that is true,

222
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,878
it is getting its manufacturing base depleted because of this--

223
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:09,230
it is keeping interest rates low.

224
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,840
And if you're a politician, you like that.

225
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,680
It makes the overall environment look superficially positive.

226
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,183
I'll leave you there and let you think about this whole situation for a little bit.

227
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:20,700
In the next video, I'll try to do a little bit of analogy

228
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,480
to think about where all of this might go.
