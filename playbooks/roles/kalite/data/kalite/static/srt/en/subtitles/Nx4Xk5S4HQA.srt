1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
   

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,070
This is the last of the word
problems that Kortaggio had

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,470
sent, and they're all
interesting because they're

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,780
all involving distances
and rates and times.

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,960
They all involve you having to
do a little bit of implicit

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,000
algebra without having to
explicitly solve for values of

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,320
variables, and that's
why they're fun.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,070
So this one says Ann and
Betty, two cyclists,

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,330
start simultaneously.

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:28,080
Ann at point A and
Betty at point B.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,510
They travel to each other
at constant speeds.

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:36,730
So let's say that Ann is
traveling with velocity A

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,130
and Betty is traveling
with velocity B.

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:42,710
Constant speeds.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,020
They pass each other
in 30 minutes.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,900
OK, so they're going to
pass each other someplace

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,230
in between A and B.

18
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,300
I'll just arbitrarily
draw that.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,100
They're going to pass
each other there.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,380
And what are these distances?

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,600
It took them 30 minutes to both
to get this point, right?

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,620
They pass each other
in 30 minutes.

23
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,740
And Ann, headed from point
B, arrives there in

24
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,170
another 20 minutes.

25
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,970
OK, so this distance
takes Ann 30 minutes.

26
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,240
So what is the actual distance?

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,900
Well, it's always useful to
write distance is equal

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,540
to rate times time.

29
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,040
So what's the actual
distance she traveled?

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,990
Well, the rate is va.

31
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,780
She traveled a rate of va and
her time -- they tell us -- it

32
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,490
took her 30 minutes
to get there.

33
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,830
So va times 30.

34
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,910
Let's say this velocity
is expressed in minutes.

35
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,970
Fair enough.

36
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,055
And then Ann, headed for
point B, arrives there

37
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:38,950
in another 20 minutes.

38
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,390
So this is going to take
her another 20 minutes.

39
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,670
So this distance
right here is what?

40
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,366
She's going at the
same velocity, but it

41
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:47,290
takes her 20 minutes.

42
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,400
So the distance is
velocity times time.

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,230
So it's va times 20, 20va.

44
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,610
Fair enough.

45
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,770
How many minutes after Ann
arrives at point B will

46
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,860
Betty arrive at point A?

47
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,380
So Betty was going in this
direction, they meet right

48
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,110
here, and then she keeps
going and hits point A.

49
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,390
So the key realization here is
that this took Ann 30 minutes

50
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,670
to get here, but it also took
Betty 30 minutes to get here.

51
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,920
So what's this distance in
terms of Betty's velocity?

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,980
What's this distance?

53
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,150
Well, distance is equal
to rate times time.

54
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,970
It took Betty 30 minutes
to go this distance

55
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,660
at a velocity of vb.

56
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,970
So it took her 30vb meters,
or whatever, actually.

57
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,490
We don't even have to
specify the units.

58
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,890
Whatever the units
the velocity is in.

59
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,580
If it's in meters per
minute, then this is

60
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,040
the distance in meters.

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,320
This distance is 30vb.

62
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,730
Right?

63
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,860
So essentially, we just have to
figure out how long it takes

64
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,920
her to travel this remaining
distance and we would

65
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,850
have solved the problem.

66
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,410
So how can we do that?

67
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,030
Well, we can already set
up a relationship between

68
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,660
vb and va, because this
distance is the same.

69
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,370
It doesn't matter how
fast you travel it, the

70
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,750
distance doesn't change.

71
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:04,880
So we know that 30 times
Betty's velocity is equal to 20

72
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,830
times Ann's velocity, 20va.

73
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,230
And so if we wanted to express
Ann's velocity in terms of

74
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,940
Betty's velocity -- let's just
do it that way -- if we divide

75
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:27,420
both sides by 20 we get 3/2 of
Betty's velocity is equal

76
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,730
to Ann's velocity.

77
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,080
Fair enough.

78
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,040
So what is this distance in
terms of Betty's velocity?

79
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,070
We know it in terms
of Ann's velocity.

80
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:43,630
In terms of Ann's velocity,
it's 30 times Ann's velocity.

81
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:43,870
Right?

82
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,280
So what is 30 times Ann's
velocity in terms of

83
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,770
Betty's velocity?

84
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,510
Well, if we multiply this times
30, that's 30 times Ann's

85
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,270
velocity, so we can multiply
both sides of this times 30.

86
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,280
So if you multiply 30 times
here and times thirty,

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,980
this is the distance.

88
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,150
This distance right here.

89
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,360
Ann's velocity
times 30 minutes.

90
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,620
It took her 30 minutes
to travel that far.

91
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,620
So this is the same distance
expressed in Betty's velocity.

92
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,600
So 30 times 3 is 90
divided by 2 is 45.

93
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,450
So it's 45vb.

94
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,980
   

95
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,694
So this distance
up here is 45vb.

96
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:25,340
   

97
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,010
So distance is equal to
rate times -- so this

98
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,490
is rate -- times time.

99
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,730
So this is how many
minutes it took Betty to

100
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,270
travel this distance.

101
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,190
So what is the
question asking us?

102
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,230
How many minutes after
Ann reaches point B will

103
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,970
Betty arrive at point A.

104
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,755
So they both reach right here.

105
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:49,270
In another 20 minutes,
Ann gets here.

106
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,990
And in another 45 minutes,
Betty will get over there.

107
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,750
Another 45 minutes.

108
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,820
So it takes Ann 20
minutes to get here.

109
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,520
It takes Betty 45 minutes to
get here, after their meeting

110
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,630
right at the center.

111
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,000
So it's going to take
Betty another 25 minutes.

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,190
Right?

113
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,110
After 20 minutes Ann is here
and then we have to wait

114
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,810
another 25 minutes for Betty
to get here, 45 minutes

115
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,720
after this meeting.

116
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,250
So the answer is 25 minutes.

117
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,740
   

118
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,430
How many minutes after Ann
arrives at point B will

119
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,980
Betty arrive at point A.

120
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,060
Yes, 25 minutes.

121
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,580
They could have just asked how
many minutes after the meeting

122
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,250
will it take Betty
to reach point A.

123
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:28,965
It would have been 45.

124
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:30,700
But they want to know
how many more minutes

125
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,920
after Ann gets there.

126
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,310
Anyway, I thought you would
find that useful and, a final

127
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,150
time, thanks to Kortaggio
for sending that problem.
