1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,656
Let's see if there's a way to make a risk-free profit.

2
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:06,436
And let me just tell you right from the get-go

3
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:09,524
there's usually not that many way to make risk-free profit in the world,

4
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:10,751
so this is very theoretical.

5
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:14,410
If the spot price for gold was a thousand dollars...

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,337
So the spot price literally just means the market price.

7
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:19,824
If you were to buy or sell gold today and actually exchange hands,

8
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:24,421
then you would pay or sell the gold for a thousand dollars per ounce.

9
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:29,739
And let's also say that the 1-year forward settlement price is $1200 per ounce.

10
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:33,609
So if you want to buy gold one year from now,

11
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,136
you can agree right now to buy it for $1200.

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,942
Or if you want to sell gold one year from now,

13
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:41,326
you could agree right now to sell for $1200

14
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:44,121
by entering into a forward or futures contract.

15
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:48,022
And just, the other details, the interest rate to borrow money is 10%.

16
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:52,971
And the carrying cost of gold is $50 per ounce per year.

17
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:55,807
And the carrying cost means if I had an ounce of gold,

18
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:57,718
and I wanted to hold it responsibly,

19
00:00:57,718 --> 00:01:00,654
I wanted to store it, maybe someplace in a safe at a bank,

20
00:01:00,654 --> 00:01:03,968
and I wanted to insure it in case it got stolen or in case someone lost it,

21
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:07,690
that would cost me $50 per ounce per year.

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,093
So that's what we mean by carrying cost.

23
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:12,874
And let's say you could also invest money risk-free in this type of a market...

24
00:01:12,874 --> 00:01:13,806
(I've just made up these numbers)

25
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:15,521
for 5% a year.

26
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:16,796
So how could you make the money?

27
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,192
Well, you could, and we're assuming you start with nothing,

28
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:29,880
so you could literally just borrow $1000.

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,626
And then you use that to buy an ounce of gold in the spot market.

30
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:39,358
So you buy one ounce of gold.

31
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:46,667
And you also agree to sell it in the future.

32
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:53,410
So you enter into that forward contract.

33
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,691
So you enter into forward as the seller.

34
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:01,659
So you are, on the spot market, you are the buyer.

35
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:03,725
And on the forward market, one year from now,

36
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:06,321
you agree to be the seller.

37
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:09,272
So let's just think about how this is going to play out.

38
00:02:09,272 --> 00:02:11,638
So over the course of the year,

39
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:13,793
you will have some cost.

40
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:16,188
You will have to pay the interest on this $1000.

41
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:17,652
That's 10%.

42
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:21,999
So you're going to have to pay $100 in interest.

43
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,991
And you're going to have to pay the carrying costs.

44
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,289
$50 per ounce.

45
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:28,439
So, $50 carrying cost.

46
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,985
And so, when we end up a year from now,

47
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:45,926
you can sell, you will sell the gold for $1200.

48
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:47,373
One year from now.

49
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:48,169
And you know you can do that,

50
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,209
because you entered into the forward agreement.

51
00:02:50,209 --> 00:03:04,361
And then you can pay back the $1000 loan plus $100 interest.

52
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:08,076
And let's say you had to pay the carrying cost at the end of the year to the bank.

53
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:10,941
So plus the $50 carrying cost.

54
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,779
So how much did we profit?

55
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:17,784
Well, we get $1200 and we had to pay back $1150.

56
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:18,590
So we make...

57
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,275
So, $1200 minus $1000 minus $100 minus $50...

58
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:27,594
We make a profit of $50.

59
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:29,527
So the big takeaway here is...

60
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:32,310
that these type of things here normally don't exist!

61
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,292
If they did, people would do it all day and all night.

62
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:37,893
And this price would go up because everyone would want to buy on spot...

63
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:42,312
and this price would go down because everyone would want to sell on the futures market.

64
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:43,778
Everyone would want to do this right here.

65
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:47,174
So the appropriate price is this one should not...

66
00:03:47,174 --> 00:03:52,070
this price, based on these numbers right here, should not be any higher than $1150.

67
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,577
So the correct market price here,

68
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:56,122
if we didn't want risk-free profit,

69
00:03:56,122 --> 00:04:02,255
or essentially what the arbitragers would make happen by kind of taking advantage of this...

70
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:04,026
it would eventually go to $1150.

71
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:05,660
So it's essentially the spot price,

72
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,194
plus the cost to borrow money at that spot price,

73
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:12,445
plus the carrying cost.

74
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:15,789
So that's essentially what would be the rational price for the futures contract,

75
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,000
Or the forward settlement price.
