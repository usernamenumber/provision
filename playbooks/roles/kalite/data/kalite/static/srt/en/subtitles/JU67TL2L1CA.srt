1
00:00:00,538 --> 00:00:03,330
Define a good word as sequence of letters

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,800
that consists only of the letters A, B and C

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,600
some of these letters may not appear in the sequence

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,457
and which A is never immediately followed by B

5
00:00:14,457 --> 00:00:17,357
B is never immediately followed by C

6
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:21,854
and C is never immediately followed by A

7
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:26,491
How many seven-letter good words are there?

8
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,241
So let's just think about this a little bit.

9
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:31,023
So there're letters which're As, Bs, and Cs

10
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:35,031
and then it could be all As all Bs all Cs

11
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:37,261
because some letters might not appear

12
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:41,634
and A is never immediately followed by B

13
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:45,412
so A could only be followed by another A or another C

14
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:49,729
B is never immediately followed by C

15
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:52,295
which means that B could only be followed by

16
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:54,474
an A or another B

17
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:57,582
and C is never immediately followed by A

18
00:00:57,582 --> 00:01:01,643
so C can only be followed by another C or a B.

19
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:03,978
So how many seven-letter good words are there?

20
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:05,817
So let's just think about the places

21
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:07,250
we have seven letters

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,593
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven letters.

23
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:15,192
now there's no contraints on this first letter

24
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:17,065
since it's not following anything

25
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:19,026
so it could be an A, B or a C,

26
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:23,870
So there's three possibilities for this first letter

27
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,763
Now there's three possibilities for this first letter

28
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:28,884
but no matter what letter this is

29
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:30,117
how many possibilities are there

30
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:32,545
for this second letter over here?

31
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:33,872
Well if this was an A

32
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:37,407
the second letter could only be an A or a C

33
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:38,887
because it can't be followed by a B.

34
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:40,222
If this was a B

35
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:44,122
the second letter could only be a B or an A

36
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:45,986
because it can't be followed by a C

37
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:46,741
if this was a C

38
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:50,340
the second letter could only be a B or a C

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,602
So no matter what letter this first letter is

40
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:57,302
the second letter can only have two possibilities

41
00:01:57,302 --> 00:01:58,736
Another way to think about it is

42
00:01:58,736 --> 00:01:59,525
there's one letter

43
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:00,856
no matter what letter this is

44
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:02,759
there's one letter that's being ruled out here

45
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,866
so it can only be two possibilities.

46
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:05,561
The same thing is here

47
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:07,087
we're gonna stick some letter here

48
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:09,908
and no matter what letter there is over here

49
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:12,713
it's going to rule out one possibility over here

50
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:14,637
so we're gonna have only two possible letters

51
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:15,880
that we can put here

52
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,454
no matter what letter is there

53
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:18,538
and use the same logic:

54
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:25,555
only two possibilities there

55
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:27,987
So how many total possibilities do we have?

56
00:02:27,987 --> 00:02:31,259
well 3x2x2x2x2x2x2

57
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,771
this is one, two, three, four, five, six 2's

58
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,119
so this is equal to 3x2 to the sixth power

59
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:45,157
which is 3 times 2 to the sixth, is 32x2, is 64

60
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:50,090
which is equal to 180 + 12, is equal to 192.

61
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,169
There're 192 possible seven-letter good words

62
00:02:55,169 --> 99:59:59,999
or good words as defined above.
