1
00:00:00,384 --> 00:00:01,912
Where we left off in the last video,

2
00:00:01,912 --> 00:00:03,636
Napoleon was doing pretty well.

3
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:06,366
In 1804, just as a bit of review,

4
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:14,706
he declared himself Emperor Napoleon I.

5
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:16,839
And then, the whole last video was about

6
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:19,204
the Third Coalition that formed in 1805.

7
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:21,610
And we saw that at the end of 1805,

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,637
after the Battle of Austerlitz,

9
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:26,200
Napoleon was able to crush the Third Coalition –

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,946
(WRITING: Crush the Third Coalition.)

11
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:34,971
– which was mainly made up of Russia and Austria.

12
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:36,907
And this is all review. We saw this in the last video.

13
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:41,370
(WRITING: Russia and Austria.)

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,450
And the big by-product of that,

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,033
other than the fact that it just made everyone think

16
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:48,645
"Gee, this Napoleon guy, he's pretty formidable."

17
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:51,777
is that it ended the Holy Roman Empire,

18
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:53,440
which you remember was neither holy,

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,199
nor Roman, nor an empire.

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,921
It was really just a collection of

21
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:59,027
German speaking states.

22
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:05,213
But it ended the official Holy Roman Empire.

23
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:10,572
(WRITING: Holy Roman Empire.)

24
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:12,430
And Napoleon felt so good about

25
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,458
himself at this point –

26
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,686
especially after crushing the Austrian

27
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:18,396
and Russian forces at Austerlitz,

28
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:21,064
that he had the Arc de Triomphe,

29
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:23,409
which if you go to Paris right now,

30
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:24,979
it's one of the things you should see.

31
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,400
He had this built.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,635
And now it's to commemorate

33
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:30,102
all of the soldiers who have died for France.

34
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:34,101
But it was originally built by Napoleon, to –

35
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:35,769
or it was commissioned by Napoleon –

36
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:38,319
to celebrate his victory at Austerlitz.

37
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,060
So this is the Arc de –

38
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,683
(My spelling is always a little weak.

39
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:43,757
But it's especially weak when

40
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:46,079
I'm spelling something in French.)

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,772
Arc de Triomphe.

42
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:50,234
And that's right there.

43
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:53,717
So Napoleon was doing pretty well.

44
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:55,314
Now, on the other side of the equation,

45
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:56,433
you could imagine that

46
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:59,239
the other major powers of Europe

47
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,809
were kind of licking their wounds.

48
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:03,402
They weren't sure what was going on,

49
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:05,309
and they were starting to feel threatened.

50
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:06,484
And in particular,

51
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:10,318
this guy started to feel especially threatened.

52
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:16,690
This is Frederick--

53
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,953
once again my spelling is not the strongest,

54
00:02:18,953 --> 00:02:20,820
especially when I'm doing something in German--

55
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,980
Frederick Wilhelm III.

56
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,492
It actually took me a long time to realize that

57
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:29,356
Wilhelm and William are the same names.

58
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:31,355
And William is just the English version of it.

59
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:33,913
But this is Frederick Wilhelm III

60
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:39,006
and he is the King of Prussia.

61
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:40,345
And he stayed out of the action

62
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:42,009
during the Third Coalition.

63
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:45,948
And even now, Prussia is a major European power.

64
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:47,414
And he gets threatened

65
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:50,015
by this rising power of Napoleon,

66
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:52,903
who was able to break up, or almost take away

67
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:55,409
Austria's influence from the Holy Roman Empire.

68
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,492
And now it kind of becomes.. you know becomes this

69
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:58,818
Confederation of the Rhine.

70
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:01,940
Let me show you the map.

71
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,947
So this whole area over here.

72
00:03:03,947 --> 00:03:09,742
This whole area.. right...

73
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:13,240
All of this right over here, this...

74
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,153
which is now mainly modern day Germany,

75
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:19,411
that used to be the Holy Roman Empire,

76
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:23,657
its emperor was the King of Austria,

77
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:24,991
who wasn't necessarily in it,

78
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:27,323
but it kind of implies some type of allegiance.

79
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:28,742
Once he trounces..

80
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,342
This is France right here.

81
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:34,409
Once he was able to trounce Austria in Austerlitz--

82
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:37,159
Austria and Russia-- then this becomes the

83
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,485
Confederation of the Rhine.

84
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,548
Holy Roman Empire...

85
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:43,244
Let me highlight this a little bit better.

86
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:44,898
So this general area.

87
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:46,688
Holy Roman Empire no longer exists.

88
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:49,691
And it now becomes kind of a satellite region of France.

89
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:51,942
France has a huge amount of control.

90
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:53,954
So you could imagine that the King of Prussia

91
00:03:53,954 --> 00:03:55,358
starts getting a little bit threatened.

92
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:57,489
France is on its borders, it's a...

93
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,621
it has shown itself to be able to

94
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:01,605
defeat other great powers with ease.

95
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:04,856
So this guy gets a little paranoid whether he feels that

96
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:08,528
France might kind of threaten Prussia's power.

97
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:10,102
Or maybe on the other side of the equation,

98
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:11,939
that he just didn't like this upstart who was not

99
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,676
related to all of the other royalty of Europe.

100
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:17,476
He maybe wanted to put him in his place.

101
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:23,432
So Frederick Wilhelm III declares war.

102
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:28,294
We're now in 1806. So we are now in 1806..

103
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:41,522
We have Prussia.. Prussia declares war on France.

104
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:43,182
And you're going to see this pattern multiple times.

105
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,842
And the one thing to kind of remember,

106
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:46,960
if you just want to remember kind of major themes.

107
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,850
We're always talking about the First Coalition,

108
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,590
Second Coalition, Third Coalition, Fourth Coalition,

109
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,258
all of these.

110
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,172
And it's always some combination of Britain.

111
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:56,690
And Britain has kind of already dominated the ocean.

112
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,028
So when we talk about these battles on land,

113
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:00,225
we're not talking about Britain much.

114
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:01,761
But this whole time, Britain is in the background

115
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:04,029
trying to be a pain in France's neck.

116
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:06,024
And then all the other coalitions are

117
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:09,683
some combination of Prussia, Austria, and Russia,

118
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:11,362
and some other countries here and there.

119
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:12,571
But you see one after another that

120
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:14,553
they keep challenging Napoleon up to this point.

121
00:05:14,553 --> 00:05:16,234
And Napoleon keeps trouncing them,

122
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,694
takes more and more land

123
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,741
and territory and power from them.

124
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:20,812
And they get even more insecure and then

125
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:22,627
they want to form other coalitions.

126
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:24,205
So this happens again.

127
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:26,537
And this is the start of the Fourth Coalition.

128
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:27,803
In the last video, it was the third.

129
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:30,870
This is now the formation of the fourth.

130
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,738
Fourth Coalition

131
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:33,468
And essentially,

132
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:36,001
the coalition forms as soon as someone else

133
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,407
other than Great Britain joins the fight.

134
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,672
Because Great Britain is kind of in a continuous war

135
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,080
with Napoleon over this entire time period.

136
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,711
So we've got this Fourth Coalition that forms.

137
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:47,792
We've got Prussia, we've got Great Britain,

138
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,931
and Russia wants to join the fight again.

139
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:53,270
So as you can imagine, the end of the Third Coalition

140
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,869
didn't keep Russia out of the fight for long.

141
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:57,748
So you also have... Let me write it down.

142
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:03,469
You have Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain.

143
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:04,802
There's always some other actors,

144
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:08,628
but these are the major ones. Great Britain..

145
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:10,685
And it was kind of silly on the part of Prussia.

146
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:11,848
Because Prussia would've been

147
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:13,534
in a much better situation

148
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:15,468
if it had helped the Third Coalition.

149
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:17,734
Maybe that would have changed the outcome.

150
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:20,668
But now they're kind of taking on Napoleon,

151
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:22,136
at least initially on their own.

152
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:23,371
Because Russia is always kind of

153
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:25,402
behind Austria or Prussia,

154
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:26,873
depending which coalition you're talking about.

155
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:28,869
So Prussia and Austria are always the

156
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:29,802
first line of offense.

157
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:31,952
In this case, in the Fourth Coalition, it's Prussia.

158
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:38,405
And they get trounced in Jena-Auerstedt.

159
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:39,541
Let me show you where that is.

160
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,036
So this is actually Napoleon getting the troops together

161
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,543
at Jena-Auerstedt.

162
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:47,212
This right here is a charge of the French troops there.

163
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:48,347
Let me write this down.

164
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:57,210
This is Jena-Auerstedt.

165
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,811
Two cities close by each other in Germany.

166
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:05,682
They are roughly around here.

167
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:09,204
Let's see, this map is a little difficult to read.

168
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:12,121
But they're roughly in that area right there.

169
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:15,624
Napoleon, once again, he trounces Prussia.

170
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:17,671
So Prussia is just out of the way.

171
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:21,535
That's in October of 1806.

172
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:27,385
So this right here, this right here is in October.

173
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:30,335
And then Napoleon essentially chases the Russians

174
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:32,287
through most of what's now Poland.

175
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:34,623
So he chases the Russians

176
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:37,470
through most of what is now Poland

177
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,292
He has this hugely bloody stalemate at Eylau.

178
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:42,291
I don't even know how to say that.

179
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,674
It's right around there if I read my maps correctly.

180
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:51,221
So a stalemate.

181
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,338
This is in 1807.

182
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:58,073
Stalemate, February 1807 at--

183
00:07:58,073 --> 00:08:03,018
let me get the spelling right, E-Y-L-A-U.

184
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:03,886
Super bloody.

185
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:05,003
They actually win the battle.

186
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:07,242
But they aren't able to decisively defeat

187
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:09,936
the Russian troops, or the Russian army.

188
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,552
And there are estimates that in that one battle,

189
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:12,604
there's anywhere

190
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:15,559
from 15,000 to 25,000 casualties on both sides,

191
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:17,136
which was huge at that time.

192
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:19,826
Even now, if you think about even modern wars,

193
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:22,010
that's a major amount of casualties to have

194
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,066
in just one single battle.

195
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:28,629
But Napoleon persists, and he's eventually able to

196
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:33,399
decisively meet the Russians at Friedland,

197
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,947
which is right about there.

198
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:40,605
This is Friedland right there.

199
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:45,466
That is in June of 1807.

200
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,879
And then he's able to decisively

201
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,668
defeat the Fourth Coalition.

202
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:55,651
So here we have.. we're at kind of the summer of 1807.

203
00:08:55,651 --> 00:09:01,297
Summer of 1807 right here.

204
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:03,811
We're talking about June is when Friedland occurs,

205
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,898
Russians decisively defeated.

206
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:07,753
The Prussians were already trounced

207
00:09:07,753 --> 00:09:09,011
several months ago.

208
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:17,608
And then in July of '07, July of 1807,

209
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:23,778
you have France signing the Treaties of Tilsit.

210
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:27,350
The Treaties of Tilsit.

211
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,950
And it's called the Treaties of Tilsit,

212
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,807
instead of the Treaty of Tilsit,

213
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:33,679
because he signed separate treaties with

214
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,806
Russia and Prussia.

215
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:37,744
At this point, Napoleon had kind of lost

216
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,381
all respect for Prussia.

217
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:40,745
And he wanted to show it.

218
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:42,343
So he had a separate treaty with Prussia

219
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:43,808
and a separate treaty with Russia.

220
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:46,038
The one with Russia was a lot more respectable.

221
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:48,591
It had all this language about how Napoleon

222
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:50,997
and Tsar Alexander I are now friends.

223
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:54,416
This is Tsar Alexander I right here.

224
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:59,173
This is Alexander I

225
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:01,254
And as you'll see, this friendship is very temporary.

226
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:02,984
As you could imagine, I mean this is the guy Napoleon

227
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:05,908
defeated at Austerlitz not too long ago.

228
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:07,327
So you know, all this friendship

229
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:09,369
should probably be written in quotes.

230
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:11,885
But the treaty with Russia was very friendly.

231
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:12,406
That's why I think

232
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:17,305
Napoleon still respected Russia's power.

233
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:23,388
So friendly with Russia, it declared them allies.

234
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:29,469
Friendly with Russia. But it took.. kind of carved up..

235
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:32,739
the other Treaty of Tilsit with Prussia carved it up.

236
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:38,148
Carved up Prussia.

237
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:40,739
And the main thing it did, if we look at this map here,

238
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:43,094
this is a map of central Europe.

239
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:47,299
Or I guess Prussia and Austria and France

240
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:48,601
at the end of the Third Coalition.

241
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,312
The main thing it did, it took the territory

242
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:53,933
west of the river Elbe from Prussia.

243
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:57,279
So this is the river Elbe right here.

244
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,736
That right there is the river Elbe.

245
00:10:59,736 --> 00:11:02,403
The blue is Prussia after the Third Coalition.

246
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:05,748
So all of this stuff gets taken away from Prussia.

247
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,204
And most of it turns into a French satellite kingdom

248
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:11,003
called the Kingdom of Westphalia.

249
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:15,007
So this is part of the Prussian Treaty of Tilsit.

250
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:19,260
So you have the Kingdom of Westphalia.

251
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,858
Kingdom of Westphalia

252
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:25,102
And to really emphasize,

253
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,212
it really is a French satellite state.

254
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:29,772
And to add insult to injury to the Prussians,

255
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,442
Napoleon puts his brother Jerome as king.

256
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:44,070
So Napoleon's brother Jerome becomes King.

257
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,289
So it really is a satellite state of France.

258
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,794
So here at the end of this, the other powers in Europe

259
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:53,398
haven't learned that this Napoleon character

260
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:55,303
with his grand army, this huge army

261
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:58,019
that he's been able to raise and his military tactics,

262
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,103
really is someone formidable to deal with.

263
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:02,730
So they keep, Third Coalition,

264
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,016
and then they lose territory.

265
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:04,940
Then the Fourth Coalition,

266
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,288
then they lose even more territory.

267
00:12:06,288 --> 00:12:09,277
So what happens at the end of this Fourth Coalition,

268
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:11,605
and actually during the Fourth Coalition,

269
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,019
after Napoleon defeated Prussia,

270
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:15,328
he realized gee, you know what?

271
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:20,037
I have, I'm in either direct control or indirect control of

272
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:22,131
a significant part of Europe.

273
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:23,667
And at the same time, he knew that

274
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:26,026
Britain had complete domination of the oceans.

275
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:29,025
And it was this kind of rising industrial power.

276
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:32,289
It was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.

277
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:34,394
So Napoleon's ideas, well gee

278
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:38,107
I can't defeat Russia on the waters,

279
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:41,531
Oh sorry I can't defeat Great Britain on the waters,

280
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:42,459
Did I say Russia?

281
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:44,804
No I've been saying-- the whole point is that

282
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:47,967
Great Britain is dominant on the oceans.

283
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,005
And Napoleon realizes that

284
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:51,829
he can't invade Great Britain by sea.

285
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:56,153
He can't do anything in the water with Great Britain

286
00:12:56,153 --> 00:12:57,660
kind of pestering him.

287
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,942
So what he tries to do is to

288
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:02,759
declare economic warfare on Great Britain.

289
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:08,677
And he institutes at the end of 1806,

290
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:09,893
the Continental System.

291
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:11,127
So I'll put this right here.

292
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,798
This is in November of 1806.

293
00:13:12,798 --> 00:13:16,275
So this is right after he trounces the Prussians

294
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:19,107
at Jena-Auerstedt.

295
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:22,741
This is in November of 1806, where he's feeling

296
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:26,857
really good about his strength on the actual continent.

297
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:29,687
He institutes what he calls the Continental System.

298
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:34,762
Continental System

299
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:36,990
And this is really just the notion of economic warfare

300
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,880
with Great Britain.

301
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,192
That hey, if you are either a part of the French Empire,

302
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:44,366
controlled by the French Empire,

303
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,021
or aligned with the French Empire,

304
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:47,747
you embargo Great Britain.

305
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:50,178
This little island, it controls the waters,

306
00:13:50,178 --> 00:13:51,502
but it is dependant on trade.

307
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:54,418
So Napoleon's idea through this Continental System is

308
00:13:54,418 --> 00:14:00,955
to embargo the United Kingdom of Great Britain,

309
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,776
whatever we want to call it.

310
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:09,682
Embargo Great Britain.

311
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,997
And one thing he got out of the Russians,

312
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:12,840
this was actually a huge concession,

313
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,769
because Russia was a major power at the time.

314
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:18,392
He got them, through the Treaty of Tilsit,

315
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:24,471
to also join the Continental System.

316
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:26,248
Let me write that in a color that'll actually show up.

317
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:33,882
Join the Continental System.

318
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:36,126
And in return, he also got some land, some islands,

319
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,554
the Ionian Islands off the western coast of Greece.

320
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:43,390
And some of the land off the Dalmatian coast.

321
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,613
Let me show you right there.

322
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:46,472
So this area over here.

323
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:48,907
And Russia in return, and it's pretty good

324
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:51,152
because Russia essentially lost the war,

325
00:14:51,152 --> 00:14:52,481
but in return they were allowed to

326
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:54,363
do whatever they want with the Ottoman Empire.

327
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:56,312
And we'll talk more about the Ottoman Empire

328
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,301
in future videos,

329
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:58,873
but if you want to have a general view of

330
00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:00,206
what the Ottoman Empire is,

331
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:03,652
I guess the last remnant of it is

332
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,526
what is today modern Turkey.

333
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:08,200
But obviously it was an empire at that time.

334
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,574
But Russia and the Ottoman Empire were kind of

335
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:11,916
that at odds with each other.

336
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,881
So it was great for Russia to say

337
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,105
hey, I'm going to be able to do whatever I want

338
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:16,627
with the Ottoman Empire.

339
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:20,212
Because before this, Napoleon was nominally

340
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,385
aligned with the Ottomans.

341
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:25,169
So this was actually a big concession for Russia.

342
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:28,451
So at the end of this, we have a situation once again,

343
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:30,367
I guess the other powers don't realize it.

344
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:33,456
Over and over, Third Coalition, Napoleon,

345
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:39,005
he really takes care of the Russians and the Austrians.

346
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,201
Destroys the Holy Roman Empire, makes it the

347
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:44,302
Confederation of the Rhine under Napoleon's control.

348
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:47,925
Prussia thinks you know, wants to put down Napoleon.

349
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:50,320
Declares war again, Fourth Coalition.

350
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,952
The only by-product of that is now they lose this land.

351
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:56,867
Napoleon becomes even stronger.

352
00:15:56,867 --> 00:16:02,234
Puts his brother as king in the kingdom of Westphalia.

353
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:04,569
And now he has Russia as an ally

354
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:07,703
to help his embargo on England.

355
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:10,102
So really, after the end of the Fourth Coalition,

356
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,282
a lot of historians view this as kind of

357
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:17,282
the height of Napoleon's power in Europe.
