1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,770
Let's do some more examples
with exact

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,670
differential equations.

4
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,300
And I'm getting these problems
from page 80 of my old college

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,430
differential equations books.

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,890
This is the fifth edition of
Elementary Differential

7
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,540
Equations by William Boyce
and Richard DiPrima.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,800
I want to make sure they get
credit, that I'm not making up

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,980
these problems. I'm getting
it from their book.

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,180
Anyway, so I'm just going to
give a bunch of equations.

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,760
We have to figure out if they're
exact, and if they are

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,850
exact, we'll use what we know
about exact differential

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,070
equations to figure out
their solutions.

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:40,850
So the first one they have is,
2x plus 3, plus 2y minus 2,

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,840
times y prime is equal to 0.

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,440
So this is our M of x and y--
although, this is only a

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,360
function of x-- and then
this is our N, right?

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,130
You could say that's
M, or that's N.

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,560
You could also say that, if this
is exact-- well, first

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:55,873
let's [? test ?]

21
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:58,120
this exact, before we start
talking about psi.

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,220
So what's the partial of this,
with respect to y?

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,950
The partial of M, with
respect to y.

24
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,590
Well, there's no y
here, so it's 0.

25
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,230
The rate of change that
this changes with

26
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,580
respect to y is 0.

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,380
And what's the rate of
change this changes,

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,120
with respect to x?

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,140
The partial of N, with respect
to x is equal to-- well,

30
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,490
there's no x here, right?

31
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,510
So these are just constants from
an x point of view, so

32
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,240
this is all going to be 0.

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,210
But we do see that
they're both 0.

34
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,480
So M sub y, or the partial with
respect to y, is equal to

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,060
the partial with respect to x.

36
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,380
So this is exact.

37
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,500
And actually, we don't have to
use exact equations here.

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,340
We'll do it, just so that
we get used to it.

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,010
But if you look here, you
actually could have figured

40
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,670
out that this is actually
a separable equation.

41
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,310
But anyway, this is exact.

42
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,240
So knowing that it's exact, it
tells us that there's some

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,610
function psi, where psi is
a function of x and y.

44
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,040
Where psi sub x is equal to this
function, is equal to 2x

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,800
plus 3, and psi-- I shouldn't
say sub x.

46
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,920
I say the partial of psi,
with respect to x.

47
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,310
And the partial of psi, with
respect to y, is equal to

48
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,270
this, 2y minus 2.

49
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,000
And if we can find our psi, we
know that this is just the

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,960
derivative of psi.

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,290
Because we know that the
derivative, with respect to x

52
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,510
of psi, is equal to the partial
of psi, with respect

53
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,840
to x, plus the partial
of psi, with respect

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,270
to y, times y prime.

55
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,750
So this is this just the
same form as that.

56
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,280
So if we can figure out y,
then we can rewrite this

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,390
equation as dx, the derivative
of psi, with respect to x, is

58
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,250
equal to 0.

59
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,490
Let me switch colors, or it's
going to get monotonous.

60
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:53,890
This right here, if we can find
a psi, where the partial

61
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,130
with respect to x, is this, the
partial with respect to y,

62
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,930
is this, then this can
be rewritten as this.

63
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,700
And how do we know that?

64
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,870
Because the derivative of psi,
with respect to x, using the

65
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,990
partial derivative chain
rules, is this.

66
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,190
This partial with respect
to x, that's this.

67
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,070
This partial with respect to
y, is this, times y prime.

68
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,070
So this is the whole point
of exact equations.

69
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,760
But anyway, so let's figure
out what our psi is.

70
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,170
Actually, before we figure out,
if the derivative of psi,

71
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,410
with respect to x, is 0, then
if you integrate both sides,

72
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,710
you just-- the solution
of this equation is

73
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,440
psi is equal to c.

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:36,030
So using this information, if we
can solve for psi, then we

75
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,630
know that the solution of this
differential equation is psi

76
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,140
is equal to c.

77
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,880
And then if we have some initial
conditions, we could

78
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,970
solve for c.

79
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,960
So let's solve for psi.

80
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,830
So let's integrate both sides
of this equation,

81
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,350
with respect to x.

82
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:58,980
And then we get psi is equal
to x squared plus 3x, plus

83
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,180
some function of y.

84
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,590
Let's call it h of y.

85
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,740
And remember, normally when you
take an antiderivative,

86
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,810
you have just a plus
c here, right?

87
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,210
But you can kind of say we
took an anti-partial

88
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,560
derivative.

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,760
So when you took a partial
derivative, with respect to x,

90
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,370
not only do you lose constants--
that's why we have

91
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,870
a plus c, normally-- but you
also lose anything that's a

92
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,570
function of just y, and not x.

93
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,110
So for example, take the partial
derivative of this

94
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,130
with respect to x, you're going
to get this, right?

95
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,430
Because the partial derivative
of a function, purely of y,

96
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,090
with respect to x,
is going to be 0.

97
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,450
So it will disappear.

98
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,550
So anyway, we take the
antiderivative of

99
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,440
this, we get this.

100
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,270
Now, we use this information.

101
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,650
Well, we use this information.

102
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,240
We take the partial of this
expression, and we say, well,

103
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,000
the partial of this expression,
with respect to y,

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,805
has to equal this, and then we
can solve for h of y, then

105
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:47,420
we'll be done.

106
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,890
So let's do that.

107
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,920
So the partial of psi, with
respect to y, is equal to--

108
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,980
well, that's going
to be 0, 0, 0.

109
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,850
This part is a function of x.

110
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,910
If you take the partial with
respect to y, it's 0, because

111
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,370
these are constants, from
a y point of view.

112
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,460
So you're left with
h prime of y.

113
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,810
So we know that h prime of y,
which is the partial of psi,

114
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,540
with respect to y,
is equal to this.

115
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,200
So h prime of y is equal
to 2y minus 2.

116
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,580
And then if we wanted to figure
out what h of y is, we

117
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,180
get h of y-- just integrate both
sides, with respect to

118
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,020
y-- is equal to y squared
plus-- sorry-- y

119
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,720
squared minus 2y.

120
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,340
Now, you could have a plus c
there, but if you watched the

121
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,410
previous example, you'll see
that that c kind of merges

122
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,740
with the other c, so you
don't have to worry

123
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,750
about it right now.

124
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,540
So what is our psi function,
as we know it now, not

125
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,640
worrying about the plus c?

126
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:56,160
It is psi of x and y is equal
to x squared plus 3x, plus h

127
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,810
of y-- which we figured
out is this-- plus y

128
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,100
squared, minus 2y.

129
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,450
And we know a solution of our
original differential equation

130
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,400
is psi is equal to c.

131
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,280
So the solution of our
differential equation is this

132
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,710
is equal to c.

133
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,230
x squared plus 3x, plus
y squared, minus

134
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,860
2y is equal to c.

135
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,520
If you had some additional
conditions, you could test it.

136
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,600
And I encourage you to test
this out on this original

137
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,390
equation, or I encourage you to
take the derivative of psi,

138
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,800
and prove to yourself that if
you took the derivative of

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,750
psi, with respect to x, here,
implicitly, that you would get

140
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,150
this differential equation.

141
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,710
Anyway, let's do another one.

142
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,770
Let's clear image.

143
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,190
So the more examples you
see, the better.

144
00:06:49,190 --> 00:07:04,130
So let's see, this one says 2x
plus 4y, plus 2x minus 2y, y

145
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,420
prime is equal to 0.

146
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,340
So what's the partial of
this with respect to y?

147
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,230
So M, the partial of M, with
respect to y-- this is 0-- so

148
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,160
it's equal to 4.

149
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,180
What's the partial of this, with
respect to x, just this

150
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,970
part right here?

151
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,460
The partial of N, with
respect to x, is 2.

152
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,980
This is 0.

153
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,090
So the partial of this, with
respect to y, is different

154
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,920
than the partial of N,
with respect to x.

155
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,500
So this is not exact.

156
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,360
So we can't solve this using
our exact methodology.

157
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,070
So that was a fairly
straightforward problem.

158
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,960
Let's do another one.

159
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,790
Let's see.

160
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,710
I'm running out of time, so I
want to do one that's not too

161
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,190
complicated.

162
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:54,130
Let's see, 3x squared minus
2xy-- actually, let me do this

163
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:54,810
in the next problem.

164
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,170
I don't want to rush
these things.

165
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,430
I will continue this
in the next video.

166
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,680
See you soon.

167
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,500
