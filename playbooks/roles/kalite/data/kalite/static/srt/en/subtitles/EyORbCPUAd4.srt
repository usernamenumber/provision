1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,600
We've see now that we can apply
linear transformations

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,460
in different coordinate systems.
The transformations

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,290
that we've been performing
before have all been with

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,130
respect to the standard basis.

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,540
So in the last video I said,
look, in standard coordinates,

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,520
if you have some vector x in
your domain and you apply some

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,930
transformation, then let's say
that A is the transformation

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,290
matrix with respect to the
standard basis, then you're

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,300
just going to have
this mapping.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,520
You take x, you multiply it by
A, you're going to get the

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,990
transformation of x.

13
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,280
Now, in the last video and in
a couple of videos before

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,070
that, or actually the one right
before that, we said,

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:34,700
well, look.

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,940
You can do the same mapping,
but just in an alternate

17
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,060
coordinate system.

18
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,960
You could do it in some
coordinate system with respect

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,790
to some basis B, and that should
be the same thing.

20
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,170
It should just be a different
transformation matrix.

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,520
And in the last video, we
actually figured out what that

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,180
different transformation
matrix is.

23
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,940
We had a change of basis, so
let's say we had this basis

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,340
right here.

25
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,090
Let me actually copy and paste
everything so that we

26
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,370
understand what we did.

27
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,869
So this was the example.

28
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:05,330
Let me copy it.

29
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,620
Let me paste it up here, put all
of our takeaways from the

30
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,870
last video up here and
paste it right here.

31
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,950
For the last video we
said, OK, this is

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,830
my basis right there.

33
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,025
And then we said-- let
me copy and paste.

34
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:24,920
   

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,330
That was my alternate basis, and
then I have my change of

36
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,300
basis matrix and it's inverse.

37
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,990
Those will be useful to
deal with, so let me

38
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,420
copy and paste that.

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,700
OK, copy, And then I'm
going to paste it.

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,150
Edit, paste.

41
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,340
Maybe I'll just write
it over there.

42
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,325
Not maybe the best order, maybe
I should have written

43
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:51,680
that first, but I think
we get the idea.

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Then we want to write what our
transformation matrix is with

45
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,390
respect to the standard basis.

46
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,790
And I wrote that write
over here.

47
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,770
This was all from the last
problem, if you're wondering

48
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,070
where I got all this stuff.

49
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,690
Let me copy and then
paste that.

50
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,000
Edit, paste.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,520
So I'll paste that.

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,430
And then the whole point of the
last video is we figured

53
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,890
out what the transformation
matrix is with respect to this

54
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,000
basis right here.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,830
So D, which was the big takeaway
from the last video,

56
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,280
was equal to this right here.

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,860
Let me copy and paste that.

58
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,980
Copy and paste.

59
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,940
And so now we have all of our
takeaways in one place.

60
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,890
Edit, paste.

61
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,560
What I want to do in this
video is verify that D

62
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,460
actually works, that I could
start with some vector x-- let

63
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,140
me write it up here.

64
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,570
Let's take some example
vector.

65
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,900
So this transformation, it's
entire domain is R2, so let's

66
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,530
start with some vector x.

67
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:13,450
Let's say that x is equal
to 1 minus 1.

68
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,840
Now, we could just apply the
transformation in the

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,520
traditional way and get the
transformation of x.

70
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,180
Let's just do that.

71
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,840
The transformation of x is
just this matrix times x.

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,940
And so what is that
going to equal?

73
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,340
Let me see.

74
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,140
Maybe I can just do it
right here in this

75
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,260
corner to save space.

76
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,330
So it's going to be this
matrix times x.

77
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,210
So this first term right here is
going to be 3 times 1 plus

78
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,520
minus 2 times minus 1,
or plus 2, right?

79
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,810
Minus 2 times minus 1 is just 2,
so it's going to be 3 plus

80
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,640
2, so it's going to
be equal to 5.

81
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,560
And then the second term right
here is going to be 2 times 1

82
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,980
plus minus 2 times minus 1.

83
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,030
Well, that's just positive 2, so
it's going to be 2 plus 2,

84
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,090
so that is 4.

85
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,940
So that's just the
transformation of x.

86
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:12,860
Now, what is this vector x
represented in coordinates, or

87
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,279
I guess you could say, this
alternate basis coordinates?

88
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,000
So what is that vector x
represented in coordinates

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
with respect to this
basis right here?

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,010
Well, you saw it before.

91
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,910
I wrote them out here.

92
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,150
Maybe it'll be useful
to do it right here.

93
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,930
I'll copy this.

94
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,280
Actually, let me copy
both of these.

95
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,310
These will both be useful.

96
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,640
Edit, copy.

97
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,670
As you can see, if you want to
go from x to the x in an

98
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,640
alternate basis or the
alternate coordinate

99
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,080
representations of x, you
essentially multiply x times C

100
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,580
inverse, so that's why I'm
copying and pasting it.

101
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,470
Let me copy, and then let me put
it up here so that we can

102
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:58,200
apply these, then paste
it right there.

103
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:07,940
So if we want to go from x to
the B coordinates of x, I take

104
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,120
my x and I multiply it
times C inverse.

105
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,820
C inverse is this thing
right here.

106
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:19,690
So if I take x and I multiply
it times C inverse I'l get

107
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,220
this version of x.

108
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,680
So let's do that.

109
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,790
So this times that.

110
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,430
Let me just put the minus
1/3 out front.

111
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,610
It's going to be equal to minus
1/3 times-- let's see if

112
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,090
we can do this one in
our head as well.

113
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,950
So it's going to be 1 times 1
plus minus 2 times minus 1,

114
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,430
which is just positive 2.

115
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,880
So it's going to be 1 plus
2, so it's going

116
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,780
to be equal to 3.

117
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,570
And then it's minus 2 times 1,
which is minus 2 plus 1 times

118
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,730
minus 1, which is
just minus 1.

119
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,195
So it's minus 2 minus
1, so it's minus 3.

120
00:05:56,195 --> 00:06:00,480
So if we have minus 1/3 times
this, the B coordinate

121
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:10,620
representation of our vector x
is going to be equal to minus

122
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,550
1 and then 1, just like that,
which is actually interesting

123
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,260
for this example.

124
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,510
It just kind of swapped
the first entry

125
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,800
and the second entry.

126
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,190
Now, let's see what happens
when we apply D to x.

127
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,690
So if we apply D to x, D should
be our transformation

128
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,640
matrix if we're dealing
in the B coordinates.

129
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,610
So let's see what happens.

130
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,990
If we apply D to x-- let me
scroll over a little bit, just

131
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,210
so we get a little bit
more real estate.

132
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,620
So if we apply D to
x, what do we get?

133
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,590
And so this is going to be the
transformation, or this should

134
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,280
be the transformation of
x in B coordinates.

135
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,290
So what is this going
to be equal to?

136
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,370
You have to multiply
this times D.

137
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,540
So it's going to be minus 1
times minus 1, which is 1,

138
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,980
plus 0 times 1.

139
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,050
So it's just minus 1 times
minus 1, which is 1.

140
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,120
And then we're going to get 0
times minus 1 plus 2 times 1,

141
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
so 2 times 1 is just 2.

142
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,850
   

143
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,410
Now, for everything to work
together and assuming I

144
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,280
haven't made any careless
mistakes, this thing, this is

145
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,400
vector right here should be the
same as this vector if I

146
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,950
change my basis, so if I go
from the standard basis

147
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,420
to the basis B.

148
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,640
When you go in that direction,
you just multiply this guy

149
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,720
times C inverse.

150
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,260
And I'm just using this
formula right here.

151
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,750
If I'm in the standard basis and
I multiply by C inverse,

152
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,140
I'm going to get the B basis.

153
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,100
So let's see what I get.

154
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,530
So this guy, I'm going to
multiply him times C inverse.

155
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,510
Let me do it up here just
to get some extra space.

156
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,450
So I'm going to multiply
the vector 5, 4.

157
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,890
I'm going to multiply
that by C inverse.

158
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:14,950
We're going to have minus 1/3
times 1 minus 2 minus 2, 1,

159
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,660
just like that.

160
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,550
So this is going to be equal
to-- Ill just write the minus

161
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,590
1/3 out front.

162
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:25,700
We have 1 times 5, which is
5, plus minus 2 times

163
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,030
4, so 5 minus 8.

164
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,710
   

165
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,490
And then we have minus 2 times
5, which is minus 10.

166
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,230
And then we have
plus 1 times 4.

167
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,230
Minus 2 times 5, which
is minus 10, plus 1

168
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,609
times 4: plus 4.

169
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:46,530
So this is equal to minus
1/3 times minus

170
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,930
3, and this is what?

171
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,360
This is minus 6.

172
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,920
If you multiply the minus 1/3
times it, all the negatives

173
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,700
cancel out, and you get 1 and
2, which is exactly what we

174
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,200
needed to get.

175
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,220
When you take this guy and you
change it's basis to basis B

176
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,230
or you change its coordinate
system to the coordinate

177
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,830
system with respect to B, you
multiply it by C inverse, you

178
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,900
get that right there.

179
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,990
So literally is the B coordinate
representation of

180
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,080
the transformation of x.

181
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,680
We just did it by multiplying
it by C inverse, which is

182
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,800
exactly what we got when we took
the B coordinate version

183
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,440
of x and we applied that matrix
that we found, the

184
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,960
transformation matrix with
respect to the B coordinates,

185
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,890
and you multiply it times
this guy right here.

186
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,190
We got the same answer.

187
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,470
So it didn't matter whether we
went this way around the

188
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,680
little cycle or we
went this way.

189
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,800
We got the same answer.

190
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,350
This isn't a proof, but it shows
us that what we did in

191
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,920
the last video at least works
for this case, and I literally

192
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,770
did pick a random x here.

193
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,790
And you can verify it, if you
like, for other things.

194
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,700
Now, you should hopefully be
reasonably convinced that we

195
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,650
can do this, that you can change
your basis and find a

196
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,690
transformation matrix.

197
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,570
We've shown how to do it, but
the obvious question is

198
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,970
why do you do it?

199
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,220
   

200
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,520
And someone actually wrote a
comment on the last video,

201
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,330
which I think kind of captures
the art of why you do it.

202
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,520
I'm not looking at the comment
right now, but if I remember

203
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,750
correctly, they said their
linear algebra teacher said

204
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,680
that linear algebra is the art
of choosing the right basis.

205
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,930
Let me write that down.

206
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:33,330
   

207
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,430
Or you could imagine, the
right coordinate system.

208
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,440
And why is there a right
coordinate system?

209
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,230
Maybe I'll put little quotes
inside the quotation.

210
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,650
What does it mean to have the
right coordinate system?

211
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,510
Well, if you look at your
original transformation matrix

212
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,750
with respect to the standard
basis, it's fine.

213
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,750
It's got this 2 by 2.

214
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,340
But if you performed matrix
operations with this, you've

215
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,100
go to do some math.

216
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,460
And if you had to perform it
over and over, if you have to

217
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,470
perform it on a bunch of
vectors, it is what it is.

218
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,570
But when you transfer your
bases, when you go to a new

219
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,950
basis, when you went to this
basis right here, all of a

220
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,720
sudden, you find that
the transformation

221
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,610
matrix is much simpler.

222
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,060
It's a diagonal matrix.

223
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,290
When you multiply a diagonal
matrix times something, you're

224
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,870
literally just taking its
scaling factors of the first

225
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,640
and second terms. When you
multiply this guy times some

226
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,220
vector-- we did it here.

227
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:30,080
When you multiplied this guy
times this vector, you

228
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,460
literally just scaled the first
term times minus 1 and

229
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,340
you scaled the second
term by 2.

230
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,540
So it's a much simpler
operation.

231
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,010
And you might say, hey, but we
had to do all of that work of

232
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,470
multiplying by C inverse to get
there, and then once you

233
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,650
get this answer, you're going
to multiply by C to go back

234
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,340
into standard coordinates, you
know, that's a lot more work

235
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,780
than just what you save here.

236
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,610
But imagine if you had to
apply D multiple times.

237
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,730
Imagine if you had to apply D
times D times D times D to x.

238
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,570
Let me say it this way.

239
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,920
Imagine if you had to apply A
times A times A or you have to

240
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,210
apply A 100 times to some vector
up here, then applying

241
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,060
A 100 times to some vector
would be much more

242
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,870
computationally intensive than
applying D 100 times to this

243
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,200
vector, even though you had a
little bit of overhead from

244
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,330
converting in this direction
and then converting back.

245
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,600
So in a lot of problems,
especially in computer science

246
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,090
frankly, or some other
applications you might be

247
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:27,830
doing, you want to pick
the right basis.

248
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,880
The computations for many
problems get a lot simpler if

249
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,400
you pick the right coordinate
system.
