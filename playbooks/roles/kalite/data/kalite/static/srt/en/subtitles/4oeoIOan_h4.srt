1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:07,740
Let's say I go to a store and I have fifty dollars in my pocket.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,562
fifty dollars in my wallet.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,660
And at the store that day they say it is a twenty-five percent

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,670
off marked price sale.

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,860
So twenty-five percent off marked price means that if the marked price is

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,660
one hundred dollars the price I'm going to pay is going to be

7
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,380
twenty-five percent less than $one hundred.

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,820
So my question to you is if I have $fifty, what is the highest

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,590
marked price I can afford?

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,270
Because I need to know that before I go finding something

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,270
that I might like.

12
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,910
So let's do a little bit of algebra.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:01:05,230
So let x be the highest marked price that I can afford.

14
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:10,280
So if the sale is twenty-five percent off of x, we could say that the new

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:20,680
price, the sale price will be x minus twenty-five percent of x is equal

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,780
to the sale price.

17
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,720
And I'm assuming that I'm in a state without sales tax.

18
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,760
Whatever the sale price is, is what I have to pay in cash.

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,810
So x minus twenty-five percent x is equal to the sale price.

20
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,850
The discount is going to be twenty-five percent of x.

21
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:44,470
But we know that this is the same thing as x minus 0.25x.

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,520
And we know that that's the same thing as-- well, because

23
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,590
we know this is onex, x is the same thing is onex.

24
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,900
1x minus 0.25x.

25
00:01:50,900 --> 00:02:00,040
Well, that means that 0.75x is equal to the sale price, right?

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:07,170
All I did is I rewrote x minus 25% of x as 1x minus 0.25x.

27
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,300
And that's the same thing as 0.75x.

28
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,170
Because 1 minus 0.25 is 0.75.

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,280
So 0.75x is going to be the sale price.

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,960
Well, what's the sale price that I can afford?

31
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,430
Well, the sale price I can afford is $fifty.

32
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:28,710
So 0.75x is going to equal $50.

33
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,810
If x is any larger number than the number I'm solving for,

34
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,320
then the sale price is going to be more than $fifty and I

35
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,360
won't be able to afford it.

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,510
So that's how we set the-- the highest I can pay is $fifty

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,940
and that's the sale price.

38
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,150
So going back to how we did these problems before.

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,700
We just divide both sides by 0.75.

40
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,110
And we say that the highest marked price that I can afford

41
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,000
is $50 divided by 0.75.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
And let's figure out what that is.

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,480
0.75 goes into 50-- let's add some 0's in the back.

44
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,810
If I take this decimal two to the right.

45
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,210
Take this decimal, move it two to the right, goes right there.

46
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,920
So 0.75 goes into 50 the same number of times

47
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,940
that seventy-five goes into five thousand.

48
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,780
So let's do this.

49
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,860
seventy-five goes into fifty zero times.

50
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,710
seventy-five goes into five hundred-- so let me think about that.

51
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,060
I think it goes into it six times.

52
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,100
Because seven times is going to be too much.

53
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,030
So it goes into it six times.

54
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,830
six times five is thirty.

55
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,880
six times seven is forty-two.

56
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,030
Plus three is forty-five.

57
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,140
So the remainder is fifty.

58
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,270
I see a pattern.

59
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,630
Bring down the zero.

60
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,630
Well, same thing again.

61
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,610
seventy-five goes into five hundred six times.

62
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,660
six times seventy-five is going to be four hundred and fifty again.

63
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,720
We're going to keep having that same pattern over

64
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,590
and over and over again.

65
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,090
It's actually 66.666-- I hope you don't think I'm an evil

66
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,490
person because of this number that happened to show up.

67
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,080
But anyway, so the highest sale price that I can afford or the

68
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,260
highest marked price I can afford is $sixty-six dollars.

69
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,410
And if I were to around up, and $0.67 if I were to

70
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,060
round to the nearest penny.

71
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,340
If I were to write this kind of as a repeating decimal, I could

72
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,790
write this as 66.66 repeating.

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,140
Or I also know that 0.6666 going on forever is

74
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,220
the same thing as two / three.

75
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,570
So it's sixty-six and two / three.

76
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,280
But since we're working with money and we're working with

77
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,270
dollars, we should just round to the nearest penny.

78
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:55,310
So the highest marked price that I can afford is $66.67.

79
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,810
So if I go and I see a nice pair of shoes for

80
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,350
$fifty-five, I can afford it.

81
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,570
If I see a nice tie for $seventy, I can't afford it with

82
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,340
the $fifty in my pocket.

83
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,610
So hopefully not only will this teach you a little bit of math,

84
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,680
but it'll help you do a little bit of shopping.

85
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,430
So let me ask you another problem, a very

86
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,750
interesting problem.

87
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,470
Let's say I start with an arbitrary-- let's put

88
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,200
a fixed number on it.

89
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,250
Let's say I start with $one hundred.

90
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:35,620
And after one year it grows by twenty-five percent.

91
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,990
And then the next year, let's call that year

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,300
two, it shrinks by twenty-five percent.

93
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,100
So this could have happened in the stock market.

94
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,360
The first year I have a good year, my portfolio

95
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,060
grows by twenty-five percent.

96
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,980
The second year I have a bad year and my portfolio

97
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,730
shrinks by twenty-five percent.

98
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,540
So my question is how much money do I have at the

99
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,920
end of the two years?

100
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,060
Well a lot of people might say, oh, this is easy, Sal.

101
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,250
If I grow by twenty-five percent and then I shrink by twenty-five percent I'll end up with

102
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,310
the same amount of money.

103
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,760
But I'll show you it's actually not that simple because the twenty-five percent

104
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,510
in either case or in both cases is actually a different

105
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,090
amount of money.

106
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,580
So let's figure this out.

107
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:27,090
If I start with $one hundred and I grow it by twenty-five percent-- twenty-five percent of $one hundred is $twenty-five.

108
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,250
So I grew it by $twenty-five.

109
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,290
So I go to $one hundred and twenty-five.

110
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,580
So after one year of growing by twenty-five percent I end up with $one hundred and twenty-five.

111
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,660
And now this $one hundred and twenty-five is going to shrink by twenty-five$.

112
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,310
So if something shrinks by twenty-five percent, that means it's just going to

113
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,670
be 0.75 or 75% of what it was before, right?

114
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,850
one minus twenty-five percent.

115
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,490
0.75 times $125.

116
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,820
So let's work that out here.

117
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,310
$125 times 0.75.

118
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,760
And just in case you're confused, I don't want to

119
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,790
repeat it too much, but if something shrinks by twenty-five percent it is

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,790
now seventy-five percent of its original value.

121
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:23,130
So if $125 shrinks by 25% it's now 75% of $125 or 0.75.

122
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,430
Let's do the math.

123
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,970
five times five is twenty-five.

124
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,800
two times five is ten plus two is twelve.

125
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,800
one times five-- seven.

126
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,500
seven times five is thirty-five.

127
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,090
seven times two is fourteen.

128
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,740
Plus three is seventeen.

129
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,560
Sorry.

130
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,870
seven times one is seven.

131
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,970
Plus one is eight.

132
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,790
So it's five, seven, and then this is seven actually.

133
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,120
fourteen.

134
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,480
nine.

135
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,250
94.75, right?

136
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,220
Two decimal points.

137
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,410
94.75.

138
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,740
So it's interesting.

139
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,380
If I start with $one hundred and it grows by twenty-five percent, and then it

140
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,440
shrinks by twenty-five percent I end up with less than I started with.

141
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,870
And I want you to think about why that happens.

142
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,380
Because twenty-five percent on $one hundred is the amount that I'm gaining.

143
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,780
That's a smaller number than the amount that I'm losing.

144
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,320
I'm losing twenty-five percent on $one hundred and twenty-five.

145
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,260
That's pretty interesting, don't you think?

146
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,090
That's actually very interesting when a lot of

147
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,470
people compare-- well, actually I won't go into stock

148
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,340
returns and things.

149
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,820
But I think that should be a pretty interesting thing.

150
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,280
You should try that out with other examples.

151
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,690
Another interesting thing is for any percentage gain, you

152
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,040
should think about how much you would have to lose-- what

153
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,250
percentage you would have to lose to end

154
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,030
up where you started.

155
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,070
That's another interesting project.

156
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,700
Maybe I'll do that in a future presentation.

Anyway, I think you're now ready to do some of those

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,190

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,320
Hope you have fun.
