1
00:00:01,723 --> 00:00:04,190
What I hope to do in this video is to explore the relationship

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,124
between oil and gas prices, and you do see that there is

3
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:10,440
a very strong correlation between how they trend.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,073
This right over here is oil prices quoted at a specific point on the planet

5
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:17,974
This is dependent on where you are and as you can see this is

6
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:22,155
in US dollars per barrel. In early 2008 around $100

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,555
It went up to about $140 then came back down

8
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:29,405
and then it's been trending up ever since, now it's about $100 per barrel

9
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:33,590
this is where we see the oil prices on a per barrel basis

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,441
And then related to that you see the gas of gasoline

11
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:40,173
this is even more geographically specific because not only do you have

12
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,014
transportation costs but you also have very

13
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:46,922
region specific taxation for oil and sometimes

14
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:50,190
regulation but taxation is the big part of it

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,256
but you do see that it trends up when oil prices

16
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:54,291
trend up, and then it goes down and this is on

17
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,623
a per gallon basis and these are the prices right

18
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,855
over here in New York. But they don't move competely

19
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:02,406
locked up, if anything you can see that the oil price on a per

20
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:05,072
barrel basis is much more volatile than the gasoline

21
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:07,722
prices right over here but there is the same

22
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:09,907
general trend, when the oil prices moves up

23
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:13,106
this tends to move up but it's not always in the same

24
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:16,124
percentage but there's definitely a relationship.

25
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:18,840
Now, before trying to figure out when you pay, say

26
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,273
$4 at the pump how much up that is oil and how much

27
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:24,708
is refining and how much is transportation

28
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,806
Let's at least kind of build up to that

29
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:29,625
to think about how does the oil even end up in your

30
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:34,973
car, then we can build up that price of the oil.

31
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:37,707
Or, the price of the gasoline I should say.

32
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:40,506
This right over here, you're probably familiar with these,

33
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:43,174
these are oil rigs, two very different types: this

34
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:46,208
This is an offshore oil rig, this is a land based oil rig

35
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,706
but they're both doing the same fundamental thing:

36
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:51,490
they're drilling into the ground until they get to a pocket of oil

37
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,041
and then they will pump that oil out

38
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,140
and try to transport it to the market somehow, first

39
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,123
going through a refinery. Offshore is really fast and it

40
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:02,341
really is an engineering marvel how they do it

41
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,606
It might be sitting out here in the ocean and it will

42
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:06,990
literally go to the bottom of the ocean, go to the sea

43
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,240
floor and then drill from there to actually get to the

44
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,890
oil pockets so it's really an engineering marvel

45
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,806
and you have to be very careful, it can be very dangerous

46
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:17,090
working on an oil rig and obviously if there's an accident

47
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,807
it can be an environmental nightmare like we saw

48
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,241
with the BP situation but it is undoubtedly an

49
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:25,606
engineering marvel. Now, once you have that oil you need

50
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:27,939
to get it to a refinery so that the oil can be

51
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,874
broken up into its useful parts, and the way it

52
00:02:31,874 --> 00:02:34,990
is typically transported to a refinery is some combination

53
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,105
of a pipeline or an oil tanker, this right over here is actually

54
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:43,756
the Alaskan pipeline, it takes oil from the very northern part

55
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:46,273
of Alaska to the southern part so that it can then be

56
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:49,389
put onto oil tankers which can then transport it anywhere

57
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:52,106
in the world to refineries. It could go straight to a tanker

58
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:55,891
actually in some offshore places you could use a tanker or sometimes if they're

59
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,874
close enough to land they actually might have a pipeline

60
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:01,773
that will take it to land where it can go to a refinery

61
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:05,305
or go to an oil tanker so that it can be transported

62
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:08,957
even farther. And then from there it gets to a refinery

63
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:12,390
So we can start to think about how the price of oil is built up

64
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,741
before we even think about what a refinery

65
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:19,423
even does. So let's say that the current price of oil

66
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:25,007
and I kind of rigged the numbers, to work out fairly well

67
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:27,856
But let's say the current price of oil is $90 per barrel.

68
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:39,781
So a barrel (this is just a units thing) is equal

69
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:44,248
to 42 gallons. So if I say I have a barrel of water

70
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:47,332
I'm really saying that I have 42 gallons of water.

71
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:49,415
And now all 42 gallons of crude oil do not turn into

72
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:54,999
42 gallons of gasoline, out of 42 gallons

73
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:57,995
of crude oil you can get about 19 or 20 gallons of

74
00:03:58,149 --> 00:04:04,114
gasoline, to make the numbers easy I'll just go with 20.

75
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:14,697
And then the rest will be other stuff, so 22 gallons of other stuff

76
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,748
It might not even be 22 gallons, some of it will just be

77
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:21,714
waste, some of it will be by-products some of it is actually

78
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:25,181
used to fuel the refining process.

79
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,864
I won't write that number, the rest is "other stuff."

80
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:33,797
So let's say, this refinery is paying $90 per barrel

81
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:38,430
when it gets it, so that incorporates what the oil procuders

82
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,582
are getting, and it also takes care of the transportation

83
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:45,198
costs to the refinery, and let's say jsut for the sake

84
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:49,431
of argument that the refinery can sell

85
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:51,864
Let's say that it doesn't even take care of the transportation

86
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:53,814
network, let's say there are people willing to buy directly

87
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:56,614
from the refinery at the refinery, they are willing to buy

88
00:04:56,614 --> 00:05:07,631
gasoline at $3.25 per gallon, so the gas at refinery,

89
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,964
people are willing to spend, the transporters are willing to pay them

90
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:21,394
$3.25 per gallon, and so from this barrel they're going

91
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:23,847
to get 20 gallons of gasoline, they can sell that

92
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:28,031
at $3.25 per gallon so you're going to have

93
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:43,864
20 * 3.25 = $65 for the gasoline

94
00:05:43,864 --> 00:05:45,781
And then let's just say, for the sake of argument,

95
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:51,147
they get $35 for the other stuff

96
00:05:51,147 --> 00:05:53,131
Some of this other stuff is actually quite useful, it's stuff like

97
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:56,265
motor oil, it could be jet fuel, it could be natural gas

98
00:05:56,265 --> 00:06:00,114
All sorts of... and it can obviously be fuel to actually fuel

99
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:05,597
the refinery, and so let's actually start building this up over here

100
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:14,015
so one way to think about it, let me draw it this way

101
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,915
so the price we're up to $3.25, this is what the price is

102
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:23,559
exiting the refinery, what the refinery is getting for it.

103
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:35,047
So, let's say this is one dollar, this is two dollars,

104
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:39,614
and this is three dollars, and they're getting $3.25

105
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:43,147
$3.25 would be like that, that is what the

106
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:45,397
refinery is getting and one way to think about it

107
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:49,666
It's not completely... not all of their profit is coming from the gasoline

108
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,797
But one way to think about it is the refinery, after refining

109
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:57,113
all of this barrel of crude oil that they paid $90 for,

110
00:06:57,113 --> 00:06:59,463
they're going to get $65 for the gasoline and then

111
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:06,166
they're going to get $35 for the other stuff

112
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,665
so they made a combination of $100. They were able to buy

113
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:12,898
crude oil at $90, do what they had to do, and then

114
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:16,347
they were able to sell it for $100, so one way to think

115
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:20,898
about it, at least in this situation, 90% of what they were

116
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,532
getting for it is their cost, it breaks down between

117
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:27,397
the other stuff and the gasoline, so it's not super easy to break

118
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:30,797
down, but you can say in this example a good chunk

119
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:35,965
of it was the cost of gasoline. And it obviously depends how

120
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:39,248
you account for it but a good chunk of it is the cost of

121
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:45,681
the crude, and this right over here you could say is

122
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:49,697
how much the refinery actually makes and that the amount

123
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:52,614
it actually gets versus what it costs, so the amount

124
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:55,964
they actually get for the product they produced versus the crude oil

125
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:58,515
that they had to pay for, this margin is often called

126
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:04,863
the crack spread. Just to understand what a refinery

127
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,847
is doing, it's breaking up the crude oil into its various parts

128
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:11,131
It's actually a very simple, well I don't want to say "simple process"

129
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:13,647
When you look at a refinery you obviously don't think it's a

130
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:16,015
simple thing, but the idea for the process is actually

131
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:21,298
fairly straightforward, it takes the crude oil

132
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:25,347
and it heats it up through a boiler, so right over here

133
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:29,814
the crude is getting really hot. This is the boiler,

134
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:34,916
the boiler is often fueled by some of the outputs of

135
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:42,881
that oil, and then it goes into a distillation column.

136
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:47,265
That's why you see all the towers over here in an oil refinery

137
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,881
Those are the distillation columns, and so in the

138
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:52,432
distillation columns the different parts of the oil have

139
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,881
different boiling temperatures. So the very long

140
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:57,547
carbon chains in the oil have very high boiling

141
00:08:57,547 --> 00:08:58,998
temperatures, so as hot as they are they're not

142
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:02,682
going to boil, they're going to stay in their liquid form

143
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:05,265
down here, and then the slightly shorter chains are

144
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:08,715
going to boil and evaporate a little bit but

145
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,714
then as they rise they're going to cool down and

146
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:13,464
then they might condense right over here and they can

147
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:16,981
be pulled away in pipes, and then things that have

148
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,964
slightly shorter chains than that will go a little bit higher

149
00:09:19,964 --> 00:09:22,498
before cooling to even lower temperatures before going

150
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,115
back into a liquid state, and they can be collected

151
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:26,432
over here... all the way until you get to the very

152
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,363
shortest chains, like the natural gas, that would be

153
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:32,197
collected out of the top. The gasoline that you put

154
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:38,281
in your car might be collected right over here from this

155
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:41,515
So essentially you're breaking up that oil into

156
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,115
its different parts. As for some of the different parts..

157
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,715
this might be motor oil over here, the thing you use to

158
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:47,681
lubricate, not fuel, your engine. You might have

159
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:50,397
jet fuel up here, then you have a whole ton of different

160
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:52,097
fuels, this might be kerosene, and all sorts of things...

161
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:56,197
you are able to take out of that crude oil.

162
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:57,865
But anyway, let's get back to the gasoline.

163
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:01,365
So the refinery got $3.25, now we have to

164
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:04,781
transport that gasoline, so let's say 10 cents for

165
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:08,582
transportation. This is at about $3.25 here, so now

166
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:12,780
we're going to have 10 cents for transportation

167
00:10:16,903 --> 00:10:19,798
I'll just write transportation for short.

168
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:22,214
And then it goes to the gas station, and as I mentioned

169
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:25,614
gas is heavily heavily taxed and it depends on what jurisdiction

170
00:10:25,614 --> 00:10:28,332
what country or even states within countries

171
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:31,031
but for the sake of simplicity let's just say that

172
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,265
it's taxed at about 50 cents a gallon, which is not that

173
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,532
different from what it's taxed at in many states.

174
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:38,814
So now we're at 50 cents a gallon so that would be

175
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:52,499
right around... this is tax right over here going

176
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:55,631
to the state and federal government, so let's see

177
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:58,547
$3.25 is what the refinery got, 10 cents for transportation gets

178
00:10:58,547 --> 00:11:05,097
us to $3.35, 50 cents for tax gets us up to $3.85

179
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:10,833
and then now we're at the gas station, it'll essentially

180
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,281
cost $3.85 for the fuel, but the gas station

181
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:15,481
needs to make some money to pay their costs

182
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:19,665
so the gas station sells you that fuel at a $4 per gallon

183
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:26,148
So you might say, hey! they gas station made 15 cents

184
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:40,797
But actually a huge amount of that 15 cents goes to the

185
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:43,031
credit card processors because most people

186
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:45,082
pay at the pump with their credit cards, so that's why

187
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:47,348
some gas stations like it, even give you a discount when

188
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:49,498
you pay in cash because of that 15 cents, as much as

189
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:53,547
or in general about 5 cents of that will go

190
00:11:53,547 --> 00:12:04,332
to the credit card fees. So the retailer will be

191
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:09,214
left with about 10 cents of margin.

192
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:11,631
So anyway, hopefully that gives you a sense of how

193
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,981
crude oil turns into gasoline, and when you pay at the pump

194
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:18,749
what is the breakdown for the different players

195
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:22,249
and how much of the money is going to those different

196
00:12:22,249 --> 99:59:59,999
players.
