1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,995
Thought I would do a video on Communism,

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:05,267
just because I've been talking about it a bunch

3
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:06,990
in the history videos, and I haven't given you

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,887
a good definition of what it means

5
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:11,245
or a good understanding of what it means.

6
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,413
To understand Communism,

7
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:13,503
let me just draw you a spectrum here.

8
00:00:13,503 --> 00:00:15,820
So, I'm just gonna start with Capitialism.

9
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,802
This is really just gonna be an overview.

10
00:00:17,802 --> 00:00:21,800
People can do a whole PhD thesis on this type of thing.

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,594
Capitalism and then I'll get a little bit more.

12
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:28,687
And then we can progress to Socialism.

13
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:31,067
And then we can go to Communism.

14
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:34,110
The modern versions of Communism are really kind of

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,133
the brainchild of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.

16
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,928
Karl Marx was a German philosopher in the 1800's

17
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:43,343
who in his communist manifesto and other writings,

18
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,867
kind of created

19
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:47,867
the philosophical underpinnings for Communism.

20
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:52,072
And Vladimir Lenin who led the Bolshevik revolution

21
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:54,530
and created essentially the Soviet Union.

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,800
He's the first person to

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,990
make some of Karl Marx's ideas more concrete.

24
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,544
And really every nation or every country which we view as communist

25
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:07,102
has really followed the pattern of Vladimir Lenin.

26
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:08,801
We'll talk about that in a second.

27
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:12,477
First let's talk about the philosophical differences between these things

28
00:01:12,477 --> 00:01:13,800
and how you would move.

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,467
Karl Marx himself viewed Communism as kind of a progression

30
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:22,800
from Capitalism through Socialism to Communism.

31
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,670
So, what he saw in Capitalism

32
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,840
and at least this part of what he saw was right

33
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:32,959
You have private property, private ownership of land.

34
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,159
That is the main aspect of Capitalism.

35
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,400
This is the world that most of us live in today.

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,092
The problem that he saw with Capitalism is,

37
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:42,908
he thought, well look, you know

38
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:44,123
when you have private property,

39
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:47,790
the people who start accumulating some capital

40
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,625
and when we talk about capital, we can be talking about land

41
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:53,733
we can be talking about factories

42
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,985
we can be talking about any type of natural resources

43
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:58,600
So the people who start getting a little bit of them

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,564
Let me draw a little diagram here.

45
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:04,600
Let's say someone has a little bit of capital.

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,533
That capital could be a factory or it could be land.

47
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:11,800
Let me write capital. So let's just say it's land.

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,467
So someone starts to own a little bit of land

49
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,800
And he owns more than everyone else.

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,600
So you just have a bunch of other people

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,129
who don't own land, but they need it essentially.

52
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:24,031
Since this guy owns all the land

53
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,118
they got to work on this guy's land.

54
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:28,610
They have to work on this guy's land.

55
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,467
And from Karl Marx's point of view, he said look,

56
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:35,067
if all of these labourers who don't have as much capital,

57
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,067
this guy has this capital.

58
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,862
And so he can make these labourers work

59
00:02:39,862 --> 00:02:44,400
for a very small wage. And so any excess profits

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,400
that come out from this arrangement,

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,792
the owner of the capital will be able to get it,

62
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:54,000
because these labourers won't be able to get their wages to go up,

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,548
because there's so much competition for them to work

64
00:02:57,548 --> 00:03:00,024
on this guy's farm or to work on this guy's land.

65
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:01,720
He really didn't think to much about.

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,179
Maybe the competition could go another way.

67
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,431
Maybe you could have a reality where,

68
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:06,682
maybe you could have a reality eventually

69
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:10,116
you'd have a bunch of people with reasonable amount of capital.

70
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:12,878
And you'd have a bunch of laborers.

71
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,995
And the bunch of people would compete for the laborers.

72
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:20,133
Maybe the laborers could make their wages go up.

73
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,733
And they could eventually accumulate their own capital.

74
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:25,513
And they could eventually start their own small businesses.

75
00:03:25,513 --> 00:03:28,129
He didn't really think about this reality too much over here.

76
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,459
He just saw this reality and

77
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,652
to his defense, and I don't want to get into the habit

78
00:03:32,652 --> 00:03:34,600
of defending Karl Marx too much. To his defense,

79
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,867
this is what was happening in the late 1800's.

80
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:41,118
Especially, you know, we have the industrial revolution.

81
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:44,400
Even in the United States you did have kind of

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
Mark Twain called it the gilded age.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,800
These industrialists who did accumulate huge amounts of capital

84
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,467
they really did have a lot of the leverage

85
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:55,467
relative to the laborers. And so Karl Marx says,

86
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:58,600
look, if the guy with all the capital has all the leverage

87
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,898
and this whole arrangement makes some profits,

88
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:02,652
he is going to be able to keep the profits

89
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:05,133
because he can keep all of these dudes' wages low.

90
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,938
So what is going to happen is the guy with the capital

91
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:10,375
is just going to end up with more capital.

92
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,852
He is going to end up with more capital.

93
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,102
And he is going to have even more leverage.

94
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,800
And he will be able to keep this people

95
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,718
on a kind of a basic wage

96
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:20,852
so that they can never acquire capital for themselves.

97
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:23,933
So, in Karl Marx's point of view, the natural progression

98
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:26,938
would be for these people to start organizing.

99
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:30,400
So these people maybe start organizing into unions.

100
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,200
So they could collectively tell the person who owns the land or the factory

101
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,148
"no, we're not going to work" or

102
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:40,467
"we're going to go on strikes unless you increase our wages"

103
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:43,200
or "unless you give us better working conditions".

104
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,871
So when you start talking about this unionization stuff,

105
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:48,467
you're starting to move into the direction of Socialism.

106
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:52,467
The other element of moving in the direction of Socialism

107
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:56,733
is that Karl Marx didn't like this kind of high concentration.

108
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:59,067
Socialists in general I should say, didn't like

109
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:02,267
this high concentration of wealth, that you have this reality of,

110
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:06,800
not only do you have these people who could accumulate

111
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,733
all of this wealth and maybe to some degree

112
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,523
they're able to accumulate it because they were innovative

113
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:13,538
or they were good managers of land, or whatever.

114
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,933
Although the Marxists don't give a lot of credit

115
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:19,200
to the owners of capital, they don't give a lot of credit to them.

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,933
Maybe they did have some skill in managing

117
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,467
some type of an operation.

118
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:24,867
But the other problem is that it gets handed over

119
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,533
it gets handed over to their offspring

120
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,133
So, private property you have this situation

121
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:32,933
where it just goes from, maybe, father to son

122
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,877
from parent to a child, so it's not even based

123
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,529
on any type of meritocracy.

124
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:40,990
It's really just based on this inherited wealth

125
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,867
and this is a problem, that you know,

126
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:45,929
definitely happened in Europe when you go back to the French Revolution,

127
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,779
you have generation after generation of nobility,

128
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:53,031
regardless of how incompetent each generation would be

129
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:55,133
they just had so much wealth

130
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:57,585
that they were essentially in control of everything.

131
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,913
And you had a bunch of people with no wealth

132
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:01,400
having to work for them.

133
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,200
And when you have that type of wealth disparity,

134
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,867
it does lead to a kind of revolution.

135
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:08,200
Another principle in moving into Socialist direction

136
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,800
is kind of a redistribution of wealth.

137
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,748
So let me write it over here. Redistribution.

138
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:16,309
Redistribution.

139
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,613
So, in Socialism you can still have private property

140
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:23,619
but the government takes a bigger role

141
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:27,913
Let me write this: larger government.

142
00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:30,067
And one of the roles of the government is

143
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:32,482
to redistribute wealth and the government also

144
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:37,252
starts having control of the major factors of production.

145
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:41,067
So maybe the utilities, maybe some of the large factories

146
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,800
that do major things all of the sudden start to become

147
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,067
in the hands of the government or in the words of the Communists,

148
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:51,492
in the hands of the people and the redistribution is going on,

149
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:54,551
so, in theory, you don't have huge amounts of wealth

150
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:58,133
in the hands of a few people.

151
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:02,364
If you kind of take these ideas to their natural conclusion

152
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:06,733
you get to the theoretical Communist state.

153
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:15,067
And the theoretical Communist state is a classless society

154
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,502
and in Karl Marx's point of view,

155
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,071
and this is a little harder to imagine

156
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:21,487
a stateless society

157
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:24,467
So, in Capitalism you definitely have classes

158
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:28,246
you had the class that owns the capital

159
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:29,482
and then you had the labor class

160
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,696
and you had all of these divisions and

161
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:32,058
they are kind of diferent from each other

162
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:33,933
and he didn't really imagine a world

163
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:36,647
where labor maybe could get out of this

164
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:38,112
that they could get their own capital

165
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:39,936
maybe they could start their own business.

166
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:43,733
So he just saw this tension would eventually lead to Socialism

167
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:47,400
and eventually a classless society where you'd have a central,

168
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,733
well he didn't go to much into the details

169
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:54,733
you'd have kind of equal, everyone is society has ownership

170
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,800
over everything and society somehow figures out

171
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,200
where things should be allocated and all of the rest.

172
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,839
And it's all stateless. And that's even harder

173
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,200
to think about in a concrete fashion.

174
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,067
So that's Karl Marx's view of things.

175
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:10,067
But it never really became concrete

176
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,333
until Vladimir Lenin shows up.

177
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,133
So, the current version of Communism,

178
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:18,600
the current thing that most of us view as Communism

179
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,733
is sometimes viewed as Marxist-Leninist State

180
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,933
Leninist.

181
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:28,467
These are sometimes used interchangeably

182
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,333
Marxism is kind of the pure Utopian,

183
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:35,400
we're eventually going to get to a world where everyone is equal.

184
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,621
Everyone is doing exactly what they want.

185
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,315
There's an abundance of everything.

186
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:42,861
I guess to some degree it is kind of describing

187
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:43,982
what happens in Star Trek where

188
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,589
everyone can go to a replicator and get what they want.

189
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:47,907
And if you want to paint part of the day,

190
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,280
you can paint part of the day.

191
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,796
And you're not just a painter

192
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,135
you can also do whatever you want.

193
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:53,933
So it is this very Utopian thing.

194
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,364
Let me write that down

195
00:08:55,364 --> 00:09:00,333
So Marxism, pure Marxism is kind of a Utopian society.

196
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,000
And just in case you don't know what Utopian means,

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,933
it's kind of a perfect society where you don't have classes.

198
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,209
Everyone is equal, everyone is leading

199
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:11,109
this kind of rich, diverse, fulfilling lives.

200
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:14,400
And Utopia is also kind of viewed as unrealistic

201
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,533
If you viewed it in the more negative light, it's like,

202
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,800
I don't know how we will ever be able to get there, who knows?

203
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,144
I don't want to be negative about it.

204
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,800
Maybe we'll get one day to a Utopian society.

205
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,733
But Leninist is kind of the more practical element of Communism.

206
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,874
Because, obviously after the Bolshevik Revolution, 1917,

207
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:33,428
in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union gets created.

208
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:35,222
They had to actually run a government.

209
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:36,677
They had to actually run a state

210
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,599
based on these ideas of Communism.

211
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:43,727
In a Leninist philosophy, and this is where it starts to

212
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:48,467
become in tension with the ideas of Democracy.

213
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:51,203
In a Leninist philosophy you need

214
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:56,133
this kind of a party system and he calls this Vanguard Party.

215
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:58,800
So the Vanguard is kind of the thing that is leading

216
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,400
that is leading the march.

217
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,095
So, this Vanguard Party that

218
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:05,467
kind of creates this constant state of revolution.

219
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:08,400
And its whole job is to guide society.

220
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,533
It's to kind of almost be the parent of society

221
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:15,400
and take it from Capitalism through Socialism

222
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,200
to this ideal state of Communism.

223
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,939
And it's one of those things where

224
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:22,733
the ideal state of Communism was never,

225
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:24,400
it's kind of hard to know when you get there

226
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,775
and so what happens in a Leninist state

227
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:29,333
is that this Vanguard Party, which is usually called

228
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,467
the Communist Party, is in a constant state of revolution

229
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:35,133
kind of saying we are sheperding the people

230
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,871
to some future state without a real clear definition

231
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,133
of what that future state is.

232
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:43,267
And so, when you talk about Marxist-Leninist

233
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,200
besides talking about what's happening

234
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,733
in the economic sphere, it's also talking about

235
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:51,133
this party system, this party system where

236
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,533
you really just have one dominant party

237
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,733
that it will hopefully act in the interest of the people.

238
00:10:56,733 --> 00:11:02,423
So, one dominant Communist party

239
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,372
that acts in the interest of the people.

240
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:10,504
And obviously the negative here is, how do you know

241
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,438
that they are really acting in the interest of people?

242
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,533
How do you know that they are actually competent?

243
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,600
What means are there to do anything

244
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,195
if they are misallocating things?

245
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:21,333
If it is corrupt? If you only have a one party system...

246
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,262
And just to make it clear, you know,

247
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:26,533
The largest existing Communist state is

248
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,533
the People's Republic of China.

249
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:32,067
And although it's controlled by the Communist party

250
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:35,433
in economic terms it's really not that communist anymore.

251
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:36,905
So it can be confusing.

252
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,400
So what I want to do is draw a little bit of a spectrum.

253
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,133
In the vertical axes over here I want to put Democratic

254
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:49,200
Democratic. And up here I'll put Authoritarian

255
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,733
Authoritarian or Totalitarian. Let me put Totalitarian.

256
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,400
Well, I'll put Authoritarian.

257
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,019
I'll do another video on the difference.

258
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,359
Authoritarian and they're similar.

259
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:03,187
Totalitarian is more of an extreme form of Authoritarian

260
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:05,800
where the government controls everything

261
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,200
and you have a few people controling everything

262
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,533
it's very non-democratic

263
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:12,533
Authoritarian is kind of along those directions.

264
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,933
And then in this spectrum

265
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,133
We have the Capitalism, Socialism and Communism.

266
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:21,400
So the United States, I would put the United States

267
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,297
some place over here.

268
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:25,276
I would put the United States over here.

269
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:28,097
It has some small elements of Socialism.

270
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:29,955
You do have labor unions.

271
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:31,667
They don't control everything.

272
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,502
You also have people working outside of labor unions.

273
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:38,000
It does have some elements of redistribution.

274
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,492
There are inheritance taxes, there are...

275
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,733
I mean it's not an extreme form of redistribution.

276
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,933
You can still inherit private property.

277
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,257
You still have safety nets for people.

278
00:12:49,257 --> 00:12:51,605
You have MediCare, MediCaid. You have welfare.

279
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,333
So there's some elements of Socialism

280
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,401
But it also has a very strong Capitalist history

281
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,467
private property, deep markets.

282
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,067
So I would stick to the United States over there.

283
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:05,390
I would put the USSR, not current Russia,

284
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,919
but the Soviet Union when it existed

285
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,576
I would put the Soviet Union right about...

286
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:14,467
I would put the Soviet Union right about there

287
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:21,400
So this was the U... I'd put the USSR right over there.

288
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,800
I'd put the current State of Russia actually...

289
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,800
I'd put the current State of Russia some place over here.

290
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,771
Because they actually have fewer safety nets and

291
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:34,533
they kind of have a more...their economy can kind of go crazier

292
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:37,150
and they actually have a bigger disparity in wealth

293
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,586
than a place like the United States

294
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:42,747
So this is.. This is current Russia

295
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:44,609
And probably the most interesting one here is

296
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:46,887
the People's Republic of China

297
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:48,668
the current People's Republic of China

298
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:51,882
which is at least on the surface a Communist state

299
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:55,061
but in some ways it's more Capitalist than the United States

300
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:58,800
in that they don't have strong wealth redistribution.

301
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,533
They don't have strong safety nets for people.

302
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:05,333
So, you could put some elements of China

303
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,067
over here, closer to the left... and they are

304
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:12,225
less democratic than either the US or even current Russia

305
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:14,001
although some people would call current Russia...

306
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:15,800
Well, I won't go too much into it

307
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,989
But current China, you could draw it here a little bit

308
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:19,323
So it could be even

309
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:20,867
a little bit more Capitalist than the United States.

310
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:24,190
Definitely they don't even have good labour laws

311
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,206
and all the rest. But in other ways you do have

312
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:28,654
state ownership of a lot.

313
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:31,267
And you do have State control of a lot.

314
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:33,800
So, in some ways they're kind of spanning

315
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,251
this whole range. So, this right over here is China.

316
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:40,400
And even thought it's called a Communist State,

317
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
in some ways, it's more Capitalist than

318
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,200
countries that are very proud of their Capitalism.

319
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,345
But in a lot of other ways, especially with

320
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,800
the government ownership and the government control of things

321
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,067
and this one dominant party. So, it's kind of Leninist

322
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,663
but with less of the Marxist going on.

323
00:14:54,663 --> 00:14:57,584
So, in that way it's more in the Communist direction.

324
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:59,230
So, hopefully that clarifies

325
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,087
what can sometimes be a confusing topic.
