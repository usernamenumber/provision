1
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:13,279
We're in Tate Britain and we're looking at John Everett Millais's really important early Pre-Raphaelite painting, Christ in the House of his Parents.

2
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:19,593
The Pre-Raphaelites wanted to strip away all the traditions of painting that had accumulated,

3
00:00:19,593 --> 00:00:21,638
almost like heavy layers of varnish,

4
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:25,885
on painting since the Renaissance, since Raphael.

5
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:29,056
And nowhere is that more clear than in this painting.

6
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:32,383
What we see here is Christ as a child.

7
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:33,799
He's wounded himself.

8
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:38,905
We see a drop of blood, clearly foreshadowing the Crucifixion.

9
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:44,144
We see Mary, his mother, comforting him and also, I think, being comforted by him.

10
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:48,759
And then we also see Saint John the Baptist and Saint Joseph, also tending to Christ.

11
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:51,845
He's showing us Christ not in an idealised environment,

12
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:55,125
but in a workshop that reminded contemporary viewers

13
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:59,428
of what a carpenter's workshop in mid-nineteenth-century England looked like.

14
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:02,943
A kind of specificity that showed that he was really looking.

15
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:07,641
So it's not idealised at all, it's not softened, it's not made more beautiful.

16
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:12,478
All of that really went against traditional treatments of the Holy Family,

17
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,991
of Mary and Christ and, say, Joseph and Saint John.

18
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:21,869
Since the time of Raphael and Leonardo, those figures were truly idealised,

19
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,497
in a way that reflected their divine status.

20
00:01:25,497 --> 00:01:28,486
By taking that idealisation away,

21
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:33,564
I think it felt to Victorian viewers as though Millais had undermined the spirituality of these figures.

22
00:01:33,564 --> 00:01:36,510
All of that is true, but there are some exceptions.

23
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,352
If we think back to the work of Carravaggio, we have an artist,

24
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:42,434
that is taking spiritual figures and placing them

25
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:45,482
in a world that was concrete, that was low, that was real.

26
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:48,315
But he was still ensconcing them in a kind of spiritual darkness.

27
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:52,331
Here it's as if Millais has turned the lights on, in a Carravaggio.

28
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:58,034
He's giving us this brilliant spotlight on the specifity even of the dirt under the fingernails.

29
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:02,146
And that was certainly something that was recognised by Victorian viewers.

30
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:06,745
This painting was attacked by Charles Dickens, of all people, who wrote:

31
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:09,411
"In the foreground of that carpenter's shop

32
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:14,241
is a hideous, wrynecked, blubbering, red-headed boy, in a bed-gown,

33
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:18,422
who appears to have received a poke in the hand from the stick of another boy

34
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:21,207
with whom he has been playing in an adjacent gutter,

35
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:25,834
and to be holding it up for the contemplation of a kneeling woman, so horrible in her ugliness

36
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:29,150
that she would stand out from the rest of the company as a Monster,

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,477
in the vilest cabaret in France, or the lowest ginshop in England..."

38
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:39,215
It's so interesting to hear Dickens actually turning against the kind of specificity that the artist is rendering,

39
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:41,858
since it's so much a part of his own literature.

40
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:45,690
But it does speak to expectations of the 19th century about what art should be,

41
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:50,204
at this moment when the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was trying to remake those expectations.

42
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:54,604
If you look at the painting carefully, you can see that the figures have angularity.

43
00:02:54,604 --> 00:03:01,443
They move in ways that feel very different from the gracefulness and elegance of Renaissance figures.

44
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:07,585
There's a linear hardness to the way that Millais has created their contours.

45
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:13,925
And that hardness reminds us of Flemish painting from before Raphael, from, say, the early 15th century.

46
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:19,790
This is really the self-conscious reviving of those ideas, and just like in that Northern Flemish painting,

47
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:25,526
we also have borrowed this notion that one can imbue ordinary objects with symbolism.

48
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:28,189
This is a painting that is full of symbolism.

49
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:31,200
For instance, if we look just over the young Christ's head,

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,162
we can see how at the back wall there is a carpenter's triangle.

51
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:38,552
Just over Christ's head, that triangle means something - it means the Trinity.

52
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,189
And we might look at the ladder in the background

53
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:45,426
and think about the ladder that we see in images of the Descent from the Cross,

54
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:50,600
where the followers of Christ climb a ladder in order to remove the nails and bring him down from the cross.

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,668
We can see those nails, but also, on that ladder there's a dove,

56
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:57,996
a reference to the ultimate Baptism of Christ, where the Holy Spirit will appear,

57
00:03:57,996 --> 00:04:01,008
who's always represented as a dove.

58
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:04,459
And we see Saint John the Baptist actually on the right, carrying a bowl of water.

59
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,491
So there is this kind of vivid rendering of all these forms, of all these people,

60
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:12,414
with a kind of particularity that is not idealised,

61
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:14,788
that makes them all the more true, all the more vivid.

62
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:19,551
And so we can immediately imagine why the Victorians had such problems with this painting.
