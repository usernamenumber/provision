1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,630
Let's say I have a line that
goes through the origin.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,630
I'll draw it in R2, but this
can be extended to an

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,630
arbitrary Rn.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,410
Let me draw my axes.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,310
Those are my axes right there,
not perfectly drawn, but you

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:15,670
get the idea.

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,810
Let me draw a line that goes
through the origin here.

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,600
So that is my line there.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,830
And we know that a line in any
Rn-- we're doing it in R2--

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,380
can be defined as just all of
the possible scalar multiples

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,550
of some vector.

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,390
So let's say that this is
some vector right here

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,600
that's on the line.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,120
We can define our line.

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
We could say l is equal to
the set of all the scalar

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,700
multiples-- let's say that
that is v, right there.

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,520
So it's all the possible scalar
multiples of our vector

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,870
v where the scalar multiples,
by definition, are just any

19
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,310
real number.

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,380
So obviously, if you take all
of the possible multiples of

21
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,760
v, both positive multiples and
negative multiples, and less

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,239
than 1 multiples, fraction
multiples, you'll have a set

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,720
of vectors that will essentially
define or specify

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,340
every point on that line that
goes through the origin.

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,820
And we know, of course, if this
wasn't a line that went

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,720
through the origin,
you would have to

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,910
shift it by some vector.

28
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,490
It would have to be some
other vector plus cv.

29
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,450
But anyway, we're starting off
with this line definition that

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,580
goes through the origin.

31
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,740
What I want to do in this video
is to define the idea of

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:33,550
a projection onto L of
some other vector x.

33
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,630
So let me draw my
other vector x.

34
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's say that this right here
is my other vector x.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,440
Now, a projection, I'm going
to give you just a sense of

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,770
it, and then we'll define it a
little bit more precisely.

37
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,860
A projection, I always imagine,
is if you had some

38
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,790
light source that were
perpendicular somehow or

39
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,370
orthogonal to our line-- so
let's say our light source was

40
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,220
shining down like this, and
I'm doing that direction

41
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,950
because that is perpendicular
to my line, I imagine the

42
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,600
projection of x onto this line
as kind of the shadow of x.

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,485
So if this light was coming
down, I would just draw a

44
00:02:11,485 --> 00:02:15,630
perpendicular like that, and the
shadow of x onto l would

45
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,840
be that vector right there.

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:26,500
So we can view it as the shadow
of x on our line l.

47
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,550
That's one way to think of it.

48
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,480
Another way to think of it,
and you can think of it

49
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,580
however you like, is how much of
x goes in the l direction?

50
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,610
So the technique would
be the same.

51
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,570
You would draw a perpendicular
from x to l, and you say, OK

52
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,740
then how much of l would have to
go in that direction to get

53
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,330
to my perpendicular?

54
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,270
Either of those are how I
think of the idea of a

55
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,790
projection.

56
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,140
I think the shadow is part of
the motivation for why it's

57
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,710
even called a projection,
right?

58
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,720
When you project something,
you're beaming light and

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,870
seeing where the light
hits on a wall, and

60
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,610
you're doing that here.

61
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,330
You're beaming light and you're
seeing where that light

62
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,190
hits on a line in this case.

63
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,835
But you can't do anything
with this definition.

64
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:07,750
This is just kind of an
intuitive sense of what a

65
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,740
projection is.

66
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,570
So we need to figure out some
way to calculate this, or a

67
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,490
more mathematically precise
definition.

68
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,430
And one thing we can do is,
when I created this

69
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,360
projection-- let me actually
draw another projection of

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,480
another line or another vector
just so you get the idea.

71
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,030
If I had some other vector over
here that looked like

72
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,050
that, the projection of this
onto the line would look

73
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:27,730
something like this.

74
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,440
You would just draw a
perpendicular and its

75
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,430
projection would be like that.

76
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,210
But I don't want to talk
about just this case.

77
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,410
I want to give you the sense
that it's the shadow of any

78
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,130
vector onto this line.

79
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,660
So how can we think about it
with our original example?

80
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,350
In every case, no matter how
I perceive it, I dropped a

81
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,100
perpendicular down here.

82
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,270
And so if we construct a vector
right here, we could

83
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,120
say, hey, that vector is
always going to be

84
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,840
perpendicular to the line.

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,920
And we can do that.

86
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,320
I wouldn't have been talking
about it if we couldn't.

87
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,050
So let me define this vector,
which I've not

88
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,480
even defined it.

89
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,450
What is this vector
going to be?

90
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,410
If this vector-- let me
not use all these.

91
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,150
We know we want to somehow
get to this blue vector.

92
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,810
Let me keep it in blue.

93
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,560
That blue vector is the
projection of x onto l.

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,500
That's what we want to get to.

95
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,230
Now, one thing we can
look at is this pink

96
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,920
vector right there.

97
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,580
What is that pink vector?

98
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,910
That pink vector that I just
drew, that's the vector x

99
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,610
minus the projection, minus this
blue vector over here,

100
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,030
minus the projection
of x onto l, right?

101
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,120
If you add the projection to
the pink vector, you get x.

102
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,050
So if you add this blue
projection of x to x minus the

103
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,480
projection of x, you're, of
course, you going to get x.

104
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,630
We also know that this pink
vector is orthogonal to the

105
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,510
line itself, which means it's
orthogonal to every vector on

106
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,400
the line, which also means that
its dot product is going

107
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,880
to be zero.

108
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,330
So let me define the projection
this way.

109
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,680
The projection, this is going
to be my slightly more

110
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,300
mathematical definition.

111
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,270
The projection onto l of some
vector x is going to be some

112
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,380
vector that's in l, right?

113
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,390
I drew it right here,
this blue vector.

114
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,590
I'll trace it with
white right here.

115
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:29,070
Some vector in l where, and
this might be a little bit

116
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:38,910
unintuitive, where x minus the
projection vector onto l of x

117
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:47,120
is orthogonal to my line.

118
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,850
So I'm saying the projection--
this is my definition.

119
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,990
I'm defining the projection of x
onto l with some vector in l

120
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,390
where x minus that projection
is orthogonal to l.

121
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,490
This is my definition.

122
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,180
That is a little bit more
precise and I think it makes a

123
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,940
bit of sense why it connects to
the idea of the shadow or

124
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,050
projection.

125
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,420
But how can we deal with this?

126
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,860
I mean, this is still
just in words.

127
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,580
How can I actually calculate
the projection of x onto l?

128
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,620
Well, the key clue here is this
notion that x minus the

129
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,160
projection of x is
orthogonal to l.

130
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,930
So let's see if we can
use that somehow.

131
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,700
So the first thing we need to
realize is, by definition,

132
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,150
because the projection of x onto
l is some vector in l,

133
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,660
that means it's some scalar
multiple of v, some scalar

134
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,510
multiple of our defining vector,
of our v right there.

135
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,700
So we could also say, look, we
could rewrite our projection

136
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,640
of x onto l.

137
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,760
We could write it as some scalar
multiple times our

138
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,270
vector v, right?

139
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,000
We can say that.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,160
This is equivalent to
our projection.

141
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,120
Now, we also know that x minus
our projection is orthogonal

142
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,580
to l, so we also know that x
minus our projection-- and I

143
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,345
just said that I could rewrite
my projection as some multiple

144
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:03,990
of this vector right there.

145
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,140
You could see it the
way I drew it here.

146
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,790
It almost looks like it's
2 times its vector.

147
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,330
So we know that x minus our
projection, this is our

148
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,150
projection right here,
is orthogonal to l.

149
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,710
Orthogonality, by definition,
means its dot product with any

150
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,460
vector in l is 0.

151
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,720
So let's dot it with
some vector in l.

152
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,060
Or we could dot it with
this vector v.

153
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,580
That's what we use
to define l.

154
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,700
So let's dot it with v,
and we know that that

155
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,380
must be equal to 0.

156
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,810
We're taking this vector right
here, dotting it with v, and

157
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,680
we know that this has
to be equal to 0.

158
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,390
That has to be equal to 0.

159
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,020
So let's use our properties of
dot products to see if we can

160
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,910
calculate a particular value of
c, because once we know a

161
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,130
particular value of c, then we
can just always multiply that

162
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,910
times the vector v, which we
are given, and we will have

163
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,760
our projection.

164
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,720
And then I'll show it to you
with some actual numbers.

165
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,610
So let's see if we can
calculate a c.

166
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,200
So if we distribute this c--
oh, sorry, if we distribute

167
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,670
the v, we know the dot
product exhibits the

168
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,940
distributive property.

169
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:14,470
This expression can be rewritten
as x dot v, right? x

170
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,725
dot v minus c times v dot v.

171
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,410
I rearranged things.

172
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,180
We know that c minus cv dot
v is the same thing.

173
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,530
We could write it as minus cv.

174
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,520
This is minus c times v dot v,
and all of this, of course, is

175
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,260
equal to 0.

176
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,750
And if we want to solve for c,
let's add cv dot v to both

177
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,950
sides of the equation.

178
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:44,750
And you get x dot v is equal
to c times v dot v.

179
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,820
Solving for c, let's divide
both sides of this

180
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,740
equation by v dot v.

181
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,160
You get-- I'll do it in
a different color.

182
00:08:51,160 --> 00:09:00,470
c is equal to this: x dot
v divided by v dot v.

183
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,930
Now, what was c?

184
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,090
We are saying the projection of
x-- let me write it here.

185
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:10,250
The projection of x onto
l is equal to some

186
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,870
scalar multiple, right?

187
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:17,110
We know it's in the line, so
it's some scalar multiple of

188
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,550
this defining vector,
the vector v.

189
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,780
And we just figured out
what that scalar

190
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,730
multiple is going to be.

191
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:35,080
It's going to be x dot v over v
dot v, and this, of course,

192
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,680
is just going to be
a number, right?

193
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,640
This is a scalar still.

194
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,170
Even though we have all these
vectors here, when you take

195
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,460
their dot products, you just end
up with a number, and you

196
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,010
multiply that number times v.

197
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,370
You just kind of scale v and
you get your projection.

198
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,000
So in this case, the way I
drew it up here, my dot

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,240
product should end up with some
scaling factor that's

200
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,260
close to 2, so that if I start
with a v and I scale it up by

201
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,700
2, this value would be 2, and
I'd get a projection that

202
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,210
looks something like that.

203
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,360
Now, this looks a little
abstract to you, so let's do

204
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,870
it with some real vectors, and
I think it'll make a little

205
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,610
bit more sense.

206
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,450
And nothing I did here
only applies to R2.

207
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,650
Everything I did here can be
extended to an arbitrarily

208
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,850
high dimension, so even though
we're doing it in R2, and R2

209
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,890
and R3 is where we tend to
deal with projections the

210
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,560
most, this could apply to Rn.

211
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,760
Let me do this particular
case.

212
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,940
Let me define my line l to
be the set of all scalar

213
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,290
multiples of the vector-- I
don't know, let's say the

214
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:40,150
vector 2, 1, such that
c is any real number.

215
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:46,000
Let me draw my axes here.

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,150
That's my vertical axis.

217
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,790
This is my horizontal
axis right there.

218
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,770
And so my line is all the
scalar multiples of the

219
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,990
vector 2 dot 1.

220
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,250
And actually, let me just call
my vector 2 dot 1, let me call

221
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,130
that right there the vector v.

222
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:58,950
Let me draw that.

223
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,570
So I go 1, 2, go up 1.

224
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,490
That right there
is my vector v.

225
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,380
And the line is all of
the possible scalar

226
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,970
multiples of that.

227
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,010
So let me draw that.

228
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,020
So all the possible scalar
multiples of that and you just

229
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,010
keep going in that direction, or
you keep going backwards in

230
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,040
that direction or anything
in between.

231
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,990
That's what my line is, all
of the scalar multiples

232
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,240
of my vector v.

233
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,680
Now, let's say I have another
vector x, and let's say that x

234
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,790
is equal to 2, 3.

235
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:43,140
Let me draw x. x is 2, and
then you go, 1, 2, 3.

236
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,540
So x will look like this.

237
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,110
Vector x will look like that.

238
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,640
Well, let me draw it a little
bit better than that.

239
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,780
Vector x will look like that.

240
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,250
That is vector x.

241
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,560
But what we want to do
is figure out the

242
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,420
projection of x onto l.

243
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,290
We can use this definition
right here.

244
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,810
So let me write it down.

245
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:08,800
The projection of x onto
l is equal to what?

246
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,850
It's equal to x dot v, right?

247
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,810
Where v is the defining
vector for our line.

248
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:24,750
So it's equal to x, which is
2, 3, dot v, which is 2, 1,

249
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,800
all of that over v dot v.

250
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:36,080
So all of that over 2, 1, dot
2, 1 times our original

251
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,750
defining vector v.

252
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,010
So what's our original
defining vector?

253
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,190
It's this one right
here, 2, 1.

254
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,410
So times the vector, 2, 1.

255
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,910
And what does this equal?

256
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,380
When you take these two dot of
each other, you have 2 times 2

257
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:57,240
plus 3 times 1, so 4 plus
3, so you get 7.

258
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,200
This all simplified to 7.

259
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,490
And then this, you get 2
times 2 plus 1 times 1,

260
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,410
so 4 plus 1 is 5.

261
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,550
So you get 7/5.

262
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,800
That will all simplified to 5.

263
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,370
That was a very fast
simplification.

264
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,270
You might have been daunted
by this strange-looking

265
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,540
expression, but when you take
dot products, they actually

266
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,260
tend to simplify very quickly.

267
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,540
And then you just multiply
that times your defining

268
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,230
vector for the line.

269
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,620
So we're scaling it up
by a factor of 7/5.

270
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,170
So multiply it times
the vector 2, 1,

271
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,490
and what do you get?

272
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,730
You get the vector-- let me
do it in a new color.

273
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,860
You get the vector, 14/5
and the vector 7/5.

274
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,840
And just so we can visualize
this or plot it a little

275
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,380
better, let me write
it as decimals.

276
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,310
14/5 is 2 and 4/5,
which is 2.8.

277
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,310
And this is 1 and 2/5,
which is 1.4.

278
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,800
And so the projection of x
onto l is 2.8 and 1.4.

279
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,740
So 2.8 is right about there,
and I go 1.4 is right about

280
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,210
there, so the vector is going
to be right about there.

281
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,655
I haven't even drawn
this too precisely,

282
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:07,660
but you get the idea.

283
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,250
This is the projection.

284
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,290
Our computation shows
us that this is the

285
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,710
projection of x onto l.

286
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,720
If we draw a perpendicular right
there, we see that it's

287
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,300
consistent with our idea of
this being the shadow of x

288
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,170
onto our line now.

289
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,490
Well, now we actually can
calculate projections.

290
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,110
In the next video, I'll actually
show you how to

291
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,135
figure out a matrix
representation for this, which

292
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:36,360
is essentially a
transformation.
