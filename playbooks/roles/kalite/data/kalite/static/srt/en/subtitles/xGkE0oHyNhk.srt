1
00:00:00,732 --> 00:00:02,072
Let's continue with our

2
00:00:02,072 --> 00:00:04,546
orange juice producing example

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,238
In this situation I want to think about

4
00:00:06,238 --> 00:00:09,432
what a rational quantity of orange juice might be

5
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:11,541
what would be a rational quantity

6
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:12,994
of orange juice to produce

7
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:14,725
given a market price

8
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:15,705
So let's say that

9
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:20,115
the market price right now is

10
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:21,973
50 cents a gallon

11
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:23,253
and I'm going to assume that

12
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:24,887
there are many producers here

13
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:26,756
so we're going to have to be price takers

14
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:27,817
and obviously we want to charge

15
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:29,345
as much as we can per gallon

16
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:31,824
but if we charge even a penny

17
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,318
over 50 cents a gallon

18
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:34,389
then people are going to buy

19
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:35,254
all of their orange juice

20
00:00:35,254 --> 00:00:36,160
from other people

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,965
so this is the price that we can charge

22
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:40,614
50 cents per gallon

23
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:41,682
So, if we think about it

24
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:43,896
in terms of marginal revenue

25
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:45,827
per incremental gallon

26
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:47,383
well that first incremental gallon

27
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:48,908
we're going to get 50 cents

28
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:50,000
the next incremental gallon

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,652
we're going to get 50 cents for that one

30
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,584
and the next one

31
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:53,470
we're going to get 50 cents as well.

32
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,535
for the first thousand gallons

33
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:55,458
we're going to get 50 cents

34
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,807
for each of those gallons

35
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,302
for the first 10 thousand gallons

36
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:00,058
we'll get 50 cents per gallon

37
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:01,554
So, our marginal revenue curve

38
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:04,391
will look something like this

39
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:07,124
Our marginal revenue is a flat curve

40
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:09,319
right at 50 cents a gallon

41
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,638
so that is our marginal revenue

42
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,528
at 50 cents

43
00:01:14,528 --> 00:01:18,090
at a market price of 50 cents per gallon

44
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,467
now in this situation

45
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:20,849
what's a reasonable quantity

46
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,212
that we would want to produce?

47
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,512
Now there's two dynamics here

48
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:29,466
we want to produce as much as possible

49
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:32,682
so that we can spread our fixed cost

50
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:37,337
over those gallons

51
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:39,371
that's one way of thinking about it

52
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:41,501
or, another way of thinking about it is

53
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,216
we have a certain amount of fixed cost

54
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:46,306
we are spending $1000 no matter what

55
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,504
so why don't we try to get

56
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:49,435
as much revenue as possible

57
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:52,055
to try to make up for those fixed costs

58
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:53,036
or if we think about it

59
00:01:53,036 --> 00:01:54,655
in terms of average fixed cost

60
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:57,017
the more quantity that we produce

61
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:59,516
the component of the cost for that

62
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:00,769
from the fixed cost

63
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:02,652
goes down and down and down

64
00:02:02,652 --> 00:02:04,322
so we want to have as much as possible

65
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:05,913
to spread our fixed costs

66
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:08,761
now the one thing that we do need to think about is

67
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,726
especially once we kind of get beyond the little dip

68
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:13,286
in the marginal cost curve

69
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:15,123
and as we produce more and more units

70
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:18,551
the marginal cost is going up higher and higher and higher

71
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:20,117
we don't want to produce so much

72
00:02:20,117 --> 00:02:22,885
that the cost of producing that incremental unit

73
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:25,296
the marginal cost of that incremental unit

74
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:28,908
is more than the marginal cost of that actual

75
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:31,074
or the marginal cost of that incremental unit

76
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:33,004
is not higher than the marginal revenue

77
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:35,802
that we're getting on that incremental unit

78
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:45,685
so, until marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost

79
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:47,263
or another way to think about it

80
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:51,846
you don't want marginal cost

81
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,726
and this is after we go to this little dip here

82
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:55,605
we're trying to do as much as possible

83
00:02:55,605 --> 00:02:57,636
marginal cost is going higher and higher and higher

84
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,641
we don't want to produce this much right over here

85
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:03,659
because here the cost for that extra gallon is higher

86
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,210
than what we're going to get for that extra gallon

87
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,950
looks like that cost for that extra gallon

88
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,430
might be 53 cents

89
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,664
while we're only gonna get 50 cents

90
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:11,733
for that extra gallon

91
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,800
so every extra gallon we produce over here

92
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,240
we're going to be losing money

93
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,457
so you don't want marginal cost

94
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:23,339
to be greater than marginal revenue

95
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,282
so when you look at the curves like this

96
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:26,284
and make sense to just say

97
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:30,063
when does marginal revenue equal marginal cost?

98
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:32,183
and that's this point right over here

99
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:35,046
and that is the rational amount to produce

100
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:37,881
so that is 9000 units

101
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,832
so we're going to be at this line over here

102
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:43,365
we're gonna produce 9000 gallons of juice

103
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:45,059
our revenue that we're going to get

104
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,862
is going to be the rectangle of the area

105
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:52,383
that is high as the price we're getting per unit

106
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:54,615
times the number of units

107
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:57,203
so this is gonna be the total revenue we get

108
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,547
if we were to shade this in

109
00:03:58,547 --> 00:03:59,595
I'm not gonna shade this in

110
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:01,808
because it's going to make my whole diagram messy

111
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,712
and what's our total cost?

112
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,815
well, we have our average total cost right here

113
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,791
this is our average total cost at 48 cents

114
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,356
that's the little green triangle here

115
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:14,733
so it's 48 cents per unit

116
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,771
times the total number of units

117
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:21,168
our cost, the area in this rectangle

118
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:22,349
so if I were to shade this in

119
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:24,406
this little slightly smaller rectangle

120
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:27,073
and so our profits are the difference between the two

121
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:30,799
our total revenue is the area under the rectangle

122
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:34,690
that has this marginal revenue line as its upper bound

123
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,253
and our cost is the rectangle

124
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:38,059
that has our average total cost

125
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:39,586
this line right over here

126
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:40,820
as its upper bound

127
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,389
so our profits in this circumstance

128
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:47,090
are going to be the area right over here

129
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,159
the height is the difference between our marginal cost

130
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,788
which is the same as our marginal revenue

131
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:53,838
and our total cost

132
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:56,149
so the heigh is going to be

133
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:58,043
this two cents right over here

134
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:00,023
we're taking the difference of 50 and 48

135
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:01,608
so it's gonna be 2 cents

136
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:03,238
and then, the quantity produced

137
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:05,977
is going to be 9000 units

138
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:07,630
so 9000

139
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,674
we're making 2 cents per unit

140
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:11,857
remember, our average cost

141
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:14,401
our average total cost is 48 cents per unit

142
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:15,882
we're selling that 50 cents per unit

143
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,267
so we're making 2 cents per unit

144
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,313
that's not 20

145
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:20,318
we're making 2 cents per unit

146
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:26,560
2 cents times 9000 units gives us

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,993
that's 18000 cents, or 180 dollars of profit

148
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:35,049
now what I want you to think about

149
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:36,802
and we'll answer this in the next video

150
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:41,956
is does it make sense to sell units at all

151
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:44,146
and if so, how many units should we sell

152
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:45,837
if, and here is the question

153
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:50,326
if the market price is lower

154
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:52,792
than your average total cost

155
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:54,053
so does it make sense

156
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,473
and how many units does it make sense to produce

157
00:05:57,473 --> 00:06:05,519
let's say if the market price were 45 cents per unit

158
00:06:05,519 --> 99:59:59,999
does it make sense for us to produce
