1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,830
All right, we're doing the
California Standards released

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,530
questions in geometry now.

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,990
And here's the first question.

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,120
It says, which of the following
best describes

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,330
deductive reasoning?

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,420
And I'm not a huge fan of when
they ask essentially

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,890
definitional questions
in math class.

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,950
But we'll do it and hopefully
it will help you understand

10
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,070
what deductive reasoning is.

11
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,380
Although, I do think that
deductive reasoning itself is

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,380
probably more natural than the
definition they'll give here.

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,360
Well, actually before I even
look at the definitions, let

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,300
me tell you what it is.

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,670
And then we can see which of
these definitions matches it.

16
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,650
Deductive reasoning is, if I
give you a bunch of statements

17
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,140
and then from those statements
you deduce, or you come to

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,380
some conclusion that you
know must be true.

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:54,070
Like if, I said that
all boys are tall.

20
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,000
If I told you all
boys are tall.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,780
And if I told you that
Bill is a boy.

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,790
Bill is a boy.

23
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,430
That's two separate
words, a and boy.

24
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,580
So if you say, OK, if these two
statements are true, what

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,420
can you deduce?

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,220
Well I say well, Bill is a boy
and all boys are tall.

27
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,160
Then Bill must be tall.

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,820
You deduced this last statement
from these two other

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,880
statements that you
knew were true.

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,090
And this one has to be true
if those two are true.

31
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,630
So Bill must be tall.

32
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,540
That is deductive reasoning.

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,170
Deductive reasoning.

34
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,790
Bill must be tall, not Bill
must be deductive.

35
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,250
So anyway, you have some
statements and you deduce

36
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,920
other statements that must
be true given those.

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,580
And you often hear
another type of

38
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,850
reasoning, inductive reasoning.

39
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,330
And that's when you're given a
couple of examples and you

40
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,580
generalize.

41
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,080
   

42
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,305
Well, I don't want to get too
complicated here, because this

43
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:56,810
is a question on deductive
reasoning.

44
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,830
But generalizations often
aren't a good thing.

45
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,080
But if you see a couple of
examples and you see a pattern

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,540
there you can often extrapolate
and get to a kind

47
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,070
of broader generalization.

48
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,080
That's inductive reasoning.

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,979
But that's not what they're
asking us about this.

50
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,310
Let's see if we can find the
definition of deductive

51
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,000
reasoning in the California
Standards language.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,510
Use logic to draw conclusions
based on accepted statements.

53
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,520
Yeah, well actually that
sounds about right.

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,130
That's what we did here.

55
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,760
We used logic to draw
conclusions based on accepted

56
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,320
statements, which
were those two.

57
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,800
So I'm going to go
with A, so far.

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,260
Accepting the meaning of a
term without definition.

59
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,630
Well, I don't even know
how one can do that.

60
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,200
How do you accept the meaning of
something without it having

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,210
being defined?

62
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,650
Let's see, so it's not B.

63
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,990
I don't think anything
is really B.

64
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,820
C, defining mathematical
terms to correspond

65
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,420
with physical objects.

66
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,980
No, that's not really
anything related to

67
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,810
deductive reasoning either.

68
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,060
D, inferring a general truth
by examining a number of

69
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,040
specific examples.

70
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,290
Well, this is more of what
I had just talked about,

71
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,870
inductive reasoning.

72
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,270
So, they want to know what
deductive reasoning is, so I'm

73
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,780
going to go with A.

74
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,770
Use logic to draw conclusions
based on accepted statements.

75
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:19,080
   

76
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,330
Next problem.

77
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,430
   

78
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,290
OK, let me copy and paste
the whole thing.

79
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,470
   

80
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,996
Copy and paste is essential with
these geometry problems,

81
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:32,750
we won't have to redraw
everything.

82
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,230
OK, in the diagram below, angle
1, and this right here,

83
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,510
you should learn,
means congruent.

84
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,510
   

85
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,110
When you say two angles are
congruent, so in this case

86
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,200
they're saying angle 1 is
congruent to angle 4, that

87
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,990
means that they have the
same angle measure.

88
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,240
And the only difference between
congruent and being

89
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,210
equal is that congruent says
they can have the same angle

90
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,040
measure, but they could be
in different directions.

91
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,440
And the rays that come out
from them could be of

92
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,380
different lengths.

93
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,370
Although I'd often say
that's equal as well.

94
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,160
But if we're dealing
with congruency,

95
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,800
that's what it means.

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,110
It essentially just means the
angle measures are equal.

97
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,560
So we could draw that here.

98
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,030
Angle 1 is congruent
to angle 4.

99
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,740
It just mean that these angle
measures are the same.

100
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,019
Whether we're measuring them
in degrees or radians.

101
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,230
All right, now what do they
want us to come to a

102
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,760
conclusion?

103
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,400
Which of the following
conclusions does

104
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,550
not have to be true?

105
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,480
Does not have to be true.

106
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,430
Not.

107
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,640
Angles 3 and 4 are supplementary
angles.

108
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,890
What does supplementary mean?

109
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,620
That means that angle
3 plus angle 4 have

110
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,740
to be equal to 180.

111
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,660
This is the definition of
a supplementary angle.

112
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,000
   

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,250
Supplementary.

114
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,965
   

115
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:51,320
So angles 3 and 4, they're
actually opposite angles.

116
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,150
And you can play with these.

117
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,195
If you had these two lines and
you kind of changed the angle

118
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,870
at which they instersect, you
would see that angles 3 and 4

119
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,680
are actually going to
be congruent angles.

120
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,880
They're always going
to be equal to

121
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,930
each other in measure.

122
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,610
So they are equal
to each other.

123
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,620
And if angle 4 is, we don't
know what it is.

124
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,450
If angle 4 is 95 degrees,
then angle 3 is also

125
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,270
going to be 95 degrees.

126
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,790
If angle 4 is 30 degrees,
angle 3 is also

127
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,120
going to be 30 degrees.

128
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,890
So I can think of a bunch of
cases where this will not be

129
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,260
equal to 180.

130
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,820
The only way that this would be
equal to 180, angle 3 plus

131
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,470
angle 4, is if angle 4 were a
90 degree angle, and angle 3

132
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,570
were also a 90 degree angle.

133
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,020
But they don't tell us that.

134
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,240
All they tell us is that angle 4
and angle 1 are the same, at

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,020
least when you measure
the angles.

136
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,710
So I would already
go with choice A.

137
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,000
That does not have to be true.

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,050
That'll only be true
if both of those

139
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,000
angles were 90 degrees.

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,790
Let's see, line L is
parallel to line M.

141
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,700
That's true.

142
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,160
If that angle is equal to this
angle, the best way to think

143
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,490
about it is, this angle is also
equal to, and you could

144
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,910
watch the videos on the
angle game that I do.

145
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,620
We do this quite a bit.

146
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,850
But opposite angles are equal.

147
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,710
And that should be intuitive
to you at this point.

148
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,380
Because you can imagine that if
these two lines, if I were

149
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,620
to change the angle at which
they cross, no matter what

150
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,670
angle I do it at, that's
always going

151
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,970
to be equal to this.

152
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,640
So angle 1 is going to
congruent to angle 2.

153
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,970
And if these two lines are
parallel, if L and M are

154
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,970
parallel, then 2 and 4 are
going to be the same.

155
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,770
Or you can think of
it the other way.

156
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,080
If 4 and 1 are the same, and 1
is the same as 2, then that

157
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,330
means 4 is the same as 2.

158
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,020
And if 4 and 2 are the same,
then that means that these two

159
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,350
lines are parallel.

160
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,080
   

161
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,540
So this is definitely true.

162
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,400
Angle 1 is congruent
to angle 3.

163
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,170
Once again, if angle 1 is
congruent to angle 4, so those

164
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,220
two are congruent, and angle
3 is congruent to angle 4,

165
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,880
because they're opposite
angles.

166
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,780
Or instead of saying congruent,
I could say equal.

167
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,080
If this is equal to this, and
this is equal to this, then

168
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,120
this is equal to that.

169
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,350
All right.

170
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,420
And then, the last one,
2 is congruent to 3.

171
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,070
2 is congruent to 3.

172
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:21,070
Well, by the same logic, if 1 is
congruent to 4, and since 1

173
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,440
and 2 are opposite, it's
also the same as 2.

174
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,470
And 4, because it's opposite of
3, it's congruent to that,

175
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,180
all these angles have to
be the same thing.

176
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,640
So 2 and 3 would also
be congruent angles.

177
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,170
So all of the other ones must
be true, B, C and D.

178
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,635
So A is definitely our choice.

179
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:40,280
   

180
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,530
Next problem.

181
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,916
   

182
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:48,630
Let me copy and paste it.

183
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,880
OK.

184
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,010
   

185
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,200
Consider the arguments below.

186
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,310
Every multiple of 4 is even,
376 is a multiple of 4.

187
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,800
Therefore, 376 is even.

188
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,030
Fair enough.

189
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,990
A number can be written
as a repeating

190
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,060
decimal if it is rational.

191
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,730
Pi cannot be written as
a repeating decimal.

192
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,120
Therefore, pi is not rational.

193
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,920
Which ones, if any, use
deductive reasoning?

194
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,300
OK, so statement one, every
multiple of 4 is even.

195
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,250
376 is a multiple of 4.

196
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,270
So this is deductive
reasoning.

197
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,680
Because you know that every
multiple of 4 is even.

198
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,059
So you pick any multiple of
4, it's going to be even.

199
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,530
376 is a multiple of 4.

200
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,530
Therefore, it has to be even.

201
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,250
So this is correct logic.

202
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,620
So statement one is definitely
deductive reasoning.

203
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,590
Let's see, statement
number two.

204
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,429
A number can be written
as a repeating

205
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,800
decimal if it is rational.

206
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:54,000
So if you're rational, that
means that you can write it as

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,250
a repeating decimal.

208
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,600
   

209
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,330
That's like 0.33333.

210
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,650
That's 1/3.

211
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,175
That's all they mean by
a repeating decimal.

212
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,960
   

213
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,010
But notice, this statement right
here, a number can be

214
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,510
written as a repeating decimal
if it is rational.

215
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:17,050
That doesn't say that a
repeating decimal means that

216
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,610
it's rational.

217
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,720
It just means that a rational
number can be written as a

218
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,740
repeating decimal.

219
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,390
This statement doesn't let
us go the other way.

220
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,330
It doesn't say that a repeating
decimal can

221
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,500
definitely be written as
a rational number.

222
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,840
It just says that if it is
rational, a number can be

223
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,330
written as a repeating
decimal.

224
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,510
Fair enough.

225
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,110
And then it says pi
cannot be written

226
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,000
as a repeating decimal.

227
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,590
Pi cannot be written as
a repeating decimal.

228
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,890
So if pi cannot be written
as a repeating

229
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,180
decimal, pi be rational?

230
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,450
Well if pi was rational, if pi
was in this set, if pi were

231
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,730
rational, then you could write
it as a repeating decimal.

232
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,954
But it said that you
cannot write it

233
00:09:57,954 --> 00:09:58,840
as a repeating decimal.

234
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,460
So therefore, pi cannot
be rational.

235
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,520
Cannot be in the set
of rationals.

236
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,760
So therefore this is also sound
deductive reasoning.

237
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,950
So both one and two use
deductive reasoning.

238
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,060
As far as I know.

239
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,710
I'm out of time.

240
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,490
See you in the next video.

241
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:16,900
