1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,010
i've already made a handful
of videos that covers what

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,990
I'm going to cover, the
trigonometric identities I'm

4
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,480
going to cover in this video.

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,330
The reason why I'm doing it is
that I'm in need of review

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,220
myself because I was doing some
calculus problems that required

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,150
me to know this, and I have
better recording software now

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,550
so I thought two birds with one
stone, let me rerecord a

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,290
video and kind of refresh
things in my own mind.

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,080
So the trig identities that I'm
going to assume that we know

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,730
because I've already made
videos on them and they're a

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,060
little bit involved to remember
or to prove, are that the sine

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:38,980
of a plus b is equal to the
sine of a times the cosine

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:47,750
of b plus the sine of b
times the cosine of a.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,670
That's the first one, I assume,
going into this video we know.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,310
And then if we wanted to know
the sine of-- well, I'll just

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,270
write it a little differently.

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,010
What if I wanted to figure out
the sine of a plus-- I'll

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,010
write it this way-- minus c?

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,990
Which is the same thing
as a minus c, right?

21
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,590
Well, we could just use this
formula up here to say well,

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:15,730
that's equal to the sine of a
times the cosine of minus c

23
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:24,020
plus the sine of minus c
times the cosine of a.

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,480
And we know, and I guess this
is another assumption that

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,580
we're going to have to have
going into this video, that the

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:35,410
cosine of minus c is equal
to just the cosine of c.

27
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,690
That the cosine is
an even function.

28
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,620
And you could look at that by
looking at the graph of the

29
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,420
cosine function, or even at
the unit circle itself.

30
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,240
And that the sine is
an odd function.

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,770
That the sine of minus
c is actually equal

32
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,010
to minus sine of c.

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,860
So we can use both of that
information to rewrite the

34
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,710
second line up here to say that
the sine of a minus c is equal

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,450
to the sine of a times
the cosine of c.

36
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,570
Because cosine of minus
c is the same thing

37
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,320
as the cosine of c.

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,650
Times the cosine of c.

39
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,510
And then, minus the sine of c.

40
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,710
Instead of writing this,
I could write this.

41
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,220
Minus the sine of c
times the cosine of a.

42
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,080
So that we kind of pseudo
proved this by knowing this

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,590
and this ahead of time.

44
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,190
Fair enough.

45
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,920
And I'm going to use all of
these to kind of prove a bunch

46
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,110
of more trig identities
that I'm going to need.

47
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,280
So the other trig identity is
that the cosine of a plus b is

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,760
equal to the cosine of a-- you
don't mix up the cosines and

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,520
the sines in this situation.

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,595
Cosine of a times
the sine of b.

51
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:51,180
And this is minus--
well, sorry.

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,720
I just said you don't mix it
up and then I mixed them up.

53
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:03,010
Times the cosine of b minus
sine of a times the sine of b.

54
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,140
Now, if you wanted to know what
the cosine of a minus b is,

55
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,890
well, you use these
same properties.

56
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,760
Cosine of minus b, that's still
going to be cosine on b.

57
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,960
So that's going to be the
cosine of a times the cosine--

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,530
cosine of minus b is the
same thing as cosine of b.

59
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,760
But here you're going to have
sine of minus b, which is the

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,600
same thing as the
minus sine of b.

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,060
And that minus will cancel that
out, so it'll be plus sine

62
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,070
of a times the sine of b.

63
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,880
So it's a little tricky.

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,610
When you have a plus sign
here you get a minus there.

65
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,410
When you don't minus
sign there, you get

66
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,570
a plus sign there.

67
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,520
But fair enough.

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,230
I don't want to dwell on that
too much because we have many

69
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,750
more identities to show.

70
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,340
So what if I wanted an
identity for let's

71
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,440
say, the cosine of 2a?

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,760
So the cosine of 2a.

73
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,500
Well that's just the same thing
as the cosine of a plus a.

74
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,480
And then we could use this
formula right up here.

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,050
If my second a is just my b,
then this is just equal to

76
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:14,030
cosine of a times the cosine
of a minus the sine of

77
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,320
a times the sine of a.

78
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,560
My b is also an a in this
situation, which I could

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,570
rewrite as, this is equal to
the cosine squared of a.

80
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,960
I just wrote cosine of a times
itself twice or times itself.

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,740
Minus sine squared of a.

82
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,910
This is one I guess
identity already.

83
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,630
Cosine of 2a is equal to the
cosine squared of a minus

84
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,240
the sine squared of a.

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,140
Let me box off my identities
that we're showing

86
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,410
in this video.

87
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,780
So I just showed you that one.

88
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,050
What if I'm not satisfied?

89
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,700
What if I just want it
in terms of cosines?

90
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,820
Well, we could break out
the unit circle definition

91
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,450
of our trig functions.

92
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,740
This is kind of the most
fundamental identity.

93
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,190
The sine squared of a
plus the cosine squared

94
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,700
of a is equal to 1.

95
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,010
Or you could write that--
let me think of the

96
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,410
best way to do this.

97
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,590
You could write that the sine
squared of a is equal to

98
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,670
1 minus the cosine
sign squared of a.

99
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,330
And then we could take this
and substitute it right here.

100
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,110
So we could rewrite this
identity as being equal to the

101
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,610
cosine squared of a minus
the sine squared of a.

102
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,060
But the sine squared of
a is this right there.

103
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,690
So minus-- I'll do it
in a different color.

104
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,310
Minus 1 minus cosine
squared of a.

105
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,260
That's what I just substituted
for the sine squared of a.

106
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,050
And so this is equal to the
cosine squared of a minus 1

107
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,890
plus the cosine squared of a.

108
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,270
Which is equal to--
we're just adding.

109
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,030
I'll just continue
on the right.

110
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,400
We have 1 cosine squared of a
plus another cosine squared

111
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,780
of a, so it's 2 cosine
squared of a minus 1.

112
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,610
And all of that is
equal to cosine of 2a.

113
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,520
   

114
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,330
Now what if I wanted to get
an identity that gave me

115
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,710
what cosine squared of
a is in terms of this?

116
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,320
Well we could just
solve for that.

117
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,930
If we add 1 to both sides of
this equation, actually,

118
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,510
let me write this.

119
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,460
This is one of our
other identities.

120
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:28,430
But if we add 1 to both sides
of that equation we get 2 times

121
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:36,750
the cosine squared of a is
equal to cosine of 2a plus 1.

122
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,620
And if we divide both sides of
this by 2 we get the cosine

123
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,290
squared of a is equal to 1/2--
now we could rearrange these

124
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:54,660
just to do it-- times 1
plus the cosine of 2a.

125
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,810
And we're done.

126
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,640
And we have another identity.

127
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,830
Cosine squared of a, sometimes
it's called the power reduction

128
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,380
identity right there.

129
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,440
Now what if we wanted
something in terms of

130
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,200
the sine squared of a?

131
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,170
Well then maybe we could go
back up here and we know from

132
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,300
this identity that the sine
squared of a is equal to 1

133
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,750
minus cosine squared of a.

134
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,930
Or we could have
gone the other way.

135
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,910
We could have subtracted sine
squared of a from both sides

136
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,000
and we could have gotten--
let me go down there.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,570
If I subtracted sine squared of
a from both sides you could get

138
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:34,050
cosine squared of a is equal
to 1 minus sine squared of a.

139
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,980
And then we could go back into
this formula right up here and

140
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,490
we could write down-- and I'll
do it in this blue color.

141
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:48,480
We could write down that the
cosine of 2a is equal to--

142
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,750
instead of writing a cosine
squared of a, I'll write this-

143
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,780
is equal to 1 minus sine
squared of a minus

144
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,795
sine squared of a.

145
00:07:56,795 --> 00:08:00,660
   

146
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,245
So my cosine of 2a is equal to?

147
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:05,910
Let's see.

148
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,650
I have a minus sine squared
of a minus another

149
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,420
sine squared of a.

150
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,600
So I have 1 minus 2
sine squared of a.

151
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,480
So here's another identity.

152
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,190
Another way to write
my cosine of 2a.

153
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,740
We're discovering a lot of ways
to write our cosine of 2a.

154
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,840
Now if we wanted to solve for
sine squared of 2a we could

155
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,610
add it to both sides
of the equation.

156
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,950
So let me do that and I'll
just write it here for

157
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,554
the sake of saving space.

158
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,230
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

159
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,210
So I'm going to go here.

160
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,520
If I just add 2 sine squared
of a to both sides of this, I

161
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:51,480
get 2 sine squared of a plus
cosine of 2a is equal to 1.

162
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,690
Subtract cosine of
2a from both sides.

163
00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:01,010
You get 2 sine squared of a is
equal to 1 minus cosine of 2a.

164
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,420
Then you divide both sides of
this by 2 and you get sine

165
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:12,280
squared of a is equal to 1/2
times 1 minus cosine of 2a.

166
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,250
And we have our other discovery
I guess we could call it.

167
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,600
Our finding.

168
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,520
And it's interesting.

169
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,050
It's always interesting
to look at the symmetry.

170
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,000
Cosine squared-- they're
identical except for you have a

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,720
plus 2a here for the cosine
squared and you have a minus

172
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,600
cosine of 2a here for
the sine squared.

173
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,440
So we've already found a
lot of interesting things.

174
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,080
Let's see if we can do
anything with the sine of 2a.

175
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,120
   

176
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,980
Let me pick a new color
here that I haven't used.

177
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,880
Well, I've pretty much
used all my colors.

178
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,120
So if I want to figure out the
sine of 2a, this is equal

179
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,380
to the sine of a plus a.

180
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:03,610
Which is equal to the sine of a
times the co-- well, I don't

181
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,640
want to make it that thick.

182
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,150
Times the cosine of a plus--
and this cosine of a,

183
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,100
that's the second a.

184
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,020
Actually, you could
view it that way.

185
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,570
Plus the sine-- I'm just
using the sine of a plus b.

186
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,000
Plus the sine of the
second a times the

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,870
cosine of the first a.

188
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,030
I just wrote the same thing
twice, so this is just people

189
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,370
to 2 sine of a, cosine of a.

190
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,490
That was a little bit easier.

191
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,030
So sine of 2a is equal to that.

192
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,140
So that's another result.

193
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,920
   

194
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,160
I know I'm a little bit tired
by playing with all of

195
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,640
these sine and cosines.

196
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,990
And I was able to get all the
results that I needed for my

197
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,580
calculus problem, so hopefully
this was a good review for

198
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,220
you because it was a
good review for me.

199
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,360
You can write these
things down.

200
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,840
You can memorize them if you
want, but the really important

201
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,350
take away is to realize that
you really can derive all of

202
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,590
these formulas really from
these initial formulas

203
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,250
that we just had.

204
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,910
And even these, I also have
proofs to show you how to get

205
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,100
these from just the basic
definitions of your

206
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,700
trig functions.
