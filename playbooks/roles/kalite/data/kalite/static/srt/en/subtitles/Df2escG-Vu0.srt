1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,803
So let's think about how

2
00:00:01,803 --> 00:00:03,809
we could find the slope of the tangent line

3
00:00:03,809 --> 00:00:07,024
to this curve right over here, so what I've drawn in red-

4
00:00:07,024 --> 00:00:11,801
at the point x=a. We've already seen this with the definition of the derivative.

5
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:16,073
We can try to find a general function that gives us the slope of the tangent line at any point

6
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:22,439
So let's see we have some arbitrary point - let's define some arbitrary point x right over here

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:31,468
then this would be the point (x,f(x)) and then we could take some x+h - so let's say that this right over here

8
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:36,601
is the point x+h, so this point

9
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:44,437
would be (x+h,f(x+h)), we can find the slope of

10
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:47,607
the secant line, that goes between these two points,

11
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:50,076
so that would be your change in your vertical,

12
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:54,637
which would be f(x+h), f of x plus h,

13
00:00:54,637 --> 00:01:03,111
minus f(x), minus f(x), over the change in the horizontal,

14
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:09,397
which would be x+h minus x, minus x;

15
00:01:09,397 --> 00:01:15,202
and these two x's cancel, so this would be the slope of this secant line,

16
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:20,072
and if we wanna find the slope of the tangent line at x - the slope of the tangent line at x-

17
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:24,008
we would just take the limit - the limit of this expression -

18
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:32,067
as h approaches 0, as h approaches 0, this point moves toward x, and that slope of the

19
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:35,898
secant line between these two is going to approximate the slope of the tangent at x

20
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:44,028
And so this right over here - this we would say is equal to f'(x) [f-prime of x]

21
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:50,537
This is still - this is a function of x! You give me an arbitrary x, where the derivative is defined,

22
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:55,733
I'm gonna plug it into this, whatever this ends up being, it might be some clean algebraic expression,

23
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:59,204
and then I'm gonna give you a number. So, for example, if you wanted to find

24
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:05,334
you, you could calculate this somehow or you could even leave it in this form, and then if you wanted f'(a)

25
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:10,702
[f-prime of a], you would just substitute a into your function definition,

26
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:15,870
and you would say, well that's going to be the limit as h approaches 0

27
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,536
of every place you see an x or every place you see an a. I'll stay in this colour for now...

28
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:33,069
Blank plus h minus, minus - minus f of blank, minus f of blank - all of that over

29
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:41,340
all of that over h. And I left those blank so I could write the a - I could write the a in red.

30
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,343
Notice every place where I had an x before, it's now an a.

31
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:52,069
So this is the derivative evaluated at a. So this is one way to find the slope of the tangent line when x=a.

32
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:58,800
Another way - this often viewed as the alternate form of the derivative - would be to do it directly.

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:07,340
So this is the point (a,f(a)), let's just take another arbitrary point [unintelligible] someplace -

34
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,588
so let's say this is the value x - this point right over here on the function would be (x,f(x)) -

35
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:20,876
So what's the slope of the secant line between these two points? It would be the change in the vertical,

36
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:29,200
which would be f(x) minus f(a) - minus f(a)- over a change in the horizontal.

37
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,422
Over x-a. So let me do that in a purple colour - over x minus a.

38
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:42,870
Now, how could we get a better approximation of the slope of the tangent line here?

39
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,085
Well, we could take the limit as x approaches a, as x gets closer and closer and closer to a,

40
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:54,000
the secant line slope is going to better and better and better approximate the slope of the tangent line.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,252
This tangent line that I have in red here. So we would wanna take the limit

42
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:06,276
the limit - as, as x approaches a here. Either way, we're doing a very similar -

43
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:10,475
we're doing the exact same thing - we're finding the - we're taking the s- we're, we're having an expression

44
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:16,866
for the slope of a secant line, and then we're bringing those x values of those points closer and closer together,

45
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:21,808
closer and closer together, so the slopes of those secant lines better and better and better

46
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:24,753
approximate that slope of the tangent line.

47
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:29,936
And at the limit, it does become the slope of the tangent line, that is the derivative of - that is the definition of

48
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:36,067
so this is the cl- the more kind of standard definition of the derivative, if would give you your derivative as a function

49
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:41,200
of x, and then you can then input your x if you wan- your, your uh - the particular value of x, or you can

50
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,869
use the alternate form of the derivative - if you know that hey, look, I'm just looking to find the derivative exactly at a,

51
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:51,869
I don't need a general function of f, then you could do this. But they're doing the same thing.
