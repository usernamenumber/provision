00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,182
I got this problem here form the 2003 AIME Exam, that state to American Invitational Mathematics Exam, and this is actually the first problem of the exam.

2
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:19,455
The product N of three positive integers is 6 times their sum, and one of the integers is the sum of the other two.

3
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:23,560
Find the sum of all possible values of N.

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,798
So we have to deal with three positive integers.

5
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:30,698
So we have three positive integers write over here.

6
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:36,011
So we just think about three positive integers, just call them a,b, and c.

7
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:37,649
They are positive and they are integers.

8
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,989
The product N of these three positive integers.

9
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:47,840
So a times b times c is equal to N, is 6 times their sum.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,457
This is equal to 6 times their sum.

11
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:52,479
Let me just use another color.

12
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,394
So this is their product.

13
00:00:54,394 --> 00:01:02,099
So the product N of three positive integers is 6 times their sum.

14
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:05,799
So this is equal to 6 times their sum of those integers.

15
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:13,004
a plus b plus c, and the one of the integers is the sum of the other two.

16
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:19,379
One of the integers is the sum of other two.

17
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,533
Let we just pick c to be the sum of a and b.

18
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,387
It does not matter. This is just a name.

19
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:28,217
We have to set one of them is larger or less than the other one.

20
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:34,877
So we just set that a plus b is equal to c. The one of integers is the sum of other integers.

21
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:41,781
c is the sum of a plus b. Find the sum of all possible values of N.

22
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:46,773
We just try to little bit of liquidation of the information that we have here.

23
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:53,614
Maybe we can get some relationship or some constrains on the numbers that we can kind of go through the possibilities.

24
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,677
We know the a plus b is equal to c.

25
00:01:56,677 --> 00:02:02,292
So we can replace c, replace c everywhere with a plus b.

26
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:08,680
So this expression write over here becomes ab which is a times b times c.

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,964
But instead of c, I am gonna to write a plus b over here. a+b.

28
00:02:14,964 --> 00:02:24,691
And then that is equal to 6 times a plus b plus c.

29
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,410
And so, once again.

30
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,068
I will replace c with a plus b.

31
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,451
And then what does this simplify to.

32
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:37,689
So on the right hand side, we have 6 times a plus b plus b plus a plus b.

33
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:45,285
This is the same thing 6 times 2a plus 2b, just add the as and bs.

34
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:49,044
And we can factor 2. This the same thing as if you take out the 2.

35
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:53,313
6 times 2 is 12 times a plus b.

36
00:02:53,313 --> 00:03:01,466
The left hand side, write over here, is still a times b or ab times a plus b.

37
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:07,445
So ab times a plus b is gotten to be equal to 12 times a plus b.

38
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:09,630
So this is pretty interesting here.

39
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,415
We can divide both sides by a plus b.

40
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:16,539
We know the a plus b won't be equal to, can not be equal to 0.

41
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:19,077
So all of these numbers have to be positive numbers.

42
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:23,402
So we divide both sides and the reason why I say that is if it was 0.

43
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:27,435
Dividing by 0, it will give a undefined answer.

44
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:33,614
So we divide both sides by a plus b, we get a times b is equal to 12.

45
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:38,356
So all the constrains that they give us boil off these down to this write over here.

46
00:03:38,356 --> 00:03:41,589
The product of a and b is equal to 12.
