00:00:01,206 --> 00:00:06,557
On a string instrument, the length of a string "l"

2
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:12,773
varies inversely as the frequency.

3
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:36,023
So, l = k*1/f.

4
00:00:36,023 --> 00:01:00,189
An 11-inch string has a frequency of 400 cycles per second

5
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:06,106
So, f = 400 cycles / second

6
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:08,556
Find the constant of proportionality and

7
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:15,240
then find the frequency of a 10 inch string

8
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:35,672
So 11 = k *1/400. So to solve for the constant of proportionality

9
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:46,156
we will mutiply both sides by 400 cycles / second

10
00:01:46,156 --> 00:02:23,340
so the left hand side becomes 400 * 11 = 4400 cycles*inches/second

11
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,589
4400 cycles*inches/second = k

12
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:54,357
We can say the length = 4400cycles*inches/second * 1/f

13
00:02:54,357 --> 00:03:01,423
Now we are taking of a situation where l= 10 inches

14
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:24,590
10 inches = 4400 cycles*inches/second * 1/f

15
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:37,940
We could mutiply both sides by "f" & we can also divide

16
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:54,721
both sides by 10 inches.

17
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,456
Left hand side we are left with "f" = frequency

18
00:03:56,456 --> 00:04:23,123
Right hand side we have 4400/10 = 440cycles/second

19
00:04:23,123 --> 00:04:27,940
So when our string is 10 inches long

20
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,272
our frequency has increased to 440 cycles/second

21
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:32,706
So when our string was 11 inches long f= 400cycles/second

22
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:38,356
when our string is shorter at 10 inches our

23
00:04:38,356 --> 99:59:59,999
f has increased to 440 cycles/second
