1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:03,685
so I want to talk to you a little bit about {atherosclerosis},

2
00:00:03,685 --> 00:00:07,495
and I have already cheated a little bit, and I started drawing,

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:11,650
I already make a slightly nice drawing, because I want to make sure that

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,730
the important thing is we can actually see them, and that is --it's pretty clear.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,178
So, in the top left, I have a small vessel,

6
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:22,623
and it have the three layers, and in the middle is the lumen,

7
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,840
and on the outside is the --the outside.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,931
So, this little white box I've drawn, I've tried to blow it up for you a little bit here,

9
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:34,002
so again, over on this side we have the lumen, just to orient you again,

10
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,312
and this is the outside of a blood vessel.

11
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:41,600
So, we know that a blood vessel have three layers and this particular blood vessel is--

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,344
actually, let me lable it, is a middle or large arteries.

13
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:51,770
so I'm specifically talking about {large and middle size arteries} here.

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:57,844
And the reasons that this makes the differece, I'll point out specifically again,

15
00:00:57,844 --> 00:01:05,646
but there're these green little coils I've drawn here, these little green squigglies,

16
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:09,890
and this is a little protein called the {elastin},

17
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,380
and I specifically want to talk about these arteries, because

18
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,768
these large and middle arteries that have --in them, in the walls-- elastin,

19
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:22,417
are very very susceptible to atherosclerosis, this process.

20
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:26,644
And so, I've thought that it makes sense to point out just for you to know exactly

21
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:29,921
which vessels are being affected by this process.

22
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:36,248
So let's go through and --quckly refresh ourselves, and talk about three layers of the vessel,

23
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:38,831
we have the intima, the {tunica intima}.

24
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:40,656
And I was writing 'T' for tunica.

25
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:43,213
And then --that's the innermost layer.

26
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:48,177
The middle layer right here, in red, is the {tunica media},

27
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:52,576
and remember that, because it's the middle layer, so media, middle.

28
00:01:52,576 --> 00:02:00,080
And on the outside right here is the {tunica externa}. Externa, kind of the external layer.

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,842
And sometimes you see that as {adventitia}, another word for it.

30
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:05,746
So these are the three layers, we know this.

31
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:12,178
And the way that atherosclerosis happens, now this is a process in --it's a,

32
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:15,343
it's a process that affects millions and millions of people.

33
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:22,177
The way this happens is that it usually affects these large vessels --large or middle arteries,

34
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:25,643
and actually these vessels just --to give you a little bit an orientation,

35
00:02:25,643 --> 00:02:31,814
I'm talking about 1 mm size of vessels all the way about 25 mm in diameter.

36
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:36,057
So kind of a --kind of biggest vessels, that you could actually see with your naked eye,

37
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:40,878
this could be like the artery, that maybe-- maybe the aorta, the largest artery,

38
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,776
or could be an artery that goes up to my arm, the brachial artery.

39
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:48,140
So in here these large or middle size arteries fit in this category,

40
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,944
and they're affected by atherosclerosis.

41
00:02:49,944 --> 00:02:53,486
So the first step in atherosclerosis, let's just jump and do it,

42
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:58,176
it's that you have an irritant, some irritant.

43
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:05,640
And that could be --I'm not talking about, maybe someone's annoying little brother or sister, annoying neighbour,

44
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,876
but some irritant like, let's say you have --here I'll draw in red-- a toxin from cigarrette smoke.

45
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:19,138
So let say you've got some toxin that's swimming through your blood vessels, and that could be an irritant.

46
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:23,877
Another irritant could be --so I'll put smoking up here for that--

47
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:29,552
another irritant could be, maybe having too much lipids, so maybe hyperlipidemia.

48
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:31,412
Hyperlipidemia.

49
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:37,546
And when I say lipid, I mean specifically fats and cholesterols.

50
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:44,022
So, you could have little droplets --it's showed a little yellow droplets, 'cuz I think yellow as fat,

51
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:50,265
of LDL, this is a protein. LDL stands for --actually I'll write that out--

52
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:55,203
Low Density --that's what the L dan D are--

53
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:57,270
Low Density Lipoprotein.

54
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,579
So this is basically something that carries fat and cholesterol around your blood.

55
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,598
So you could have too much of it. You could have too much LDL in your blood,

56
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:10,739
in the blood vessels, in the arteries.

57
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,776
And that could be an irritant.

58
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:18,013
Or it could be --maybe I'll use a dark-- maybe a white colour here,

59
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:19,686
maybe could be high blood pressure,

60
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:24,759
high blood pressure pushing out on these vessels, could be an irritant.

61
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:32,307
So any of these things could be an irritant, hyperlipidemia, smoking, or hypertension or high blood pressure.

62
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:34,146
Could be an irritant.

63
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:36,520
And what is being irritated?

64
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,507
What is the thing that is being irritated?

65
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:40,052
That's number two.

66
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:46,451
It's the layer of cells right here, these inner layer cells in the tunica intima.

67
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:54,841
and that layer itself we know as the endothelial layer. {endothelial cells}

68
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:59,459
So that's the layer that's being offended somehow, so it's being upset or angry.

69
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:05,341
It's getting upset at these irritants, so I'm going to show some unhappy faces here,

70
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:08,384
maybe some unhappy faces down here from the LDL,

71
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:11,673
maybe some unhappiness from that high blood pressure.

72
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:17,100
And right behind it, --just to orient you-- is the basement membrane,

73
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,820
but really again it's the endothelial cells that're being irritated.

74
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:29,692
Right, so that would be step two, is endothelial --actually leaving the same colour--

75
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:36,079
{endothelial disfunction}. This stop working the way they like to work,

76
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,681
in all, try to be a little bit more specific,

77
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:43,234
endothelial cells are basically a barrier, right?

78
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:49,282
they're creating a barrier between what is flowing through the blood and the wall itself,

79
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:55,421
right, they're the first thing that molecules and cells in the blood are gonna see.

80
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:59,510
And so, if you have endothelial disfunction, what you get is

81
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,046
that this barrier starts breaking down.

82
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:07,457
And so this barrier --let me erase some of this stuffs now, just to make some space,

83
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:11,316
we know that LDL is Low Density Lipoprotein, I'll erase that.

84
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:15,370
And I'll erase this white areas for the hypertension.

85
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,420
And I'll even erase that ciggarette smoke, the toxin.

86
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,066
and I'll leave the LDL for a second, you'll see why.

87
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:24,941
But please let me show you that these cells start getting unhappy,

88
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:31,053
and they start breaking down, and --I guess I'll erase a lot of it and I'll draw some of it back.

89
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:36,099
And what you get is something like this.

90
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:41,555
We've --We have, now, a breach. A breach.

91
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:47,436
So you have these cells here, but now they're letting stuff through.

92
00:06:47,436 --> 00:06:54,180
And the stuff they get through, primarily --and this is of importance to us, is the LDL.

93
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,089
So even if something else was the irritant,

94
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:00,178
let's say cigarrete smoke was the major irritant here,

95
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:02,920
and you got endothelial disfunction from that,

96
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:11,643
the next step in atherosclerosis, step three, is LDL goes into --I'll just write--

97
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:15,287
into T. or tunica intima.

98
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:20,637
This is kind of the next major step, is that LDL decides that it wants to go inside,

99
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:23,886
it likes to be inside of this layer.

100
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:32,711
And so you got LDL hanging out over here --I'll just write LDL here, so you'll know what we're talking about.

101
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:39,970
So all this little molecule of LDL, which again, you bring with them a lot of fat and cholesterol,

102
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:45,952
and they're all now in this tunica intima layer.

103
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:50,948
So they're all within this tunica intima layer --let me try make that very clear,

104
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:53,800
all within this layer tunica intima.

105
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,945
So they're not usually there. And that's step three.

106
00:07:56,945 --> 00:08:00,134
Now step four, really really interesting,

107
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:01,853
this is where things get really kind of wild,

108
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:09,777
is you have cells in your immune system that are right here, called {macrophages}

109
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,738
Macrophages.

110
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,913
and these macrophages, they have huge mouth,

111
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,777
and they're --actually macrophages really means 'big eater'.

112
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:24,712
So, macro-big, and 'phage' meaning to eat.

113
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:30,075
Macrophages actually swim through the blood, and they're patroling the blood,

114
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,213
almost like police officers,

115
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:36,177
and they sense that, "hey, something is not right with this wall, there's LDL in there"

116
00:08:36,177 --> 00:08:39,575
and they go in pursuit --they go after that LDL.

117
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:42,021
And now they go into the wall.

118
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,046
So now you got LDL on the wall, you got macrophages on the wall,

119
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:49,534
and so I'm gonna draw these macrophages, it's not to scale, just again they're bigger than this.

120
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:54,640
But they're now in the wall, they're hanging out in this area, right.

121
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,654
And they start devouring, again they're big eaters.

122
00:08:57,654 --> 00:09:01,289
So they start devouring, gobbling up all that fat.

123
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:06,441
So this is gonna get a little bit tricky, but let me try to sketch it out again up here for you.

124
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:12,087
These're gobbling up fat, and they get loaded with this little fat,

125
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:14,426
these little particles of LDL.

126
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:19,455
So this is now LDL that's inside of the macrophages, right?

127
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:23,175
and if you look through microscope, what this may look like?

128
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:28,039
is --you have to use your imaginaton here, but is seafoam.

129
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,778
So if you actually look --go out to the sea, you know, let's say you go to Mediteranean Sea.

130
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:37,376
And you look at seafoam, that's actually what it would look like, potentially.

131
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,845
That 's someone's thought anyway.

132
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:43,173
And so they called these cells, these macrophages that've gobbled up LDL,

133
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:46,638
and actually died, so these cells has now died.

134
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:48,761
I'll draw a little Xs, because it is so much have died.

135
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:53,126
These cells they called them {foam cells}.

136
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:57,237
Foam cells. I'll just write a little arrow here,

137
00:09:57,237 --> 00:10:00,770
so you know which one I'm talking about. Foam cells.

138
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,075
So if you look in the tunica intima again, that's for all the action is, right?

139
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:09,812
this is --this is the important part here --I'll draw box around it.

140
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:12,454
That's kind of the central stage.

141
00:10:12,454 --> 00:10:17,923
The LDL, the macrophages that chase down, now the dead foam cells,

142
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:22,005
are all sitting in here, in this lake of fat.

143
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:27,297
So now you got macrophages in step four --let me just make sure I catch up with our picture.

144
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:32,570
Macrophages and plus foam cells.

145
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,183
foam cells.

146
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:39,208
into tunica intima, right.

147
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,434
So now we're on the same page.

148
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:47,662
And this --this intima now, really, starts looking a lot like this.

149
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:50,155
Let me erase this, clean this up a little bit,

150
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:54,334
because it's getting quite a mess here, then you'd --you'd agree it needs a little cleaning up.

151
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:56,717
So let me erase all this stuff on the outside.

152
00:10:56,717 --> 00:11:02,154
We know that LDL was in the blood, but it went into the intima, we know that.

153
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:09,960
So --so now you have, basically, this LDL, all of these molecules (...) is start merging,

154
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,519
into literally a lake. Think about it like a lake of fat.

155
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:23,680
and how disgusing about is that, right? Like a lake of lard, here, or fat, here.

156
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,828
It's your fat, or this person's fat.

157
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:35,150
And it's all, in this layer, called the tunica intima.

158
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,443
In fact, let me even draw another dead macrophage.

159
00:11:39,443 --> 00:11:42,237
It's another foam cell, I'm making a foam cell out of this.

160
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:44,586
Looks like seafoam, maybe.

161
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:47,524
And so you have here a lake of LDL.

162
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:53,526
You have foam cells, and it's all sitting in the tunica intima.

163
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:57,859
And if you're actually to, let's say you're to fillet this cell open,

164
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:01,120
or this blood vessel open --let me to try to show what I mean.

165
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,164
If you're --let's say you have this blood vessel.

166
00:12:03,164 --> 00:12:06,285
I'm drawing you very simply now, you know that that there're three layers,

167
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:07,705
it's not the one that I'm drawing there,

168
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:11,428
but let's imagine that you took a knife and you slice through it.

169
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:15,261
So now, you basically are looking at kind of just the inside of it.

170
00:12:15,261 --> 00:12:17,727
Right, it's the inside of it.

171
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:25,125
What you would see is basically this giant streak of fat.

172
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:29,055
And this is kind of that lake, that I just showed you, right.

173
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,795
Now, looking at it lengthwise.

174
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:37,717
So this lake of fat is called the {fatty streak}.

175
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:41,325
So if you open up a blood vessel, and look at it,

176
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:46,500
if this process has been going on, you might start seeing fatty streaks.

177
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,478
and so that's basically the first half of atherosclerosis.

178
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,233
So let's pick up there in the next video.

179
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,000
