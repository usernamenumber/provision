1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:03,019
Let's say I have a balloon

2
00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:06,920
and in that balloon i have a bunch of particles bouncing around

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,731
they're gas particles

4
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:11,192
so they're floating freely

5
00:00:11,192 --> 00:00:15,186
and they all have, they each have some velocity

6
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:17,529
some kinetic energy

7
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:20,462
and what I care about

8
00:00:20,462 --> 00:00:23,696
what I care... let me just draw a few more

9
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:27,121
what I care about is the pressure that is exerted

10
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:28,468
on the surface of the balloon

11
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:30,000
so I care about the pressure

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,647
and what's pressure? it's force per area

13
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:36,130
force per area

14
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,917
so the area here, you can think of it as

15
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,067
the inside surface of the balloon

16
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:40,681
and what's going to put force,

17
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:43,421
what's going to apply force to that?

18
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:46,626
at any given moment i only drew what, 6 particles here

19
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:48,390
but in a real balloon you would have

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,759
you know, gazillions of particles, you know

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,592
we could talk about how large, but more particles

22
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:56,471
than you could really, probably imagine

23
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:58,932
but at any given moment some of those particles

24
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:02,183
are bouncing off the wall of the container

25
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:04,273
that particle is bouncing there, this particle

26
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:07,199
is bouncing there, this guy's bouncing like that

27
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:09,567
and when they bounce, they apply a force to the

28
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:12,725
container, an outward force, that's what keeps

29
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,861
the balloon blown up.

30
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:16,933
So let's think about what the pressure

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,391
is going to be dependent on.

32
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:21,409
So first of all the pressure, the faster these

33
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:24,660
particles move, the higher the pressure, right?

34
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,682
Faster particles

35
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:31,812
faster particles would imply pressure would go up

36
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:34,180
right? slower particles you're gonna be bouncing

37
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,666
into the container less

38
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,338
and when you do bounce into the container

39
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:39,474
there is going to be less of a ricochet,

40
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,933
or less of a change in momentum

41
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:43,004
so slower particles

42
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:47,462
you're gonna have pressure go down

43
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:50,806
now it's practically impossible to measure

44
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:53,128
the kinetic energy, or the velocity

45
00:01:53,128 --> 00:01:55,450
or the direction of each individual particle

46
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,121
as especially you have gazillions of them

47
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:58,654
in the balloon

48
00:01:58,654 --> 00:01:59,954
so what we do is we think of

49
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,719
the average energy of the particles

50
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,180
and the average energy of the particles

51
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,991
you might say oh, Sal's about to introduce us

52
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,199
to a new concept

53
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:10,450
well I might, well it's a new of looking at a

54
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,029
probably very familiar concept to you

55
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:13,747
and that's temperature

56
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:17,091
temperature can and should be viewed

57
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:19,923
as the average energy of the particles in the system

58
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:22,385
so i'll put a little squiggly line

59
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:23,867
cause it's, you know, there's a lot of ways to

60
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:25,682
think about.. Average energy

61
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:30,001
or, you know... some, and mostly kinetic energy

62
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:32,044
right? because these particles are moving and bouncing

63
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:33,763
the higher the temperature, the more

64
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:36,595
the faster that these particles move

65
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:38,871
and the more that they're going to

66
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:40,543
bounce into the side of the [sic]particle

67
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:41,982
into the side of this container

68
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:43,794
but temperature is average energy

69
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:50,063
it tells us energy, energy per particle

70
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:54,067
right, if you wanted to know the total, so you know

71
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:57,586
obviously if we only had one particle in there

72
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:59,072
with super high temperature

73
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:01,069
that's going to have less pressure

74
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,323
then if we have a million particles in there

75
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:03,716
let me draw that

76
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:08,592
if i have.. if i have..

77
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:12,261
let's take two cases right here

78
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:15,326
one is: i have a bunch of particles with

79
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:18,000
a certain temperature

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,478
moving in their different directions

81
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:24,521
and in the other example i have one particle

82
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,822
right?

83
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,540
and maybe they have the same temperature

84
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,001
on average they have the same kinetic energy

85
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,416
the kinetic energy per particle is the same

86
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,295
cleary this one is going to be applying

87
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:37,014
more pressure to its container

88
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:38,546
cause at every given moment

89
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:40,079
more of these particles are gonna be bouncing

90
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,868
off the side

91
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:42,447
then in this example, this guy is gonna

92
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:44,398
bounce —bam— and gonna go and move and bounce bam

93
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:46,069
so he's gonna be applying less pressure

94
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,020
even though his temperature might be the same

95
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,017
because temperature is kinetic energy, or you

96
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:53,128
can view it as kinetic energy per particle

97
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:55,543
or it's a way of looking at kinetic energy per particle

98
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:58,097
so if we wanted to look at the total energy

99
00:03:58,097 --> 00:04:00,234
in the system, we would want to

100
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:01,400
multiply the temperature

101
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,388
times the number of particles

102
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:08,593
and just since we are dealing on the molecular scale

103
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:11,008
the number of particles can often be represented

104
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:13,330
as moles, remeber, moles is just the number of particles

105
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,605
so we're saying that pressure

106
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:20,853
pressure, is well I'll say, it's proportional

107
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:24,150
so it's equal to let's say, some constant

108
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,537
let's call that R times

109
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:30,930
(cause we've got to make all the

110
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,673
units work out in the end

111
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:33,020
I mean temperature's in Kelvin

112
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,413
but we eventually want to get back to Joules

113
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:36,921
so let's just say it's equal to some constant

114
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:38,082
or it's proportional to temperature

115
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:41,287
times the number of particles

116
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:43,841
we could do that a bunch of ways

117
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,280
but let's think of that in moles

118
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,649
but if I say they're 5 mole particles there

119
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:51,318
you know that's 5 times 6 times 10 to the 23 particles

120
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:55,439
so this is a number of particles (n)

121
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,030
this is the temperature (T)

122
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,166
and this is just some constant (n)

123
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,928
constant, right there.

124
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,878
now what else is the pressure dependent on?

125
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:06,828
we gave these two examples

126
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:08,175
obviously it's dependent on the Temperature

127
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,126
the faster each of these particles move,

128
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:11,798
the higher pressure it will have

129
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:13,980
it's also dependent on the number of particles

130
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,513
the more particles we have

131
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:16,667
the more pressure we'll have

132
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,717
what about the size of the container?

133
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:20,296
the volume of the container?

134
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:25,730
if we took this example, but we shrunk the container somehow maybe by pressing on the outside

135
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:31,627
so this container looked like this, but we still had the same four particles in it

136
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:36,875
the same four particles with the same average

137
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,522
kinetic energy, with the same temperature

138
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,798
so that number of particles is the same,

139
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:42,912
the temperature's the same

140
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:44,352
but the volume has gone down

141
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:46,535
now these guys are gonna bump into

142
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:49,089
the sides of the container more frequently

143
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,132
and there's less area, right?

144
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:53,454
so at any given moment, you have more force

145
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,151
and less area

146
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,473
so when you have more force and less area

147
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:57,448
the pressure's gonna go up

148
00:05:57,448 --> 00:06:02,323
so when the volume went down

149
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:04,228
your pressure went up

150
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:08,227
so pressure is going to be, is going to be

151
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:09,126
we could say, we could say

152
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:12,773
pressure is inversely proportional to volume

153
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:13,841
so let's think about that

154
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,978
let's put that into our equation

155
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:17,324
we said that pressure

156
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:19,925
sorry, not ressure

157
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:24,151
pressure is proportional, and I'm just saying

158
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,358
some proportionality constant, let's call that R

159
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:32,000
to the number of particles times the temperature

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,133
(this gives us the total energy)

161
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:36,272
and it's inversely proportional to the volume

162
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:38,645
and so if we multiply both sides of this

163
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:39,820
times the Volume

164
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,653
we get the pressure, times the volume is proportional

165
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:48,198
to the number of particles times the temperature

166
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,148
and then you know

167
00:06:49,164 --> 00:06:51,550
so PV is equal to R n t

168
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,012
and just to switch this around a little bit

169
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:55,823
so it's in a form that you are more likely to see

170
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:57,913
in your chemistry book, if we just switch

171
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:59,027
the n and the R term

172
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:02,789
you get P (pressure) times volume is equal to

173
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,064
n (the number of particles you have)

174
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:07,990
times some constant times temperature

175
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,820
and this right here is the ideal gas equation

176
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,281
ideal gas equation

177
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:16,396
and hopefully makes some sense to you

178
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:19,925
ideal gas (not not gass) equation

179
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:24,755
they say ideal gas is based on

180
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:27,866
this little mental exercise I did to come up with this

181
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:30,467
i made some implicit assumptions when I did this

182
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:33,997
one is I assumed, I essentially I assumed that

183
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:35,668
that we are dealing with an ideal gas

184
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:38,594
and so you say, what Sal, what is an ideal gas?

185
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:42,356
an ideal gas, is one where the molecules

186
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:44,492
they're not too concerned with each other

187
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:46,953
they're just concerned with their own kinetic energy

188
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,486
and bouncing off of the walls

189
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:50,715
so they don't attract or repel each other

190
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:56,520
don't attract or repel....

191
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,610
cause let's say they are attracted to each other

192
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,607
then as you increased the number of particles,

193
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:03,207
maybe they'd want to not go to the side

194
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,715
maybe they'd all gravitate towards the center a little bit more

195
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:06,830
if they did attract each other

196
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,148
and if they did that, they would bounce into the walls less and the pressure would be a little bit lower

197
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:13,192
so assuming that they don't attract or repel each other

198
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,536
and we're also assuming that the actual volume

199
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:20,808
of the individual particles are inconsequential

200
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,991
which is a pretty good assumption

201
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:23,780
because they're pretty small

202
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,056
altough if you start putting a ton of particles

203
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:31,257
into a certain volume then at some point,

204
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:32,325
especially if they are big molecules

205
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,740
it will start to matter in terms of their size

206
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,341
but we're assuming that for the purposes of

207
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:40,870
our mental exercise that the molecules have

208
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,867
inconsequential volumes

209
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:45,282
and they don't attract or repel each other

210
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:49,601
and in that situation we can apply the ideal gas

211
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,933
equation, right here.

212
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:54,802
Now we've established the ideal gas equation

213
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,821
but we're like oh,oh what's R, how do I deal with it, and how do I do math problems

214
00:08:57,821 --> 00:09:00,282
and solve chemistry problems with it

215
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:01,675
and how do the units all work out

216
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:06,458
we'll do all of that in the next video, where i will solve a ton of equations, or a ton of exercises

217
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,595
with the ideal gas equation

218
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:11,799
but the important thing, the important take away from this video

219
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,003
is just to have the intuition, as to why this actually does make sense

220
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:18,486
and frankly once you have this intuition, you should never forget it

221
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:22,225
you should be able to maybe even derive it on your own.
