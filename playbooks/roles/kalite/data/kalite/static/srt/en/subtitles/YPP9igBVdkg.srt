1
00:00:08,068 --> 00:00:09,720
What I want to do with this video

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,390
is to talk a little bit about 401(k)s,

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,107
Which you probably at minimum have heard of,

4
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:16,780
and just from the get-go, just to put some structure

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,405
in your mind of what this really is,

6
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:34,507
is it's very similar to a traditional IRA.

7
00:00:34,507 --> 00:00:37,295
And the ways that they're the same is that you defer your taxes.

8
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:44,600
So you put money in on a tax deferred basis,

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,361
Let me put it this way, you put untaxed or you put

10
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:57,840
pre-tax money in, the money can grow inside of

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,886
either the 401(k) account or the traditional IRA account

12
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:05,277
untaxed. Let me write that.

13
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:16,907
Money grows in account untaxed, and then you can

14
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:23,638
withdraw it, you can withdraw the money

15
00:01:23,638 --> 00:01:28,445
or start getting distributions from the account

16
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:33,396
after age 59 and a half.

17
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:35,132
So that's essentially when you're gonna start retiring,

18
00:01:35,132 --> 00:01:37,447
when you're gonna need the money.

19
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:40,460
And when you withdraw after the age of 59 and a half,

20
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:50,613
you will then pay income tax.

21
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:52,195
And this is what people are talking about

22
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,695
when they talk about deferring taxes,

23
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:55,969
you're not getting out of the taxes,

24
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,748
you're just pushing off the date that you're going to have to pay the taxes.

25
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:02,071
And for a lot of people this might be useful,

26
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,029
because while you are making money, you might be

27
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:08,524
paying at a fairly high incremental tax rate,

28
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:12,247
but then once you're retired, you'll have a much lower one

29
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:15,041
I guess you be in a much lower incremental tax bracket

30
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,630
So your total overall tax bill might be lower.

31
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,739
Also maybe something happens just in terms with what the government does

32
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:25,563
in terms of how they charge taxes.

33
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,983
And in general, if you have to pay 50 cents

34
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:30,404
20 years in the future versus 50 cents today,

35
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:32,556
just present value of money tells you that

36
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:37,125
that 50 cents is going to be worth a lot less in the future,

37
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,436
or the present value is a lot less.

38
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:41,606
So that's some reason to defer, but of course,

39
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:44,745
you're not paying, you're not just gonna pay on what you put in

40
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:47,268
you will then also pay income tax on what you put in

41
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:53,377
and whatever grew, so you will pay income tax on total

42
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:59,958
on total dispersals.

43
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,749
And in both cases you have to start taking despersements

44
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,662
from your account by 70 and a half,

45
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:10,637
so penalties, let me write it this way:

46
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:19,308
penalties if you don't withdraw, or you don't

47
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:22,022
start withdrawing some of your funds by

48
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:23,750
70 and a half. And there are some special cases

49
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:27,272
if you're working and all these type of things.

50
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:29,335
Now, what happens if you withdraw

51
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:35,935
before age 59 and a half?

52
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:38,475
So so far everything I've listed is true of both

53
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:42,037
401Ks and traditional IRAs,

54
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:44,182
if you withdraw before 59 and a half,

55
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:53,989
you are taxed on withdrawal and,

56
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:56,479
on top of that, there's a

57
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:03,006
10% penalty on all the funds you receive.

58
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:04,603
And this is what you have to think about

59
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:06,123
unless you know if you just say,

60
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:08,798
I'm just always gonna max out my traditional IRA or 401(k),

61
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:10,825
you've gotta make sure that you're want that money

62
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:14,278
before 59 and a half, because you might be facing

63
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:16,409
this 10% withdrawal. So these are all the cases

64
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:18,811
that they are the same, so the question is,

65
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:20,114
why do they both exist? Why is there something

66
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:23,654
called a traditional IRA, and why is there something called a 401K?

67
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:26,000
They both seem like a pretty good way for me to

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,750
defer taxes, get earnings on income on my investment

69
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,966
in a tax deferred way and then pay at some future date,

70
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:38,114
and they both kind of force me to make sure they

71
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:41,656
strongly suggest that I shouldn't take out my money

72
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,047
before 50 and a half. So the ways that they're different

73
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:47,353
so let's focus on the differences,

74
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:54,750
so the differences between the two.

75
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:06,915
One is 401(k)s have a higher limit,

76
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:12,261
and if you're focused on 2010 but these numbers keep changing,

77
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:17,033
in 2010 the 401(k) limit is $16,500

78
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:21,267
and that's for just what you contribute to your 401(k)

79
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:31,468
while the IRA limit is $5,000.

80
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:33,685
This is an IRA. So one,

81
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:35,587
401(k) you can just participate with more money,

82
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:37,223
so actually in both of these cases,

83
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:40,330
as you approach your retirement, so after the age of 50

84
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,410
So let me put that in the same thing so that we're comprehensive,

85
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,535
so another similarity is that you can accelerate

86
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:54,678
some of your, or you can have higher I guess

87
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:57,617
deposits into your account.

88
00:05:57,617 --> 00:06:02,183
Accelerate after 50, which just means you can put more money

89
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:04,681
than these limits than what I have right here.

90
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:06,165
So these are your limits before 50,

91
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,350
after 50, between 50 and 59 and a half (when you can start withdrawing)

92
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,132
you can put a little bit more money,

93
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:13,625
and these are constantly moving targets,

94
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:18,455
but the general idea is that you can put more money inside of a 401(k).

95
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:22,275
Now, the other difference is that a 401(k)

96
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:25,955
tends to be organized by your employer.

97
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:33,682
401(k) organized by employer.

98
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:36,483
And just from your point of view, that means two things:

99
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:44,365
one is, the employer will often specify the investments,

100
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:48,130
Specifies investments.

101
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,428
So they'll actually run the 401(k) account for you

102
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:54,151
Normally they'll be held by someone else,

103
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:56,381
but it will be for your company,

104
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,730
for company x, and the company gets to decide

105
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,067
the universe of investments that you will be able to invest in,

106
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:06,596
and the other thing, because it's run by the employer,

107
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:13,240
the employer might match, which means for every dollar you put in,

108
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,049
they'll put another dollar, even though they might go

109
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:20,721
above matching, actually I think the current limits

110
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:24,346
are approaching $50,000 for the total of the employee

111
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:30,349
and employer match. So you can actually get a lot of leverage

112
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,531
from putting in to a 401(k) if you have a very

113
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:35,458
generous employer. And the other difference

114
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,171
and this is really kind of a superficial difference

115
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:40,995
because it's just what you see, is that with a 401(k)

116
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:42,933
the money will be taken out of your paycheck,

117
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:51,175
you will never see it, so taken out before paycheck.

118
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:56,330
While with a traditional IRA, you will take the money

119
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,829
invest it into an IRA account, and when you report your taxes,

120
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:00,933
it will be reported as a tax deduction,

121
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,629
so you won't have to pay taxes on it.

122
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:06,433
Functionally they're the exact same thing.

123
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:09,571
So you think about the pros and cons, if you have a 401(k)

124
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:12,280
the option is available to you, it's a pretty good option.

125
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,333
You're going to have a higher limit right over here

126
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,520
and your employer might match it.

127
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,017
And then the other thing, and this doesn't come into place a lot,

128
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:27,558
but there's also the option of borrowing from a 401(k)

129
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:34,582
without penalty. Borrowing from a 401(k),

130
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:37,205
but you have to pay back interest to the 401(k) if you did that,

131
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:41,838
and you cannot do that with a traditional IRA.

132
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:44,483
Now when you're looking at this, well, why would anyone want to do a traditional IRA

133
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,226
well there's a couple things, one could do both,

134
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,314
or the other thing is traditional IRAs

135
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:53,799
you have much more flexibility on where you want to invest,

136
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,851
maybe your company says you can only invest

137
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:58,689
in us, you can only invest in that company's stock,

138
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:03,183
while in traditional IRAs you can invest in anything

139
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:05,274
But, hopefully that clarifies things a bit for you.
