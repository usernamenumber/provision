1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:03,646
So let's revisit the scenario where everyone is trying to

2
00:00:03,646 --> 00:00:08,522
exit Country B's currency, and convert it back into Country A.

3
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:14,652
We saw in the last video that if just left to its own devices, if this were to happen,

4
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:18,400
if a lot of B's were wanted to be converted into Currency A,

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,639
and because everyone is converting- everyone is afraid to convert into B now,

6
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:26,262
because they think for whatever reason that B, Country B is in bad shape,

7
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:29,327
then you have this imbalance and if you left to its own devices,

8
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:33,088
the Country B's currency would become devalued.

9
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:38,243
you would need more, more B's to trade for an A.

10
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:40,857
(For an A.)

11
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:45,057
which is just another way to say B's currency, B's value,

12
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:50,523
would go down. And that would be a bad thing, especially if it's a pretty steep decline.

13
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:54,190
Maybe it's a country that needs to import fuel from the rest of the world,

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,657
Maybe they need to import food from the rest of the world,

15
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,340
and if their currency were to devalue dramatically,

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,257
then imports could become very, very, very expensive.

17
00:01:02,257 --> 00:01:04,495
And so people in that country might have to pay double for gas,

18
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:08,396
and double for basic necessities, like food and whatever else.

19
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:11,833
And so we played out a scenario where the central bank of Country B

20
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:16,755
actively tries to intervene to keep this from happening, to keep the exchange rate

21
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:17,568
stable.

22
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,816
So what they do is, they could use, (they could use), reserves

23
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,277
(and I'll do some blue for Country B,)

24
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:28,481
so they could use reserves for- of A,

25
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:30,990
that they have accumulated during better times,

26
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,893
And they take those reserves,

27
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,308
so these are reserves that they accumulated in better times,

28
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:37,523
or in previous videos, depending how you want to view them,

29
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:40,974
and they try to balance out the supply with A's with the supply of B's

30
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:45,496
by selling, (by selling), their reserves and buying B's.

31
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:48,067
So one way to think of it they're adding supply of A's,

32
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:51,952
and they're also adding supply- they're also adding demand for B's.

33
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,930
They're going to sell the reserves of A,

34
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,413
and buy their own currency. And that would work,

35
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:59,689
as long as they have reserves, they're going to be able to

36
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:03,123
stabilize things, so that this situation doesn't happen.

37
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,423
But the problem was, and we talked about at the end of the last video,

38
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:10,103
is that they can run out here. It's not like they can print

39
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,666
another country's currencies forever.

40
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,799
Or they can't print it at all; they had to accumulate this.

41
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:18,999
This isn't their own currency, so they have a

42
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,399
finite amount of this, they could eventually run out.

43
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:24,009
And what is often the case is,

44
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:26,935
currency speculators see this and begin to smell blood.

45
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:29,599
They see, "Okay, look, people are trying to exit this currency,

46
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,866
it would devalue if it was left to its own devices,

47
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:38,799
but the central bank of Country B is trying to keep it devaluing

48
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:42,399
by depleting its finite reserves of currency A.

49
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:45,464
And so what currency speculators will start to do is,

50
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:48,999
"Well, I can go into Country B, and I can borrow B's,

51
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:55,466
(so I could literally go to a bank in country B and borrow, I could borrow some of the B currency),

52
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:59,907
and then I can go into the exchange markets, and try to convert it into A's."

53
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:03,732
(and try to convert it into A's.)

54
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:07,199
And just off of when looking at this superficially,

55
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,591
what- what's that going to do?

56
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:11,732
Well, this is going to make the situation even worse for the central bank.

57
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,468
Because now you have people actively,

58
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:15,732
that even hold B's before they're going to be borrowing B's,

59
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:17,399
and converting them into A's.

60
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:21,066
So it's going to create an even larger supply of B's,

61
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:26,666
and even more demand for the finite number of A's that are willing to go this way.

62
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,199
And why is the speculator doing this?

63
00:03:29,199 --> 99:59:59,999
Well think about the two situations for them.
