00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,533
In the last video we talked a little bit about what inflation is in the Consumer Price Index

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:10,810
and i thought i will actually show you data and maybe point out a few interesting things right over here

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:15,142
so this right over here is the monthly press-release, there is a table from the monthly press-release

4
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:21,376
issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and this is Table A which is really a summary of all the important things

5
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:25,001
it's the changes in CPI for all urban consumers

6
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,761
the CPI-U

7
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,904
and they do it for non- or urban consumers and all the rest

8
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:33,816
but the CPI that is quoted is the one for urban consumers

9
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:35,404
the US city average

10
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:38,342
I always find that the details are much more interesting

11
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:39,820
than what you hear just on the news

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,944
when people say "oh, the CPI changed by 0.5 per cent"

13
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,902
and one thing I do wanna point out and this is true of the CPI

14
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:49,011
this is true of all government statistics,

15
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:51,676
and frankly this is true of any report that any company gives you,

16
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,277
it's very important to keep in mind

17
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:56,148
whether they're giving a sequential change

18
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:58,678
or whether they're giving a year over year change

19
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:03,541
so, for example, there might be a press release like this one

20
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,874
and the text of it or maybe the headline number when you look at your local newspaper

21
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:09,211
or your news report would say

22
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:19,410
"look, in June 2011 inflation on all items, on the entire basket of goods went down by 0.2 per cent"

23
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,611
and you might say "oh wow, look, there's no inflation, in fact the prices are going down,

24
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:25,542
"this would be minor deflation"

25
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:33,167
but it's important to realise that this is only the seasonally adjusted prices from May to June

26
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:35,210
and when I talk about seasonally adjusted is that

27
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,876
traditionally maybe people use a different amount of energy, a different amount of gasoline from May to June

28
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:45,744
and they try to factor that in when they compare the price of the basket of goods

29
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:49,141
from May to June, so that's what they talk about "seasonally adjusting"

30
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:51,867
but if you look over here, the prices went down from May to June

31
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:55,367
adjusting it for the season,

32
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:59,410
but the year over year changes are still up

33
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:05,866
if you compare June 2011 to June 2010, it is still up by 3.6 per cent

34
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:09,033
and in general, the monthly things are going to be a little bit more volatile,

35
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:12,868
obviously with the seasonal adjustments you have other short-term factors that might change it,

36
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:18,676
but the year over year one is a stronger signal for what is actually happening with inflation

37
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:21,217
although someone might wanna pay attention to the monthly one,

38
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:26,676
because that's obviously giving you kind of the most up-to-date of what's happening now

39
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:30,301
and what you'll often see is they'll give an inflation number for everything

40
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:33,467
and then they'll subtract out actually food and energy,

41
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:37,011
so this is all items less food, less energy

42
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:41,214
and as for food energy, they represent a good bit of the basket but the'yre very, very volatile

43
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:43,505
you can see it right here in this report

44
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:48,302
year over year energy has gone up double digits

45
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:52,347
20 per cent for energy generally

46
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:54,556
if you look at fuel oil - 35.6 per cent

47
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:57,210
at least in this report, it's been coming down more recently,

48
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,843
but year over year it's been up a huge amount

49
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:03,895
and that's actually the main driving factor for this 3.6 per cent

50
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:06,342
if you take food and energy out of the equation,

51
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:08,409
if you compare the basket of goods minus that,

52
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:11,475
inflation was only up 1.6 per cent

53
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:15,142
it is interesting, even within that you can look at which parts of the economy

54
00:03:15,142 --> 00:03:19,820
or which products and services are getting a lot more expensive and which ones are getting cheaper

55
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,168
it is actually really interesting that used cars and trucks are up 5.1 per cent

56
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:26,830
that seems like a pretty strong price increase for used things
