1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:04,561
To get a better understanding of quantitative easing

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:06,009
in the American context, especially the context

3
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,077
that Ben Bernanke is talking about,

4
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:11,353
I want to read this quote from a speech that

5
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:13,587
Ben Bernanke gave at the London School of Economics

6
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:17,138
on January 13th, 2009. So this is shortly

7
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:19,869
after a lot of the craziness of the financial crisis

8
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:21,758
was happening but it was still going on.

9
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:25,893
And he's saying, "Our approach, which could be described as

10
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:30,560
'credit easing' -- resembles quantitative easing in one respect."

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,493
He's saying it's not quite quantitative easing,

12
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:33,935
although it really is.

13
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:40,329
"It involves an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet."

14
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:42,045
So just to understand what he's talking about,

15
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:44,943
the central bank, it has liabilities and assets,

16
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:46,554
like any corporation, and they have to,

17
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:52,311
the liabilities, plus the equity has to match up to the assets.

18
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:56,146
Just for simplicity, let's just have the assets and the liabilies

19
00:00:56,146 --> 00:01:00,276
lining up together. So let's say that this is the central bank's

20
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,394
balance sheet right over here.

21
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:05,627
This is their current assets, and let's say

22
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:07,676
that is is their liabilities over here,

23
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:10,341
so liabilities, and then this is their equity,

24
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:14,548
although the federal reserve's equity is a little bit strange,

25
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:17,117
it's not like traditional equity, that they get all the

26
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:19,059
excess profits and all of that, all the excess

27
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:21,632
profits actually go to the US government.

28
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:25,887
But when the fed prints money, what they literally do

29
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:29,477
is that they create offsetting liabilities and assets

30
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:31,991
So when they print money they'll, so literally

31
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,636
let's say that they're printing some money right over here,

32
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,473
so that's money that they're printing,

33
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:39,318
so this is literally, it would be federal reserve notes

34
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:42,411
being created, so these are notes, which are essentially dollar bills.

35
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:46,749
So these are dollar bills right here being printed,

36
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:49,122
either physically or electronically.

37
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:51,326
And then they have an offsetting liability

38
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:53,644
which is just notes outstanding, which is literally saying

39
00:01:53,644 --> 00:01:56,477
that hey, these are notes that we've created.

40
00:01:56,477 --> 00:02:02,289
Notes outstanding is the other side of the balance sheet.

41
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,215
So, just to parse the statement, when he says, "credit easing

42
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:08,876
resembles quantitative easing in one respect

43
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:11,727
it involves an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet."

44
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:15,193
So this is the expansion of the central bank's balance sheet.

45
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:18,911
Which is essentially the same thing as printing money.

46
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:21,193
And the federal bank will get these notes into

47
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,676
circulation by going out into the market

48
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,944
and buying assets.

49
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:28,900
Traditionally, when the fed is more focused on

50
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,327
short-term interest rates,

51
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:32,594
on overnight borrowing rates between banks,

52
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:35,509
it will use these to buy shorter-term debt

53
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:37,876
that increases the amount of currency out there

54
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:40,410
the amount of dollars out there, and so it will

55
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,894
lower the interest rate for people buying

56
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:44,249
and selling dollars, or I should say

57
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:46,041
borrowing and lending dollars, not buying and selling.

58
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,758
Borrowing and lending dollars, the overnight rate

59
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:51,658
for banks will go down because there's more dollars out there,

60
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,669
the cost of borrowing them will go down.

61
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:56,277
That's normally what the fed is concerned about.

62
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:58,826
And they're saying, look, quantitative easing is just

63
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:01,631
this idea of expanding that balance sheet.

64
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,971
Let's keep reading:

65
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:06,069
"However, in a pure quantitative easing regime,

66
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:10,326
the focus of quality is the quantity of bank reserves,

67
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,815
which are liabilities of the central bank;

68
00:03:12,815 --> 00:03:15,684
the composition of loans and securities on the asset side

69
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:18,888
of the central bank's balance sheet is incidential."

70
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:20,935
So he's saying in traditional quantitative easing,

71
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:25,147
the central bank says look, I just care about printing money

72
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:28,543
I just care about printing money,

73
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:32,066
So their liabilities increase accordingly.

74
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:36,810
So this is notes outstanding again,

75
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,426
And the height here is proportional to how much money

76
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:41,317
they print, so maybe this is another trillion

77
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:42,793
dollars they're printing.

78
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:45,355
But what the federal reserve is saying, in traditional

79
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:46,155
quantitative easing, all the central bank cares about

80
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:49,739
is printing this money and getting it out there

81
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,707
into circulation, and they don't really care

82
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:55,543
what they're using this money for.

83
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:57,360
So whenever they get this money into circulation

84
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,486
they do go out there and they do buy assets

85
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,009
usually treasury assets,

86
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,918
and then they say even, "Indeed, although the

87
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:06,262
bank of Japan's policy," -- so he's comparing

88
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:10,010
relative to what Japan did when they kind of faced deflationary crisis.

89
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,555
"Indeed, although the bank of Japan's policy approach

90
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:17,166
during the quantitative easing period was quite

91
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,322
multifaceted, the overall stance of its policy

92
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:26,009
was gauged primarily in terms of its target for bank reserves."

93
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:28,626
So you're saying look, the Japanese were trying to fight

94
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:32,375
a deflationary bank crisis, they kept printing money

95
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:36,240
so they kept increasing the liability side of their

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,136
balance sheet, they kept printing money

97
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:40,571
and they did use this money for a bunch of stuff,

98
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,980
they did use that money to go buy a bunch

99
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,656
of assets, but their focus of their intervention

100
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:49,023
was just, how much did they print?

101
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,306
They didn't really care, they didn't really

102
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,633
engineer where that money went to.

103
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,810
They really weren't trying to change what happens

104
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,276
in the markets that they were participating in.

105
00:04:58,276 --> 00:04:59,919
Let's keep reading what the fed is saying.

106
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,940
"In contrast, the Federal Reserve's credit easing

107
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,180
approach focuses on the mix of loans and securities

108
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,689
that it holds and on how this composition of assets

109
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:14,725
affects credit conditions for households and businesses."

110
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:17,688
So what he's saying is that, we are mechanically

111
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:19,602
doing the same thing that Japan did,

112
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:24,185
we're increasing our balance sheet, which is analogous to printing money

113
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:27,009
And we are also buying a bunch of stuff,

114
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,276
just like Japan did,

115
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:30,144
Japan had a multifaceted approach,

116
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:32,397
that's how they put the money into circulation,

117
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:34,948
but what Bernanke is saying

118
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,561
is that our approach isn't just focused on the amount

119
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,745
of cash that we are printing, our focus is

120
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:42,426
where are we putting that cash toward,

121
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,857
how can we use this cash that we printed

122
00:05:45,857 --> 00:05:50,576
to kind of, provide liquidity, to ease up things

123
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:52,560
in certain parts of the economy. To understand

124
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,320
what he's talking about, let me draw

125
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,855
a yield curve right over here.

126
00:05:56,855 --> 00:06:00,676
Let me draw this yield curve right over here,

127
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:06,609
so this is maturity on the horizontal axis,

128
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:09,309
and this is yield,

129
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,588
and I'm gonna draw the yield curve for treasuries.

130
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:14,875
So let's say the short-term overnight borrowing for,

131
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,547
let's say, let's do the yield curve for treasuries,

132
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:20,210
maybe it looks something like this.

133
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,862
So short-term interest rates are already

134
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:26,909
pretty darn close to zero, and maybe you know

135
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:29,737
this is some, I don't know what percentage,

136
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:32,241
maybe this is like 4% or something.

137
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,977
It's not accurate, but just gives you an idea.

138
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,876
So this is the treasury yield curve.

139
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:41,709
Now you could also have a yield curve for other types of

140
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,171
debt. Maybe you have AAA corporate debt,

141
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,946
a very safe corporate debt, a perceived safe corporate debt,

142
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:49,744
but it's not quite as safe as US treasuries,

143
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:56,269
so maybe it's yield curve might look something like this

144
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:59,829
and this difference, for any maturities,

145
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,545
maybe this is a 10 year,

146
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,373
this is 10 year debt right here.

147
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:08,501
This difference between this AAA corporate debt

148
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:11,977
and the treasury, that is the yield spread.

149
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:16,019
And maybe the fed is able to, through intervention,

150
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,098
first they're able to print money,

151
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:20,127
normally they buy shorter-term debt,

152
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:24,369
maybe they start buying longer-term treasury debt,

153
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,209
and maybe that helps get the yield curve,

154
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:29,110
for longer-term treasuries down a little bit.

155
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,780
Helps bring it down.

156
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,042
But maybe the AAA corporate debts

157
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:34,937
don't react, maybe the spread doesn't stay constant

158
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:39,492
maybe the spread widens. Maybe the same thing

159
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,372
for other types of debt. This is highly rated

160
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:44,924
mortgage backed securities, maybe they have a

161
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:47,176
slightly higher interest rate.

162
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,493
And once again, even though the treasury interest rates

163
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:51,203
are coming down, while they're intervening

164
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:53,447
because of all the craziness that is happening in the economy,

165
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:58,857
the spread between treasuries, and AAA mortgage

166
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:01,502
backed securities, or the spread between treasuries

167
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:03,078
and AAA corporate debt

168
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:05,164
that widens, or another way to think about it

169
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:07,199
is the treasury interest rates are coming down

170
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,136
while these things aren't following it,

171
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:11,936
so what Ben Bernanke is saying, look we are doing

172
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:14,394
quantitative easing, we are printing money

173
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,698
and we are using that money to go buy things in the economy

174
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:18,181
and we're increasing the amount

175
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:20,136
of cash that there is in the economy,

176
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:22,399
but our point isn't to increase the amount

177
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,743
of reserves, or increase the amount of cash,

178
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:25,994
because it's really not changing the behavior

179
00:08:25,994 --> 00:08:28,129
of banks. What we are going to do is

180
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:32,529
go buy things like highly rated mortgage backed securities,

181
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,336
or things like commercial paper, AAA corporate debt,

182
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:41,719
so that those things, the interest on those things

183
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,371
goes down. Obviously if someone is willing to pay more

184
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:46,493
for a certain amount of debt,

185
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,387
and I've gone over this in another video,

186
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:49,737
maybe it's not so obvious,

187
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:53,536
then the interest rates on it will go down.

188
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:55,870
And so what they're doing is, what Bernanke is saying,

189
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,631
is he cares more about what winds up on the

190
00:08:58,631 --> 00:09:00,320
asset side of the Fed's balance sheet,

191
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,936
because it takes these dollars that it printed,

192
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:03,276
and goes and buys other stuff,

193
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,687
and it wants to put some mortgage backed securities

194
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:08,586
over here, it wants to put some AAA corporate debt

195
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:12,328
over here. And maybe it also does some longer term

196
00:09:12,328 --> 99:59:59,999
treasury securities, or whatever else.
