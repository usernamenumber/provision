1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
-

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,430
In the last video, we saw a
reality where the currency

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,080
between, or the exchange rate
between, the Yuan and the

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,780
dollar started off at 10 to 1.

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,740
And at that exchange rate,
China was shipping more

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,890
goods-- in terms of whether you
measure it in dollars or

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,960
Yuan --was shipping more to
the U.S. than the U.S. was

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,760
shipping to China.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,920
And because of that, we saw an
imbalance in the currencies.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,840
The Yuan became more expensive,
or the dollar

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,509
became cheaper, until eventually
Chinese goods got

12
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,340
expensive enough that there was
less demand in the U.S.

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,090
and U.S. goods got cheap enough,
that there was more

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,900
demand in China, that the trade

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,520
actually came into balance.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,810
Now, that's OK if everyone
wanted to have balanced trade,

17
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,380
but what if the Chinese
government didn't want that.

18
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,880
They said, hey, we needed to
develop, the United States is

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,800
already developed, we want to
have an industrial base, we

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,110
want to have a market to
sell our goods to.

21
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,070
We want to export more to
the United States than

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,250
we import from them.

23
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,650
We want export-led growth.

24
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,250
So they don't like the dynamic
that they saw, they did not

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,390
like the currency, they
did not like the

26
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,440
Yuan getting expensive.

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,730
So let's say the Chinese
government-- let me scroll up

28
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:29,560
a little bit --so the Chinese
government wants to keep

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:45,700
currency exchange pegged at-- I
ran out of space over there

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,570
--at CNY 10 per dollar.

31
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,120
And they want that because they
want this situation to

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,680
keep on going forever, that
China keeps shipping more to

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,170
the U.S. than the U.S. ships to
China, or maybe they wanted

34
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,210
to go even more, that China
keeps shipping more and more

35
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,310
to the U.S. than the U.S. ships
to China so that China

36
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,390
could build its industrial
base.

37
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,340
And, I guess the more sinister
view is also so that the

38
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,370
United States' industrial
base gets depleted.

39
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,920
That they keep manufacturing
things cheaper and cheaper and

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,530
cheaper, and then United States

41
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,710
manufacturers can't compete.

42
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,740
And we'll talk about this in
more videos, it's not it's not

43
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,470
clear that it's 100%
one-sided.

44
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,140
There's actually some benefits
that the United States also

45
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,830
gets from this, and we'll
discuss that more.

46
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,390
It's a little bit
more involved.

47
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,700
So how could they do this?

48
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,930
Let's just say that the Chinese
government wants this

49
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,970
reality, and they want
this reality frozen.

50
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,720
They do not want the reality
where the trade balances.

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,660
How could they intervene in
currency markets so that this

52
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,660
doesn't change?

53
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,380
Because, as we said, if more
Chinese goods are being

54
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,060
bought, there's more demand
for Yuan, the Yuan should

55
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,470
appreciate, the dollar
should go down.

56
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,560
But how do you get both?

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,730
How do you have your cake
and eat it too?

58
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,360
How do you get more goods being
shipped to the United

59
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,090
States than back to China
without the Yuan appreciating?

60
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,030
And the way you do that,
there's the Chinese

61
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,770
government, or maybe in
particular we could talk about

62
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,850
the Chinese Central Bank.

63
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,520
The Chinese Central Bank, which
is a part of the Chinese

64
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,690
government can say, hey, to
keep our Yuan devalued, we

65
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,820
will print money.

66
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,230
So let me draw the Chinese
Central Bank.

67
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,390
Let me do this in a new color.

68
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:43,410
-

69
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,860
And what they do, they can
actually just print money.

70
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,220
So we had this scenario that I
had outlined in the last two

71
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,250
videos where we had
this imbalance.

72
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,310
There was demand for
CNY 1,000, but only

73
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,480
supply of CNY 500.

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,540
So what they can do is
just equalize this.

75
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:15,680
They could just print CNY 500
and then try to convert that

76
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,930
into dollars.

77
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:24,090
-

78
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,620
So what just happened?

79
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,790
Now all of a sudden, we have
$100 that are trying to be

80
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,590
converted into roughly CNY 1,000
or if that exchange rate

81
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,740
were to be constant.

82
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,035
So there's demand
for CNY 1,000.

83
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:39,510
Before the Chinese Central Bank
got involved, there was

84
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,270
only a CNY 500 supply.

85
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,910
But now the Chinese Central
Bank says, OK, there's a

86
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,450
demand for CNY 1,000, there's
only CNY 500 supply, we're

87
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,110
going to produce another
CNY 500.

88
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,360
We literally can just print it,
and then they will convert

89
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,490
what they printed
into dollars.

90
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,300
So just like that, you
now have a balance

91
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,320
of supply and demand.

92
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,390
You have CNY 1,000, 500 here and
500 here that want to be

93
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,090
converted into dollars, and then
you have $100 that want

94
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,180
to be converted into,
I guess, CNY 1,000.

95
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,060
So if they were to do this, the
currency wouldn't change.

96
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,990
The exchange rate
would change.

97
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,900
The supply and demand of the two
currencies would be equal.

98
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,320
Now, and that would work and
frankly that's what they have

99
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,210
been doing for some time now.

100
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,710
But there's one kind
of catch here.

101
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,130
The whole time that they're
doing this, what is happening?

102
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,820
Well, they keep shipping more to
the United States then the

103
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,780
United States is shipping
to China.

104
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,200
These guys keep having to print
Yuan and buy dollars

105
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,580
with those Yuan in
order to keep the

106
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,660
Chinese currency cheap.

107
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,290
So these people are going to
keep accumulating dollars.

108
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,770
They just keep printing Yuan
and then they just keep

109
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,530
accumulating dollars.

110
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,730
Let me draw that over here, so
the Chinese Central Bank just

111
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,160
starts accumulating many,
many dollars.

112
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,920
They can they can print Yuan
as much as they want, those

113
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,120
Yuan, they trade them into
dollars and then these guys

114
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,170
start accumulating more and
more dollars over here.

115
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,800
And the more that they want this
trade imbalance to occur,

116
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,320
the longer they want it to
occur, the more dollars that

117
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,160
they will have to accumulate.

118
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,990
So they have to just keep
on doing it, they can't

119
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,970
even stop doing it.

120
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,610
They have to keep doing it in
order to keep the trade

121
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,950
balance the way it is.

122
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,720
And in the next video, I'll talk
about what they actually

123
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,240
have to do with these dollars
because they actually won't

124
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,850
just keep it in cash, what they
actually have to do with

125
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,480
these dollars, and then what
effect that actually might

126
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,400
have on the United
States economy.

127
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,870
Then we could talk about how
this might unwind itself, but

128
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,850
we'll find out it's actually
very difficult for this

129
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,280
scenario to unwind once
it gets started.

130
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,067
