1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
   

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,370
In the last video we figured
out that if we had a proton

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,990
coming into the right at a
velocity of 6 times 10 to the

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,470
seventh meters per second.

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,360
So the magnitude of the
velocity is 1/5

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,490
the speed of light.

7
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,740
And if it were to cross this
magnetic field, we used this

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,560
formula to figure out that the
magnitude of the force on this

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,650
proton would be 4.8 times 10
to the negative 12 newtons.

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,600
And then the direction, we
used our right hand rule

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,990
because it's a cross product.

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,180
And we figured out that it would
be perpendicular-- well,

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,820
it has to be perpendicular to
both, because we're taking the

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,470
cross product-- and right when
it enters, the net force will

15
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,500
be downwards.

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,020
But then think about
what happens.

17
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,830
If you have a downward force
right there, then the particle

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,950
will be deflected downward a
little bit, so its velocity

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,900
vector will then look
something like that.

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,800
But it's still in the magnetic
field, right?

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,090
And not only is it still in the
magnetic field, but since

22
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,470
the particle is still moving
within the plane of your video

23
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,145
screen, it's still completely
perpendicular to

24
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:01,130
the magnetic field.

25
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,660
And so the magnitude of the
force on the moving particle

26
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,980
won't change, just the
direction will.

27
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,430
Because if we do the right hand
rule here, but if we just

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,260
move our hand down a little bit,
if we tilt it down, then

29
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,080
our thumb's going to be pointing
in this direction.

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,200
And that just keeps happening.

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,590
It gets deflected that
way a little bit.

32
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,560
So the magnitude of the velocity
doesn't ever change.

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,670
It always stays perpendicular to
the magnetic field because

34
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,230
it's always staying
in this plane.

35
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,510
But the orientation does change
within the plane.

36
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,280
And because of that, because
the orientation of the

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,130
velocity changes,
the orientation

38
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,400
of the force changes.

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,550
So when the velocity is here,
the force is perpendicular.

40
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,100
So it acts as kind of a
centripetal force, and so the

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,340
particle will start moving
in a circle.

42
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,290
So let's see if we can break
out our toolkit from what

43
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,740
we've learned before in
classical mechanics, and

44
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,940
figure out what the radius
of that circle is.

45
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,110
And that might seem more
daunting than it really is.

46
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,530
Well, what do we know about
centripetal forces and

47
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,140
radiuses of circles,
et cetera?

48
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:19,880
   

49
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,250
So, what is the formula
for centripetal force?

50
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,750
And we proved it many, many
videos ago, early in the

51
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,090
physics playlist. Well,
centripetal acceleration is

52
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,100
the magnitude of the velocity
vector squared over the radius

53
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,630
of the circle.

54
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,330
And since this is acceleration,
if we want to

55
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,920
know the centripetal force,
it's just the mass times

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,590
acceleration.

57
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,250
So it's the mass of the
particle, or the object in

58
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,270
question, times the magnitude
of its velocity squared

59
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,740
divided by the radius
of the circle.

60
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,452
In this case, this is the
radius of the circle.

61
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:53,270
And that's what we're going
to try to solve for.

62
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,940
And what do we know about
the centripetal force?

63
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,550
What is causing the
centripetal force?

64
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,930
Well, it's the magnetic field
and we've figured that out.

65
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,460
This is going to be equal to
this, which we figured out is

66
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,770
going to be equal to-- at least
the magnitudes-- the

67
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,060
magnitude of this is equal
to the magnitude of this.

68
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,790
And that magnitude is
4.8 times 10 to

69
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,150
the minus 12 newtons.

70
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,290
And so the radius is going to
be-- let's see, if we flip

71
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:33,510
both sides of this equation,
we get radius over mass

72
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,580
velocity squared is equal
to 1 over 4.8 times 10

73
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,460
to the minus 12.

74
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,210
I could just figure out what
that number is, but I won't

75
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:42,830
worry about that now.

76
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:49,330
Then we can multiply both sides
times this mv squared.

77
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,840
And we get that the radius of
the circle is going to be

78
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,030
equal to the mass of the proton
times the magnitude of

79
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:06,910
its velocity squared divided
by the force from

80
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,930
the magnetic field.

81
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,610
The centripetal force.

82
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,830
4.8 times 10 to the
minus 12 newtons.

83
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,830
And the radius should be in
meters, since everything is

84
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,300
kind of in the standard
SI units.

85
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,149
And let's see if we can
figure this out.

86
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,530
Get our calculator.

87
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,470
And this is where that constant
function is useful

88
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,090
again, because what is
the mass of a proton?

89
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,210
Well, that's something that I

90
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,020
personally don't have memorized.

91
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,090
But if we go into the built-in
constants on the

92
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,850
TI-85-- let's see more.

93
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,800
Mass of a proton.

94
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,920
This is mass of an electron.

95
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,170
This is mass of a proton.

96
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,420
So mass of a proton-- that's
what we care about-- times the

97
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,740
magnitude of the velocity
squared.

98
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,500
What was the velocity?

99
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,440
It was 6 times 10 to the seventh
meters per second.

100
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,220
So times 6 times 10
to the seventh

101
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,050
meters per second squared.

102
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,120
   

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,380
And all of that divided
by the magnitude of

104
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,750
the centripetal force.

105
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,040
Which is the force that's
being generated by the

106
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,520
magnetic field.

107
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,590
That's 4.8 times 10 to
the negative 12.

108
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:26,380
Divided by 4.8 E minus 12.

109
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:26,940
Let's see.

110
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,340
Hopefully we don't get
something funky.

111
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,330
There we go.

112
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,900
That's actually a pretty
neat number.

113
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,510
1.25 meters.

114
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,630
That's actually a number
that we can imagine.

115
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:46,520
So if you have a proton going
in this direction at 1/5 the

116
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,140
speed of light through a--
what'd I say it was?

117
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,830
It was a 0.5 tesla magnetic
field, where the vectors are

118
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,220
pointing out of the video.

119
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,510
We have just shown that this
proton will go in a circle of

120
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,210
radius 1.25 meters.

121
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,820
Which is neat because
it's a number that I

122
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,520
can actually visualize.

123
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,940
And so this whole business of
magnetic fields making charged

124
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,820
particles go into circles, this
is one of the few times

125
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,100
that I can actually say has a
direct application into things

126
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,040
that you've seen.

127
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,510
Namely, your TV.

128
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,790
Or at least the old-school TVs.
The non-plasma or LCD

129
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,410
TVs, your cathode ray TVs,
take advantage of this.

130
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,760
Where you essentially
have a beam of

131
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,015
not protons but electrons.

132
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,570
And a magnet-- if you take
apart a TV, which I don't

133
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,170
think you should do, because
you're more likely to hurt

134
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,730
yourself because there's a
vacuum in there that can

135
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,280
implode, and all that-- but
essentially, you have a magnet

136
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,700
that deflects this electron beam
and does it really fast

137
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,930
so it scans your entire screen
of different intensities, and

138
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,980
that's what forms the image.

139
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,000
I won't go into that detail.

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,060
Maybe one day I'll do a whole
video on how TVs work.

141
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,090
So that's one application of a
magnetic field causing a beam

142
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,210
of charged particles to curve.

143
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,670
And then the other application,
and this is

144
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,600
actually one where it's actually
useful to make the

145
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,550
particle go in a circle, is
these cyclotrons that you read

146
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,200
about, where they take these
protons and they make them go

147
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,700
in circles really, really
fast, and then

148
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,470
they smash them together.

149
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,990
Well, have you ever wondered,
how do they even make a proton

150
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,090
go in a circle?

151
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,440
It's not like you could
hold it and guide

152
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,300
it around in a circle.

153
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,770
Well, that's what they do.

154
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:21,120
They pass it through an
appropriate strength magnetic

155
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,620
field, and it curves the path
of the proton so that it can

156
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,610
keep going through the same
field over and over again.

157
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,670
And then they can actually use
those electric fields.

158
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,610
I don't claim to have any
expertise in this, but then

159
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,620
they can keep speeding it up
using the same devices,

160
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,750
because it keeps passing
through the

161
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,440
same part of the collider.

162
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,180
And then once it collides,
you've

163
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,430
probably seen those pictures.

164
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,090
   

165
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,860
You know, that you spend
billions of dollars on

166
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,020
supercolliders, and you end
up with these pictures.

167
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,620
And somehow these physicists
are able to take these

168
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,470
pictures and say, oh, this is
some new particle because of

169
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,580
the way it moved.

170
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,980
Well, what they're actually
talking about is these are

171
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,700
moving at relativistic speeds.

172
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,580
And since they're at
relativistic speeds as they

173
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,430
move at different velocities,
their mass is

174
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,050
changing, and all that.

175
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,770
But the basic idea is what
we just learned.

176
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,110
They move in circles.

177
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,680
They move in circles because
they're going through a

178
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,540
magnetic field.

179
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,180
But their radiuses are different
because their

180
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,010
charges and their velocities
are going to be different.

181
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,917
And actually some will move
to the left and some

182
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:25,640
will move to the right.

183
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,480
And that might be because
they're positive or negative,

184
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,570
and then the radius will be
dependent on their masses.

185
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,810
Anyway, I don't want
to confuse you.

186
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,559
But I just wanted to show you
that we actually are touching

187
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,650
on some physics that
a physicist would

188
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,309
actually care about.

189
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,377
Now with that said, what would
have happened if this wasn't a

190
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:45,980
proton but if this was an
electron moving at this

191
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,360
velocity at 6 times 10 to the
seventh meters per second

192
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,260
through a 0.5 tesla
magnetic field

193
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,240
popping out of this video.

194
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,260
What would have happened?

195
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,360
Well, this formula would
have still been safe.

196
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,335
The magnitude of the force is
the charge-- but it wouldn't

197
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:02,630
have been the charge of a
proton, it would have been the

198
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,040
charge of an electron, times 6
times 10 to the seventh meters

199
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,490
per second times 0.5 teslas.

200
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,210
So what's the difference between
the charge of a proton

201
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,820
and the charge of an electron?

202
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,840
Well, the charge of an
electron is negative.

203
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,040
So if this was an electron,
then the net force would

204
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,510
actually end up being
a negative number.

205
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,030
So what does that mean?

206
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,260
Well, when we used the right
hand rule with the proton

207
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,800
example, we said that the-- at
least when the proton is

208
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,110
moving in this direction--
that the net

209
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,690
force would be downwards.

210
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,880
But now, all of a sudden, if we
reverse the charge, if we

211
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,850
say we have a negative charge--
the same magnitude

212
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,980
but it's negative,
because it's an

213
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,410
electron-- what happens?

214
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,910
The force is now in this
direction, using the right

215
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,880
hand rule, but it
is a negative.

216
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,530
So really it's going to be a
positive force of the same

217
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,640
magnitude in this direction.

218
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,700
So if we have a proton,
it'll go in a

219
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,810
circle in this direction.

220
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,610
It'll go like this.

221
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,820
But if we have an electron,
it'll go in a circle of the

222
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,810
other direction.

223
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,110
Now let me ask a question.

224
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,520
Is that circle going
to be a tighter

225
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,870
circle or a wider circle?

226
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,843
Well, the mass of an electron is
a lot smaller than the mass

227
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:09,830
of a proton.

228
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,680
And we had the radius is equal
to the mass times the velocity

229
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,990
squared divided by the
centripetal force.

230
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,625
So this mass is smaller
and the radius

231
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,460
is going to be smaller.

232
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,370
So the electron's path would
actually move up and it would

233
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,990
be a smaller radius.

234
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,570
Actually proportional to the
difference in their radiuses

235
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,960
is the difference in their
masses, actually.

236
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,650
But that would be the path
of the electron.

237
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,920
Anyway, I thought you'd be
interested in that, as well.

238
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,370
I have run out of time.

239
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,800
I will see you in
the next video.
