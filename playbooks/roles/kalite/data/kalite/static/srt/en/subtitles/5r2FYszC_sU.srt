A common house spider has 8 eyes. If a spider is looking at you with its 2 front eyes and 3 of its other eyes, what fraction of its eyes are looking at you?

2
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:23,048
And just to show that we're not making this stuff up, these are actual pictures of spiders and you see in each of these pictures that they have 8 eyes.

3
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:31,235
Here in this one there&#x27;s an eye over here: 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5, 6, 7, 8. And i&#x27;ve never even realised that this is quite creepy.

4
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:33,881
But anyway, let's focus on the problem:

5
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:38,402
So it's looking at you with 2 of its front eyes. 2 of its 8 eyes.

6
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:48,339
So the 2 front eyes represent what fraction of the eyes? Well it represents 2 of the 8 eyes.

7
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:54,534
You could look at it right over here. You have 8 eyes and 2 front eyes. That&#x27;s 1 and 2. 2 of the 8.

8
00:00:54,534 --> 00:01:02,491
And it says it's also looking at us with 3 of its other eyes. So it's also looking at us with 3 of the 8 eyes.

9
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:07,841
So you could image, that might be that one, that one and that one.

10
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:12,484
So this is really about adding fractions. This about adding 2/8 of something to 3/8 of something.

11
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:16,448
So what fraction of its eyes are looking at us?

12
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:28,220
Well it&#x27;s still going to be a fraction of 8. 2 + 3 over 8.

13
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:38,146
Which is going to be equal to 5&#x2F;8 of the eyes. 5 out of the 8 eyes are looking at us and we see that right over here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

14
00:01:38,146 --> 00:01:42,146
5 out of a total of 8 eyes are looking at us in a fairly creepy way.
