1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,780
I want to do one more video on total revenue and price elasticity of demand,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,400
Just to make sure that you-- the relationship between the two is an intuitive one.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,040
So let's draw an arbitrary demand curve:

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,000
this is my price axis,

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,760
that is my quantity demanded axis,

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,170
and let me just draw an arbitrary demand curve right over here,

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,960
so let's say that is my demand curve,

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,100
and let's pick some price and quantity that is on this demand curve.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,270
So let's say that the price is up here - let's call that P1,

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,500
and then the quantity demanded - let's call that Q1.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,760
We already know that the total revenue is the area of this rectangle right over here -

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,840
this is the total revenue, it's just the price times the quantity.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,840
If I'm selling two burgers an hour for nine dollars a burger,

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,330
I'm going to make $18 per hour - that's going to be this area right over here.

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,440
Now let's assume in this part of the curve,

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:13,860
that the price elasticity of demand is greater than one (&gt;1), so we are elastic.

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:26,010
So absolute value of the elasticity of demand is greater than one,

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:36,650
which means for a 1% drop in price,

19
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:48,880
you have greater than 1% increase in quantity.

20
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,620
And that comes straight out of the expression or formula for what elasticity is

21
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:04,090
Remember, elasticity is our % change in quantity over % change in price

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:12,980
So if the absolute value of this is greater than 1

23
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,450
that means this quantity is going to be larger than this quantity

24
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:24,000
So if we have a 1% drop in price, the change in our quantity is going to be greater than 1%

25
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,000
And so for this point right over here, if we lower this by 1%

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,280
we're going to increase this by more than 1%

27
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,000
So any reduction in our height will be more than made up for --

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,020
this is generally the case -- will be more than made up for by increase in our width

29
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,980
So total revenue will increase

30
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:54,780
So when price drops -- so 1% drop in price and a larger than 1% increase in quantity

31
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,020
means that total revenue will go up

32
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,860
Now if we go down to this part of the curve

33
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:11,680
Let's call this P2, and let's call that quantity 2

34
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,070
And this area here will be total revenue 2

35
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,770
Let's call that total revenue 1 here

36
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,210
Price times the quantity

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,870
We're going to assume that

38
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:34,670
the absolute value of our price elasticity of demand is less than 1 at this point in the curve

39
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:44,120
And all that is a fancy way of saying that for a 1% drop in price

40
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:59,560
we get a less than 1% increase in quantity

41
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:06,040
So if we have a 1% drop, we're lowering the height by 1%

42
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,800
but we're not getting a 1% increase in our width

43
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,420
So the width isn't going to be increasing that much

44
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,270
So in general this is going to result in a lowering of this area

45
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:22,460
The area will get smaller. We're reducing our height more than we're expanding our width

46
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,450
So in this situation, the total revenue will go down

47
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,520
Remember this is a elastic situation

48
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:43,400
So when it is elastic, a drop in price tends to make total revenue go up

49
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:54,360
And when it is inelastic, a drop in price tends to make total revenue go down

50
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,410
And then you could imagine, right when you're at unit elasticity, someplace around there

51
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:08,350
A 1% drop in price will result in exactly a 1% increase in quantity demanded

52
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:16,900
And so they'll kind of trade off; you won't get a noticeable change in revenue

53
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,880
The reason why I say that is that many econ textbooks will tell you that

54
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,960
you don't get a change in revenue, but if you look at the detailed math --

55
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,320
let me write it over here. So the

56
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,490
absolute value of the price elasticity of demand at that point is 1

57
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,200
which tells us that a 1% drop in price

58
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,680
goes along with a 1% increase in quantity

59
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:50,040
but if you look at the math, -- let's call this price 3, and call this quantity 3

60
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:58,560
right over here, so total revenue 3, which is this area right over there

61
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,770
is going to be equal to price 3 times quantity 3

62
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,390
Now if we decrease price by 1%

63
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,220
then this will become 0.99 times our price

64
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:20,660
And if we increase our quantity by 1%, this'll become 1.01 times our quantity

65
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,420
Now, let's think about what this number here is. This is what I'm saying

66
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,750
The total revenue isn't exactly unchanged

67
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:36,620
If you multiply 0.99 times 1.01, you don't get exactly 1

68
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:44,660
Another way to think about it, .99 times 1.01 is going to be 1% less than 1.01

69
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,080
and 1% of 1.01 is slightly larger than 1

70
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,020
Or another way to think about it, this value is going to be 1% larger than .99

71
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,970
and 1% of .99 is less than 1

72
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,060
So it's not gonna get you to 1. You can calculate it

73
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:12,540
.99 times 1.01 is very close to 1. This is going to be equal to 0.9999

74
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:25,760
times P3 Q3, which is 0.9999 times total revenue 3

75
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,030
But it is roughly unchanged. That's the general rule of thumb

76
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,880
So when you're at unit elasticity

77
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:50,900
then a decrease in price roughly says no change in total revenue

78
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,590
So I just want to make sure that this makes sense. It really just comes from these areas

79
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,270
If you're reducing the height less than you're increasing the width

80
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,290
obviously the area is going to increase

81
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,440
or most of the case, I should actually say. That depends on where you are

82
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:12,610
If you're compensating whatever you reduce the height perfectly with the width

83
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,940
then you're not going to have a change in revenue

84
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,800
And if you decrease the height by more

85
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,900
if you're taking more area from the top than you're adding on the width

86
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,140
then you're going to have a total decrease in total revenue
