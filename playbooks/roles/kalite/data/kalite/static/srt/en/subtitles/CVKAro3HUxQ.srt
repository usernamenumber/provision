1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,690
So what do we have here

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,050
We have a triangle,

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,140
and we know that the length of AC is equal to the length of CB,

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,110
so this is an isosceles triangle we have

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,910
Two of its legs are equal to each other

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,660
And then they also tell us that this line up here,

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,310
let me put another label there

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,930
Let me put another label there just for fun

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,120
Let' call this！

10
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,920
listen, you can call this a ray cause it's starting at C

11
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,830
That line or ray CD is parallel to this segment AB over here

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,660
And that's interesting

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,360
Then they give us！ they give us these two angles right over here,

14
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,930
these adjacent angles, they give it to us in terms of x

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,360
And what I wanna do in this video is try to figure out what x is

16
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,350
And so given that they told us that this line

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,760
and this line are parallel,

18
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,650
you could！ we could turn this into a line CD,

19
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,930
so it's not just a ray anymore,

20
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,230
so it just keeps going on and on in both directions

21
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,360
The fact they'd given us a parallel line tells us

22
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,100
that maybe we can use a little！

23
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,550
we know about transversals and parallel lines

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,010
to figure out some of the angles here

25
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,330
And you might recognize,

26
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,980
you might recognize that this right over here, this line

27
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,670
Let me do that in a better color

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,450
You might recognize that line CB

29
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,090
is a transversal for those two parallel lines

30
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,290
Let me draw both of the parallel lines a little bit more,

31
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,450
so that you can recognize that as a transversal

32
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,260
And then a few things might jump out

33
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,290
You have this x+10 right over here,

34
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,010
and its corresponding angle is right down here

35
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,040
This would also be x +10

36
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,520
And if this is x + 10,

37
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,200
then you have a vertical angle right over here

38
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,920
that would also be x + 10

39
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,830
Or you could say that you have alternate interior angles

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,130
that would also be congruent

41
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,160
Either way, these base angles wanna be x+10

42
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,560
Well, it's an isosceles triangle

43
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,750
so you're 2 base angles are going to be congruent

44
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,960
So if this is x+10, then this is going to be x+10 as well

45
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,710
And now we have the 3 angles of a triangle expressed as

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,290
as functions of, expressed in terms of x

47
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,570
So when we take their sum,

48
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,180
then they'd be equal to 180 and then we can actually solve for x

49
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:11,870
We get 2x + x + 10 + x + 10 is going to be equal to 180 degrees

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,160
And then we can add up the x's,

51
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,590
so we have a 2x there, plus an x, plus another x

52
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,910
That gives us 4x 4 x's

53
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,030
And then we have a + 10 and another +10,

54
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,060
so that gives us a +20, is equal to 180

55
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,320
And we can subtract 20 from both sides of that

56
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,140
And we get 4x

57
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,140
4x is equal to 160

58
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,690
Divide both sides by four, and we get x is equal to 40

59
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,860
And we're done!

60
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,900
We figured out what x is

61
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,560
And we can actually figure out what these angles are

62
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,730
This is x+10, then you have 40 + 10

63
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,830
This right over here is going to be a 50 degree angle

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,790
This is 2x, so 2 * 40

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,110
This is an 80 degree angle

66
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,020
It doesn't look like it, the way I've drawn it

67
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,500
And that's why you should never take anything

68
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,400
you should never assume anything based on how a diagram is drawn

69
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,380
So this right over here is going to be an 80 degree angle

70
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,310
And then these 2 base angles right over here are also going to be

71
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,580
are also going to be 50 degrees

72
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,450
So you have 50 degrees, 50 degrees, and 80,

73
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,250
they add up to 180 degrees
