[music playing]

2
00:00:04,478 --> 00:00:07,016
We're at the Cloisters, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

3
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:14,969
and we're looking at a breathtaking series of tapestries that date to about 1500,

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,429
give or take five years on either side.

5
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,649
We're looking specifically at what we think is

6
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:23,136
the last of the series of tapestries,

7
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:25,662
except that we're not even sure of that.

8
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:27,312
-We're sure of very little, except that

9
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:29,430
the tapestries are very popular.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,561
-And gorgeous.

11
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:33,095
-And the unicorn is very popular, and much loved.

12
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:35,886
-So this is the unicorn in captivity.

13
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:38,165
There have been many, many theories

14
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:40,308
about the narrative, about the origin,

15
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:42,639
about the patron, about the source

16
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:47,691
of these tapestries, and we really know almost nothing.

17
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:51,235
-It's one of those things that happens sometimes in art history,

18
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:53,733
where we can find lots of clues,

19
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:56,155
and sometimes the clues don't add up.

20
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:57,687
-We do know we're looking at

21
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:01,787
this extraordinary tall representation of a unicorn,

22
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:06,452
captured in this circular fence that's so low,

23
00:01:06,452 --> 00:01:08,836
we imagine - if we look at it literally -

24
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:10,967
-he could easily hop out.

25
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,686
-He could hop out. But he's chained

26
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:15,062
to a pomegranate tree, and I guess

27
00:01:15,062 --> 00:01:18,098
it's probably worth noting that

28
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:21,866
although the pomegranate tree's fruit is identifiable,

29
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:25,221
the leaves are not what a pomegranate's leaves look like.

30
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:29,887
But, so much of the rest of the surface of the tapestry

31
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:32,862
is taken up by these careful botanical studies,

32
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:35,867
and I think that we've identified nearly everything,

33
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:37,649
in terms of what kinds of plants.

34
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:40,600
-The plant life is completely identifiable,

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,544
in a long tradition of Northern Renaissance painting

36
00:01:44,544 --> 00:01:46,073
and manuscript illumination.

37
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:50,068
Very close attention to actual species of plants -

38
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,120
we see that in Northern Renaissance painting like van Eyck.

39
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,386
-But actually, it's more than that here,

40
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:56,399
because in this set of tapestries,

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,350
the plants that are in the meadows are, in fact,

42
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,421
the plants that one would find in the meadows.

43
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,005
The plants that are by the water

44
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:04,098
would be those that are water loving, et cetera.

45
00:02:04,098 --> 00:02:06,538
The shade plants are in the forest.

46
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:09,167
And so there's a real attention to

47
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,554
that being important information to convey.

48
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:15,003
-But strangely, in this particular one,

49
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:18,705
and in one other from the series,

50
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,607
we're not in a real landscape at all.

51
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:23,849
We have a very flat background . . .

52
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:24,649
-Very abstract.

53
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:28,089
. . . formed by these very real plants.

54
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:30,172
So there's no hills, no landscapes,

55
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:31,566
no architecture in the background.

56
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:33,450
-Well, we are, after all, looking at a unicorn.

57
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,671
-We are! But in the other panels,

58
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:38,501
we do have figures, and castles,

59
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:41,666
and sky, and water, and other animals.

60
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,899
-So perhaps this is the most allegorical of all,

61
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:45,458
and I think there's a lot of attention

62
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,933
that has been paid to this particular tapestry

63
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,488
and what its meanings might be.

64
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:50,919
-Well, it doesn't quite fit, right?

65
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,139
Because the rest of the story tells us

66
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,207
of the successful hunt of a unicorn -

67
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:58,543
-And even the killing of the unicorn.

68
00:02:58,543 --> 00:03:01,972
-Right. And so in this last, maybe last panel,

69
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:04,774
is this the resurrected unicorn?

70
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:06,741
Well, that's certainly one long tradition,

71
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:09,170
that the unicorn is an allegory of Christ.

72
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,942
-Right - a creature who is very pure-

73
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,369
and who can only be caught by a virgin.

74
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,667
-Who is symbolized, of course, as the Virgin Mary.

75
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,964
And so in medieval stories, medieval mythology,

76
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:25,624
the unicorn in a way comes to represent Christ,

77
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:29,474
and the virgin who can capture the unicorn is Mary.

78
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:31,560
-And so we've got that overlay,

79
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,317
but we've got some contradictions here also, right?

80
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:36,468
-We do, because in most of the series,

81
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:37,833
the unicorn is being hunted.

82
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,875
-And persecuted,

83
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:39,867
-And captured.

84
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,709
-But that works, you know, we have the Roman soldiers

85
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,009
persecuting Christ, we have the . . .

86
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:45,176
-Right, there are allegories there, parallels there.

87
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:47,407
. . . we have the hunt here, and so that works.

88
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:49,677
But here, we have the pomegranate tree,

89
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:52,461
which is a traditional symbol of fertility.

90
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:53,776
-And marriage.

91
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:56,274
-The idea of the golden chain, often representing marriage.

92
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:59,243
-You know, maybe the unicorn is the betrothed.

93
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:02,577
-So, is there a kind of eliding of symbol here?

94
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,924
Is there a kind of overlay of narratives?

95
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:07,921
-It seems like there are two traditions coming together.

96
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:10,974
A tradition where the unicorn is Christ,

97
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:14,507
and this is interpreted in a very Christian context,

98
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:16,390
and then a very secular context

99
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,522
of the unicorn as the beloved,

100
00:04:18,522 --> 00:04:21,639
who is happy to be captured.

101
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,370
So, it's sort of one of those things where it's got so much meaning,

102
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,398
and it may be that it's a twenty-first century search for "the meaning,"

103
00:04:29,398 --> 00:04:31,760
but maybe it never had one meaning.

104
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,878
Maybe its meaning was always multifarious.

105
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:35,895
-And perhaps open. I think that that's right.

106
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:38,629
Of course, it would help enormously if we knew the occasion,

107
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,392
and the patrons for which this was made.

108
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:42,081
-Perhaps a wedding. Who knows?

109
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,199
-There is an A, and there's a backward E

110
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,042
in each of the panels, each of the tapestries.

111
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:51,641
There's been much scholarly disagreement as to who those are for.

112
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,621
The tapestries themselves are gloriously rich,

113
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:55,344
brightly colored; and in fact,

114
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:58,310
in a recent restoration, the backing was taken off,

115
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,331
and much of the richness of the color

116
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,940
was photographed, and it's really breathtaking.

117
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,475
Even the front of the tapestries are just glorious.

118
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:06,230
-And of course, tapestries would have been hung

119
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,993
in a room that was dark, like this one that we're in,

120
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:13,710
and would've served as a way of insulating the room

121
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,623
and keeping the warmth in.

122
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,776
-Yes, they were quite practical.

123
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:18,476
-But it's important to go up and look closely,

124
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:20,862
because when you look at the flowers and the animals

125
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,180
and really try to decode the narrative,

126
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,081
there's a real richness that unfolds that is . . .

127
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,992
-Just the sensuality of the surface!

128
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:30,566
I think that that's absolutely right.

129
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,581
And this is not only dyed wool, but it's also silk.

130
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:35,381
And I think it's interesting,

131
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,530
this idea of this creature that's imaginary,

132
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,731
that's pure, that can't be caught, you know,

133
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:43,275
we can't see it, we can't find it . . .

134
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:47,816
-And maybe even our modern understanding.
