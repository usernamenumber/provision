00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,470
Problem 51. Actually,let me scroll all the way up,problem 51.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,680
They drew a little triangle here,which I assume I need,

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,970
so I'll draw it as well.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:17,150
That side is flat and that side goes down like that,

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,940
and then they draw some angles.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:27,320
This is being angle x,this is angle y,this is angle z.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,200
And they say,what is the value of z in the triangle above?

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:41,520
Fair enough.Statement number one is x plus y is equal to 139.

9
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,930
Well,as soon as you see a triangle and you have to

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,450
figure out one side,you should always remember that

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,670
the sum of the angles of a triangle add up to 180.

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:54,020
So we know that x plus y plus z is equal to 180.

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,170
Statement one just told us that x plus y is equal to 139.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,450
So we know from statement one that this is 139.

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,190
So that would just make this equation 139 plus z

16
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,220
is equal to 180. Which is very easy to solve.

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,350
Subtract 139 from both sides which you get z is equal to 41

18
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,210
or something like that.

19
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,980
It doesn'nt matter,you don't have to get the answer.

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,590
You just have to know that you can get the answer.

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,080
So statement one,alone,is enough.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,960
Now what do they give us in statement number two?

23
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,430
Statement two,y plus z is equal to 108.

24
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,250
This statement alone is useless. We don't know what y is.

25
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,940
So we can't figure it out.

26
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,010
I mean,one thing is true,if you had both of these statements,

27
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,100
then you can figure out all of the angles of the triangle.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,080
Because you know that z is 41 then you could figure out y,

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,150
then once you know y you could figure out x.

30
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,820
But they're not asking us that.

31
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,850
We need to figure out what angle z is.

32
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,460
And this statement alone would not tell us what angle z is

33
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,860
because we don't know what angle y is.

34
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,700
But statement one alone works. So the answer is A.

35
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,850
Next problem. Turn the page. 52.

36
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:18,770
If x y and z are non-0-- they could have written x times y

37
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,390
times z does not equal 0 because that's the same thing.

38
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,370
Because if any of them were 0,it would have been equal 0.

39
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,450
So I could have written xyz does not equal 0.

40
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,340
Because if you multiply three non-0 numbers

41
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,760
it's not going to equal zero.

42
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,220
But anyway,they're asking is xz equal to 12?

43
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,970
xz equal to 12 is the question. Statement one tells us--

44
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,190
and I'll do it in a different color--

45
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,990
Statement one tells us that x squared times yz

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,470
is equal to 12xy. So let's see what we can do.

47
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,850
What if we were to divide both sides of this equation by xy?

48
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,320
Well,let's divide both sides by x first.

49
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,020
So if you divide both sides by x,

50
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,860
and we can do that because we know that x does not equal 0.

51
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,060
so then you get--

52
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:20,310
If Divide both sides by x,you get xyz is equal to 12y,right?

53
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,680
Divided by x on both sides. Now let's divide both sides by y.

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,700
You get xz is equal to 12. And we're done.

55
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,110
Statement alone is enough.

56
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,940
And remember,the only reason why we we're able to divide

57
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,730
both sides by y is because we knew it didn't equal 0.

58
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,070
Now what does statement two tell us?

59
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:45,740
Statement two tells us that z/4 is equal to 3/x.

60
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,540
And here we can cross multiply,

61
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,300
x times z is equal to 3 times 4.

62
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,830
And if that didn't make sense to you,

63
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,950
you could do it one step at a time.

64
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:58,820
Multiply both sides by 4,you get z is equal to 12/x,

65
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,330
just multiplied both sides by 4.

66
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,810
Then multiply both sides by x and you get xz is equal to 12.

67
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,660
So each statement,independently,

68
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,170
is enough to solve the equation. So that's D.

69
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,000
I always have to keep looking back and looking at

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,610
which letter I have to say. I should memorize that.

71
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,730
You should at least,you have to take the GMAT. Alright,53.

72
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,010
A certain company currently has how many employees?

73
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,150
So we want to know the number of emps. How many employees.OK.

74
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,950
So statement number one: if 3 additional employees are hired

75
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,170
by the company and all of the present employees remain,

76
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,380
there will be at least 20 employees in the company.

77
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:56,860
So let's say e is the number of employees today. So e plus 3.

78
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,720
So the current number of employees and three additional

79
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,600
are hired and all of them remain.

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,470
There will be at least 20 employees in the company.

81
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,390
So it at least tells us greater than or equal to 20 employees

82
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,160
That's what statement one is.

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,880
And that by itself doesn't tell me how many employees are

84
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,530
at the company.

85
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,660
It tells us that there at least 17 employees at the company

86
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,260
but it doesn't tell us anything else.

87
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,000
I mean you can subtract 3 from both sides and you say e is

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,350
greater than or equal to 17.But e could be 100. I don't know.

89
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:31,610
OK. Statement two: if no additional employees are hired

90
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,260
by the company and 3 at the present employees resign--

91
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:42,340
so e minus 3-- there will be fewer than 15 employees

92
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:50,010
at the company.So fewer than 15 employees.So not 15 or lower.

93
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:55,340
They say fewer than 15,so less than 15.

94
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,650
Right here they said at least 20,so that's greater than 20,

95
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,950
greater than or equal to.

96
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,680
Here they said fewer than,they didn't say 15 or fewer,

97
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,960
they said fewer than 15.

98
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,270
So if you simplify this you get-- add 3 to both sides--

99
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:14,810
you say e is less than 18. So,let me ask you a question.

100
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,180
First of all this by itself isn't helpful because this

101
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,170
just tells us we could only 5 employees at the company

102
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,150
or we could have 10. This doesn't tell us by itself.

103
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,780
But if we use both of these in conjunction,

104
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,950
you if we know that e is less than--

105
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,690
so if we say 17 is less than or equal to e.

106
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,840
I just wrote this in a different order.

107
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,820
Alright,17 is less than or equal to e,which is less 18--

108
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,540
I'm using both statements-- what is e?

109
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,130
It has to be greater than or equal the 17,

110
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,610
so it could be 17. Can it be 18?

111
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,970
Well,no,because it has to be less than 18. So e has to be 17.

112
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,590
So both statements together are needed to solve this problem.

113
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:01,880
And that is C. Both statements,together,are sufficient.

114
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,810
Next problem.

115
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:15,650
54. Let me erase this little 5 I drew here. 54.

116
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:25,600
Alright,what is the value of n in the equation minus 25

117
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:32,990
plus 19 plus n is equal to s?

118
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,610
Well,just to simplify it,we could add up minus 25 plus 19,

119
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:47,090
you get minus 6? So you get n minus 6 is equal to s,right?

120
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,890
That's right. Actually,you don't have to do this.

121
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,140
Remember the whole point of this is to figure out

122
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,080
whether you can solve the problem.

123
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,950
You don't always have to solve it but I'm solving them here

124
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,410
just to prove it to you.

125
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,370
To give you the intuition of when you can solve it.

126
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,730
So if you add 6 to both sides.

127
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,680
So anyway,this was just a simplification.

128
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,330
Let's read the statements. I haven't read them yet.

129
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,710
Maybe I didn't have to do any of that.

130
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,650
Alright,what problem was I-- 54. OK.s is equal to 2.

131
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,700
Well,clearly,if we know that s is equal to 2,

132
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
we can solve for n.n would be equal to 8.

133
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,550
This statement alone is sufficient.

134
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:23,460
Now statement number two tells us n/s is equal to 4,

135
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,800
and once again,as long as we have some relation with n and s

136
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,240
and we can solve for s and then substitute back in,

137
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,330
we can solve for n. And to prove it,let me do it.

138
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:42,050
We have n is equal to 4s,and if we know that n is equal to 4s

139
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,740
what are we doing? We're trying to solve for n.

140
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,920
We could write s is equal to n divided by 4.

141
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,700
And then you can substitute back into that equation.

142
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,630
So then you would get n is equal to s,

143
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,770
which is n/4 plus 6. And then you could just solve for n.

144
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,620
And if you want to do it,let's see,multiply both sides by 4,

145
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,900
you get 4n is equal to n plus 24.

146
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,350
That's an equal sign not a notequal.

147
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,420
I just multiplied both sides by 4. 4n is equal to n plus 24.

148
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,930
Subtract n from both sides,you get 3n is equal to 24

149
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,100
and then you get n is equal to 8 again.

150
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,590
So each statement alone is sufficient.

151
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,340
And that is-- I should really memorize this-- that's D.

152
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,740
