1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,550
We're asked to multiply
65 times 1.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,574
So literally, we just need to multiply 65,

3
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:14,026
and we could write it as a times sign like
that or we could write it as a dot like that

4
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:16,963
but this means 65 times 1.

5
00:00:16,963 --> 00:00:19,080
And there's two ways
to interpret this.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,420
You could view this as the
number 65 one time

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,516
or you could view this as the number 1
sixty-five times, all added up.

8
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:34,127
But either way, if you have one
65, this is literally just going to be 65.

9
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:37,902
Anything times 1 is going
to be that anything,

10
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:39,290
whatever this is.

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,087
Whatever this is times 1 is going
to be that same thing again.

12
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:52,270
If I have just some kind of
placeholder here times 1,

13
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,414
that's going to be that same placeholder.

14
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:04,810
So if I have 3 times 1,
I'm going to get 3.

15
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,630
If I have 5 times 1,
I'm going to get 5,

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,940
because literally, all this is
saying is 5 one time.

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:21,160
If I put-- I don't know-- 157
times 1, that'll be 157.

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,160
I think you get the idea.
