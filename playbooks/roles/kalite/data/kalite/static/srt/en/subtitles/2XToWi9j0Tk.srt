let's say we're playing monopoly with two six sided dice and I say what is the probability that I will get

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:15,650
a 7? when I add up the two rolls of the dice so I drew this grid here:and this grid esentially represents

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:23,591
all the outcomes I can get with the two dice where on the top row that is the outcomeI can get on dice

4
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:27,446
one: I can get a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6 and similarlyfor dice two these are all of the outcomes
