1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,142
Hey I'm Beth Harris, I'm Shana Lindsay

2
00:00:03,142 --> 00:00:05,809
We're going to talk about this very odd

3
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:08,326
and disturbing photograph

4
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:10,560
This is a photograph by Diane Arbus

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,043
It say New York City photographer at dates 1962

6
00:00:16,043 --> 00:00:19,543
and it's called Child with a toy grenade, New York City

7
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:21,924
It's incredibly disturbing

8
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:24,058
He's got a grenade in his hand

9
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:27,059
that's upsetting, It's look like there's

10
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:28,910
something wrong with him.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,092
And selecting her photograph, she's always

12
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:34,309
brought something that seems and more handy

13
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:36,710
identify with and other hand seems

14
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,274
very awkward to you, it's very different

15
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,825
You may say disturbing

16
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:44,875
You don't find this disturbing? I do although

17
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,324
having children, and particulary boys,

18
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:50,791
sometimes they do make faces like this

19
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:54,390
You know just in their imagination, they play

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,758
They does, this is almost something like you

21
00:00:56,758 --> 00:01:00,723
has to wonder something medically wrong with him

22
00:01:00,723 --> 00:01:02,640
almost in this photograph, more than

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,758
he's just playing.

24
00:01:03,758 --> 00:01:05,642
All right, he's neck is incredibly tense.

25
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:07,523
That's interesting is that she her training

26
00:01:07,523 --> 00:01:10,374
as photograph she was an assistant with her husband

27
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:14,108
they had a homebased studio

28
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,473
where they which shoot fashion photos

29
00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:20,357
so this type of you know

30
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:22,773
a straining little body is something that she

31
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:25,756
would never ever choose at her commercial work

32
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:28,874
It have everything to be very graceful, smooth

33
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:34,140
and say she wants us * this number

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,857
and so she asked this boy to pose?

35
00:01:37,857 --> 00:01:40,022
She can cross him in the park and ask him to pose?

36
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:43,873
Yes, she was apparently just walking through the park

37
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:45,822
looking for something for shoot and she

38
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:51,022
find a boy and so * as you can see from this contact

39
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:54,672
sheet here, she's move him around to several different

40
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:57,639
locations and here he's standing next to

41
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:02,655
very-- He's rather ordinary in most others photographs--

42
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,138
right standing in some gallantly here

43
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:10,172
you know on a pass than she moves him to

44
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,372
this area where you see the tree in the background

45
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:14,605
which is ultimately that same, you know

46
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:16,755
area that final print was made from.

47
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:20,354
And I think she likes that (deepling) of the sunlight

48
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:23,104
You know, we can see light slightly coming from

49
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,722
behind, ultimately this is the shoot that

50
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:32,790
she choose as his, go back.

51
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,021
He's standing so there's continuation of the

52
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:43,587
tree, one tree with this suspender down the legs

53
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:47,788
This is slightly * access and there also

54
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:50,206
that parring of trees matches with parring of

55
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:56,570
two legs, you know-- one suspender falling down

56
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,704
and looping to the right just like this

57
00:02:58,704 --> 00:03:00,519
little branch coming out of the top

58
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,319
of the other tree to the right

59
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,420
and * hands doing the same things

60
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,170
so there's all the symmetry and * symmetry

61
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,820
at that same time, there's pattern of course

62
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,519
in his shirt that in some way that flats

63
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,320
that light *

64
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,470
and he almost seems like all of these

65
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,637
he's * focal point of this *

66
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:25,037
seems to emerge from him

67
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:28,385
He's almost like halo of light or (dappling) around him

68
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:31,518
absolutely and since the light is coming

69
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:34,752
from slightly behind him It's almost like

70
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:36,468
light being projected toward us

71
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:39,686
*

72
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,968
like they checker floor of renaissance

73
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:47,268
right, did she take this to ordinary lens

74
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,918
She, yeah the type of camera she uses is

75
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:55,419
* flex and is has view finder

76
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:58,135
that's allow her to see the image

77
00:03:58,135 --> 00:04:00,153
that is usally hanging around her waist, to the

78
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:02,818
camera so she looks down into the camera

79
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,835
and there's another one that

80
00:04:04,835 --> 99:59:59,999
is actually use to shoot.
