1
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:07,902
We're looking at the Bishop Bernward doors

2
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:10,180
that date from about 1015.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,382
We know that Bishop Bernard went

4
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:14,584
on a pilgrimage to Rome,

5
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:16,788
and then returned back to Hildesheim

6
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:18,398
and wanted to recreate some

7
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:20,800
of the monumental art that he saw.

8
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:21,619
And specifically when he was in Rome,

9
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:24,832
he saw the monumental wooden doors at Santa Sabina

10
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,070
that have scenes from the Old and New Testament

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:27,965
carved into them.

12
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:30,118
And he felt like he needed his own doors.

13
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,548
We read these starting in the upper left hand corner,

14
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:35,926
in which you have the creation

15
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:37,558
of Eve from the side of Adam.

16
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:39,285
And then, below that,

17
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:41,120
is the presentation of Eve to Adam.

18
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:42,741
Then the Temptation.

19
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:45,977
Below that is then the accusation of Adam and Eve.

20
00:00:45,977 --> 00:00:48,575
And then below that the Expulsion.

21
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:52,036
The panel below that, interrupted by the door handles,

22
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:54,865
and we see Adam working the land on the left –

23
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:57,211
Eve nursing on the right.

24
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:59,786
And a fun fact about Eve's nursing is that this is one of

25
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:02,701
maybe only twenty images of Eve nursing.

26
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:07,160
Below that we have Cain and Abel and their sacrifices

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,201
or presentation to the Lord.

28
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:11,657
Below that the final panel

29
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:14,113
is the murder of Abel by Cain.

30
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:16,569
And then instead of going back to the top on the right

31
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:17,953
it starts at the bottom, where we have the Enunciation

32
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,991
with Mary and the Angel.

33
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:23,738
Then the Nativity – that's the birth of Jesus.

34
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:26,153
And then the scene is interrupted by the

35
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,658
door handle here, is the adoration of the Magi.

36
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:30,435
We have the three Magi on the right

37
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:32,363
approaching Mary and Jesus on the left.

38
00:01:32,363 --> 00:01:34,733
Above that we have the Presentation in the Temple.

39
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:37,938
Above that we've got Christ being presented

40
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:40,816
to either Herod or Pilate before his crucifixion.

41
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:43,815
Above that we've got the crucifixion of Christ.

42
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:46,229
About that we have the Marys at the tomb,

43
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,706
which was the standard scene showing

44
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:50,397
the resurrection in the early Middle Ages.

45
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:52,415
And then at the very top we have

46
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:54,433
what's called the "Noli me tangere" [Touch me not]

47
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:56,452
Mary Magdalene sees Jesus in the garden

48
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:57,895
and he says, "Don't touch me."

49
00:01:57,895 --> 00:02:01,199
And so we have our scenes from early Genesis,

50
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:03,697
and then scenes from the Gospels.

51
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:05,330
Now one of the really interesting things

52
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,963
that happens here, is that we have

53
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:08,596
all the scenes lined up next to each other.

54
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:11,431
There are some visual and also some thematic patterns

55
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,063
that happen left to right.

56
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:15,626
And the one that I think is a really good example –

57
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:17,577
in the third panel from the top,

58
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:19,528
we've got the Temptation.

59
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:21,481
Adam and Eve are about to eat the fruit.

60
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:24,033
And then on the right, the Crucifixion.

61
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,929
And if we look at the tree that holds the fruit

62
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:28,396
in the Adam and Eve scene-

63
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:30,973
it's very much a cruciform shaped tree –

64
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:33,041
just as we have Christ on the cross

65
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,145
in the center of the other image.

66
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:37,538
And then we have Adam and Eve on either side –

67
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:39,956
just as we have the tormentors on either side.

68
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:42,618
And then on he far edges of the Adam-and-Eve scene,

69
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:45,248
we've got trees and then we have Mary and John

70
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,871
in the crucifixion scene.

71
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:49,623
So there's a similarity of composition.

72
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:51,630
And what I think that does is bring out

73
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,712
the thematic connection of

74
00:02:53,712 --> 00:02:57,369
"In Adam all men die. In Christ, all men are made alive."

75
00:02:57,369 --> 00:03:00,087
Which is a really important idea for Christianity –

76
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:02,081
and especially for Christianity in the Middle Ages.

77
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,172
Absolutely. This is a very long, old tradition

78
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:06,263
in Christianity –

79
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:08,355
to compare Christ as the new Adam-

80
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,203
and then Mary as the new Eve.

81
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:13,364
And you have traditions that the cross was made

82
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:15,935
from the wood of the tree in the garden.

83
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:18,061
So this is an Ottonian work of art.

84
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:20,602
And Ottonians were kind of hangers-on

85
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:22,716
to the Carolingian Renaissance.

86
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:24,771
They saw themselves as being inheritors

87
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,484
of the Carolingian Empire.

88
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:29,524
In my mind, they're not so much looking back

89
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:32,279
so diligently to the classical models.

90
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,939
But there is definitely the flavor

91
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:37,812
of some of that Carolingian Renaissance here.

92
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:40,017
These are cast in solid bronze.

93
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:41,271
And it's very much thought that

94
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:44,853
the lost wax method was used here –

95
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:48,207
that Bishop Bernward had his artists recreate

96
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,531
or rediscover the lost-wax method,

97
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,043
so that these doors could be cast in two single pieces,

98
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:56,482
as opposed to being hammered from the inside

99
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:58,921
with the 'reposé'

100
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:01,360
And that is very much in keeping with that Carolingian

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,672
and the inherited idea of looking back

102
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:05,984
to classical and ancient models

103
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:08,298
and reclaiming them and reviving them.

104
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:09,467
Right. So we have the ancient method

105
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:12,377
used here in the Ottonian Period.
