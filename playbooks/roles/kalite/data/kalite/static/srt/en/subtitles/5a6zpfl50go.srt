1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,530
Let's say I have the equation
y is equal to x plus 3.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,570
And I want to graph all of the
sets, all of the coordinates x

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,750
comma y that satisfy this
equation right there.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,000
And we've done this
many times before.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we draw our axis, our axes.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,250
That's my y-axis.

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,630
   

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,620
This is my x-axis.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,470
   

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,070
And this is already in
mx plus b form, or

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,540
slope-intercept form.

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,840
The y-intercept here is y
is equal to 3, and the

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,690
slope here is 1.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,840
So this line is going
to look like this.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,910
We intersect at 0 comma
3-- 1, 2, 3.

17
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,190
At 0 comma 3.

18
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,890
And we have a slope of 1,
so every 1 we go to the

19
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,070
right, we go up 1.

20
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,870
So the line will look
something like that.

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,610
   

22
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,760
It's a good enough
approximation.

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,770
So the line will
look like this.

24
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,380
And remember, when I'm drawing
a line, every point on this

25
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,280
line is a solution
to this equation.

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,210
Or it represents a pair
of x and y that

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,100
satisfy this equation.

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:22,300
So maybe when you take x is
equal to 5, you go to the

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,010
line, and you're going to see,
gee, when x is equal to 5 on

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,160
that line, y is equal
to 8 is a solution.

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,370
And it's going to
sit on the line.

32
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,550
So this represents the solution
set to this equation,

33
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,820
all of the coordinates
that satisfy y is

34
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,660
equal to x plus 3.

35
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,000
Now let's say we have
another equation.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,040
Let's say we have an equation
y is equal to

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,210
negative x plus 3.

38
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,540
And we want to graph all of the
x and y pairs that satisfy

39
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,130
this equation.

40
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,630
Well, we can do the
same thing.

41
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,340
This has a y-intercept also
at 3, right there.

42
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,250
But its slope is negative 1.

43
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,810
So it's going to look
something like this.

44
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,210
   

45
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,505
Every time you move to the
right 1, you're going

46
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:05,870
to move down 1.

47
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,980
Or if you move to the right a
bunch, you're going to move

48
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,020
down that same bunch.

49
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,720
So that's what this equation
will look like.

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,860
Every point on this line
represents a x and y pair that

51
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,070
will satisfy this equation.

52
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,770
Now, what if I were to ask you,
is there an x and y pair

53
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,740
that satisfies both of
these equations?

54
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,280
Is there a point or coordinate
that satisfies both equations?

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,420
Well, think about it.

56
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,850
Everything that satisfies this
first equation is on this

57
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,500
green line right here, and
everything that satisfies this

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,460
purple equation is on the
purple line right there.

59
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,520
So what satisfies both?

60
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,210
Well, if there's a point that's
on both lines, or

61
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,190
essentially, a point of
intersection of the lines.

62
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,150
So in this situation, this
point is on both lines.

63
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,570
And that's actually
the y-intercept.

64
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,660
So the point 0, 3 is on
both of these lines.

65
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,090
So that coordinate pair, or that
x, y pair, must satisfy

66
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,020
both equations.

67
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,880
And you can try it out.

68
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,890
When x is 0 here, 0 plus
3 is equal to 3.

69
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,610
When x is 0 here, 0 plus
3 is equal to 3.

70
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,880
It satisfies both of
these equations.

71
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,500
So what we just did, in a
graphical way, is solve a

72
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,786
system of equations.

73
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:26,080
   

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,330
Let me write that down.

75
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,330
   

76
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,550
And all that means is we
have several equations.

77
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,650
Each of them constrain
our x's and y's.

78
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,790
So in this case, the first one
is y is equal to x plus 3, and

79
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:48,140
then the second one is y is
equal to negative x plus 3.

80
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,950
This constrained it to a line
in the xy plane, this

81
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,810
constrained our solution
set to another

82
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,510
line in the xy plane.

83
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,600
And if we want to know the x's
and y's that satisfy both of

84
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,620
these, it's going to be the
intersection of those lines.

85
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,070
So one way to solve these
systems of equations is to

86
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,270
graph both lines, both
equations, and then look at

87
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,420
their intersection.

88
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,690
And that will be the solution
to both of these equations.

89
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,460
In the next few videos, we're
going to see other ways to

90
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,850
solve it, that are maybe more

91
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,430
mathematical and less graphical.

92
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,730
But I really want you to
understand the graphical

93
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,310
nature of solving systems
of equations.

94
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,560
Let's do another one.

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,980
   

96
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:36,270
Let's say we have y is
equal to 3x minus 6.

97
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,620
That's one of our equations.

98
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,410
And let's say the other equation
is y is equal to

99
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,860
negative x plus 6.

100
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,220
And just like the last video,
let's graph both of these.

101
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,360
   

102
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,740
I'll try to do it as
precisely as I can.

103
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,950
   

104
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,530
There you go.

105
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,260
Let me draw some.

106
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,680
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

107
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,710
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

108
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,410
And then 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

109
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,790
I should have just copied and
pasted some graph paper here,

110
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,470
but I think this'll
do the job.

111
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,580
So let's graph this purple
equation here.

112
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,380
Y-intercept is negative 6, so
we have-- let me do another

113
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,660
[? slash-- ?]

114
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,380
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

115
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,670
So that's y is equal
to negative 6.

116
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,150
And then the slope is 3.

117
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,510
So every time you move
1, you go up 3.

118
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,370
You moved to the right 1,
your run is 1, your

119
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,830
rise is 1, 2, 3.

120
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,580
That's 3, right?

121
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,120
1, 2, 3.

122
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,640
So the equation, the line
will look like this.

123
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,960
And it looks like I intersect
at the point 2

124
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,080
comma 0, which is right.

125
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,270
3 times 2 is 6, minus 6 is 0.

126
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,830
So our line will look something

127
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,700
like that right there.

128
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,560
That's that line there.

129
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,770
What about this line?

130
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,700
Our y-intercept is plus 6.

131
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,850
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

132
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,620
And our slope is negative 1.

133
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,630
So every time we go 1 to the
right, we go down 1.

134
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:26,500
   

135
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:33,240
And so this will intersect at--
well, when y is equal to

136
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,100
0, x is equal to 6.

137
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,280
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

138
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,880
So right over there.

139
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,620
So this line will
look like that.

140
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,300
The graph, I want to get it
as exact as possible.

141
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,730
And so we're going to ask
ourselves the same question.

142
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,440
What is an x, y pair
that satisfies

143
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,500
both of these equations?

144
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,470
Well, you look at it here, it's
going to be this point.

145
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,785
This point lies on both lines.

146
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:04,560
And let's see if we can figure
out what that point is.

147
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,060
Just eyeballing the graph here,
it looks like we're at

148
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,370
1, 2, 3 comma 1, 2, 3.

149
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,810
It looks like this is the same
point right there, that this

150
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,820
is the point 3 comma 3.

151
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,370
I'm doing it just on inspecting
my hand-drawn

152
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,080
graphs, so maybe it's
not the exact--

153
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,250
let's check this answer.

154
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,260
Let's see if x is equal to
3, y equals 3 definitely

155
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,630
satisfies both these
equations.

156
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,790
So if we check it into the first
equation, you get 3 is

157
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,740
equal to 3 times 3, minus 6.

158
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,030
This is 9 minus 6, which
is indeed 3.

159
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,350
So 3 comma 3 satisfies
the top equation.

160
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,120
And let's see if it satisfies
the bottom equation.

161
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,800
You get 3 is equal to negative
3 plus 6, and negative 3 plus

162
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,740
6 is indeed 3.

163
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,487
So even with our hand-drawn
graph, we were able to inspect

164
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:57,420
it and see that, yes, we were
able to come up with the point

165
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,370
3 comma 3, and that
does satisfy

166
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,450
both of these equations.

167
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,810
So we were able to solve this
system of equations.

168
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,160
When we say system of equations,
we just mean many

169
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,510
equations that have
many unknowns.

170
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,060
They don't have to be, but they
tend to have more than

171
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,610
one unknown.

172
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,310
And you use each equation as a
constraint on your variables,

173
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,860
and you try to find the
intersection of the equations

174
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,300
to find a solution
to all of them.

175
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,420
In the next few videos, we'll
see more algebraic ways of

176
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,300
solving these than drawing their
two graphs and trying to

177
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,910
find their intersection
points.

178
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:29,933
