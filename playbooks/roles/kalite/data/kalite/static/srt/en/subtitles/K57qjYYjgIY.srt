1
00:00:02,467 --> 00:00:07,434
So what you're looking at is basically kind of a mechanistic way of thinking about the heart.

2
00:00:07,434 --> 00:00:13,272
Almost it´s a couple of pumps with pipes attached to the pumps.

3
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:15,934
And in the way, that´s not a bad way to think about the heart.

4
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:18,516
In fact we're gonna kind of move through this diagram.

5
00:00:18,516 --> 00:00:24,900
I realize that it looks little bit scary. But, once I start labeling these stuff you'll start to see that it is actually not as bad as it seems.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,070
So let´s get started in the upper part of the heart.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,439
The Right atrium, It's right there.

8
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,502
And the blood goes down into the right ventricle.

9
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:38,569
And then, on the other side I´m going to label the last two chambers. The left atrium and the left ventricle.

10
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:43,271
We're gonna actually follow the path of blood after it leaves the right ventricle.

11
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:46,679
We're gonna start our journey here at the right ventricle.

12
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,118
So what´s the first thing that kind of comes across?

13
00:00:49,118 --> 00:00:56,482
Well, blood leaves the right ventricle, goes through a valve and after, on the other side you´ve got, this area right here.

14
00:00:56,482 --> 00:01:03,674
And I've drawn it as one tube with no split and this is the pulmonary trunk. Pulmonary trunk.

15
00:01:03,674 --> 00:01:15,206
So blood is headed towards the lungs, going first through the trunk, and of course after the trunk, there is left and right --I write that up here-- pulmonary arteries are next.

16
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:18,038
And remember I call them arteries, because they´re going away from the heart.

17
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:24,561
And there are two arteries, so pulmonary arteries left and right pulmonary arteries.

18
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:31,941
And that´s why you see two things here, one here and you see one here and those are basically tubes.

19
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:39,569
So it´s going from the pulmonary trunk, it´s splitting into one of the two tubes and I´m drawing the left and right lung up top.

20
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:44,475
Of course you know that the lungs are actually not gonna look this way, so this is not anatomically correct.

21
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:47,967
But this is not --as I said in the beginning-- bad way of thinking about it.

22
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:54,980
So blood goes through the lungs and then comes out on the other side and there, we're gonna talked about the left and right pulmonary veins.

23
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:03,003
And actually here I´m gonna make the point that there aren´t just two pulmonary veins, one for each lung.

24
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,601
Actually they're usually more than that.

25
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:11,167
And so when I draw these two, I really wnat you to just think of the two sides, veins coming from both sides.

26
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:14,236
But the actual number could be a few pulmonary veins in total.

27
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:19,069
The pulmonary veins drain blood and into the left atrium, right.

28
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:22,390
So now we are on the other side of the heart.

29
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:31,769
And for the moment I´m gonna kind of pause the journey here. So we´ve gone from the right ventricle around to the lungs, back again into the left atrium.

30
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:34,479
And this is kind of the first part of our journey.

31
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,568
And this part of the journey is called the pulmonary circulation.

32
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:42,170
I´m actually just gonna write that here - Pulmonary circulation.

33
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:51,638
So the fact that this part starting from the heart and going back to the heart is one circuit.

34
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,070
And our heart actually has two circuits.

35
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,540
But I wanna point out these circuits one at a time.

36
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,116
We´ve already kind of completed one circuit.

37
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:06,271
So I´m gonna just take some blue paint to indicate deoxygenated blood or blood without oxygen,

38
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:09,004
I´m gonna paint in how it look.

39
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:18,835
--And actually it stop there because of my arrows, but you can actually see now-- deoxygenated blood kind of goes from the right ventricle, through the pulmonary trunk, through the arteries and into the left and right lung.

40
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:27,480
And once it´s there it´s gonna be kind of mixed in with the capillaries and it´s gonna start getting oxygen.

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,501
And then it´s gonna come out on the other side, in the pulmonary veins.

42
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:40,236
--And It´s again stopped a little bit there, but I can fill it in-- and the pulmonary veins are gonna deliver that oxygenated blood to the left atrium.

43
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:44,319
So what you see kind of colored in now, is the pulmonary circulation.

44
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,649
That´s the first part of our circuit.

45
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:54,062
Let´s now keep going and talk about the second part of the circulatory system, which is the systemic circulation.

46
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:58,235
So now the journey starts with the left ventricle. Let me start there.

47
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:04,736
For the systemic circulation, I´m gonna start in the left ventricle and it´s gonna go round to the body.

48
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,150
Right, the body is kind of the thing that's gonna be receiveing all the blood.

49
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,403
And when I said body, I really mean lots of things.

50
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:25,791
I mean things like the brain. So it coud be an organ, like the brain, the liver. Or it can also be maybe things like bones and your fingers, could be the toes, could be any part of your body that you can think of.

51
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:32,345
All these different organs and tissues are gonna be getting blood from the left ventricle.

52
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:36,836
It´s gonna be going initially through a giant vessel.

53
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:42,670
This vessel I´m gonna label --let's say here, as the Aorta.

54
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:49,103
So this large vessel, the Aorta. And of course it branches and splits and I haven't shown all the branches that come off the Aorta.

55
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:50,536
But there are many, many of them.

56
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:54,390
It goes to the various tissues and organs and then it comes back on the other side.

57
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:00,982
And at the end, kind of somewhere up here, it´s gonna go back to the right atrium.

58
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:06,061
And it generally travels through two major kind of vessels.

59
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:15,604
One is the Inferior and the other is the Superior, meaning lower and upper, and they both are called Vena Cava.

60
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:19,607
So Superior Vena Cava and Inferior Vena Cava. I just write that here.

61
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:26,971
So these are the two major veins that bring you back blood from the all the different parts of the body.

62
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:31,004
So now you´ve actually seen the second circulation, because it all ends up in the right atrium.

63
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:34,237
And this is the systemic circulation. I´m going to write [systemic circulation] here.

64
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:41,967
So now you can see that the heart is really two different system --err-- let´say two different circuit, rather.

65
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:49,669
And the first one, the pulmonary circulation, is really kind of relying on the right vetricle as the pump.

66
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:53,309
And the second one is relying on the left ventricle as the pump.

67
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:56,503
And actually I can --now you see, I can now color it in.

68
00:05:56,503 --> 00:06:06,510
It would kind of deliver all the blood to the various organs, then the organs would use up the oxygene, so let me show it kind of now going back to blue.

69
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:12,981
That´s to indicate deoxygenated blood and it goes back to the right atrium as deoxygenated blood.

70
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:18,508
So this is kind of how we sometimes see it and again this doesn't show you or give you an appreciation for the anatomy exactly,

71
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:23,310
you know, where things branch off and where the different names make sense,

72
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,314
but you got kind of overall feel for the fact that we have two different circulations

73
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:31,367
and you can see where the blood is going for the two different circuits.

74
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:37,737
Now when you look at this picture you could say, well, okay, I guess you can see all the different tissues are getting the blood,

75
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:41,770
basically sounds like everything is coming from the oxygenated blood,

76
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,948
coming out of the left ventricle.

77
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:49,058
But, some tissues always kind of trick people out --err-- it's kind of a sparkle question.

78
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:54,885
I´m just gonna kind of try to target a couple of the tissues that I think people sometimes might have questions about.

79
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:59,815
And one of them, I woudn´t really call it tissue, but you can definitely call it cell type.

80
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:04,168
It´s the RBC, and RBC just stands for red blood cell.

81
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:08,702
So people sometimes wonder, you know, if the red blood cells are carrying oxygen to other parts of the body.

82
00:07:08,702 --> 00:07:11,901
Then how do they themselves get oxygen?

83
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:17,704
You know, do they just kind of use up some of the oxygen they´re carrying, or what exactly?

84
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:26,669
And to answer this question, I would have to remind you that the red blood cell basically looks a little bit like this, right, in cross section.

85
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,128
And it doesn´t have any mitochondria, no mitochondria.

86
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:40,503
So, has no mitochondria. And remember, mitochondria are these tiny little organelles inside of cells that are using oxygen.

87
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:45,437
So that has no mitochondria, and it´s not really using oxygen.

88
00:07:45,437 --> 00:07:54,336
So it´s not using oxygen and really these cells, we call them cells and there are many senses of the word,

89
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:57,102
but they don´t really have mitochondria, they also don´t have nucleus.

90
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:08,829
These are literally amazingly designed cells that are made for the purpose of carrying around oxygen to the body, because they literally are bags of hemoglobin.

91
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:14,510
So just remember, red blood cell don´t really need oxygen they´re simply carrying it around.

92
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,107
Another tissue or organ that makes people kind of wonder, is the heart.

93
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:29,903
The heart is pumping all the blood around, but does it actually get oxygen from vessels that are in the pulmonary circulation or from the systemic circulation or what?

94
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:34,936
And here the short answer is systemic circulation.

95
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:36,475
That´s kind of the quick answer.

96
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:42,388
And let me actually show you where the blood vessels come from.

97
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:50,834
These are called coronary vessels --I just write the word coronary here. Coronary vessels-- So, coronary artery and vein.

98
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:56,937
And these coronary vessles they actually come right off the aorta here and here.

99
00:08:56,937 --> 00:09:02,812
So they kind of come off the aorta right away, they are the first branches off the aorta, actually.

100
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:04,902
So the first branches go and serve the heart.

101
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:08,804
So it´s kind of the first to get systemic circulation blood.

102
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:15,040
And the veins actually drain into a spot , directly into the right atrium.

103
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,676
There is actually a little spot right there that they drain in to.

104
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:22,611
So the blood from the arterial side is coming from the aorta

105
00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:27,568
and on the venous side it´s actually not even dumping into the inferior or superior vena cava,

106
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,773
kind of little known fact that is coming directly into the right atrium.

107
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:34,005
And finally kind of tricky one, but the lungs.

108
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:36,335
Where do the lungs get their oxygen from?

109
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:41,511
And this is, I said tricky and I can not save this for last because there are actually blood vessels

110
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:46,502
and again don´t worry so much about the anatomy --in terms of where is it coming off exactly,

111
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:53,335
but it´s coming off of the systemic circulation and you´ve got a vessel going to the right lung.

112
00:09:53,335 --> 00:10:04,076
Let´s say something like that. And you´ve got another vessel going, I´ve just drawn --kind of going to the left lung, like that.

113
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:09,521
So you´ve got a couple of arteries that are branching off and these are also part of the systemic circulation --systemic circulation.

114
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:10,853
And these are called the bronchial arteries.

115
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:18,001
And these bronchial arteries bring then, really --wonderful- oxygenated blood, right. These are the bronchial arteries.

116
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,777
And you might say, well that wasn´t so difficult.

117
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:24,943
I'll say bronchial vessels, because there are also some veins coming off.

118
00:10:24,943 --> 00:10:29,702
Actually let me draw the veins now for you, so you can see how those kind of end up

119
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:36,704
and these veins come from -of course- the right lung and they actually end up -kind of- dumping in here.

120
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:43,403
I can't really show blue on blue, but you know, just try to see they kind of go there.

121
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:44,814
And you´ve got another vein from the other lung

122
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:49,604
kind of following a parallel path and going into the veins, as well.

123
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:53,670
And so they don´t dump necessarily directly into the inferior/ superior vena cava.

124
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,900
I´ve just wanna showed that they´re going to the venous side on the systemic circulation.

125
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:07,267
So if that was it, that would be really simple. But, actually lungs are kind of interesting in the sense that there is a lot of mixing going on.

126
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,935
You´ve got pulmonary arteries carrying blood,

127
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,537
you´ve got bronchial arteries carrying blood

128
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,703
and that blood mixes.

129
00:11:14,703 --> 00:11:16,626
And then you´ve got the capillaries,

130
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:19,144
you´ve got some blood kind of from both places -

131
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:23,140
the pulmonary circulation and the blood from the systemic circulation again mixing.

132
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:30,139
And then on the other side where the veins are bringing blood back to the heart

133
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:36,570
most of the blood as it turns out, most of the blood actually goes this way into the pulmonary veins.

134
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:43,238
So even though you have the bronchial arteries bringing blood in, that would be right here,

135
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:50,402
you know the bronchial arteries bringing blood in, a lot of that blood ends up going into that pulmonary circulation.

136
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:56,539
So that´s kind of a intersting fact that not as much goes this way directly into that systemic circulation.

137
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,838
So that´s kind of the tricky thing to keep in mind

138
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:03,642
but the lungs then technically really are getting blood both from the systemic circulation

139
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:10,103
but also they are kind of mixing blood and they´re mixing blood with the pulmonary circulation.

140
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:12,225
We´ll talk a little bit more about this in another video

141
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:16,237
and I don´t feel like this kind of --got too confusing

142
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:22,353
but I just want you to be aware that there is mixing going on in the lungs with the systemic and pulmonary circulation.

143
00:12:22,353 --> 00:12:25,000
That´s kind of a unique organ in that sense.
