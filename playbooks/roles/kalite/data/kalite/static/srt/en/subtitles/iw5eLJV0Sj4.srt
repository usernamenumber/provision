99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The goal of this video is to try to figure out

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the antiderivative of ln(x), and is not completly

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
obvious how to aproach this at first, even if were to I told you

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to use integration by parts, you would say:

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
'Wait, wait. Integration by parts you are looking for

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the antiderivative of something that con be expressed

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as a product of two functions, it looks like I only have one function'

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it might become a little bit more obvious

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i I were to rewright this as the integral of ln(x)

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times one dx, now you have the product of two functions

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one is a function of x, it actually not dependent of x

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's always gonna be 1, but you could have f(x) = 1

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And now it might become more obvious to use integration by parts

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Integration by parts tells us that, if we have an integral

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that can be veiwed as the product of one function

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the derivative of another function

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is really just the reverse product rule

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we've shown that multiple time already, this is gonna

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
be equal to the product of both functions

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
f(x) times g(x) minus the antiderivative of

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
instead of having f and g' we are gonna have

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
f' and g, so f'(x) times g(x) dx

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we've seen this multiple times so when you

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so when you figure it out what should be f and what should be g

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for f you want to figure it out something that is easy

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to take the derivative of and it simplifies the things, possibly

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you are taking the derivative of it, and for g'(x)

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you want to find something where it's easy to take the antiderivative of it

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so, a good candidate for f(x) is ln(x)

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you take the derivative of it is 1/x

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets say that f(x) = ln(x), then f'(x) = 1/x

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and lets set g'(x) = 1 that means g(x) could be equal to x

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets go back right over here so this is going to be equal to

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is going to be equal to f(x) times g(x)

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
f(x) time g(x) is x ln(x), so g(x) is x and f(x) is ln(x)

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I just like writing the x infront of the ln(x)

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to avoid ambiguity so this is x ln(x) minus

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the antiderivative of f'(x), which is 1/x times g(x) which is x

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
dx

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well what's this gonna be equal to? all we have inside the integral

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is just 1/x time x which is just equal to 1

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this simplifies quite nicely, this is going to end up equaling

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x ln(x) minus the antiderivtive of just dx

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or the integral of 1 dx is just minus x

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is just the an antiderivative of this, if we want to

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
write the entire class of antiderivaives we just have to add plus c here

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we are done! we figured out the antiderivative

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of ln(x) and I encourage you to take the derivative of this

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for this part you are gonna use the product rule
