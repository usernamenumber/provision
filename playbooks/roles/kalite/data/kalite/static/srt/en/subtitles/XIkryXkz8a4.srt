1
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,741
We're in the Ufizzi looking at two portraits

2
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,644
that were once joined as a diptych.

3
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:11,946
So they would have been connected

4
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:13,447
by a hinge.

5
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:16,015
This is the Duke and Duchess of Urbino â€“

6
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,453
Federico da Montefeltro and Battista Sforza.

7
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:22,804
She had just died and this was a commemorative portrait

8
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:25,059
this is a way that he could remember his his wife.

9
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,660
We think it was actually painted

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,197
by Piero della Francesca, possibly from a death mask

11
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,099
that had been made of her.

12
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,934
Look at how dressed-up she is.

13
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,169
They are both very formal.

14
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,388
It reminds me of the fact

15
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:38,973
that we're so used to photographs being taken of us

16
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:40,541
from the time we're very little.

17
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,643
It's true, this was a very privileged thing.

18
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,579
Only the extremely wealthy could have an image

19
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,047
that could outlast them .

20
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,351
I'm also reminded that women used to pluck their foreheads.

21
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,720
It was considered to be especially beautiful

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,154
to have a very high forehead.

23
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,590
You often see this in northern painting.

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,925
It's important to remember that Federico da Montefeltro

25
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,928
actually brought northern painters, that is Flemish painters

26
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,529
down to his court.

27
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,765
In fact Piero who is an Italian painter seems to have borowed

28
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,801
that northern interest

29
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,536
perhaps not only in the high forehead

30
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,942
but also in the great intricacy and specificity of the landscape.

31
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,176
We have this wonderful

32
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,244
atmospheric perspecive.

33
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,412
One of the other characteristics

34
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,481
that I also think is so interesting here

35
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:23,717
is the very strict profile on which both figures are rendered.

36
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,853
The formality that you were talking about

37
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,388
comes through because of the profile.

38
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,468
This is based on a coinage

39
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:31,058
from Ancient Rome

40
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:35,195
which, by the way, the humanists of Montefeltro's court and other humanist courts

41
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,965
at this time were actively collecting.

42
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,708
When you think about a rendering

43
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,635
of Caesar or even on modern coinage,

44
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,337
you generally have a perfect profile,

45
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,677
and you see that here.

46
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:47,608
The one interesting detail is that

47
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,948
the portraits are almost always facing right

48
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:53,756
and here the duke is facing his wife, facing left.

49
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:58,191
Actually we know that he had suffered wounds on the right side of his face,

50
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,586
he was missing an eye.

51
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,488
That's right and part of his nose was missing.

52
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,490
That may be another reason why we only see

53
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,530
the left side of his face.

54
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,227
But there is that formality and power

55
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,546
that comes from the profile pose

56
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,433
but also from the bird-eyes view of the landscape

57
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:15,072
so that the figures tower over the landskape

58
00:02:15,072 --> 00:02:17,510
So there really is symbolism in this painting.

59
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,507
And there is also symbolism outside of this painting as well.

60
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,009
You had mentioned that this was a diptych.

61
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,479
When this painting was closed you would actually only see the exterior.

62
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,614
The exteriors are painted as well.

63
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,760
Let's go have a look.

64
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,253
There is a lot of symbolism on the outside of this painting.

65
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,855
It's covers, you could say.

66
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,713
You have two triumphal chariots

67
00:02:36,713 --> 00:02:39,226
which is an image that comes from Ancient Rome as well.

68
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:43,027
On both of them we can see the people

69
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:45,466
that are portrayed on the inside of the painting.

70
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:48,869
That's right. On the back of Battista Sforza's portrait

71
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,305
we see her borne in a triumphal chariot

72
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,942
surrounded by figures who represent her virtues.

73
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,010
And the same with the duke.

74
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,981
Also below that we have these inscriptions in latin.

75
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,857
Now, the classical inscription refers specifically

76
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:06,820
to the vitues that are represented on those triumphal chariots.

77
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,424
One example can be seen on the duke's chariot

78
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:14,027
which shows facing us, sitting, but full-frontal

79
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,630
a personification of justice.

80
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,534
You can she she is holding the scales of justice in her hand

81
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,702
as well as a sword.

82
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:25,893
On the female portrait the cart is beeing drawn

83
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:27,007
not by horses but by unicorns.

84
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,562
It's really a fanciful landscape that they are in as well

85
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:31,612
there is this real sense of imagination

86
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:34,181
an attempt to invent a kind of iconography,

87
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,317
that ennobles the figures represented.

88
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,359
And we have that typical Piero della Francesca

89
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:44,658
sense of geometry and formality

90
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:48,061
which, I think, complements the portraits themselves.
