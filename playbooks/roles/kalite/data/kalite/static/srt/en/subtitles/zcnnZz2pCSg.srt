1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,400
In the last video, we figured out the absolute minimum

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,340
speed in order to stay on the circular path right over here especially near the top

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,980
was 27.6 km/h

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,420
What I want to do in this video is

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,090
I just clipped out the parts where he's actually on the loop de loop

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,440
and I want to figure out his average [speed]

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,740
So I'm going to use the video editor right here

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,060
to time how long it takes to complete the loop de loop

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,220
And then we can use that and we know about the circumference of this loop de loop

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,460
and we're going to assume that it is perfectly circular for our purpose

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,130
although it looks like it's a little bit egg-shaped in reality or elliptical

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,170
For our calculation, we're going to assume that it's perfectly circular

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,710
I'll leave it to you to think about how it would change

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,210
if you had an elliptical shape like this

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,370
So anyway, let's watch the video again

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,080
Remember this is from fifth gear which shows on Channel 5 in United Kingdom

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,850
So there you go

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,770
Let's watch it again. It's fun to watch. There you go

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,630
And right over here, we have a little timer for my video editor

20
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,160
And this right over here is in seconds and I was corrected on a earlier video

21
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,540
This right over here is not in hundredth of seconds. This is in frames

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,630
And there's 30 frames per second

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,240
So it starts at 0 seconds 0 frames

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,250
and then when we play it, it goes to 2 seconds and 14 frames

25
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,410
There's 30 frames per second

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,350
So it's 2 and 14/30 of a second. It's how long it takes the car to do the loop

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,510
So 1 second, and then 2 seconds, 2 and 14/30. So almost 2.5 second

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,850
So let's write that down

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:50,440
So the time required to do the loop de loop is roughly 2 and 14/30 seconds

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,530
And what is the distance that it travels?

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,320
If we assume that this thing is circular although it looks like it's a little bit egg-shaped

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,250
if we assume that it is circular

33
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,950
then the distance traveled is the circumference of the circular loop de loop

34
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,970
The circumference is 2 pi times the radius which is equal to 2 pi

35
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,030
and in the previous video, we figured out the radius was 6 m

36
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:20,710
So it's 2 pi times 6 m which is equal to 12 pi meters

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,510
If you wanted to figure out its average speed--

38
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,130
the velocity is constantly changing because the direction is changing

39
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,140
but the magnitude of the velocity--

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:37,250
if we wanted to figure out the average magnitude of the velocity or the average speed

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,150
the total distance traveled is 12 pi meters

42
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,010
divided by the time required to travel the 12 pi meters

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,720
so that is 2 and 14/30 seconds

44
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,190
Now let's get our calculator out to actual calculate that value

45
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:06,930
So we're going to have the distance 12 pi m divided by

46
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:15,480
2 + 14/30 just to get the exact value

47
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,010
And then this gives us in meters per second

48
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,710
15.3 m/s

49
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:31,070
So the average speed is approximately 15.3 m/s

50
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:37,900
which is almost twice as fast as the minimum speed we figured out

51
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,100
because you want that margin of safety

52
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,870
and you want to be able to have some traction with the road

53
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,260
Although you don't want to go too fast, because then the G force is going to be too big

54
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,070
then this--maybe we'll talk about that in the future video

55
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,590
I'll just relate this into kilometers per hour. Let's figure out what that is

56
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,730
I want to use the calculator here

57
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,890
So that's in the meters per second

58
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,270
Let's figure out how many meters per hour by multiplying it by 3600 seconds per hour

59
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,170
So that's how many meters per hour, and divide it by 1000 which you can see right over there

60
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,030
that is 55 km/h

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,270
If you want to do it in miles, it's rough approximation, divide it by 1.6

62
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:26,470
It's about 35 mph give or take or 55 km/h

63
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,560
So this is approximately 55 km/h

64
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,640
So the driver here luckily they did the physics ahead of time

65
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,900
and he had the margin of safety

66
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,340
He was well in excess of the minimum velocity just to maintain the circular motion

67
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,650
So he probably has some nice traction with the track up here
