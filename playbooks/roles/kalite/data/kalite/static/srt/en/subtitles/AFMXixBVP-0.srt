1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say we've got the function f(x) is equal to e to the x,

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just to get a sense of what that looks like

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we do a rough drawing of f(x) is equal to e to the x.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It would look something like this. It would look something

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
like that. So that is e to the x, and what I want to do is approximate f(x) is equal to e to the x

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
using a taylor series approximation or taylor series expansion, and I want to do it

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not around is equal to 0, I want to do it around x is equal to

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
3, just to pick another arbitrary value, so we're going to do it around x is

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to 3, this is x is equal to 3, this right there, that is f of 3

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
, f of 3 is e to the third power. So this is e to the third power

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over there. So when we take the taylor series expansion, if we have a

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
zero degree polynomial approximating it, the best we can do is have a constant

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
function going straight through e to the third. If we do a first order approximation

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we have a first degree term, then it will be the tangent line

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
. As we add more and more degrees to it, we should hopefully

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
be able to, kind of contour or converge with

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the curve better and better and better. In the future we'll talk more about

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how we can test for convergences, and how well are we converging, and all

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that type of thing. But with that said, let's just apply the formula

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
, then hopefully we'll have the intuition for in the last video. So the

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
taylor series expansion for f(x) is equal to e to the x will be the

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
polynomial. So what is f of c. Well if x is equal to 3, we're saying

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that c is 3 in this situation. So if c is 3, f of 3 is e to the third power

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
. So that is e to the third power plus, what's f prime of c? Well,

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
f prime of x is also going to be e to the x. You take the derivative of

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
e to the x to get e to the x. That's one of the supercool things

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
about e to the x. So thjis is also f prime of x, gfrankly this is also the sma e as

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
f, the nth derivative of x. You can just keep taking the derivative

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of this and you'll get e to the x. So f prime of x is e to the x

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
, you evaluate that at 3, you get e to the third power again, times

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x minus 3, c is 3, plus the second derivative of our function, we

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's still e to the x, evaluate that at 3, you get e to the third power

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over 2 factorial times x minus 3 to the 2nd power, we can keep

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going. The third derivative is still ex, evaluate that at 3, c is three in this

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
situation so you get e to the third power over 3 factorial times x minus

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
3 to the third power, and we can keep going with this, but I think you get

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the general idea. But what's even more interestin than just kind of going through

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the mechanics of finding the expansion is seeing how it

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how as we add more and more terms it approximates e to the x

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
better and better and better, and our approximation gets further away from

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x is equal to 3. A nd to to dthat I used wolfram alpha

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
available at wolframalpha.com/.And I think I tpyed in taylor series expansion

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
e to the x ad xis equals 3, and it knew what i wanted, and just gave

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
me all of this business right over here. And you can see that's its the exact same thing that we have

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over here e to the third and e to third times times x-3 plus 1/2. They actually

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
expanded out the factorial, instead of 3 factorial they wrote 6 over here,

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they did a bunch of terms over here. But whats even more interesting is

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that they actually graph each of these polynomials qwith more and more terms

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So in orange we have e to the x, we have fi s equal to e to the x, and then they

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
#tell us, order and approximation shown wuth n dots, so the

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
order 1 approximation, so that should be the suituatioin where we have

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a first degree polynomial, so literaally a first degree polynomial would be these

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
three temrs right over here. Cause this is a zeroth degree,, this is a first degree

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we just hvae x to the first power involved her. That will be, if we just

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
qwere to plot this, if this was our polynomial that is plotted nwith

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one dot, and that is this one right over here is one dot, and they plotted, they

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plotted right over here and we can

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can see that it's just a tangent line at , x is equal to 3, that

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is x is equal to 3 right over there. So this is the tangent line. If

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we add a term, now we're getting to a second degree polynomial

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cause we're adding an x squared, and if you expand this out you'll

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
have a x squared term and you'll have another x term, but the degree

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the polynomial will now be a second degree. So let's look for 2 dots

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's this one right over here. So let's see, 2 dots coming in

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
see you'll not notice one but two dots, so you have 2 dots and it comes in

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is a parabola, this is a second degree polynomial, and then it

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
comes back like this. But notice, it does a better job, especially around x equals 3

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of approximating e to the x. It stays with the curve a little bit longer

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
. You add another term, let me do this in another colour, a colour

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that I have not used, you add another term. Now you hvae a third degree polynomial

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
. If you have all of these combined, if this is your polynomial, and you

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were to graph that, and so let's look for the 3 dots right over here

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
. So 1, 2, 3, so it's this curve, third degree polynomial is this curve

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here. And notice it starts contouring e to the x a little bit

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sooner than the second degree version, and it stays with it a little bit

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
longer. It stays with it a little bit longer, and so you have it just

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
like that. You add another term to it, you add the fourth degree term

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to it, so now we have all of this plus all of this. All this is

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your polynomial now you have this cool curve right over here. Notice, if you add

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a term, it's getting better and better at approximating e to the x

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
furht er and further away fromx is equal ro 3. And if you add anbother

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
term, you get this term, this one up here. But hopefully that

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
satisfies you that we are getting closer and closer the more terms

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we add, so you can imagine it's a pretty darn good approximation
