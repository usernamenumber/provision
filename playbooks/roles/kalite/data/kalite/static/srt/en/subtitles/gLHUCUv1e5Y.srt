1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,067
When people refer to social security in United States, they really are referring to the OASDI which

2
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:24,667
stands for - Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance.

3
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:27,733
And it is exactly what this acronym implies it is.

4
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:34,667
It provides retirement benefits when someone retires or when someone passes before that and they had

5
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:38,933
paid into or paid into the social security insurance, this OSADI

6
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:43,333
And when they pass away then it provides benefits to their survivors.

7
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:47,133
Or if that person doesn't pass away but becomes disabled, and can't work anymore, it will also

8
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,533
provide benefits for them.

9
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:54,933
Now one very very common misconception with social security is that it someone is a

10
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:59,533
retirement savings account like a 401(k) or an IRA.

11
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:04,733
It is not that. From the government's point of view they view it more as a kind of insurance, but

12
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:11,867
in reality, all it is, is a way for current workers to directly pay for retirement of existing retirees.

13
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:15,333
And the reason why they did this is when it started off in 1935, they wanted the

14
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:22,400
current retirees to immediately get benefits. They didn't want the current generation to

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
save enough money and only use their money, so they made it a direct transfer

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,400
from the current workers to the people who are using the benefits.

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,800
To make the point clear, a traditional retirement account - let's say this is

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:40,400
me over my career, and then this is when I retire, so this is when I get older

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,000
I am aging as we go to the right. So while in my working years, in a traditional

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,600
retirement plan, I would be putting money into some account some place.

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,400
This is the case with an IRA or a 401k. So this is an account, an account some place

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,600
And in the case of an IRA or 401k, they are tax deferred and you can invest this and you

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:11,667
can get interest on it. So it can grow as you invest, and put more and more money into it.

24
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:16,467
And if you invest it well. And once you retire, all that money, that money that you directly placed

25
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:22,467
there will be used to fund your retirement. That money will be used to fund your retirement.

26
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:28,667
Social security is not this. When you pay the FICA tax, we'll talk about that in more detail in future videos,

27
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:33,067
when you pay that tax, you're not actually putting it into a separate account

28
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:40,867
you will then tap into later. You're actually for the most part paying current retirees or survivors o

29
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:45,267
r people with disabilities, you're paying for their benefits. So the way social security works

30
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:57,467
is more like this. You have all the current workers paying their FICA taxes You have all the current

31
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:59,667
workers paying their FICA taxes. And right now, at least I think these numbers

32
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:06,600
are as of 2010, you have 157 million people paying into social security. And you have 54 million

33
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:17,267
people receiving social security. And so this ratio is pretty good, this money is right now as of 2010

34
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:24,267
2011 is enough money to pay for all these benefits and actually we are running

35
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:29,800
a little bit of a surplus, and that surplus is put into a separate trust account.

36
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,200
And it is informally called the social security trust, or the more formal name is

37
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:43,400
the OSADI trust. I'll just call it the social security trust. And the idea behind this is, OK, look, we're running a surplus now

38
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,400
we can cover at least all of our current obligations and we have a surplus.

39
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,067
And as more baby boomers retire and more people go from this side of the equation to this side

40
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:57,467
of the equation, then we can use the trust to kind of make up any deficits we might have.

41
00:03:57,467 --> 00:04:01,067
Because if we have more people on the right, we're going to have to spend more and

42
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,800
we're going to have fewer people on the left so we're going to have less coming in

43
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,267
Well, look, we had all that saved up surplus before so we can use that. And that might

44
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:13,800
sound like overall a decent idea but the problem is that this trust is going to start shrinking because

45
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:22,867
of all the retiring of all the baby boomers. Start shrinking and we estimate 2023, and these things m

46
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:27,467
move around based on how much benefits retirees get, the economy, how many people are paying

47
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:32,867
into it and a whole other bunch of assumptions. They estimate it is going to start shrinking roughly

48
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:36,267
a deacade from now. And the really bad thing is, that this thing will be

49
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:44,467
completely depleted so it won't be able to that extra funding for these kinds of deficits not having e

50
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:47,600
enough money to pay for all the retirees. It will be completely depleted

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,667
sometime between 2030 and 2040. Once again, this is a little ways out but

52
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:57,333
it is actually not that far out. This is actually going to affect - Let's see

53
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:05,733
I'm right now 35, in 2011, so in 2031, I'll be 55, so I, this will potentially affect my

54
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:11,533
retirement. By the time I retire, I dunno, 20 - hopefully I'm around - 2042. Actually I'll

55
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:14,933
probably have to be 67. So I'll have, what is it, 2045 or whatever

56
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:18,333
I retire - based on the current taxes that are coming in, the current level of the

57
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:23,867
Social Security trust, the interest the social security trust is getting on its invested money,

58
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:28,333
and its all being invested in treasuries securities, so it's being invested in treasuries, so

59
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:32,133
it is not getting crazy interest, it's getting like only a few percentage points

60
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:39,533
per year. But it has to, because it has to be invested in a very safe place - given this,

61
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,533
there are 3 possible eventualities. Either the FICA tax goes up,

62
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,867
so based on the number of people working here you get more revenue per person right over here.

63
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:55,000
Eventuality #2 is the benefits go down or even possibly disappear. And eventuality #3

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,800
is by this timeframe right over here, that other parts of the government's budget

65
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,200
is going to have to fund social security to make up the shortfall because

66
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,200
if you don't have enough revenue coming from the FICA tax and you don't have enough money from

67
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,400
the social security trust so other parts of the budget. But as we'll see, there won't be a lot of other p

68
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,200
parts to the budget because you also have medi-care growing and really medi-care

69
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,200
is the really unsustainable one. The one that is growing even faster than social security.

70
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,200
So this is very much in question whether there is even another part of the budget that you can even

71
00:06:27,200 --> 99:59:59,999
possibly take from
