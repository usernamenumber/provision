1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,930
So far we've been focused on elasticity of demand for only one good,

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,100
we've thought about how changes in the price of that good affect changes in its quantity.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,060
Now we are going to explore is how we can go cross goods.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:23,440
So we are going to talk about the cross elasticity of demand.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,540
And there is multiple different scenarios we can think about. But its

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,060
really thinking about how price change in one good might affect quantity demanded in another.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,280
To see a example of this. Think about two airlines.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,950
Two competing airlines, maybe its the same exact route. Going at the

9
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,180
exact same time, maybe, between New York and London.

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:46,620
So, airline one right over here, airline two, very competitive

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,720
Price over here is a $1000 for a round trip.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,570
Quantity demanded is 200 tickets, let's say in a given week.

13
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,420
Airline two's price is $1000 for the round trip,

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,090
the quantity demanded is 200 tickets as well.

15
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:16,650
Now, let's think about what will happen if Airline 1 raises its price from $1000 to $1100?

16
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,670
We could even do something less dramatic than that. To $1050.

17
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,900
So, a relatively small increase in price.

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,010
Remember when we are thinking about the % price increase, we are thinking about elasticity.

19
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,770
In general, we don't just say - OK. $50 on top of a $1000 is a 5% price increase.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,310
That's what we would in kind of everyday thinking, if you went from a $1000 to $1050.

21
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:49,350
You would say that is a $50 increase on a base of a 1000. Or that is a 5% increase.

22
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,860
When you think about elasticities, because you want to have the same % change between...

23
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,710
you go from a 1000 to a 1050 or if you go from a 1050 down to a 1000.

24
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:09,000
We actually use the average point as the base, so the percent change in this scenario...

25
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,150
I'll write it in quotes because it's a little different than what you do in traditional

26
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,710
mathematics, when you think about percent changes. It's you had a

27
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,470
50 change in price. Your price went up by 50

28
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:26,280
And on our base we'll use 1025, which is the average of 1000 and 1050

29
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,980
We'll say increase in price, although we'll put that increase in quote

30
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,940
because we're using it on the average

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:59,230
It's 4.9% increase using the midpoint as the base

32
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:05,640
Now when that happens -- everyone today uses travel site to compare prices

33
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,610
if these really are the exact same route

34
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,000
going from the exact same airport to the exact same airport, leaving at the exact same time

35
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,550
everyone is going to take this one now, because it's only $1000

36
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,900
Even just $50, why would they ride on this airline

37
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,010
So this quantity demanded is going to go to 0

38
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,100
And this quantity demanded is going to go to 400

39
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,990
We're not going to think about the actual capacity of the plane and all that

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,040
We're gonna have a very simple model here

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,720
So what was the percent change in quantity for airline 2 here?

42
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,780
Well once again, our change in quantity is 200 not 400

43
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,980
We went from 200 to 400, so we gained 200

44
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,600
And our base, we want to use the average of 200 and 400 which is 300

45
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,590
And so this is approximately 67%

46
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:10,720
So we have, all of a sudden, our cross elasticity of demand for airline 2's tickets

47
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,760
relative to A1's price

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:27,360
and we get the % change in the quantity demanded for A2's tickets, which is 67%

49
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,950
over the % change not in A2's price change, but in A1's price change

50
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,310
That's why we call it cross elasticity. We go from one good to another

51
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:44,690
So for simplicity, that's roughly 5%

52
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,830
So you have a very high cross elasticity of demand

53
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,640
If you even increase this maybe by $5, you might have had the same effect

54
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,330
So you would have had a very large number here

55
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,610
And that situation right here for this cross elasticity of demand is

56
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,450
because these things are near perfect substitutes

57
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,510
The way we set up this problem we said

58
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,090
Well people don't care which one they take. They'll just go for the cheapest one

59
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:39,110
When you have nearly perfect substitutes for each other, like this example here

60
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:46,000
the cross elasticity of demand approaches infinity

61
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,530
It gets higher and higher and higher. In theory, if these are really, really, really identical

62
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,870
even if you raise a penny, people will say, why would I waste a penny?

63
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,660
I would just use airline 2

64
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:01,330
And so this number would be even lower here. So this thing might approach infinity

65
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,020
And notice, this was positive. When we just in regular price elasticity of demand

66
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:13,020
the only way that you would increase quantity for a traditional good was by lowering price

67
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,120
but here we raised price on a substitute competitive product

68
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:24,620
and we raised the demand for airline 2's product which actually makes a lot of sense

69
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,790
So it wasn't a negative relationship. It's actually a positive value here

70
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,420
But you could have that negative relationship using cross elasticity of demand

71
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,060
This is the example of a substitute

72
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,290
We could think about the example of a complement

73
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:49,250
So what if we're talking about e-books?

74
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,410
So let's say I have some type of an e-book

75
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,840
And the current quantity demanded in a given week, I don't know, is 1000

76
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:07,230
Let's say the price of an e-reader that you would need for my e-book is $100

77
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:16,370
but let's say that the price of the e-reader goes down from $100 to $80

78
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,020
So you had a $20 decrease in price

79
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,450
Well, what's going to happen to my e-book, assuming its price does not change?

80
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,420
Well then the quantity demanded for my e-book will go up

81
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,630
So let's say the quantity demanded for my e-book goes up by 100

82
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,690
because more people are going to afford this

83
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,920
or they're gonna have money left over when they buy this to buy more e-books

84
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,840
and so I don't even know what the price for my e-book is, but at a given price point

85
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,690
the quantity demanded will go up and so this goes to 1100

86
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,500
And so I'll leave it to you to calculate this price elasticity of demand

87
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,540
but you'll see that you'll actually get a negative value

88
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,770
like we used to seeing for regular price elasticity of demand

89
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:12,240
And when we do calculate, remember, you want to do your % price change in e-book quantity

90
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:21,270
over percent change in e-reader price

91
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,390
And the other thing you have to remember, you don't just take -20/100, you

92
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,770
take -20 over the average of these two when you're thinking of it in the elasticity context

93
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:43,240
So this value right over here is -20 / 90, the average of those two

94
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:54,660
This value right over here is going to be +100 over the average of these two, which is 1050

95
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:07,050
And so we get -- 100/1050 which gets you to about .095

96
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,080
So about 9.5% change in quantity demanded for my book

97
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:22,190
And then this denominator right here is -20 / 90

98
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,900
So you get a drop of 22%

99
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:36,810
If you divide the numerator by the denominator, it's .0952/-.22222...

100
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:46,470
and you get -0.43

101
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,110
And this make sense. If you lower the price of the e-reader, this complement product

102
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,360
a product that goes along with my e-book, it increases the demand

103
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,400
Just like you get with price elasticity of demand, you get a negative value over here

104
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,370
What about completely two unrelated products?

105
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,180
Let's say that I have basketballs

106
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,840
And the price of basketballs goes from, let's say, $20 to $30

107
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,930
What's going to happen to my e-book?

108
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,440
Well, my e-book's not gonna change. They're gonna stay at 1000

109
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:31,740
So my % change in the quantity demanded of my e-book is going to be zero in this example

110
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,250
when we wanna do this cross elasticity of demand over my % change in basketballs

111
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:46,610
which would be 30/25 so whatever that is

112
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,110
10/25, I should say, sorry, which is a 40% increase. So that would be

113
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,170
0/40% which equals zero

114
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,270
So for unrelated products, products where the

115
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,860
price change in one of them does not affect the quantity demanded in the other

116
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,650
it makes complete sense that you have a zero cross elasticity of demand

117
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,310
If they're complements, you'd have a negative cross elasticity of demand

118
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,760
If they're substitutes, you would have a positive and the

119
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,710
closer the substitutes they are, the more

120
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,950
positive your cross elasticity of demand is going to be
