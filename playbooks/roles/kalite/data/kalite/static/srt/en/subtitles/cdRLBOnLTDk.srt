1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,850
Find the probability of pulling
a yellow marble from a

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:09,060
bag with three yellow, two red,
two green, and one blue

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,480
marbles, I'm assuming.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,510
So let's just think about
this bag a little bit.

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,470
There are three yellow
marbles in it.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,660
So let me draw them.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,350
We have one, two, three
yellow marbles.

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,010
We have two red marbles.

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,565
   

11
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:27,170
So we have one, two red marbles,
assuming they're all

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,240
mixed in there.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,990
We have two green marbles--
one, two green marbles.

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,500
And then there's one
blue marble.

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,720
   

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,820
And they want to know the
probability of pulling a

17
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,700
yellow marble.

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:48,530
So they want to know what is the
probability of pulling a

19
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,430
yellow marble.

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,470
Now probability is just a way of
expressing-- well, I don't

21
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,330
want to use too loaded words.

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,460
But it's the odds of picking
yours relative to the odds of

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,440
picking everything else.

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,130
Or another way of thinking about
it is, it's the number

25
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,330
of outcomes that could result
in what you want, a yellow

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,100
marble, over the total
number of outcomes.

27
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,720
So how many ways are there-- how
many events-- you're going

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,710
to pick out a ball.

29
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,980
How many of those-- how many
ways-- or how many balls can

30
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,670
you pick out that
will be yellow?

31
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,710
Well, there's three balls.

32
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,580
There's three balls that you
can pick out as yellow.

33
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,400
One, two, and three.

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,260
We're assuming that they're
all equally likely

35
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,970
to be picked up.

36
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,090
They're all mixed in there.

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,760
So there's three yellow balls
you could pick up.

38
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,080
Now how many total
balls are there?

39
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,810
How many total balls are
there to be picked up?

40
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,540
Well, you could be picking up
any one of eight balls, right?

41
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,010
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

42
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,060
So there's a total number
of eight balls.

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,160
So the probability of picking
a yellow marble is 3/8.

44
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,730
So you have a 3/8 chance of
picking a yellow marble.

45
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,500
And just a way to
think about it.

46
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,560
I just want to reiterate.

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,840
It's just the number
of outcomes.

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,490
There's eight total outcomes.

49
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,320
There's eight different
things that you could

50
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,580
pull out of the bag.

51
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,840
Three of them satisfy
your conditions.

52
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,080
Three of them would be
a yellow marble.

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,733
