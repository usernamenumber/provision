1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,554
Over many videos now, we've been talking about

2
00:00:02,554 --> 00:00:07,400
how every interstellar object is moving away from Earth.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,867
We've also been talking about how the further something is

4
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:13,267
away from Earth, the faster it's moving.

5
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:14,675
What I want to do in this video

6
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:16,393
is to put a few numbers behind it,

7
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:19,267
or even better conceptualize what we've been talking about.

8
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:20,898
So, one way to think about it

9
00:00:20,898 --> 00:00:22,965
is that, if at an early stage in the Universe,

10
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:24,636
I were to pick some points,

11
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:25,635
so that's one point,

12
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:28,305
another point, another point

13
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:29,400
another point,

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,067
let me just pick 9 points so that I have a proper grid.

15
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:36,400
So this is an early stage in the Universe

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,267
if we fast-forward a few billion years,

17
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:41,308
and I'm clearly not drawing it to scale.

18
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:42,632
All of these points

19
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:45,000
have all moved away from each other.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,267
So this point is over here,

21
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:49,133
and actually let me draw another row,

22
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:53,600
actually another column,

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,892
just to make it clear.

24
00:00:54,892 --> 00:00:57,000
So if you fast-forward a few billion years

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,467
the Universe has expanded,

26
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:01,000
and so everything has moved away from everything

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,400
and let me color code a little bit,

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,225
let me make this point magenta.

29
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:08,067
So this point, the magenta point is now here.

30
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,333
This green point

31
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,562
has now moved away from the magenta point.

32
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:16,067
And now this blue point

33
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,933
has now moved away from the magenta point

34
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:20,000
in that direction,

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,467
and we can keep going,

36
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,058
this yellow point is maybe

37
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:24,067
over here now.

38
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,467
I think you get the general idea.

39
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,133
And I'll just draw the other yellow points,

40
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:33,333
so they've all moved away from each other.

41
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,800
So there's no center here

42
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,733
everything is just expanding away

43
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:38,894
from things next to it.

44
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:40,333
And what you can see here,

45
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,733
is not only did this thing expand away from this,

46
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:44,815
but this thing expanded away from this

47
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:46,133
even further,

48
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:50,000
because it had this expansion plus this expansion.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Or another way to think about it is

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200
the velocity with which,

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,067
the apparent velocity with which something is expanding

52
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,400
is going to proportional to how far it is.

53
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,933
Because every point in between is also expanding away.

54
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:06,897
And just to review a little bit of the visualiztion of this,

55
00:02:06,897 --> 00:02:09,067
one way to think of this, if you think of the Universe

56
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:11,267
as an infinite flat sheet.

57
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:13,468
You could imagine that we are just taking a sheet of

58
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:14,933
I don't know

59
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:19,000
some type of sheet of stretchy material and just stretching it out

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,200
we're just stretching it out,

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,708
that's if we kind of imagine a more infinite Universe,

62
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,891
that just goes off in every direction.

63
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,267
We're just stretching that infinite sheet out,

64
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:30,467
so it has no boundaries, but we're still stretching it out.

65
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:33,554
Another way to visualize it, and this is what we did earlier on,

66
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:38,337
is you could imagine that this --, that the Universe is the

67
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:41,400
three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere,

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,600
or the three-dimensional surface of a hyper-sphere.

69
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,558
Sort of an early stage in the Universe,

70
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:52,067
the sphere looked like this, and these points here

71
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:54,467
the magenta point is right over here

72
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:57,000
the green point is right over there,

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,733
then we had the blue point up here,

74
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:03,000
and then let me just draw the rest of the yellow points.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,548
And the yellow points are here, they're all on the surface of this sphere.

76
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:09,933
They're all on the surface of the sphere.

77
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:12,333
Obviously, I'm only dealing with two-dimensions right now,

78
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,133
and it's nearly impossible, or maybe impossible to imagine

79
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,667
a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere,

80
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,227
but then the analogy holds.

81
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:22,133
If is the surface of a balloon, or the surface of a bubble,

82
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,057
if the bubble were to expand,

83
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:28,133
so if the bubble were to expand over a few billion years,

84
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,267
and once again - not drawn to scale.

85
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:33,067
So now we have a bigger bubble here

86
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:36,224
This part of the surface is all going to expand,

87
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:38,333
so once again, you have your magenta

88
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,800
you have your blue dot,

89
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,000
you have your green dot,

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,400
and then let me just draw the rest in yellow.

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,133
So they will have all expanded away from each other on the surface of this sphere.

92
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,600
Just to make it clear that this is a sphere, let me draw some contour lines.

93
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,867
So this is a contour line,

94
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:01,467
just to make it clear that we are on the surface,

95
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:05,000
we are on the surface of an actual sphere.

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,667
Now with that out of the way, let's think about

97
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:12,099
how fast or what is the apparent velocity with which things are moving away.

98
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,685
remember, we're going to say not only how far things are moving away,

99
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:20,157
but we're going to say, how far they are moving away from, if the observer is us

100
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:24,566
depending on how far they already are

101
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:29,161
we're going to do, we could say, let me write this down

102
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:31,883
all objects

103
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:43,565
all objects moving away from each other

104
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:48,513
and the velocity and the apparent velocity

105
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:54,430
apparent relative velocity

106
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,406
relative velocity

107
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:59,576
is proprotional to distance

108
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:04,831
proportional to distance

109
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:07,633
And what I've written down, this is why I wrote it down

110
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:11,695
this is a rephrasing of essentially Hobble's law.

111
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:14,564
Hubble's law

112
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,479
And he came up with this by just observing, that when he looks especially the further

113
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,291
out he looks, the more red shifted objects are and not only,

114
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,859
they were moving faster and faster away from earth, but they seem

115
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,809
to be moving faster and faster away from each other.

116
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:33,891
So this is just a restating the Hubble's law or another way to say it is

117
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,931
from anypoint, let say from the Earth,

118
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:40,493
the velocity something appears to be moving is going to be

119
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:45,224
some constant times the distance

120
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:49,023
times the distance it is away from the observer.

121
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:53,093
In this case we're the observer. And we put this little zero,

122
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:56,359
so this is H here is called Hubble's constant.

123
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:59,756
Hubbles's constant.

124
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:04,530
And it's a very non-constant constant, this constant will change depending on

125
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,020
where we are of the evolution of the Universe.

126
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,885
So we put this little zero here, this little sub-zero,

127
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:20,892
right over here to show, this is Hubble's constant right now.

128
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:24,424
And when we talk about distance, we talk about proper distance

129
00:06:24,424 --> 00:06:27,624
right now. Propper distance

130
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:29,621
now. And this has to be very important, because that proper distance

131
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:32,230
is contantly changing as the Universe expands.

132
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,119
The now will actually change slightly from the beginning of this video to the end of this video.

133
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:39,076
But we can roughly say in kind of our current

134
00:06:39,076 --> 00:06:42,960
period of time. And when we say proper distance, we're talking about

135
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,715
if you actually had rulers and you would just lay them down instantaniously.

136
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:48,893
Obviously, we can't do something like that, but we can imagine

137
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:51,557
doing something like that, so that's what we're talking about.

138
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:58,895
Just to give a sense of how fast thing are acually moving apart.

139
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:03,828
The current Hubble's constant

140
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:07,730
is, let me accualy write it where someplace i have more space,

141
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:15,763
the current Hubble's constant is 70.6 +/-

142
00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:17,939
3.1, so we have observed

143
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:22,028
some varriation here, there is I guess some error to

144
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:25,028
our actual measurement, kilometers

145
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:34,073
per second per megaparsec.

146
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:38,826
And remember parsec is roughly 3.2

147
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,162
3.2 to 3.3 light years

148
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:42,869
so another way to thing about it is, if this is

149
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:49,355
where we are in the Universe right now and if this is

150
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:52,028
and if this object right over here, if this distance right over here,

151
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:55,086
is one megaparsec, so one

152
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:59,088
million parsens or 3.2

153
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:02,398
million light years from Earth.

154
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:06,518
So this is roughly, so just so we have a sense, this is 3.2

155
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:08,761
6 roughly, 3.26 million

156
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:13,294
light years from Earth, than this object will

157
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:18,028
appear to be moving away, althought it's not moving in space, just the space

158
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:20,535
that it is in is stratching in such a way, that it looks to be moving

159
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:22,770
at 70, it looks like it's moving

160
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,631
70, based on it's redshift, 70.6

161
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:31,362
kilometers per second away from us

162
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:34,882
So this is huuuge velocity, 70.6

163
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:39,229
kilometers per second, per second! So this is

164
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,495
a pretty fast velocity

165
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,437
But we have to remember, this is over one megaparsec

166
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:49,496
the Andromeda galaxy is not even a megaparsec

167
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:53,173
away, it's about 2.5 million light years, it's about

168
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:56,222
0.7 or 0.8 of a megaparsec. So if you look

169
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:59,745
at the points in space little bit further, than the Andromeda galaxy,

170
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:02,426
it will look to be right now receiving 70.6

171
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:05,353
kilometers per hour

172
00:09:05,353 --> 00:09:10,283
If you would look at something, that is almost 7 light years away,

173
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,869
2 megaparsecs away, so if you look at

174
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:18,696
this object over here,

175
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:22,937
how fast would that be receding

176
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,693
It's two megaparsecs away, so it's gonna be twice

177
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:29,769
this. You just gonna multiply it's distance two megaparsecs times

178
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,028
this, the megaparsecs cancels out, so 70.6

179
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:38,268
times 2 is, so it's going to be moving

180
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:40,628
or it's going to look to be moving, it's not mooving in space, remember,

181
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:44,560
the space is stratching. It's velocity, it's apparent velocity

182
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,688
will be 70.6. times 2, so that's 141.2

183
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:51,762
141.2 kilometers per second

184
00:09:51,762 --> 00:09:55,427
And this is, one question, how did Hubble know

185
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:59,008
You know, it's easy to observe the red shift of objects moving away from us,

186
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:02,159
but did he know, that they are moving away from each other?

187
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,015
Look at the red shift of this object, wow that's moving away moving away at 70.6

188
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:09,094
kilometers per second and than you'd look at the red shift of this and say: wow,

189
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:13,485
that's moving away from us at 141.2 kilometers per second

190
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:16,828
then you also know, that these two objects

191
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:19,761
are moving away from each other at 70.6

192
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:22,487
kilometers per second

193
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:28,065
and we can keep doing this over different distances. But hopefully this gives you a little bit more

194
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:30,885
a little big bigger sense of thing. And just remember, even thought I said this is

195
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:34,151
a huge distance, a mega parsec, further than it is to

196
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:39,151
the Andromeda galaxy. The Andromeda galaxy is the nearest large galaxy

197
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:42,885
to us, there are some smaller galaxies to us , that are kind of satelites

198
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:46,152
galaxies around the Milky way, but the Andromeda is the largest galaxz

199
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:51,264
nearest large galaxy to us, but we also know

200
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:53,763
that, we are talking about hundreds of billions of galaxies in

201
00:10:53,763 --> 00:10:57,884
just the observable universe

202
00:10:57,884 --> 00:11:01,672
So very quickly as you go near the edge of the observable universe

203
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:04,434
these velocities

204
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:08,598
aparent distance start to become

205
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:11,533
prety significant.
