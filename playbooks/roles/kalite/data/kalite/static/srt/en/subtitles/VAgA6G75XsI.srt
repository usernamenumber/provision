1
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:06,221
When I was studying ancient Rome

2
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:08,032
one of the most difficult things for me to understand is

3
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:11,257
how all of these ancient ruins fit together,

4
00:00:11,257 --> 00:00:13,569
but luckily we have Dr. Bernard Frischer

5
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:16,590
who has built an extraordinary video simulation

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,057
that allows us to move through this space.

7
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:21,026
The difficulty is always two-fold.

8
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:23,864
First of all, that ancient cities are now in ruins

9
00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:25,448
so the one problem we have is

10
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:27,598
how do you go from ruins to the way

11
00:00:27,598 --> 00:00:28,854
it did look in antiquity.

12
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:30,804
Secondly, we only have random ruins,

13
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:31,630
we don't have everything.

14
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,858
So even if you can visualize what the Pantheon looks like

15
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:34,768
or the Colosseum,

16
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,024
they are a mile apart in the city .

17
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:38,985
What was everything else? Most of it is missing.

18
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:41,494
So the visualization is trying to put the whole city together

19
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:43,247
And so let's take a look. Okay.

20
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:44,877
It is just beautiful.

21
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:48,365
We're now flying low over the city, over the Tibre.

22
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,028
It's a good place to start because you know,

23
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:52,344
the Tibre does divide Rome into two parts.

24
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:55,180
And I see in the distance a very large temple.

25
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,504
That's the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

26
00:00:58,504 --> 00:00:59,936
Jupiter, the best and the greatest,

27
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:03,039
which was the main temple of the Roman state cult.

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,431
And it's on top of the Capitoline Hill

29
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,733
which because of this temple and some others,

30
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,090
was considered the center of the state cult

31
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,262
and the state religion.

32
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:14,137
So what moment in Rome's history have you chosen?

33
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:16,709
This is notionally the year 320 AD,

34
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,641
the peak of Rome's urban development,

35
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,142
certainly in terms of public architecture

36
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:22,342
for the simple reason that

37
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:24,974
the Emperor at this time was Constantine the Great

38
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:26,440
and shortly after this year

39
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,255
he moved the capital from Rome

40
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,037
to his city of Constantinople.

41
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:32,309
Ok so we're flying up the river

42
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:36,441
and after the Capitoline Hill we see the Palatine Hill,

43
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:39,701
another one of the seven canonical hills of Rome.

44
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:43,194
And the Palatine is obvious to anybody who visits Rome.

45
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:44,635
If you're in the forum,

46
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:47,207
this is the great hill with the palaces.

47
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,736
In fact, the word palace derives from the word Palatine.

48
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:52,459
The Romans, as time went on in their history,

49
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,833
said "where ever the emperor is, there the palace is,"

50
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,306
or the paletine. So, the term palace got detached

51
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:58,908
from this physical hill

52
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:01,907
and came to just mean "a place where the ruler lives".

53
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:04,108
And actually as we're flying past

54
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:05,853
what is the Circus Maximus,

55
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:08,801
I see the imperial palace, it is so large.

56
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:11,262
It is literally enveloped the entire hillside.

57
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:12,866
We have to remember this was not only

58
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,832
where the emperor lived, and his family with him,

59
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:17,314
but it was also the center of the government.

60
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:19,895
any important relationship

61
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:22,657
between this enormous circus and the palace?

62
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:24,089
They are in fact connected

63
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:26,965
and the Emperor was a great giver of the circus games

64
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:31,175
and could easily come down to the Imperial box

65
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:32,321
from the palace,

66
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:33,266
or if he even wanted

67
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:36,050
he could watch the circus races at the Palace.

68
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,362
So we're not talking about Barnum & Bailey,

69
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:40,924
we're talking about sporting events.

70
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:43,116
We're mainly talking about chariot races.

71
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:46,119
Think Ben Hur, the very famous chariot race scenes.

72
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:47,460
And there were also animal hunts,

73
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,062
there were parades, religious processions,

74
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:51,623
and the triumphal processions.

75
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:54,135
So let's go into the city proper. We know that

76
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:57,663
Rome was this mercantile culture that has real markets.

77
00:02:57,663 --> 00:02:59,204
How much do we know about

78
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:01,509
the daily lives of the inhabitants?

79
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:02,686
We know a huge amount.

80
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:05,818
We know about their hundreds of trades and professions,

81
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,360
the different social classes.

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,768
We know about their diet, we know about their longevity.

83
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:12,884
The scholars have really reconstructed in great detail

84
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:14,274
what everyday life was like.

85
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:15,713
So one of the most impressive structures

86
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:19,156
that I'm seeing is this aqueduct, this highway for water.

87
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:21,186
Yeah, the Romans are famous for their aqueducts.

88
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:22,934
They never could have had their big city

89
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:24,324
of a million or even the 2 million that

90
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:26,456
we're now seeing without the aqueducts

91
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,861
that brought water in from

92
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:29,234
20 or 30 miles away in the mountains.

93
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:32,384
They kept this gravitational sytem working

94
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:34,730
by getting the sources up into the mountains,

95
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,895
bringing it down into the city

96
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:38,519
and the valley which gave the force to the water.

97
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,529
And they were able to somehow calculate

98
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:43,215
a slope of even just 1 foot every 2000 feet,

99
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:44,242
which is remarkable.

100
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:46,456
We don't know how they could measure so accurately

101
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:49,116
so that the water kept moving gently downhill

102
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:50,684
but relentlessly downhill.

103
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:52,349
There is this kind of ambition,

104
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,953
this notion that man can control nature.

105
00:03:54,953 --> 00:03:58,853
It does not need to build a city where the water is already,

106
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:02,056
but one can actually bend nature to man's will.

107
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:04,334
The Romans were remarkable engineers.

108
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,654
They used the water for drinking purposes,

109
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:07,560
obviously cooking, and so on.

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,564
But also a lot of these aqueducts

111
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:11,118
ended at great fountains,

112
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,995
but also in the great public baths.

113
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:16,629
So this area seems to be sort of set apart from

114
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,472
this denser, urban part of the city,

115
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:20,250
and these are the baths of Trajan.

116
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,467
Yes, these were not the first public baths,

117
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:23,977
but they were the baths

118
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:26,583
that gave the standard design for public baths.

119
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,282
Block of bathing buildings

120
00:04:28,282 --> 00:04:30,000
in the middle of a kind of garden area,

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,544
delimited by a wall.

122
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:34,583
And we were talking earlier about the way

123
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,273
in which the emperors would provide for

124
00:04:36,273 --> 00:04:37,340
the well- being of the city,

125
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,480
and this is really a prime example.

126
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,542
So now we are moving to some of the most

127
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,674
well known monuments in ancient Rome.

128
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:43,997
The Colosseum.

129
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:46,389
But we're in a fairly late moment in Roman history.

130
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,165
Before the Colosseum, wasn't there another palace here?

131
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:49,750
There was.

132
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,324
The Colosseum was built by the emperor of Vespasian,

133
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:56,097
who became emperor in 69 AD.

134
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:59,945
After the suicide of Nero, a very unpopular emperor.

135
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:02,493
One of the reasons he was so unpopular was that

136
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:04,364
after the great fire of 64 AD

137
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:06,237
in which a lot of the city was destroyed,

138
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:09,253
he took over 100 acres in the heart of the city

139
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:10,972
and converted it from private property

140
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:13,596
to his own personal use as a palace.

141
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:14,984
The Golden House of Nero.

142
00:05:14,984 --> 00:05:18,016
And the Colosseum was actually a lake in that palace.

143
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,202
And Vespasian,

144
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:21,095
to show that he was a friend of the people,

145
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:23,326
filled in that lake and built a Colosseum on top of it.

146
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:26,400
The Colosseum was not originally called the Colosseum.

147
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,552
No. That's a term that

148
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:29,384
only goes back to the early middle ages.

149
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:31,758
The Romans called it the Flavian Amphitheatre

150
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:34,844
because the Vespasians' family name was Flavius,

151
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:36,303
so Flavian.

152
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,846
And it's an Amphitheatre, or kind of a double theatre,

153
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:40,477
an oval in shape.

154
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:42,513
The Romans certainly didn't call it Colosseum,

155
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:45,032
but they did call this enormous statue the Colossus.

156
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:46,532
It's a statue of the sun god.

157
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:49,542
Now you have mentioned that this is the moment

158
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,338
when Constantine rules Rome

159
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:53,715
and has not yet moved the capital to the east.

160
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:55,680
And it's interesting to look at his arch,

161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,146
the arch of Constantine,

162
00:05:57,146 --> 00:05:59,124
and realize that this is brand new.

163
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:00,780
It's only a couple of years old,

164
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,299
Constantine left Rome after he defeated Maxentius

165
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:06,032
at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge.

166
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,054
As far as we know,

167
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:08,700
he never came back to Rome to actually see it.

168
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,032
So we've just risen over the edge of the Colosseum

169
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:13,199
and we're looking down.

170
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,613
This is in a way, a mirror of Roman society.

171
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:17,796
The best seats are the ones farthest down,

172
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:19,262
closest to the arena,

173
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:21,456
and that was reserved for the emperor,

174
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:24,224
top office holders, priests, and so on.

175
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:25,914
Then behind them were the senators.

176
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:27,564
Behind them, the wealthy business men.

177
00:06:27,564 --> 00:06:30,932
And behind them, the free born, normal citizens.

178
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:35,319
At the very top, sat women, slaves, and foreigners.

179
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,907
So what were they coming to watch?

180
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:38,610
As we can see now what's going on

181
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,530
is the main thing that we associate with the Colosseum,

182
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,237
the gladiatorial combats.

183
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:43,508
Another thing that went on here that

184
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:46,208
the Romans loved was hunts of wild animals.

185
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,106
The third thing is the execution of criminals.

186
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:51,255
Often in very colorful ways.

187
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:53,397
Ways we would find very cruel.

188
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:56,769
So let's make a left turn and move towards the forum.

189
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:58,875
What is that enormous temple?

190
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,496
It's the biggest temple of the state religion.

191
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:03,187
It's the temple of Venus and Rome.

192
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:05,267
It was built by the emperor Hadrian.

193
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:06,555
It's actually interesting because

194
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:08,071
it's two temples back-to-back.

195
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,569
One part of it is dedicated to the worship

196
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:12,025
of the goddess, Venus.

197
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:13,569
That's the one facing the Coliseum.

198
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:16,029
The other, to the goddess, Roma, that's facing the forum.

199
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,736
And there seems to be a reason for that.

200
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:19,435
Venus is looking at the Colosseum

201
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:21,042
which is associated with fun and games.

202
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:23,324
Otium, the Romans would say. Leisure.

203
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:26,000
Whereas Roma is a more serious goddess.

204
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,201
She's facing the forum which is the area of negotium,

205
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:30,134
or business and work.

206
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,860
Ok, so now we're moving over to the forum itself.

207
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,061
And we'll stop first at the Basilica of Maxentius,

208
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:38,417
the last of the great civic buildings

209
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,294
built in Rome before Constantine moved the capital.

210
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,688
This is a huge structure

211
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:45,448
and the word Basilica is familiar to us.

212
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:47,233
We often call churches "basilicas" now.

213
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,679
For the Romans it was a civic building

214
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,793
used mainly for courts,

215
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:53,834
the Christians adopted the building forum

216
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,233
because they worshipped inside,

217
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:58,667
so they adopted this preexisting building forum

218
00:07:58,667 --> 00:07:59,807
and gave it a new content.

219
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:01,238
So now we're moving into

220
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:03,326
one of the most complicated parts of Rome,

221
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:05,205
especially when you try to look at the ruins

222
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:07,726
and understand how these buildings related to each other.

223
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:10,330
I always say the forum is like the wall in Washington.

224
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,241
It's a big open public space

225
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:16,096
used for public events like parades and speeches.

226
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,425
The buildings around that open space are also public

227
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:21,931
and they are courthouses and temples.

228
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:24,155
Then, on the forum plaza are,

229
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,794
as in the case of the wall in Washington,

230
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:27,999
monuments commemorating

231
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,321
great men and important events.

232
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:31,691
Adjacent to the forum,

233
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:34,267
private property was increasingly bought up

234
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:36,639
so that each emperor could build his own forum,

235
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,408
the so called imperial fora of the emperors.

236
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:41,930
We've made a full circle

237
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,128
and we're now looking again at the Capitoline.

238
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:45,872
We're flying over the Roman forum,

239
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:46,779
we'll acutally come back to it.

240
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,519
We're flying over the Capitoline hill,

241
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,239
we can see the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus,

242
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,447
and we're going beyond, back to the river,

243
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:55,814
where we find a big flat area of Rome

244
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:57,175
called the Campus Martius,

245
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:58,402
the field of Mars.

246
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:00,701
It was called that because in the Roman republic

247
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:01,773
when there was a citizen army,

248
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:03,784
the army would meet here and train.

249
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:08,366
Now, we've just moved over this lovely squared pond,

250
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:10,297
and we're looking at the flank

251
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:13,154
of an enormously important building, the Pantheon.

252
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:14,741
The rotunda, the round part,

253
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:16,952
we wouldn't really see in antiquity.

254
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:19,324
We would see the part that has the eight columns

255
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:21,709
across the front that looks like a traditional temple.

256
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,252
We like to say that it was built as a building

257
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:26,624
with a surprise on the inside.

258
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:28,926
Because it does look like a regular

259
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:29,970
Greek or Roman temple

260
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,045
but when you get inside,

261
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:33,774
that's when you notice that there's actually a rotunda.

262
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,484
I just want to spend just a second

263
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:37,959
marvelling at the scale of this structure.

264
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:41,704
Look at those columns, they are enormous.

265
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:45,201
The ability to get stones that large upright

266
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:47,244
is just a phenomenal feat in itself.

267
00:09:47,244 --> 00:09:50,508
It's phenomenal and even more so when you consider that

268
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:52,625
this is granite, and it's all from Egypt.

269
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,637
So it was brought from very far away.

270
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:57,498
This is a building that celebrates the Roman emperors.

271
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:59,504
This building we know had statues of

272
00:09:59,504 --> 00:10:01,654
Julius Caesar and Augustus,

273
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:04,813
so we think that this building was dedicated always

274
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,693
to the worship of the emperors.

275
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:10,023
So this space opens up just magically.

276
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:12,485
It does, and the magic is really remarkable,

277
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:14,087
I've taken many visitors there,

278
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:15,203
and I've asked them

279
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:17,184
if they've had the same experience that I've had.

280
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,541
If you stop right on the threshold,

281
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,160
and you hold your head straight, I always say,

282
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,233
"what can you see?" And everybody always agrees.

283
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,907
You can see the hole in the dome up at the top,

284
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:26,824
we call it the eye.

285
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:27,769
You can see the floor,

286
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,473
and you can see the two sides left and right.

287
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:33,258
That is to say that this is a grandiose space.

288
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,631
But it's right at the limit of human vision,

289
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:38,224
and for me it always defines what is the classical,

290
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:41,534
which is always derived from the human form,

291
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:44,157
its proportions and its limitations.

292
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:46,746
And by building a building that exactly

293
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:51,515
corresponds to the limits of our vision it ennobles us.

294
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:54,292
It makes us feel as big and great

295
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:55,580
as we can feel as humans.

296
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,497
It doesn't reduce us. Had it been ten times bigger,

297
00:10:57,497 --> 00:10:59,203
we would have felt ourselves

298
00:10:59,203 --> 00:11:01,486
reduced to the size of an ant, or something.

299
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:05,205
The building is obsessively concerned with circular form.

300
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,777
But it is also concerned with squares.

301
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:09,507
We look at the floor we actually see

302
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:11,042
this play of squares and circles.

303
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:12,828
And then of course there are the coffers

304
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:15,258
that create this beautiful sense of rhythm.

305
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,087
Absolutely. And notice we also there

306
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:18,450
get the play of squares and circles,

307
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,084
because these are square coffers that

308
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:21,744
give us a semi circular dome.

309
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:24,092
But what's interesting to me about it is

310
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:25,332
first of all it's painted,

311
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:25,928
when you go there today,

312
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:27,480
the paint has been completely lost.

313
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,153
In a dome of heaven motifs.

314
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:31,836
So the ground of the dome is painted blue.

315
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:34,295
The coffers are highlighted in yellow as if

316
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,590
radiating the light of the sun,

317
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,867
and in the middle were probably rosettes

318
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:40,723
that are supposed to be suns or stars.

319
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:43,276
And even in antiquity we know from a historian

320
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:44,839
who wrote only a hundred years

321
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,244
after the building was built.

322
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:47,751
People wondered, how did they build the dome?

323
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:49,136
How could they do that?

324
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:51,093
They marvelled at it even in antiquity.

325
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:52,804
The light is very interesting.

326
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:56,149
If you look at the coffering, you can get the idea that

327
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:00,337
you know the light from the eye is going to

328
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:02,917
direct the sunbeams to different coffers

329
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:04,893
at different times of day, on different days of the year.

330
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:07,288
Recent scholarship suggests that

331
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:09,005
this wasn't really a sundial,

332
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,740
but there was a play of the passage of time

333
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,674
and a play of light on space to indicate

334
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:15,404
the passage of time during the year.

335
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:17,447
There is though one alignment

336
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:19,066
that seems to be very intentional

337
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:22,656
and that is the sunlight coming through the eye

338
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:25,203
at noon on April 21

339
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,076
exactly illuminated the main door of the Pantheon.

340
00:12:28,076 --> 00:12:30,673
Remember Hadrian was the man

341
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:33,270
responsible for the Pantheon in this phase.

342
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,206
April 21 was the birthday festival of Rome,

343
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:38,542
and Hadrian's very interested in the birthday festival,

344
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:41,275
changed the name to the Romaea festival

345
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:42,940
in honor of the goddess Roma.

346
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,060
He seems to have aligned the building in such a way that

347
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,773
there would be this dramatic effect at noon,

348
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:49,980
and we can only imagine that

349
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,414
there must of been some sort of birthday festival

350
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:53,614
happening in the Pantheon that day.

351
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:56,323
So let's move back down to the forum now.

352
00:12:56,323 --> 00:12:58,481
Some of the main roads going through the city

353
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:00,352
met here in the forum,

354
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:03,002
it's a place that the average Roman

355
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:05,177
on an average day might well pass through.

356
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:06,741
As the camera pulls back

357
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:09,793
and we can really see the full extent of the city,

358
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:12,398
you really understand how complex,

359
00:13:12,398 --> 00:13:14,585
how advanced this ancient world was.

360
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,971
How many buildings were here, do we think?

361
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:20,274
We have two censuses from the fourth century AD that

362
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:21,477
suggest there were

363
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:23,580
between eight and ten thousand buildings here.

364
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,970
We think the population

365
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,513
might have been between one and two million.

366
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:29,325
The total surface area was about

367
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,452
twenty-five square kilometers,

368
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:33,536
so it was the biggest city in the Western world anyway

369
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,609
until 19th Century London.
