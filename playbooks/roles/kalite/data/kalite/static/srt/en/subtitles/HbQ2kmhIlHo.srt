1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
   

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,690
[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,890
What I want to do in this video
is to give you the gist

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:17,460
of what the Roth IRA
is all about.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,360
And just to get an idea of why
it's called the Roth IRA, it's

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,780
named after William Roth, the
late senator from Delaware.

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,510
He helped, I guess you could
say, shepherd this legislation

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,850
in 1997 when it was first
passed, so they named

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,250
the IRA after him.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,260
   

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,630
So that's where the word comes
from, so it's a special type

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,060
of individual retirement
account.

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,840
So why did they go to the
trouble of creating a new one?

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,250
So let's think about what
a traditional IRA does.

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,580
And then I'll talk about why a
Roth IRA could be interesting,

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,830
or it's a little bit different,
or why it could be

17
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,460
beneficial.

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,540
And then we'll actually
see it in an example.

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,280
So the first question is, what
happens when you put money

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,510
into a traditional
or Roth IRA?

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,830
In the traditional IRA video,
you saw that it is

22
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,080
tax-deferred.

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,360
   

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,800
That if you were to put $5,000
in your traditional IRA, you

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,830
are not taxed on that money.

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,430
In the Roth IRA, it
is not deferred.

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,700
So you would actually pay
taxes on that $5,000.

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,350
So immediately, you're saying,
hey, gee you know, this

29
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,000
doesn't seem like that
great of a thing.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,820
Why would I ever use it?

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,100
I have to pay taxes on
the money I put in.

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,500
And this is the interesting
thing, in both situations, as

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,390
long as your investments stay
in the either traditional or

34
00:01:44,390 --> 00:02:00,450
Roth accounts, earnings are not
taxed while in account.

35
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,570
This is true for both of them.

36
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,170
But you're still going to say,
hey Sal, the traditional still

37
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,950
looks a lot better.

38
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,160
I have to pay taxes on the Roth
right from the get-go.

39
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,150
I didn't have to pay it
on the traditional.

40
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,190
And then they can both grow
and I can buy and sell my

41
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,700
stocks or I invest in mutual
funds, whatever I

42
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,660
do inside of them.

43
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,920
I don't pay taxes, the

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,980
traditional still looks better.

45
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,880
Now the interesting thing
is what happens when you

46
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,120
withdraw the money.

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,460
So there's a lot of special
circumstances on when a

48
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,860
withdrawal is qualified or not,
I'm not going to go and

49
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,120
all the details, I really just
want to give you the essence

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,600
of why the Roth is
interesting.

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,000
So let's say you're over 59 and
1/2 years old and in the

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,370
Roth, and your money's been
there for more than five

53
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,490
years, it's been seasoned.

54
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,480
I'm not going to all
the particulars.

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,490
So in the traditional IRA, when
you withdraw-- so let's

56
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:57,420
say we're older than 59 and 1/2
for both, and then we do a

57
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:04,780
withdrawal -- in the
traditional IRA,

58
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,030
you have to pay taxes.

59
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,410
   

60
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,350
You're taxed ordinary
income tax.

61
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:17,010
   

62
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,600
While in the Roth
IRA, no taxes.

63
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,910
   

64
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,520
And we saw in the traditional
IRA video, that this tends to

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,370
be pretty good.

66
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,560
When you're older than 59 and a
half, you might be retired,

67
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,570
you might be in the lower tax
bracket, so you're going to

68
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,190
pay the lower taxes on it.

69
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,110
And it's been differed for
however many years your IRA

70
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,470
has been in existence.

71
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,520
Now this is especially
interesting, because over here

72
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,450
you paid tax just on
the original amount

73
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,470
that you put in.

74
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,450
And then you allow that original
amount to grow over

75
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,110
many, many, many, years and that
all of a sudden you're

76
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,200
not taxed at all.

77
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,240
So that all of a sudden
becomes a little bit

78
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,490
interesting.

79
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,336
This seems like a pretty good
thing to have, and we're going

80
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,220
to actually play with
the numbers to see

81
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,770
how they work out.

82
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,640
Now the other interesting thing
about the Roth is if you

83
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:19,709
early withdrawal, for
traditional a IRA you pay 10%

84
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:26,400
penalty on the withdrawal,
plus you get taxed.

85
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,930
On the Roth IRA, if you're
just taking the original

86
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,280
amount you put in-- and I'll
do this with a numerical

87
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,750
example-- if you're just taking
out your principal

88
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,470
amount, no taxes or penalty
on the principal.

89
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:57,820
   

90
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,230
And you would only have to
pay-- even if it's a

91
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,700
non-qualified withdrawl, and
there's all these special

92
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,540
circumstances what's qualified
and I'm not going to go to the

93
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:13,000
details-- you would only have
to pay the 10% penalty and

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,250
taxes on earnings.

95
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,470
   

96
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,300
And one of the main reasons why
I'm not going into all the

97
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,330
details is, one, it would make
the video a little confusing.

98
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,310
But also, the government
is constantly

99
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,580
changing the details.

100
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,300
So I want you to be able to
watch these videos many years

101
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,290
in the future and it not to be
dated, so I don't want to go

102
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,360
into all of the different things
that the government is

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,390
changing from year to year.

104
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,420
But let's just do a very basic
example just to get

105
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,790
the sense of things.

106
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:47,890
So let's look at a traditional
IRA and then we have a Roth,

107
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,610
let me write IRA just to be
clear that we're talking about

108
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,860
an IRA in both circumstances.

109
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,250
So let's say my original income
amount, let's say I

110
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,150
made more than $5,000, I'll
just use $5,000 thousand

111
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,380
dollars as my example.

112
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,010
And also make another note, Roth
IRA is subject to more

113
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,370
limitations in terms of your
total overall income.

114
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,210
And that's also changing, so I
don't want to be specific on

115
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,620
the numbers.

116
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,010
You could look that up.

117
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,470
But there are ways that you can
transfer traditional IRAs

118
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,020
into Roth IRAs, so that's kind
of a little bit of a loophole

119
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,130
on being able to get around some
of those restrictions.

120
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,540
But anyway, I won't go into the
details just yet, but just

121
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,910
remember Roth IRAs there are
some more limitations on

122
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,990
whether or not you can
put things into it.

123
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,410
But if you're tricky,
you might be able

124
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,140
to get around them.

125
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,530
So let's say you have $5,000.

126
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,700
And just so you know, the limits
on IRAs-- they apply to

127
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,720
Roth or traditional or any
combination of the two-- so if

128
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
you're starting with $5,000.

129
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,330
So in the traditional IRA, you
have 0 taxes initially.

130
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,980
In your Roth IRA initially,
let's say you have a 32% tax

131
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:04,360
bracket, just like in the
previous video, then you'll

132
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,580
pay 32% on $5,000.

133
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:19,440
That's 0.32 times $5,000,
that's $1,600.

134
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,800
So you're going to pay
$1,600 in taxes.

135
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,780
So your amount in the account--
so in your account,

136
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:36,350
your principal in your
traditional IRA-- maybe I

137
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,400
should write it out here--
starting with that $5,000,

138
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:49,860
your principal is going
to be $5,000 here.

139
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,240
And it's going to only
be-- you have to take

140
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,130
$1,600 out for taxes.

141
00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:03,910
So it's only going to be
$3,400 right there.

142
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,380
Now let's say in either
situation, you were to take

143
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,670
that, invest it in some stocks,
and then five years

144
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,640
later it doubles.

145
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,280
So let's say at some future
point it doubles, and you sell

146
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,770
those stocks.

147
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,800
So that becomes $10,000 in your
account there, and then

148
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,920
this you invested in stocks
and it doubles.

149
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,520
This becomes $7,800 in your
account right here.

150
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,309
So this is 10 years--
I think I said five

151
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,429
years into the future.

152
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:43,840
I'm just picking that
into the future.

153
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,440
And let's say we're still not 59
and 1/2 years old just yet.

154
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,580
Now, we could just continue to
leave either of these amounts

155
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,690
in our account until we're 59
and 1/2, but let's say we have

156
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,380
some type of need.

157
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,170
We need to give a loan to our
brother-in-law or something,

158
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,940
so we really want to have
access to this money.

159
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,310
So let's look at the situation
where we withdraw.

160
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,170
If we were to withdraw-- well
let's think of a couple of

161
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,730
situations-- if we were
to withdraw $3,400.

162
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,240
Let's say that's exactly
what my brother-in-law

163
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,210
needs, just right now.

164
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:27,020
So if we were to withdraw $3,400
in the traditional IRA

165
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:33,660
sense, so we take out $3,400.

166
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,170
We're going to have to do two
things: First, we're going to

167
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,100
have to pay taxes on it, so
we're going to have to pay 32%

168
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,490
of that, assuming we're still
in the same tax bracket.

169
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:50,820
So $3,400 times 0.32 is equal
to-- we're going to have to

170
00:09:50,820 --> 00:10:02,150
pay $1,088 in taxes.

171
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,270
And we're also going to have
to pay a penalty on this

172
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,380
entire amount, on the $3,400.

173
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:13,540
So we're also going to have to
pay 10% penalty, $340 penalty.

174
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,060
So we're going to be left with,
after paying all of

175
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:23,620
this, this is-- let me get the
calculator out-- we're going

176
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:30,470
to be left with $3,400
minus $1,088 minus

177
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,850
$340 is equal to $1,972.

178
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,230
So we're left with $1,972.

179
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,160
Now in the Roth IRA, when you
needed that money all of a

180
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,730
sudden and you decided to
withdraw it early, and we're

181
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,800
only taking out $3,400.

182
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,860
So we're taking them out,
the amount that was

183
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,140
our original principal.

184
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,760
In the Roth IRA, we get the
$3,400, because that was our

185
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,110
original amount, and we pay
no taxes or penalties.

186
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,580
So at any point in time on the
Roth IRA, you can always take

187
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,900
your principal out.

188
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,010
In the other types of IRAs, not
only will you have to pay

189
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,920
taxes on it, but you're also
going to have to pay a penalty

190
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,710
on top of that.

191
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,830
So with the Roth IRA, one of the
very positive things is,

192
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,150
it gives you a lot
of flexibility.

193
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,580
Now, let's say you want needed
to withdraw, I don't know,

194
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:26,980
let's say you needed
to withdraw $4,000.

195
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,530
This is another scenario.

196
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,485
$4,000 at this same
point in time.

197
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:35,660
In the traditional IRA scenario,
once again you're

198
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,435
going to have to pay 32% of that
in taxes, so you're going

199
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:47,480
to have to pay $4,000 times 32%
in taxes and you're also

200
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,710
going to have to
pay plus $400.

201
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:58,420
In the Roth IRA case, you pay
nothing, you get the original

202
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:04,110
principal you put in, that was
your original amount, $3,400.

203
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,200
In all of this, I'm assuming
that we're not 59 and 1/2

204
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,560
years old just yet.

205
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,940
So in the Roth situation, you
get the $3,400 free and clear,

206
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:20,110
tax and penalty free, but the
other $600, you're going to

207
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,930
have to pay 32% taxes, or
whatever your tax bracket is,

208
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,840
and then you're also going to
have to pay $60, a 10% penalty

209
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,930
on just the earnings portion.

210
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,090
Remember, $3,400 was
your principal.

211
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,440
Then if you want to take $4,000,
the $600 extra, that's

212
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
stuff that you earned,
that stuff that was

213
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,030
grown from the principal.

214
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,970
So you're going to have to pay
plus another $60 penalty.

215
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,160
But it's still a much better
situation, if you do the math,

216
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,990
then this one here.

217
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,870
So in general, if you're not
sure whether you're going to

218
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,020
need that money before you
retire, the Roth gives you a

219
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,560
lot more flexibility.

220
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,130
Now let's go all the
way to retirement.

221
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,020
   

222
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,510
Let's say we never withdrew
any money.

223
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,600
We invested in another stock,
and so we go 10 years later.

224
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,480
So we never withdrew
any money.

225
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,160
We're just going to look at
the retirement situation.

226
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,620
And we go to our stock, and
we sell it, our new stock.

227
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,090
We get $20,000 there.

228
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:24,080
Here we get $15,600.

229
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,420
And, of course, in both of these
situations, it's great

230
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,830
that we're able to buy and sell
stocks inside of these

231
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,010
retirement accounts
and not pay taxes.

232
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,180
If these weren't sitting in
retirement accounts, every

233
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,010
time we bought and sold the
stocks, we would have to pay

234
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,360
capital gains tax.

235
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,350
And you saw that in the
previous video.

236
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:47,760
Now that we are older, let's say
we're 60 years old, we can

237
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,780
now withdraw our money from
either situation.

238
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,840
There's some other little
stipulations, your money has

239
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,090
to be seasoned, has to be
sitting there for five years

240
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,700
and all that, but I won't
go into the details.

241
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,950
But let's see what happens when
we withdraw the money.

242
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,620
Let's say we have a 25%
tax bracket now.

243
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,380
   

244
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,950
So we're a retiree, we're
earning a little bit less

245
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,190
money, we are in a lower
tax bracket.

246
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,050
In this situation, when we
withdraw from a traditional

247
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:21,890
IRA, we are going to pay 25% in
taxes, which is $5,000 in

248
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:27,390
taxes, and we are going to
be left with $15,000 for

249
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,560
ourselves to spend in our
retirement years.

250
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,830
In the Roth IRA situation, once
we're over 60 years old,

251
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,710
our tax bracket doesn't matter,
we just get the money.

252
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:46,650
$15,600 free and clear.

253
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,300
So if you think about it in
either situation, when we

254
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,110
withdrew early, the Roth IRA
was much more forgiving,

255
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,610
especially if we would draw less
than the amount that we

256
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,290
originally put in, $3,400.

257
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,440
The Roth IRA does not tax
us or give us penalties.

258
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,660
It only does that on any money
that we earn, any money in

259
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,930
excess of the $3,400.

260
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,620
The traditional IRA taxes
us and penalizes us on

261
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,430
everything.

262
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,090
And then even when we go into
the future, remember, in the

263
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:19,750
traditional IRA, we didn't pay
any taxes to begin with, but

264
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,490
we had to pay taxes
to end with.

265
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,320
So when we pay taxes in the end,
we're paying taxes not

266
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,830
just on what we put in
initially, we're also paying

267
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,270
taxes on all of our cumulative
earnings, right?

268
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,780
We originally put in
$5,000, now we're

269
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,680
paying taxes on $20,000.

270
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,360
So we're only going to
end up with $15,000.

271
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,840
While in the Roth IRA, we don't
pay taxes on anything,

272
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,810
for, I guess, in return for
being willing to pay our taxes

273
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,710
front-loaded, to pay them in the
beginning, we never have

274
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,660
to pay taxes on that money or
on any of the earnings that

275
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,370
that money makes.

276
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,370
Now, I fixed the numbers here to
make them close, depending

277
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,690
on your tax bracket before and
after, or how much growth you

278
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,090
actually see in your earnings,
one may be better than the

279
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,750
other, but these are important
considerations.

280
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,260
So I just want to let you
know the pros and cons.

281
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,230
The Roth IRA tends to be better
in terms of giving you

282
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,400
the flexibility and never
not worrying to pay

283
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,230
taxes at the end.

284
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,130
And there's one other thing--
and this is, you know,

285
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,460
depending on how you view life,
it might be a minor

286
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,460
thing-- in the traditional
IRA, when you're 70 and a

287
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,580
half, they force withdrawal.

288
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,650
   

289
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,930
And then, of course,
you have to start

290
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,740
paying taxes on things.

291
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,100
In a Roth IRA, there's
no age limit.

292
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,600
   

293
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,010
So that's another consideration
you might want

294
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,260
to take into.

295
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,760
   

296
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,010
