1
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:08,157
A strong cipher is one which disguises your fingerprint.

2
00:00:08,957 --> 00:00:10,840
To make a lighter fingerprint

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,274
is to flatten this distribution of letter frequencies.

4
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:18,935
By the mid 15th century,

5
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,266
we had advanced the polyalphabetic ciphers

6
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:23,357
to accomplish this.

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:28,167
Imagine Alice and Bob shared a secret shift word.

8
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:30,766
First, Alice converts the word into numbers

9
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:33,223
according of the letter position in the alphabet.

10
00:00:33,223 --> 00:00:37,830
Next, this sequence of numbers is repeated along the message.

11
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:41,981
Then each letter in the message is encrypted

12
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:44,160
by shifting according to the number below it.

13
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:48,809
Now, she's using multiple shifts instead of a single shift

14
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,637
across the message as Caesar had done before.

15
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,626
Then, the encrypted message is sent openly to Bob.

16
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:01,626
Bob decrypts the message by subtracting the shifts

17
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:04,859
according to the secret word he also has a copy of.

18
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:08,042
Now imagine a codebreaker, Eve,

19
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:10,173
intercepts a series of messages

20
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:12,642
and calculates the letter frequencies,

21
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:18,043
she'll find a flatter distribution or a lighter fingerprint,

22
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:20,592
so how could she break this?

23
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:26,169
Remember, codebreakers look for information leaked,

24
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,382
the same as finding a partial fingerprint.

25
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:32,411
Any time there's a differential in letter frequencies,

26
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,929
a leak of information occurs.

27
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:39,826
This difference is caused by repetition in the encrypted message.

28
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:45,911
In this case, Alice's cipher contains a repeating code word.

29
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,096
To break the encryption, Eve would first need to determine

30
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:55,567
the length of the shift word used, not the word itself.

31
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:56,922
She'll need to go through

32
00:01:56,922 --> 00:02:00,487
and check the frequency distribution of different intervals.

33
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:04,430
When she checks the frequency distribution of every fifth letter,

34
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,648
the fingerprint will reveal itself.

35
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:10,144
The problem now, is to break five Caesar ciphers

36
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:12,821
in a repeating sequence.

37
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:14,726
Individually, this is a trivial task

38
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:17,136
as we have seen before,

39
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:19,740
the added strength of the cipher is the time taken

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,909
to determine the length of shift word used.

41
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:26,909
The longer the shift word, the stronger the cipher.
