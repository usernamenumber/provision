1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,230
This problem is from chapter
five of the Kotz, Treichel,

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,860
Townsend Chemistry and Chemical
Reactivity textbook.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,280
So they tell us, suppose you
want to know the enthalpy

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,090
change-- so the change in
total energy-- for the

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,140
formation of methane, CH4,
from solid carbon as a

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,410
graphite-- that's right there--
and hydrogen gas.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,640
So we want to figure
out the enthalpy

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,590
change of this reaction.

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,130
How do we get methane-- how
much energy is absorbed or

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,670
released when methane is formed
from the reaction of--

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,740
solid carbon as graphite
and hydrogen gas?

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,080
So they tell us the enthalpy
change for this reaction

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,590
cannot to be measured in the
laboratory because the

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,440
reaction is very slow.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,470
So normally, if you could
measure it you would have this

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,320
reaction happening and you'd
kind of see how much heat, or

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,140
what's the temperature change,
of the surrounding solution.

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,820
Maybe this is happening so slow
that it's very hard to

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,380
measure that temperature change,
or you can't do it in

21
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,600
any meaningful way.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,140
We can, however, measure
enthalpy changes for the

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,660
combustion of carbon, hydrogen,
and methane.

24
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,420
So they're giving us the
enthalpy changes for these

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,660
combustion reactions--
combustion of carbon,

26
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,760
combustion of hydrogen,
combustion of methane.

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,050
And they say, use this
information to calculate the

28
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,410
change in enthalpy for
the formation of

29
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,370
methane from its elements.

30
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,440
So any time you see this kind
of situation where they're

31
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,740
giving you the enthalpies for a
bunch of reactions and they

32
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,740
say, hey, we don't know the
enthalpy for some other

33
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,710
reaction, and that other
reaction seems to be made up

34
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,590
of similar things, your brain
should immediately say, hey,

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,530
maybe this is a Hess's
Law problem.

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,960
Hess's Law.

37
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,450
And all Hess's Law says is that
if a reaction is the sum

38
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,610
of two or more other reactions,
then the change in

39
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,520
enthalpy of this reaction is
going to be the sum of the

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,890
change in enthalpies
of those reactions.

41
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,600
Now, when we look at this, and
this tends to be the confusing

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,240
part, how can you construct
this reaction out of these

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,790
reactions over here?

44
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,560
And what I like to do is just
start with the end product.

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,630
So I like to start with the end
product, which is methane

46
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,120
in a gaseous form.

47
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,870
And when we look at all these
equations over here we have

48
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,100
the combustion of methane.

49
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,850
So this actually involves
methane, so

50
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,140
let's start with this.

51
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,200
But this one involves
methane and as a

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,070
reactant, not a product.

53
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,480
But what we can do is just flip
this arrow and write it

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,820
as methane as a product.

55
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,260
So if we just write this
reaction, we flip it.

56
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,090
So now we have carbon dioxide
gas-- let me write it down

57
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:35,680
here-- carbon dioxide gas plus--
I'll do this in another

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,720
color-- plus two waters-- if
we're thinking of these as

59
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,100
moles, or two molecules of
water, you could even say--

60
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,950
two molecules of water
in its liquid state.

61
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,570
That can, I guess you can say,
this would not happen

62
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,680
spontaneously because it
would require energy.

63
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,450
But if we just put this in the
reverse direction, if you go

64
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,160
in this direction you're going
to get two waters-- or two

65
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,330
oxygens, I should say-- I'll
do that in this pink color.

66
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:12,140
So two oxygens-- and that's in
its gaseous state-- plus a

67
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,390
gaseous methane.

68
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,480
   

69
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,380
CH4.

70
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,160
CH4 in a gaseous state.

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,670
And all I did is I wrote this
third equation, but I wrote it

72
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,420
in reverse order.

73
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,460
I'm going from the reactants
to the products.

74
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,220
When you go from the products
to the reactants it will

75
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,720
release 890.3 kilojoules
per moles of the

76
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,290
reaction going on.

77
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,920
But if you go the other way it
will need 890 kilojoules.

78
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,380
So the delta H here-- I'll do
this in the neutral color-- so

79
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,650
the delta H of this reaction
right here is going to be the

80
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,720
reverse of this.

81
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,290
So it's positive 890.3
kilojoules

82
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,160
per mole of the reaction.

83
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,390
All I did is I reversed
the order of this

84
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,660
reaction right there.

85
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,810
The good thing about this is I
now have something that at

86
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,690
least ends up with what
we eventually

87
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,350
want to end up with.

88
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,630
This is where we want to get.

89
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,000
This is where we want
to get eventually.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,130
Now, if we want to get there
eventually, we need to at some

91
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,000
point have some carbon dioxide,
and we have to have

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,590
at some point some water
to deal with.

93
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,410
So how can we get carbon
dioxide, and

94
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,300
how can we get water?

95
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,980
Well, these two reactions right
here-- this combustion

96
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,550
reaction gives us carbon
dioxide, this combustion

97
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,920
reaction gives us water.

98
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,380
So we can just rewrite those.

99
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,180
Let me just rewrite them over
here, and I will-- let me use

100
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,720
some colors.

101
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,060
So if I start with graphite--
carbon in graphite form--

102
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,630
carbon in its graphite form
plus-- I already have a color

103
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:55,980
for oxygen-- plus oxygen in
its gaseous state, it will

104
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,870
produce carbon dioxide
in its gaseous form.

105
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,430
It will produce carbon-- that's
a different shade of

106
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,840
green-- it will produce carbon
dioxide in its gaseous form.

107
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,620
And this reaction, so when you
take the enthalpy of the

108
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,370
carbon dioxide and from that you
subtract the enthalpy of

109
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,030
these reactants you get
a negative number.

110
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,120
Which means this had a lower
enthalpy, which means energy

111
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,960
was released.

112
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,440
Because there's now
less energy in the

113
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,660
system right here.

114
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,890
So this is essentially
how much is released.

115
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,180
But our change in enthalpy here,
our change in enthalpy

116
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,850
of this reaction right here,
that's reaction one.

117
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,630
I'll just rewrite it.

118
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:45,240
Minus 393.5 kilojoules
per mole of

119
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,290
the reaction occurring.

120
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,850
So the reaction occurs
a mole times.

121
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,260
This would be the
amount of energy

122
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,270
that's essentially released.

123
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,540
This is our change
in enthalpy.

124
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,300
So if this happens, we'll
get our carbon dioxide.

125
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,020
Now we also have-- and so we
would release this much energy

126
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,820
and we'd have this product to
deal with-- but we also now

127
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,780
need our water.

128
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,390
And this reaction right here
gives us our water, the

129
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,360
combustion of hydrogen.

130
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,590
So we have-- and I haven't done
hydrogen yet, so let me

131
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,770
do hydrogen in a new color.

132
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,000
That's not a new color,
so let me do blue.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,110
So right here you have hydrogen
gas-- I'm just

134
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,180
rewriting that reaction--
hydrogen gas plus 1/2 O2--

135
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:32,200
pink is my color for oxygen--
1/2 O2 gas will yield, will it

136
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,910
give us some water.

137
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:41,960
Will give us H2O, will give
us some liquid water.

138
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,820
Now, before I just write this
number down, let's think about

139
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,580
whether we have everything
we need.

140
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,250
To make this reaction occur,
because this gets us to our

141
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,000
final product, this gets
us to the gaseous

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,960
methane, we need a mole.

143
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,380
Or we can even say a molecule
of carbon dioxide, and this

144
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,460
reaction gives us exactly one
molecule of carbon dioxide.

145
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,790
So that's a check.

146
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,990
And we need two molecules
of water.

147
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,840
Now, this reaction only gives
us one molecule of water.

148
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,200
So let's multiply both sides
of the equation to get two

149
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,550
molecules of water.

150
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,280
So this is a 2, we multiply this
by 2, so this essentially

151
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,830
just disappears.

152
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,830
You multiply 1/2 by 2, you
just get a 1 there.

153
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,360
And then you put
a 2 over here.

154
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,470
So I just multiplied this
second equation by 2.

155
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,540
So I just multiplied-- this is
becomes a 1, this becomes a 2.

156
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,280
And if you're doing twice as
much of it, because we

157
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,720
multiplied by 2, the delta H
now, the change enthalpy of

158
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,950
the reaction, is now going
to be twice this.

159
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,490
Let's get the calculator out.

160
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:49,640
It's now going to be negative
285.8 times 2.

161
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,260
Because we just multiplied the
whole reaction times 2.

162
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,890
So negative 571.6.

163
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:59,470
So it's negative 571.6
kilojoules

164
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,920
per mole of the reaction.

165
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,250
Now, let's see if the
combination, if the sum of

166
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,820
these reactions, actually is
this reaction up here.

167
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,330
And to do that-- actually, let
me just copy and paste this

168
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,270
top one here because that's kind
of the order that we're

169
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,700
going to go in.

170
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,680
You don't have to, but it just
makes it hopefully a little

171
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,070
bit easier to understand.

172
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,990
So let me just copy
and paste this.

173
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,070
Actually, I could cut
and paste it.

174
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,610
Cut and then let me paste
it down here.

175
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,540
That first one.

176
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,470
And let's see now what's
going to happen.

177
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,360
   

178
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,179
To see whether the some of these
reactions really does

179
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:41,980
end up being this top reaction
right here, let's see if we

180
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,350
can cancel out reactants
and products.

181
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,690
Let's see what would happen.

182
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,730
So this produces carbon dioxide,
but then this mole,

183
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,100
or this molecule of carbon
dioxide, is then used up in

184
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,350
this last reaction.

185
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,000
So this produces it,
this uses it.

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,910
So those cancel out.

187
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,210
Let me do it in the same color
so it's in the screen.

188
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,070
This reaction produces it,
this reaction uses it.

189
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,390
Now, this reaction right
here produces the two

190
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,440
molecules of water.

191
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,660
And now this reaction down
here-- I want to do that same

192
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,960
color-- these two molecules
of water.

193
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,110
Now, this reaction down
here uses those two

194
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,920
molecules of water.

195
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,590
Now, this reaction right here,
it requires one molecule of

196
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,840
molecular oxygen.

197
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,640
This one requires another
molecule of molecular oxygen.

198
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,580
So these two combined are two
molecules of molecular oxygen.

199
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,700
So those are the reactants.

200
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,040
And in the end, those end
up as the products

201
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,130
of this last reaction.

202
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,500
So those, actually, they go into
the system and then they

203
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,250
leave out the system,
or out of the sum

204
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,060
of reactions unchanged.

205
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,730
So they cancel out
with each other.

206
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,620
So we could say that and
that we cancel out.

207
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,850
And so what are we left with?

208
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,610
What are we left with
in the reaction?

209
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,820
Well, we have some solid carbon
as graphite plus two

210
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,260
moles, or two molecules of
molecular hydrogen yielding--

211
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,530
all we have left on the product
side is some methane.

212
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,210
So it is true that the sum of
these reactions is exactly

213
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,240
what we want.

214
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,690
All we have left on the product
side is the graphite,

215
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,770
the solid graphite, plus the
molecular hydrogen, plus the

216
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,200
gaseous hydrogen-- do it
in that color-- plus

217
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,300
two hydrogen gas.

218
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:28,390
And all we have left on the
product side is the methane.

219
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,260
All we have left is the methane
in the gaseous form.

220
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,920
So it is true that the sum of
these reactions-- remember, we

221
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,020
have to flip this reaction
around and change its sign,

222
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,060
and we have to multiply this
reaction by 2 so that the sum

223
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,470
of these becomes this reaction
that we really care about.

224
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,840
So this is the sum of
these reactions.

225
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,660
Its change in enthalpy of this
reaction is going to be the

226
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,240
sum of these right here.

227
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,860
That is Hess's Law.

228
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,860
So this is the fun part.

229
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,190
So we just add up these
values right here.

230
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,350
So we have negative 393.--
no, that's not

231
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,880
what I wanted to do.

232
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,120
Let me just clear it.

233
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,710
So I have negative 393.5, so
that step is exothermic.

234
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,600
And then we have minus 571.6.

235
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,270
That is also exothermic.

236
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,570
Those were both combustion
reactions, which are, as we

237
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,930
know, very exothermic.

238
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,580
And we have the endothermic
step, the reverse of that last

239
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,400
combustion reaction.

240
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:38,480
So plus 890.3 gives
us negative 74.8.

241
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,650
It gives us negative 74.8
kilojoules for every mole of

242
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,930
the reaction occurring.

243
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,800
Or if the reaction occurs,
a mole time.

244
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,530
So there you go.

245
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,800
We figured out the change
in enthalpy.

246
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,380
And it is reasonably
exothermic.

247
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,270
Nowhere near as exothermic as
these combustion reactions

248
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:06,060
right here, but it is going
to release energy.

249
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,660
And we're done.
