1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,560
We've all had cuts on our finger
or wherever else on our

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,320
body, and immediately that part
of the body gets a little

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:16,219
bit of redness, a little bit of
swelling, some heat maybe,

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,800
and, of course, there'll be
some pain associated with

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,040
what's going on there.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,150
And in general, this set of
symptoms that we experience,

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,370
these are known as the
inflammatory response, or you

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,220
might say that there's some
inflammation going on there.

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,670
And people have known about this
I guess ever since really

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,230
people have been having cuts.

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,250
I think probably with modern
medicine, people have been a

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,030
little bit more particular about
actually classifying the

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,640
symptoms, but this isn't
anything new for someone to

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,880
say that there's some type of
inflammation going on or some

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,380
type of inflammatory response.

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,080
But what I want to do in this
video is understand what's

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,330
causing these-- I guess we can
call them macrosymptoms.

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,130
What's happening at
a cellular level?

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,480
Because, really, the
inflammatory response is

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,140
essentially the initial
field of battle

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,530
of our immune system.

22
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,090
Our first line of defense is our
skin or the fluids on the

23
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,360
outside of our skin or the
mucous membranes, but the

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,070
inflammatory response is what
happens when something gets

25
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,780
beyond that.

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,870
We get punctured with a nail, or
there's some type of virus

27
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:21,000
or bacteria gets beyond our
skin or the mucus that

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,250
surrounds our membranes.

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,950
   

30
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:31,160
This is the field of battle,
especially the

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,830
initial field of battle.

32
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,940
So let's set up an immune battle
so we can see exactly

33
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,000
what's going on with the
inflammatory response.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,050
And I want to be very clear.

35
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,830
Immunology, is still a very
under understood field.

36
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,400
It's an area of active
research.

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,520
People are still discovering
the mechanisms

38
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,270
and it's hugely complex.

39
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,520
I'm sure we'll probably
be studying this for a

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,550
long time to come.

41
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,250
So what I'm going to talk about
is just the overview,

42
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,700
just you know the general actors
and you know in general

43
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,760
what's causing the redness,
the swelling, the

44
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,030
heat, and the pain.

45
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,855
So let me draw some
skin cells.

46
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:09,070
   

47
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,889
This is a gross
oversimplification of

48
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,820
everything, but it's really just
to give an idea of what

49
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,900
is going on.

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,420
So I'm going to do
a cross-section.

51
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,210
So those are some skin cells in
there, and then I'm going

52
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,190
to-- so this is the outside
world right here.

53
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,120
   

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,770
Then amongst those skin cells,
I'll do some other cells.

55
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,820
We'll talk about what they do.

56
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,340
I won't go into huge
detail about them.

57
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,410
Let's call this cell right
here a mast cell.

58
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,260
I'll draw a few more
mast cells.

59
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,110
Maybe another one right there.

60
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,500
That's a mast cell.

61
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,500
And if you remember from the
videos on phagocytic action or

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,480
phagocytes, you'll remember
there was one type called

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,710
dendritic cells and they tend
to hang out near our skin.

64
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,430
They kind of hang out near areas
that might interface

65
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,380
with the outside world.

66
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,640
I'll draw a couple of dendritic
cells and these are

67
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,680
also the ones that were
really good at

68
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,550
activating helper T-cells.

69
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:11,480
   

70
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,370
They're called dendritic
cells.

71
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,450
They have no relation to
the nervous system.

72
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,440
They just look like they have
dendrites on them and that's

73
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,170
why they call them dendritic,
but they're really phagocytes

74
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,800
and they tend to be near
external interfaces and they

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,530
phagocytose particles and
they're good at presenting

76
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,150
them to helper T-cells so that
they can get activated and

77
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,870
ring the alarm bell,
so to speak.

78
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,870
So this is just a normal,
functioning, happy skin.

79
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,290
So that's the outside.

80
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,170
Over here, this is the
interstitial fluid.

81
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,200
   

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,740
That's just a fancy word for the
fluid that cells are kind

83
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,220
of being surrounded by
or that bathe cells.

84
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,350
The cells aren't all directly
connected to

85
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,530
the circulatory system.

86
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,190
The oxygen goes from the
circulatory system to the

87
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,240
interstitial fluid and
eventually finds

88
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,250
its way into cells.

89
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,380
So everything is directly
connected to capillaries, but

90
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,560
capillaries play a big role
in our circulatory system.

91
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,470
So let me draw that.

92
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,815
Instead of just drawing them as
tubes, I'm actually going

93
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,360
to draw the cells of our
circulatory system.

94
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,130
So let's say that this down
here-- these are the

95
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,670
endothelial cells of
our capillaries.

96
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,310
So these are literally the cells
that make up the walls

97
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,560
of our capillaries.

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:32,100
   

99
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,490
And of course, this is
a cross-section.

100
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,410
If I were to-- I would draw
it as a tube somehow.

101
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,420
It's not like it's a sandwich.

102
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,940
It's actually a tube.

103
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,040
Everything is in
cross-section.

104
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:55,160
So these are capillary
endothelial cells, and of

105
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,850
course, right in here, we have
our blood flowing and we'll

106
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,460
have red blood cells in here.

107
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,315
   

108
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:04,600
These are red blood cells.

109
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,050
Maybe they're flowing
in that direction.

110
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,390
On this side, they're
oxygenated.

111
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,250
This would be arteries and then
they'd become veins as

112
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,580
the red blood cells
lose their oxygen.

113
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,950
And of course, you might have
circulating white blood cells

114
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,470
inside of your-- obviously, in
much lower quantity than your

115
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,580
red blood cells, but just to
show that they're circulating

116
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,940
and they're moving with your
circulatory system being

117
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,640
pumped by the heart.

118
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,500
Now under normal circumstances,
there is an

119
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,210
exchange obviously of gases
between what's going on in our

120
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,020
circulatory system and the
interstitial fluid and there's

121
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,140
also a mild exchange of some
cells and proteins.

122
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,950
What we're going to see
now is what happens

123
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,090
when we have an intruder.

124
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,430
So let's say someone takes a
nail, dips it in some cow

125
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,170
manure, and then pokes
you with that nail.

126
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,420
Let's see what happens.

127
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:57,730
   

128
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,100
So let's say someone pokes
you with this nail

129
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,370
dipped in cow manure.

130
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:07,570
So it's got all sorts of nasty
stuff on it, pathogens on it,

131
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,730
probably has a bunch
of bacteria

132
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,240
sitting in the cow manure.

133
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,000
I didn't pick cow manure
at random.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,920
It's probably a good
source of bacteria.

135
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,720
So as soon as it pierces the
first line of defense, as soon

136
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,310
as it pierces your skin,
a couple of things

137
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:22,830
are going to happen.

138
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,740
A lot of these bacteria are
immediately going to start

139
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,860
floating around in your
interstitial fluid.

140
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,310
The cells that it came in
contact with, it pierced them.

141
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,570
It probably killed some cells.

142
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,990
It's also going to damage some
of these skin cells and those

143
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,860
skin cells are immediately
going to start releasing

144
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,120
chemicals, the ones that are
still in a position to do so.

145
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,530
They're going to start releasing
chemicals that are

146
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,520
essentially chemical messengers
that move through

147
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,360
the-- well, at first locally in
the interstitial fluid and

148
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,970
says, something is going on.

149
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,890
Something has happened to me.

150
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,140
And these are called
chemokines.

151
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,560
   

152
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,960
And chemokines are just a very
general word, really, for

153
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,110
small molecules or small
proteins that cells release as

154
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,570
a kind of signaling mechanism.

155
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,170
Chemo for chemical, kine for
kinetic, for moving.

156
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,560
These are messengers.

157
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,460
They move.

158
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,790
So these chemokines
get released.

159
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,120
And this is all tremendously
complicated.

160
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,840
So I'm doing very high level.

161
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,970
There are many, many types
of chemokines.

162
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,160
And also you have these mast
cells here, and these mast

163
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,570
cells can be activated by direct
contact maybe with the

164
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,440
rusty nail.

165
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,150
It could be from the chemokines
released by some of

166
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,500
these cells up here.

167
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,460
It could be from some of the
molecules released by the

168
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,870
actual bacteria.

169
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,800
These bacteria are also
releasing different byproducts

170
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,350
as they enter the body.

171
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:48,020
And any of the above can
activate the mast cells and

172
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,440
mast cells release histamine.

173
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,880
   

174
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,910
So you can already appreciate,
I'm doing a high-level

175
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,280
overview, and it already is
kind of complicated, but I

176
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,870
think you get the sense
of what's going on.

177
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,270
And if the word histamine sounds
vaguely familiar, it's

178
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,040
probably because you've taken
an antihistamine sometime

179
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,800
probably in the last
several months,

180
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,240
especially during cold season.

181
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,590
Histamine is kind of one of
the main actors in the

182
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,840
inflammatory response, and when
you have a cold and a

183
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,760
runny nose and stuffy nose and
all of those type of things,

184
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,950
those are all byproducts of the
inflammatory response, and

185
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,880
anti-histamines essentially
try to shut down that

186
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,000
inflammatory response so some
of those symptoms disappear.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,490
But it begs the question
of is that necessarily

188
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,419
always a good thing?

189
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,539
Because, as I'm going to talk
about in this video, this is

190
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,880
the first line of defense.

191
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,690
This is the first part of the
battle of our immune system.

192
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,330
But anyway, so the histamine--
one of the things that the

193
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,460
histamine does is it goes to
the endothelial cells that

194
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,750
line your capillaries, and it
causes them to separate away

195
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,400
from each other and make the
actual capillaries larger.

196
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,650
This is called vasodilation.

197
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:15,560
   

198
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,960
Let's say that they've all been
activated with a little

199
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,210
bit of histamine.

200
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,680
   

201
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,910
The histamine has come
in so now these

202
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,110
guys get further apart.

203
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,130
They get further apart
and the actual

204
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,400
capillary becomes larger.

205
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,810
   

206
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,780
So this is where you get a lot
of your swelling, because all

207
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,370
of sudden, the capillary's
larger, more fluid, and

208
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,110
actually, it gets smaller
further down so it really

209
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,780
encourages the fluid to collect
right around here.

210
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,190
So this is called vasodilation,
just another

211
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,960
fancy word for saying your

212
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,470
capillaries are getting dlated.

213
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,420
They're getting larger.

214
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Fluid is filling them up.

215
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,900
Not only are things starting
to collect here-- more and

216
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,830
more red blood cells are
collecting here, obviously

217
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,580
there's a lot of fluid here,
the white blood cells-- but

218
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,400
also the capillary walls are
becoming more porous.

219
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,820
All of a sudden, things that
couldn't get through them are

220
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,280
going to have a much easier
time getting through them.

221
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,810
And one of those things that
are going to have an easier

222
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,750
time getting through them-- and
once again, remember, all

223
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,210
this other stuff is going on.

224
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,400
You have these histamines that
are being dumped on these

225
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,350
endothelial cells and
maybe some of it 's

226
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,340
getting into the serum.

227
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,530
You have these chemokines being
released locally from

228
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,920
this area of damage.

229
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,550
You have the actual things
being-- the green was the

230
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,870
color of the molecules being
released by the viruses.

231
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,330
You have the chemokines,
which are in blue.

232
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,820
They're all being
released here.

233
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,600
And so the first responders,
the phagocytes, and in

234
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,590
particular, the neutrophils,
which are the most abundant of

235
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,510
the phagocytes, a subclass of
white blood cells, they're

236
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,730
attracted to these chemicals.

237
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,760
They want to move in the
direction that there's more of

238
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,660
these chemicals.

239
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,800
And now that the space between
these capillary cells have

240
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,440
gotten further apart, they
can get through.

241
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,855
So what they actually do is--
let's say that this right here

242
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:10,105
is a neutrophil.

243
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:13,980
   

244
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,530
They start kind of rolling along
the wall right here.

245
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,430
   

246
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,330
That's called margination.

247
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,310
They roll along this wall and
eventually-- so they kind of

248
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,600
stick to the wall.

249
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,610
They adhere to the wall, and
then eventually they squeeze

250
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,650
through these gaps in
the capillary wall.

251
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,220
This is called diapedesis
or extravasation.

252
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,110
Sometimes it's called
emigration.

253
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,800
These are all fancy words,
but essentially it's just

254
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,920
squeezing through the walls.

255
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,620
So that's the neutrophil
right there.

256
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,270
And then, of course, because of
the vasodilation, this is

257
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,120
where the neutrophils will be
getting dumped in and this is

258
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,800
exactly where they're needed.

259
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,090
So these neutrophils are going
to be here and then they're

260
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:52,870
going to do what they do.

261
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,810
They're going to phagocytose
some of these bacteria and

262
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,330
start eating up, and
maybe even some

263
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,240
damaged cells up here.

264
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,460
And so that's what you
want to happen.

265
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,860
That's why I said this is
the field of battle.

266
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,310
At the same time, your dendritic
cells, other

267
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,430
phagocytes, they will eat up the
viruses and then they'll

268
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,530
present them on their
surfaces.

269
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,980
And it's not just neutrophils
that are coming in.

270
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,240
Because this is kind of an area
of congestion and all of

271
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,410
the fluid is coming here, you'll
also have B-cells and

272
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,180
T-cells that'll also
make their way.

273
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,840
They'll also experience
marginalization, where they

274
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,130
roll up against the sides of
the capillary and then

275
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,900
diapedesis or extravasation
where they go through, and

276
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,670
then they'll be activated, and
they can actually do the

277
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,490
specific immune system.

278
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,840
So the whole point here is I
wanted to show you-- and this

279
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,730
is why I delayed the whole
video on the inflammatory

280
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,440
response, because it isn't just
one type of simple thing.

281
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,830
It's actually the field of
battle where all of the actors

282
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,400
come and play, even the first
line of defense of your skin,

283
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,480
and then all of the actors, the
nonspecific reactions of--

284
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,610
inflammatory response is
normally categorized as

285
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,520
nonspecific because it's going
to happen no matter what

286
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,450
comes, but you have the
nonspecific actors like the

287
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,320
neutrophils.

288
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,600
You have your specific actors
like your B-cells and T-cells

289
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,890
and you also have the
nonspecific complement system.

290
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,580
And I'm not going to go into
detail here, but you actually

291
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,990
have proteins that are flowing
in your blood plasma that are

292
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,650
normally in an inactive state,
but when the inflammatory

293
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,050
response occurs, these proteins,
they get essentially

294
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,940
activated and sometimes-- and
this is all not 100% well

295
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,490
understood-- they become
activated, they get cleaved

296
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,600
up, and then the cleaved-up
versions of those proteins are

297
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,070
really good at, in a very
nonspecific way, helping to

298
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,770
kill off at least some of what's
getting-- maybe the

299
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,970
bacteria in this case.

300
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,990
So this right here, this is the
complement system, which

301
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,600
is really just a set of proteins
that always just

302
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,070
floats around and they are a
good kind of first line of

303
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,950
nonspecific fight against some
type of invading pathogen.

304
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,470
So hopefully, this gives you a
good sense of what is going on

305
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,410
in the inflammatory response.

306
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,670
And as you can imagine, you have
all of this fluid coming

307
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,210
here, all of this blood
is collecting here.

308
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,180
You have all of this fluid
coming into-- so not just

309
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,280
cells that are going from
our capillaries into our

310
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,960
interstitial fluid, you'll
actually have fluid going in

311
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,990
and that fluid that's going
in is called exudate.

312
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,800
   

313
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,010
So this whole thing become
swelling and red and engorged

314
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,180
and that's why you see, on kind
of a very macro level,

315
