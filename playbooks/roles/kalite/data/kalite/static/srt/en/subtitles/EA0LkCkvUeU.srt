1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
what I'm gonna do in this video is talk about what

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,020
a Bitcoin is in more general term &amp; what

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,150
differentiating characteristics they have compared

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,560
to other approaches

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,660
so for starters, Bitcoin is just an electronic

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,090
payment system

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,790
by electronic payment system, I mean it's just a vehicle of conduit by which

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,790
2 parties can transact

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,840
over the internet

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,920
I'll call these parties Alice &amp; Bob

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,030
&amp; let's say Alice, for whatever reason,

12
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,340
wants to give money to Bob

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,570
over the internet

14
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,570
this maybe because she owes Bob money,

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,800
or maybe Bob is a merchant &amp; Alice is buying something from Bob

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
or maybe Bob is

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,820
a not-for-profit &amp; Alice makes a donation to Bob

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,490
so there can be many reasons why Alice is trying to pay Bob

19
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,050
over the internet

20
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,510
in some capacity

21
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,790
now if Bob is willing to accept

22
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,570
Bitcoins, which are a form of electronic payment

23
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,520
then Alice can go ahead &amp; send Bob

24
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,920
some value in Bitcoins, &amp; really,

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,570
a Bitcoin transaction between Alice &amp; Bob

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,040
amounts to a specially constructed

27
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,160
sequence of numbers, that Alice will basically send over to Bob

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,800
and, this will be done entirely over the internet

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,540
these numbers will have certain mathematical properties

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,900
that make it hard for some to really defraud the system, or to

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,730
conduct some type of nefarious action on the system

32
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,670
&amp; the way that Alice is actually going to conduct this transaction in practice is,

33
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,230
either by, installing a special piece of software, which we call a Bitcoin client,

34
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,930
or she can

35
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,520
work with a third party service, that can handle these mechanics for her

36
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,110
but either case (either the client / the service) is gonna generate these numbers for Alice

37
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,800
&amp; the flip side, Bob will also typically either have a piece of software installed

38
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,800
or he'll use a third party service

39
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,230
that will take these numbers &amp; allow him to do something else with those numbers, for example

40
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,330
Bob can, in turn, buy something on his own with those numbers, or he can trade those numbers in for

41
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,470
for real money &amp; so on &amp; so forth

42
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:54,990
alright

43
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,060
now 1 of the 1st questions you might have

44
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,060
&amp; I kind of alluded this earlier

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,150
is: "Why would Bob even want to accept Bitcoin in the 1st place?"

46
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,020
after all, a Bitcoin is just a bunch of numbers.

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,640
What intrinsic value would it conceivably have?

48
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
&amp; it turns out

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,150
quite surprisingly

50
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,830
Bitcoins actually have real world value, there are

51
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,090
more &amp; more merchants popping up each day who accept Bitcoin for transactions

52
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,660
&amp; there are also, Bitcoin exchanges, places where you can go &amp; exchange

53
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,860
Bitcoin for more mainstream currencies

54
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,460
some of these exchanges include

55
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,780
the major one is called "Mt. Gox"

56
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:39,050
&amp; in Mt. Gox, you can exchange your Bitcoin for Euro, Yen, Dollar, &amp; so on &amp; so forth

57
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,610
now the current price, the current value of Bitcoin in US Dollar as of this video is

58
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,400
approximately $100 per Bitcoin

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,360
that number is fluctuating, this is a new currency

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,220
&amp; there's gonna be some fluctuations, but as people understand the currency better

61
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,570
the hope is that fluctuation will decrease

62
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,600
but I think ultimately, the thing to keep in mind is that

63
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,930
the value of a Bitcoin is going to be derived from the faith that you have

64
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,630
&amp; the value of what you can procure with that Bitcoin. It's just like

65
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,350
you would for a Dollar, Euro, or Yen. The faith that you have

66
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,410
in that currency's value is how you value that currency

67
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,450
now another you might have is: "Why do people even bother with Bitcoin in the 1st place?"

68
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,970
I mean, aren't there other more standards ways?

69
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,970
Why couldn't Alice &amp; Bob use Paypal?

70
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,240
Why couldn't they use a credit card number to transact?

71
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,570
Why couldn't Alice just send Bob an electronic check?

72
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,740
Why not use one of these other approaches that are more well understood, more mainstream,

73
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,810
that are more established. Why would you possibly want to mess with a good thing?

74
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,330
So it turns out there are a few properties of Bitcoin that are worth noting, for starters,

75
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,690
there's privacy

76
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,220
it turns out, within the Bitcoin ecosystem, within the Bitcoin network

77
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,140
people can transact without divulging who they are in the real world

78
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,680
from the perspective of Bitcoin, Alice's identity is gonna be a sequence of numbers

79
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,940
&amp; that sequence of numbers, is effectively gonna function

80
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,310
like a pseudonym for Alice

81
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,100
&amp; that sequence of numbers has nothing to do with her real world identity

82
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,330
nobody knows this is Alice transacting

83
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,160
all they need to worry about is the pseudonym within the system

84
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,070
&amp; this is kind of, but not quite, like what you'd get if you bought something using cash

85
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,900
when you buy something using cash,

86
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,720
then you don't have to provide any details / proof regarding who you're in the real world

87
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
&amp; that's different from let's say,

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,110
using a credit card, where

89
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,790
you have to provide your name, billing address, &amp; so on

90
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,480
or let's say providing an electronic check

91
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,260
where you need to tie that electronic check typically to your bank account details

92
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,690
okay, now I do wanna also mention here that

93
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,080
sometimes when you have a

94
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,940
cash ??? or transaction that uses cash

95
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,270
there is now the possibility that people might try to use this transaction for

96
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,100
malicious purposes to buy illicit goods & services

97
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,440
that definitely is a risk that occurs when you provide anonimity &amp; privacy

98
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,500
but there are certainly legitimate reasons why somebody might

99
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,110
wanna conduct a transaction privately &amp; not have the whole world

100
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,110
know what they're transacting

101
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,810
another property of Bitcoin is that it's open

102
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,320
literally, anyone can get involved

103
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,100
anyone who has Internet connection can make a Bitcoin transaction

104
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,810
&amp; all you need to do to get started, is download this special Bitcoin client

105
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,140
&amp; the Bitcoin client, or for that matter, you can use

106
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,900
a service like Mt. Gox, which will effectively do the same work as a client for you

107
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,490
but the short of it is that,

108
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,030
anyone who has a Bitcoin client or who owns an account with an exchange like Mt. Gox,

109
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,320
can engage in Bitcoin transactions

110
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,600
that transaction, the details of it, the mechanics of it, will be transparent to the user

111
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,760
all the user has to worry about

112
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,880
All Alice needs to worry about is how much money she has

113
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
&amp; whether she can get that money to Bob

114
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,420
the actual software underneath will take all the underlying mechanics of making that transaction work

115
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,120
now this is different when you think about traditional currency, like a Dollar

116
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
if I wanna transact something online

117
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,900
typically I need a bank account, credit card

118
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,550
&amp; so on &amp; so forth

119
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:16,880
we often take it for granted, but there are people out there who may not have access to credit card, bank account, for example

120
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,890
in United States alone, it turns out (I just looked this up)

121
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,140
the number of households without a bank account

122
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:29,420
is somewhere north of 8%. It's pretty high, a lot of people out there who wouldn't be able to conduct

123
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,090
a traditional internet transaction

124
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,370
but who can conduct a transaction using Bitcoin

125
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,080
by they way, there are people using Bitcoin all over the world, literally

126
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
it doesn't matter where you are

127
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,690
in the world, as long as you have internet connection, you can start transacting Bitcoins

128
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,860
Now another property of Bitcoin worth mentioning is that it's decentralized

129
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,340
there's no bank / centralized entity that can really control

130
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,820
what's happening in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it's all done in this kind of ad-hoc fashion

131
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
&amp; what that means is that,

132
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,000
when you do a transaction, when Alice transacts with Bob over the internet,

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,080
that transaction is ??? with third party. There's no

134
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,630
there's no bank that gets in the way of that transaction

135
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,170
&amp; that can have certain benefits as well, for example, that means

136
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:21,160
no one entity can directly control the money supply of Bitcoin &amp; so on

137
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,480
that also means that no one entity can

138
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,930
let's say, seize your assets, for that matter

139
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,820
no one entity can reverse a transaction

140
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
which is definitely desirable for some merchants

141
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:37,050
Some merchants might not be able to conduct business online, because of fraud concerns

142
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,690
&amp; if you have a system where the transactions can't be charged back easily,

143
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,110
then, from the merchant's perspective,

144
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,570
they may be able to inhibit fraud &amp; thereby,

145
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,380
that might enable their business entirely online

146
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,020
now I wanna point out this last property of decentralization

147
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,100
definitely causes concerns among some people about Bitcoin.

148
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,260
After all, when you think about it, a central authority like a bank

149
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,900
does a perform an important function in the context of traditional currency, for example,

150
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,220
banks might validate currency, they might

151
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,490
validate transactions against fraud

152
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,740
now in Bitcoin, this validation is basically done in a decentralized way

153
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,510
by the other party, the other nodes in the Bitcoin network

154
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:26,000
another goal of the remaining videos in this series, is to walk through the underlying mechanics

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,900
of Bitcoin transactions &amp;

156
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,270
really how they're validated, even though the system is decentralized

157
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,010
and there are some pretty amazing techniques that are used

158
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,520
to make all this work

159
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,490
I suspect at this point, you may have tons of questions about Bitcoin, &amp; that's entirely to be expected

160
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,680
Bitcoin is a very complex protocol, it has many moving parts

161
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,660
&amp; I think it's pretty cool, when you can understand something this complex

162
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,260
&amp; wrap your head around some thing as sophisticated as Bitcoin

163
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,160
it's important to get exposed to all the parts first

164
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,300
so that you can ultimately, get a flavor of how they fit together

165
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,650
&amp; hopefully the other videos in this series,

166
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,320
will help you to understand, these different parts

167
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,930
&amp; along the way, address many other questions that you might have
