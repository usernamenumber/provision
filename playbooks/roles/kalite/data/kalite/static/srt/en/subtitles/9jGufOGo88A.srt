1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,250
[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:08,610
   

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,740
Ever since people have been
lending money to each other,

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,840
there's been one fundamental
problem.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,870
What happens when someone can't
pay back their debts?

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,720
   

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,220
What are you going to do?

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,450
And before I really jump into
what we do now in our modern

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,290
society, let's get a couple of
the I'll words out of the way

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,290
that we're going to use a lot.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,770
And these are words that you'll
hear a lot in the

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,840
context of debt, or in
the context of loans.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,930
So on one side of
the transaction,

15
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,450
you have the debtor.

16
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,100
And this is essentially
the person that

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,350
borrowed the money.

18
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,070
   

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,450
And because they borrowed the
money, they now owe money.

20
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,220
So you could either say they
borrowed the money or that

21
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,470
they owe money.

22
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,360
   

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,870
On the other side of
the transaction,

24
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,120
you have the creditor.

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,610
   

26
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,970
This is the entity, or the
person, that is owed the

27
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,240
money, or they lent the
money to the borrower.

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,510
So they lend the money.

29
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,780
So we have our words out of the
way, but let's go back to

30
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,670
our fundamental question.

31
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,010
What happens when the debtor
can't pay the creditor back

32
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,930
the money that the creditor
is apparently due?

33
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,010
Well, if we go back through
human history, they've come up

34
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,720
with various solutions to this
problem, we can call it.

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:38,430
If you go back to ancient
Greece, they had a very simple

36
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,530
solution to it.

37
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,760
If the debtor can't pay back
their debts, well then become

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,330
a debt slave to the creditor.

39
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,480
So they became a debt slave.

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,600
So if the creditor needs some
gardening done or would like

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,890
his or her house cleaned more
regularly, the debtor-- and

42
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,390
actually, probably the debtor's
family-- would have

43
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,690
then had to do whatever the
creditor wanted until they

44
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,710
essentially paid back their
debt through their labor.

45
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,860
So that's how Greece
handled it.

46
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,060
It's kind of shocking
to us now, but

47
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,990
that was their solution.

48
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,370
You decided to borrow money, you
can't pay it anymore, this

49
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,090
is what you've got to do.

50
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,620
Now if we fast forward a little
bit to maybe medieval

51
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,100
Europe, this is even-- Charles
Dickens' father was even

52
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,060
caught into this
kind of a bind.

53
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,540
But until kind of the early or
mid-1800s in Europe and the

54
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,745
United States you had the notion
of debtor's prison.

55
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:38,620
   

56
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,235
And frankly, when I describe
this to you, you'll find that

57
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:44,720
it's even worse in my mind than
being a debt slave. In

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,120
debtor's prison, they would
throw you in jail.

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,620
They would imprison you.

60
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,050
That's why it's called
debtor's prison.

61
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,060
And you're not coming out
until your family

62
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,310
pays off your debt.

63
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,830
Your family or maybe your
friends, if you have good

64
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,460
friends, pays off your debt.

65
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,510
   

66
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,680
Just thinking about why this
is especially horrible, at

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,070
least here you had your chance
to work off your debt.

68
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,390
   

69
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,750
My situation right now.

70
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,530
You know, if I get thrown in
prison will my 10-month-old

71
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,910
son be able to pay
off my debt?

72
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,090
No, I'm just going to rot
in prison forever.

73
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,660
Or what if my family
doesn't like me?

74
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,110
Or what if I have no
family or friends?

75
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,840
I might have owed someone the
equivalent of now of $1,000

76
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,920
and because of that,
I could serve a

77
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,790
life sentence in prison.

78
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,280
You can imagine the debtor's
prison could be quite harsh.

79
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,160
And actually, Charles Dickens'
dad was in debtor's prison.

80
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,330
It can kind of tell you a little
bit about why he writes

81
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,400
the type of books
that he does.

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,260
But anyway, this is the past.
We are now a civilized

83
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,240
society, and hopefully we have
a better way of dealing with

84
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,180
the situation when a debtor
owes a creditor money.

85
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,930
And that's the topic
of this video.

86
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,000
And so now what we do is
something called bankruptcy.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And just so you know, the first
versions of bankruptcy

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,340
weren't that different
from debtor's prison.

89
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,110
They were actually more to
protect the creditor than to

90
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,830
protect the debtor.

91
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,630
But now we have bankruptcy laws,
and for the most part,

92
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,269
they're to prevent this type of
craziness or for someone to

93
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,660
spend their entire
life on kind of

94
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,025
this wacky debt treadmill.

95
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:22,700
So let's talk a little
bit about bankruptcy.

96
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,030
And I'm going to focus on
bankruptcy as it is in the

97
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,200
United States.

98
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,610
So let me write down bankruptcy
in a new color.

99
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,860
Bankruptcy.

100
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,930
   

101
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,740
It's going to have
a U.S. focus.

102
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,040
And in general I'm going
to talk about personal

103
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,730
bankruptcy, although a lot of
what I talk about on some

104
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,280
level, applies to corporations
as well.

105
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,990
And I've actually made videos
on that as well.

106
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,740
So let's say I'm just
overwhelmed with debt.

107
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,090
I have $100,000 of credit
card loans.

108
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,020
I have a mortgage to pay.

109
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,580
I have a car lease that was
a little bit over my head.

110
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,670
What can I do?

111
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,660
So there's a couple of options
in the United States.

112
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,690
You have Chapter 7.

113
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,540
It seems very complicated.

114
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,800
These are all different--
literally-- chapters of the

115
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,000
bankruptcy code.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,705
So you have Chapter 7.

117
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:19,220
It is called a straight
bankruptcy.

118
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,020
And this is literally
you go-- I mean it's

119
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,660
not a simple procedure.

120
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,740
But the gist of it is, you go
to the bankruptcy courts.

121
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,010
You say, look, I can't
pay back my debts.

122
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,840
And so what they're going to do
is they're going to take my

123
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,620
assets and then whatever there
is there, they're going to

124
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,050
split it amongst my creditors.

125
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,010
And then after all is said and
done, I don't owe anyone

126
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,620
anything, although I've lost
a lot of my assets.

127
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,560
Some of them are exempt.

128
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,180
They let you keep things that
you need to live, like your

129
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,010
pots and pans and maybe
one television.

130
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,070
And maybe a suit so that
you can find a job.

131
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,540
But if I have a bank account, I
probably don't because I got

132
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,400
so deep into debt.

133
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,780
But if I have some money, if I
have a nice diamond ring or a

134
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,640
Rolex watch, they're going
to take that from me.

135
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,000
The trustee, the bankruptcy
court, is going to take that

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,630
from me, sell it, and then give
it to all my creditors.

137
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,530
But at the end of the day, after
all is said and done,

138
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,460
I'll actually be free
of all of my debt.

139
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,300
It's kind of a way to break
from this cycle of always

140
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,150
owing money and always just
barely making it, or probably

141
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,350
not making it at all.

142
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,980
So that's a straight
bankruptcy.

143
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,080
And you might say, well, why
doesn't everyone do that who's

144
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,650
under a big, heavy
load of debt?

145
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,670
Well one, there's a lot of rules
that make this easier or

146
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,460
not so easy to do.

147
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,540
But the other thing is it stays
on your credit report

148
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,530
for 10 years.

149
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,920
10 years on credit report.

150
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,540
So you've got to think to
yourself, am I going to be

151
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,310
better off over the next
10 years continuing

152
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,110
to pay off my debt?

153
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,670
If I can pay off my debt, if
I have any chance, I should

154
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,210
probably do that so that I don't
ruin my credit for the

155
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,890
next 10 years.

156
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,970
But if it's just a hopeless
situation, I

157
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,190
might as well do it.

158
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,730
And just so you know.

159
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,450
This isn't a cure
for everything.

160
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:06,310
If you're sitting on $300,000 of
student loans, I say, wow,

161
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,560
that's going to take me more
than 10 years to pay anyway.

162
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,220
Let me just declare Chapter
7 bankruptcy.

163
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,410
It'll be unfortunate to find
out that student loans are

164
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,000
not-- cannot be forgiven in
a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,680
So there's a whole set of a
types of loans, or I guess you

166
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,770
could say, types of liabilities,
things you owe to

167
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,590
other people that cannot
be forgiven.

168
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,980
Certain types of taxes, student
loans, child support,

169
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,780
those won't be forgiven.

170
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,160
This will definitely apply
to things maybe

171
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,520
like credit card loans.

172
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,130
But this isn't just a very,
very simple process.

173
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,420
So any of these things that I
talk about, you definitely

174
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,200
want to consult an expert on
your kind of particular

175
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,680
situation to get a little
bit more detail.

176
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,060
But this is just an overview.

177
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,030
So that's Chapter 7, straight
up bankruptcy.

178
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,890
I don't have what it takes to
keep servicing my debt.

179
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,030
I want a brand new start.

180
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,850
Now, the next one or the next
one that you're going to be

181
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,090
most-- going to hear the most
about in the context of a

182
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:09,460
personal bankruptcy--
is Chapter 13.

183
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,896
And this is often referred
to as a reorganization.

184
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:17,670
   

185
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,450
And here the idea is, look,
I have a salary.

186
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,730
I have a job.

187
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,920
But I just have more debt
than is imaginable.

188
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,530
And it might not be just
because I've been

189
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,300
irresponsible.

190
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,010
Maybe a medical emergency came
up in the family or I had some

191
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,970
unknown expenses that just
popped up out of nowhere.

192
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,880
And so here the situation is,
look, Mr. Creditors out there,

193
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,730
I really do want to pay you
back, but what you're asking

194
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,480
for me to do right now
is just crazy.

195
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
If you ask me to do that I'm
just going to end up in

196
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,400
Chapter 7 eventually.

197
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:55,250
So for both my sake-- me as the
debtor-- both for my sake

198
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,590
and for your sake, why don't we
come up with a plan so that

199
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,620
I can realistically pay
you over the next

200
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,490
three to five years?

201
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,490
And that might involve you
saying, hey, instead of being

202
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,880
owed $50,000, you now
owe me $40,000.

203
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,250
Or instead of the interest on
my credit card being 20% per

204
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,150
year, let's change that
to 10% per year.

205
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,270
So they'll be a little
bit of a negotiation.

206
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,130
You're going to have to
come up with a plan.

207
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,260
And then once you come up with
that plan, I've got to pay

208
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,050
that over the next three
to five years.

209
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,720
   

210
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Now once again, you might say,
hey, well that's pretty good.

211
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,630
If I owe $100,000 in credit card
debt and I kind of go to

212
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,190
my creditors and look like a
genuine individual and make a

213
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,650
nice sob story, they're going
to lower my debt.

214
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,440
I'll be better off than
if I didn't do it.

215
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,130
But here again, there's
a penalty to doing it.

216
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,530
And once again, it shows up
on your credit report.

217
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,750
And so, in general, they're
going to come up with a plan

218
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,950
for you to pay back your
creditors over three years.

219
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,490
And then after that, it's
going to show up on your

220
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,670
credit report for
another 7 years.

221
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:06,750
   

222
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,000
So in general, from the time
you file until the time it

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,390
leaves your credit report is
going to be 10 years, just

224
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,890
like Chapter 7.

225
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,380
So in either of these
situations, these aren't

226
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,210
things that you want to just
jump into and then think, wow,

227
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,690
I found an easy out
from my debt.

228
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,940
These are very serious things
that will impact you for a

229
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,130
reasonable chunk of your life.

230
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,790
So these aren't just simple
things to do.

231
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,690
But they are good to know about
just in case you do find

232
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,530
yourself a little bit over
your head or a little bit

233
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,990
under water, or you
know someone

234
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,090
who's in this situation.

235
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,970
At least it is an out where they
can feel that look, if I

236
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,960
do this or that, maybe over the
next either 3 years or 10

237
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,770
years-- depending on how
you view it-- they can

238
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,680
get to a new start.

239
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,010
And just so you have a sense
of how often this occurs, I

240
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,990
looked this up a little
bit earlier.

241
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,010
In the U.S., and as you can
imagine, we're in the middle

242
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,830
of a recession now, so
bankruptcy filings are kind of

243
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,880
going through the roof.

244
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,350
So let me write this down.

245
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,600
So this is Chapter 7.

246
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,610
   

247
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,495
And here's Chapter 13.

248
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:13,850
And if you're wondering,
what are all

249
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,430
the chapters in between?

250
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,060
There's a Chapter 12, which is
essentially Chapter 13 for

251
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,330
farmers and fishermen.

252
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,940
They get a few more benefits
than the rest of us get

253
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,380
because we want to
promote, I guess,

254
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,260
people who produce food.

255
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,440
And then there's Chapter 11,
which is essentially business

256
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,110
reorganization.

257
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,570
It can apply to some
individuals who are

258
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,660
essentially kind of big shots.

259
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,680
Their personal portfolios of
assets and liabilities look a

260
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,000
lot like a business.

261
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,440
So for them Chapter 11 will
be more appropriate

262
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,060
than Chapter 13.

263
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,880
So those are kind of the
two other chapters.

264
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,160
But from a personal bankruptcy
point of view, Chapter 7 and

265
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,500
Chapter 13 is what most people
concern themselves with.

266
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,070
Now, just to give you the
numbers of how often this is

267
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,430
occurring, if you find yourself
in the circumstance,

268
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,960
just so you know you're
not necessarily alone.

269
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,420
And also just to see that
they really are

270
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,870
increasing right now.

271
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,440
So 2007, 2008, 2009.

272
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,390
So Chapter 7 filings
in the United

273
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,380
States in 2007: 413,000.

274
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,120
In 2008 it went up to 560,000.

275
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,890
So this is more than
a 25% increase.

276
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,480
And then in 2009,
819,000 filings.

277
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,240
Essentially double of the
number of Chapter

278
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,580
7 filings in 2007.

279
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,250
And if you look at Chapter
13, in 2007

280
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,040
we had 277,000 filings.

281
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,020
So for every two Chapter 7's it
looks like there's about--

282
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,780
well, for every four there's
about three of these.

283
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,380
Then we have 334,000 in 2008.

284
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,080
And then 370,000 in 2009.

285
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,070
So you can see that the Chapter
7 ones, I mean they're

286
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,610
both increasing really
fast. But Chapter 7

287
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,560
is even more dramatic.

288
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,290
And you could imagine because
in a situation where people

289
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,550
don't have jobs, Chapter
13 really isn't that

290
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,570
viable of an option.

291
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,820
They really have to do something
like Chapter 7.

292
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,310
Anyway, hopefully you found
that useful and you know a

293
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,282
little bit about
bankruptcy now.
