1
00:00:00,731 --> 00:00:02,875
Sal: This is Sal, I'm here with Ben Eater.

2
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:03,356
Ben: Hi Sal.

3
00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:05,117
Sal: And you've made this module,

4
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:05,413
Ben: I did.

5
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:08,554
Sal: called the fundamental theorem of arithmetic!

6
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:09,018
Ben: Very exciting!

7
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:12,523
Sal: Very exciting, isn't this? This says that we can essentially get to

8
00:00:12,523 --> 00:00:16,679
any whole number greater than one

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:17,299
Ben: Right.

10
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:19,556
Sal: by taking products of prime numbers.

11
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:20,386
Ben: That's right.

12
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:21,136
Sal: That any number

13
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:21,613
Ben: Any number.

14
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:23,314
Sal: can be made by taking

15
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,553
Ben: Just the right prime numbers

16
00:00:24,553 --> 00:00:26,152
Sal: by multiplying a bunch of prime numbers together.

17
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:26,832
Ben: Yeah

18
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:29,220
Sal: and right over here, were essential going to try to do that.

19
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,406
Ben: and there's one and only

20
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,457
one way to get to that number.

21
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:34,354
Sal: There's only one way, there's not other

22
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:34,868
kind of ways..

23
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,251
Ben: There's only one set of prime numbers that will get you to any number

24
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:39,113
Sal: Very, very interesting. So let's see, they say

25
00:00:39,113 --> 00:00:42,904
find the prime factorization of 42. So when their saying prime factorization,

26
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:46,548
you know when your saying, since you wrote this, your saying

27
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:48,903
factor this and all the numbers that when I multiply them together

28
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:50,796
I get to 42. Well, the prime numbers.

29
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:51,895
Ben: Prime numbers. And so we only give you

30
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:52,951
prime numbers

31
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:54,939
Sal: You only give the prime numbers, 2 through

32
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:59,246
13. It says use arrows to change the exponent

33
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:02,757
on each prime number. So the exponent is how many times you're going to

34
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:06,334
multiply that,or, and we have many videos on this,

35
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:09,119
going into depth on exponents, but you could also, one way to visualize it

36
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,096
is how many times your going to multiply one times its number.

37
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:12,652
Ben:Right.

38
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:16,161
Sal:For at least this case right over here, we're multiplying

39
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:19,206
one times two 0 times, so the answer is

40
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:23,001
one there. If you mulitply it by 2 once, you get a two there.

41
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:27,347
and then if you do it by 2 twice, you get 2 times 2, is 4.

42
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:30,418
So the prime factorization of 42. So the way I

43
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:32,589
think well, lets use your hints. Ben: OK

44
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:34,050
Sal: Sometimes, you've got these hints

45
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,934
you should think about if their.. so lets see, I'd like a hint.

46
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:42,049
so let's see what it tells us to do. We can

47
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:46,232
use a factor tree to break 42 into its prime factorization.

48
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:49,986
Which of the pime numbers divides into 42? so.

49
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:51,610
Ben: A good place to start is think of any of those prime numbers

50
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,672
and which ones divide... Sal: And maybe start with those at the smaller end...Ben: thats what I like to do, Yeah. ..Sal:And 2 is

51
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:59,284
usually the easiest one to think of. This is an even number, 2 is going to didive into it.

52
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:03,050
so lets see if thats what ya'll confirm in the hints. Oh, yes, right there,

53
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,215
2 goes in, and you can do this on paper if you want, or you should

54
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:12,598
but 2 goes into 42 21 times, so I can just try doing it 21 times, but we're not

55
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,142
done yet, because 21 is not a prime number, is not even listed here,

56
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:20,681
keep listing the prime numbers, 21 is not prime,and so

57
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:23,636
2 does not go into 21 anymore, so we're kinda done with 2,

58
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:31,278
2's, so actually, lets see, we have 1 2 over there, but 3 does go into 21!

59
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:33,166
Ben: It does. Sal: 3 does go into 21, and so lets see,

60
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:36,498
so 21 can be factored into 3 times, so lets

61
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:40,723
see if thats what your hint...Ben:which are both prime Sal: which are both prime!

62
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:43,249
lets see if thats what the hint confirms. Yes! 3 times 7

63
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:46,971
and then 7 is prime and your done Ben: Thats right!

64
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:51,021
Sal: So you can say your gonna have, er, your gonna have this 2 right over here, your gonna have

65
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:54,584
a 3, and then were gonna need a 7. 2 times 3 times

66
00:02:54,584 --> 00:03:00,200
7 is 42. And were done! And we go right over here

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:07,119
answer, check, click the.. need to change your answer, no no already did that.

68
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:09,406
so now i just check the answer, and I'm done! Correct! Next question.

69
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:17,319
and I got two, we used the hints so we dont get full credit.

70
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:24,757
Lets do the next one. Lets see what shows up. Oh,we already know the prime factors of 21, we just did that!

71
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:29,021
So we got a three, and we got a 7 in there, and there we go!

72
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:33,887
Lets do another one. 18.

73
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:36,040
So 2 goes into 18. Ben: It does. Sal: 2 goes into 18.

74
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:45,720
and so, if I wanna do this in my head, 2 times 9, and I dont need to do this in my head, since I have hints,

75
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,788
Ben: You have hints!

76
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:49,790
Sal: You have hints, that essentially do that.so we can use our factor tree

77
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,558
and break 18 into its prime factorization. It's 2 times 9!

78
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:55,345
and 9 is odd, but not prime.2 doesnt go into it, 3 does.

79
00:03:55,345 --> 00:04:03,972
so we have 3 times 3, leaving us with 3..

80
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:09,157
3 is prime so were done factoring. So this is interesting, so we have a 2, and then were multiplying by 3 twice.

81
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:19,058
3 times 3 is 9, and times 2 is 18. And were done.

82
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:26,358
we have not been able to prove the fundamental theoem of arithmatic wrong! Ben: Thats right!

83
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:30,358
(both men laughing) haven't disproved it. Sal: right, very good. well, this is very neat.
