1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,740
Let's say I had the reaction
where I had some copper ions.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,560
They have a positive
charge of 2.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,000
It's an aqueous solution.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,780
There could be some
other negative

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,970
ions in that solution.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,600
Actually we could talk about
that in a little bit.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,820
But we know that when you have
these ions in solution, they

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,890
all disassociate.

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,910
So you just have to know you
have a bunch of ions just

11
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,780
floating around in water.

12
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,140
There could be some other
negative ones to neutralize

13
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,580
the entire solution, but let's
just worry about the positive

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,650
ones for now.

15
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:37,940
And in that solution, I'm going
to put a bar of zinc.

16
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,465
And what happens is that they
essentially switch places.

17
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:44,510
   

18
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,260
The copper wants to jump out
of your aqueous solution.

19
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,250
I should probably draw this.

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,340
Let me draw it.

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,500
This is my solution.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,460
And in my solution, we make it
blue, because it's aqueous, so

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,010
most of it is water.

24
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,275
I have some copper molecules
here in the solution.

25
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:11,830
They're a plus-2 charge.

26
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,490
I could have some other ions
that are negative, like some

27
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,790
nitrate ions or whatever, but
they're all disassociated.

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,490
They're all mixing around with
the water molecules that are

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,940
polar, and that's why ions
disassociate, or salts in

30
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,460
general, disassociate
well in water.

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,360
And I stick a bar
of zinc in it.

32
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,500
Solid zinc. So let me do that.

33
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,640
So I stick of bar of
solid zinc into it.

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,050
And so what this reaction says
is that these copper ions, if

35
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:46,930
they can get a hold of some
electrons and essentially

36
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,080
become neutral, they would
rather go back

37
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,630
into the solid state.

38
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,920
And the molecules of zinc out
here that are in the solid

39
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,650
state, if they can lose some
electrons, they want to jump

40
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,350
into the solution.

41
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,210
So let me write down
the whole reaction.

42
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,130
So if the copper can get some
electrons, they're going to go

43
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,229
into the solid state.

44
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,980
Copper will go into
the solid state.

45
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,320
And if the zinc can lose some
electrons, they'll become

46
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,740
positive ions or cations.

47
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,630
And then they will go into the
solution, plus-- I'll do the

48
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:30,550
same color-- zinc plus
2 plus aqueous.

49
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,260
Actually just so, a little
side note here, these are

50
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,170
actual ions.

51
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,850
We've been dealing with
oxidation numbers.

52
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,070
And when you want to know the
oxidation number of an ion,

53
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,860
the oxidation number is the
same thing as its charge,

54
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,780
because it's no longer
hypothetical.

55
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,980
Remember oxidation numbers were
hypothetical charges if a

56
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,910
bond were ionic.

57
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,420
In this case they are ionic, so
the oxidation state, or the

58
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,730
oxidation number is the
same as the charge.

59
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,380
And just as a side note, the
convention, if it's written 2

60
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,690
plus, this means that this
is a real charge.

61
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,810
If it's written plus 2-- at
least this is the way I

62
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,410
learned, and maybe there's
different conventions in

63
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,980
different places-- then it would
be an oxidation state,

64
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,300
which says, oh, it's not
necessarily an ion, but this

65
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,380
is what it would be
if it was an ion.

66
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,185
So if someone writes plus 2,
this is oxidation state.

67
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:17,900
If they write 2 plus,
they say, hey

68
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,400
this is a real charge.

69
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,690
And likewise, if you just have
a regular ion that has, like,

70
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,720
a charge of 1-- so let's say you
have Na plus-- this means

71
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,830
that it's an actual charge.

72
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,730
If you wanted to write its
oxidation state, you would

73
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,270
write plus 1.

74
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,870
Small little note, it doesn't
probably make a big difference

75
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,560
in the whole scheme of things,
but sometimes it can get

76
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,690
confusing whether something is
an oxidation state or an ion.

77
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,820
But depending on where you're
going to school and what your

78
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,090
teachers or conventions are, you
might want to clarify that

79
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,425
and just make sure that they use
the same conventions that

80
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:50,290
at least I remember when
I first learned it.

81
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,390
So anyway, let's go back
to this reaction

82
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,470
that's happening here.

83
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,010
So let's do the half
reactions for this.

84
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,230
So we start here, and actually
we can just look at the

85
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,750
oxidation states
to begin with.

86
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,720
This guy has an oxidation.

87
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,890
He has a charge of 2, which is
also an oxidation number of 2.

88
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,990
And he goes to a
neutral charge.

89
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,760
So clearly, he gains two
electrons, which means that he

90
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,830
was reduced.

91
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,450
He went from a positive
charge to a zero

92
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,170
oxidation state or charge.

93
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,699
So his charge was reduced.

94
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,760
Just let me write that.

95
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,830
So this guy was reduced.

96
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,220
And let me write his
half reaction.

97
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,950
He essentially started off
with some copper in the

98
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:36,370
aqueous state, and he
got two electrons.

99
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,870
That's how you get reduced.

100
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,440
So plus two electrons.

101
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,035
And he ended up in the solid
state of copper.

102
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:48,120
And his oxidation
number is now 0.

103
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,930
Now let's see what happened to
the zinc. The zinc, it starts

104
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,150
completely neutral in
the solid state.

105
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,440
No extra electrons or deficiency
of electrons.

106
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,100
But then once the zinc jumps
into the solution

107
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,000
here, he has a charge.

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,960
So he must have lost
electrons.

109
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,060
So the half reaction for zinc--
in this situation you

110
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,610
have zinc as a solid and he
reacts to produce two

111
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:28,830
electrons and he's in the water
and he's now an ion.

112
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,450
So let me put that there.

113
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,120
An aqueous solution.

114
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,140
So if we did this experiment
right here-- and I will tell

115
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,160
you right now this reaction
moves forward.

116
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,670
This is truly a reaction.

117
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,560
We're going to talk about, in
a second, how badly do the

118
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,240
electrons essentially want to
jump from-- where are they

119
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,820
jumping from?

120
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,860
They're jumping from the
zinc to the copper.

121
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,240
So we're going to talk a little
bit about how strongly

122
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,880
they want to jump
in the voltage.

123
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,840
And voltage is really just how
badly does charge want to move

124
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,020
or how much potential energy
does charge have. But this

125
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,620
whole reaction, you just have
to think about what's

126
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,820
happening, is that you have
charge moving from-- as the

127
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,330
zinc jumps into the water, as
the zinc jumps into the

128
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,070
aqueous solution, it's passing
on some charge to the copper

129
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,330
that jumps into the
solid form.

130
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,270
So electrons are moving here.

131
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,770
And if somehow we could
harness these moving

132
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,390
electrons, we could
create a current.

133
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,920
In this situation, it's
all chemical.

134
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,270
The electrons are moving around,
but they're not doing

135
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,640
it in any organized way.

136
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,270
Because the solution
is all mixed up.

137
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,160
But this is an interesting
situation we're

138
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,960
dealing with here.

139
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,100
And we can even talk about how
badly the electrons want to

140
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,080
move in these directions.

141
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,470
You can look at these
half reactions.

142
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,320
You can look it up in a table,
and you can get these energies

143
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,740
or the voltage is for
these reactions.

144
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,720
And this half reaction right
here has a voltage.

145
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,970
So they'll sometimes right E.

146
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,720
Sometimes it's an E not right
over there, but that's like

147
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,800
kind of out of the scope
of at least a

148
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,150
first-year chemistry course.

149
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,760
But they'll say it's
0.34 volts.

150
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,450
And then this reaction in this
direction has a potential

151
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,770
difference.

152
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,840
The energy is 0.76 volts.

153
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,290
If I wrote this in the other
way, if I wrote this reaction

154
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,090
of zinc plus 2 electrons going
to zinc solid, then you would

155
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,480
just switch the sign.

156
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,010
But what this says is that this
state, this state right

157
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,020
here, is a higher energy
than that state.

158
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,830
So it wants to go in
that direction.

159
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,510
And it wants to do that with
an energy per coulomb.

160
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,450
And you can watch the
physics playlist on

161
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,160
more details of volts.

162
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,720
But volt units are joules
per coulomb.

163
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,710
This is how badly the electrons

164
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,160
want to join the copper.

165
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,520
That's the best way
of viewing it.

166
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,090
And this is a measure of how
badly the electrons want to

167
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,030
leave the zinc. So if you wanted
to talk about this

168
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,370
whole reaction, so this whole
reaction that we have up here,

169
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,510
we could say it's an energy, so
the energy of this entire

170
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,510
reaction up here.

171
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,530
We know that electrons really
want to join the copper with

172
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,330
this energy, and they really
want to leave the zinc with

173
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,250
this energy.

174
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,600
So the energy of this entire
reaction, how badly do

175
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,010
electrons want to move from zinc
to copper to form this

176
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,340
over there, is just the
sum of the two.

177
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,970
So you get what's 1.1 volts.

178
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,530
You're probably saying, hey Sal,
all this talk of volts,

179
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,190
this is interesting
and current.

180
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,539
Is there some way that we could
construct a battery or a

181
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,679
galvanic cell?

182
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,179
If you don't know what a
galvanic cell is, it's what

183
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,669
we're about to construct
right now.

184
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,039
And the answer is obviously yes,
because that's the whole

185
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,220
point of this video.

186
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,080
So how can we somehow
harness that charge?

187
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,370
So let's separate the
two reactions.

188
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,830
Let's separate the two.

189
00:08:52,830 --> 00:09:01,310
So let me put my
zinc bar here.

190
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,590
I'll try to stay true to the
colors that I used earlier.

191
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,570
And let me put my copper
bar there.

192
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,400
Actually maybe I should
copy and paste

193
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,720
what I wrote up here.

194
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,640
Just so we remember the
reaction itself.

195
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,880
Actually, yeah let me do that.

196
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,620
Never hurts.

197
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,641
OK.

198
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:24,760
I'll paste it down here.

199
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,825
Ignore all the squiggly
lines around it.

200
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:31,330
And let me put but both of my
bars in some aqueous solution.

201
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,310
And there could be some other
dissolved ions in there to

202
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,630
help neutralize the different--
so I put them both

203
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,230
in an aqueous solution.

204
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,480
But they're separate.

205
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,160
   

206
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,060
And let me label them
appropriately.

207
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:55,210
So this is my zinc. Zinc right
here, a bar of solid sync.

208
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,490
And this is my bar
of solid copper.

209
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,960
I should do that in
a different color.

210
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,980
So this is copper right here.

211
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,270
My bar of solid copper.

212
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,470
And then I have an
aqueous solution.

213
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,050
So what happens if we
were to connect

214
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,640
these two metals, right?

215
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,230
They're metals.

216
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,480
If you look at the periodic
table they're

217
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,660
both transition metals.

218
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,570
They both have the
sea of electrons.

219
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,350
So they both conduct
electricity well.

220
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,880
What happens if you connect
these two with a wire?

221
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,370
So if I connect them with a
wire right here like that.

222
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,780
So we already know that the
zinc is just dying to jump

223
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,880
into the water and lose
its electrons, right?

224
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,670
So let's say that happens.

225
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,430
So the zinc jumps into the
aqueous solution, and it turns

226
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,720
into a positive ion of zinc.
And then its electrons are

227
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,030
left behind, right?

228
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,980
So it essentially has
two electrons.

229
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,300
I did the half reaction
right here, right?

230
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,410
The zinc jumps into the solution
and it leaves behind

231
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,850
two electrons right here.

232
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,810
Two electrons here, they really
want to jump off of the

233
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,470
zinc.

234
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:05,110
Now I have a lot of copper out
of here, out here in the

235
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,850
solution, that really want to
jump on to this bar of copper.

236
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,050
But right now they're
all ions.

237
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,340
These are all plus 2 ions.

238
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,350
   

239
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,970
And they really want to jump on
to the bar and join all of

240
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,190
these other copper ions here.

241
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,530
But in order to jump
on to that, they

242
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,880
have to get some electrons.

243
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,270
Each of these guys have
to grab two electrons.

244
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,580
And we know that kind
of potential, or the

245
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,170
electromotive force with which
they want to grab those

246
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,830
electrons is 0.34 volts.

247
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,940
These guys want to jump here
and grab electrons from

248
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,260
someplace with plus
0.34 volts.

249
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,350
These guys want to jump off
of the bar and leave their

250
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:59,350
electrons behind with
0.76 volts.

251
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,820
So what do you think's going
to happen if we have a

252
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,500
conducting wire here?

253
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,960
Well those electrons are, once
this zinc just jumps off,

254
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,260
those electrons are going to
travel through the wire.

255
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,050
And then they're going to be
available, because these are

256
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,290
surplus electrons, to merge with
these copper ions that

257
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,670
want to jump back
on to the bar.

258
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,850
So these copper ions are going
to jump back on to the bar.

259
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,780
But from this reaction
what's happening?

260
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,380
You're having a current flow.

261
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,750
Current is actually flowing.

262
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,610
And what is the voltage
across this?

263
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,450
How badly does an electron want
to go from the zinc on

264
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,420
this bar to over here, join
with some copper in the

265
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,400
solution and let that copper
join on to that bar?

266
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,960
It wants to do it with
plus 1.1 volts.

267
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,520
Now the question is the
electrons are flowing in that

268
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,480
way, what is the cathode
and what is the anode?

269
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,660
So the cathode is the positive
terminal of, well, you can

270
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,430
already imagine, this is a
battery of sorts, right?

271
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,270
Because we are able to generate
a current by having a

272
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,430
voltage difference across
two terminals.

273
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,550
The cathode is the positive
terminal.

274
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,460
That's where the electrons
want to go to.

275
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,450
And then the anode-- and you can
familiarize yourself with,

276
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,570
you know, just a cation is a
positive ion and anion is a

277
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,010
negative ion.

278
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,430
So the anode is a negative
terminal.

279
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,890
So what's the negative
terminal here?

280
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,800
The negative terminal is where
the electrons come from.

281
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,560
See, electrons are coming from
the zinc jumping off.

282
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,980
So is your negative terminal.

283
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,140
And what's the positive
terminal?

284
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,790
That's where the electrons
want to go to.

285
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,200
They want to go down here and be
available for these coppers

286
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,700
that want to jump out
of the solution.

287
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,200
So this is our positive
terminal, or our cathode.

288
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,510
This is the cathode.

289
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,650
This is the anode.

290
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,460
And if someone says, hey, does
oxidation or reduction occur

291
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,690
at the cathode or the anode?

292
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,220
Well what's occurring
right here?

293
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,620
We have zinc in its solid
state right here.

294
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,170
We have solid zinc jumping in--
and it's neutral-- and it

295
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,180
jumps into the solution and it
leaves two electrons behind.

296
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,100
So it's losing electrons.

297
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,750
When you lose electrons
you're being oxidized.

298
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,140
So this is where the oxidation
is occurring.

299
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,090
Likewise, on this side you
have copper ions that are

300
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,090
already in the solution, and
they're gaining electrons.

301
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,250
So their charge is
being reduced.

302
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,280
So the cathode is where
reduction is taking place.

303
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,690
Reduction.

304
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,860
Now you're probably saying, oh
Sal, this is a nice cute

305
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,190
little, you know, battery-- or
this is called a galvanic

306
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,630
cell-- that, you know, you've
created this current.

307
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,860
But I see a problem here.

308
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,780
Because as this happens, you're
going to have more and

309
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,670
more positive zinc ions jump
into the solution here.

310
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,960
You have more and more positive
zinc ions in here as

311
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,270
this progresses.

312
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,940
And you're going to have fewer
and fewer copper ions in here.

313
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,720
So if you assume that there
were some other, let's say

314
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,560
there was, I mean, maybe to keep
the solution neutral--

315
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,460
the copper is positive-- maybe
you had some chloride in

316
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:28,190
there, chloride anions
that were keeping

317
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,250
this solution neutral.

318
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,450
And maybe you had some chlorine
anions here that were

319
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,910
keeping, well, it started
negative but then it maybe

320
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,150
gets a little bit more neutral
as the zinc jumps in.

321
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,060
But once this happens a
lot then it becomes

322
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,160
very positive, right?

323
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,960
This is becoming more and more
positive as more and

324
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,170
more zinc jumps in.

325
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,780
And this is becoming more and
more negative as more copper

326
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,020
jumps on to this bar.

327
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,340
So what can we do to
solve that problem?

328
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,710
What they do is-- and this is
just one way to solve the

329
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,770
problem, there's actually many
but this probably what you

330
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,020
might encounter in your
first-year chemistry class--

331
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,185
is they create something
called a salt bridge.

332
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:03,620
And what they do is they create
a, I guess we could

333
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,280
call it a pseudo-aqueous
solution of salt.

334
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,980
Maybe it's potassium chloride.

335
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,320
So in here we have potassium.

336
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,370
Potassium has a plus charge.

337
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,600
It's aqueous, plus
chlorine with a

338
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,300
negative charge aqueous.

339
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,330
And I say pseudo-aqueous
because it's not really

340
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,490
super-liquid water.

341
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,280
What they do is they try to
make it more viscous so it

342
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,580
just doesn't mix completely.

343
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,190
If this was pure water, then all
of it would just fall into

344
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,800
the solution, and you would
really have nothing up here.

345
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,150
It would be a useless device.

346
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,460
But what they do is they create
a gel that's still

347
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,210
aqueous enough that the
ions can move around.

348
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,780
The sodium and chloride
ions can move around.

349
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,520
So let's say that those are
the-- sorry, not the sodium,

350
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,565
the potassium-- let's say
that's the potassium.

351
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:56,195
And let's say the chlorine ions
are-- I already did it in

352
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:58,870
that blue-- so chlorine
are the minus.

353
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,910
And what happens is as we have
this oxidation reduction

354
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,160
reaction that's causing these
electrons to travel from the

355
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,880
anode to the cathode, this
becomes positives, this

356
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,089
becomes negative.

357
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:13,740
The salt bridge allows the
negative components of the

358
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,240
ionized salt and just waste the
chlorine to go into the

359
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,589
solution to neutralize it.

360
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,220
So they'll end up having more
and more chlorine as

361
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,130
the zinc pops off.

362
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,020
If you were to evaporate the
solution you'd end up with a

363
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,500
bunch of zinc chloride.

364
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,040
And on this side, to keep the
balance here, you'll have a

365
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,610
lot of the positive parts,
components, of the salt.

366
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,450
So the sodium would jump in to
replace the copper that's

367
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,610
jumping out.

368
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,810
So when you have this whole
thing it enables the current

369
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,150
to keep flowing without having
a bad effect on the charge.

370
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,490
Because, you know, what
happens if this

371
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,140
becomes really positive?

372
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,350
If this becomes really
positive-- I'll do it in

373
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,310
vibrant color because there's no
salt bridge-- at some point

374
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,650
the electrons are going to say,
hey, I can either go over

375
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,120
here and drive this reaction
or, hey, I got a lot of

376
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,860
positive stuff hanging
out here.

377
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,430
Maybe I don't want
to leave it all.

378
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,290
So you have to do something to
neutralize the charge here.

379
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,310
Likewise, if this becomes really
negative from all the

380
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,780
chlorine atoms jumping out,
electrons aren't going to want

381
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,390
to go here.

382
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,940
Because like charges
repel each other.

383
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,670
So that's what having the salt
bridge neutralizing the

384
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,650
solution does for you.

385
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,600
It keeps it from getting
negative, and then our

386
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,500
galvanic cell can
keep operating.

387
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:25,667
