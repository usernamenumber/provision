1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,180
We're on problem 115.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,890
Mary's income is 60% more than Tim's income.

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,260
So that's 1.6 times Tim's income.

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,470
You could write it as Tim's income plus 60% of Tim's income,

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,240
but hopefully it's second nature that

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,010
this is just 1.6 times Tim's income.

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,680
So if Mary's income is equal to 1.6 times Tim's income,

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,710
and Tim's income is 40% percent less than Juan's income.

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,160
So Tim's income, if it's 40% less than Juan's income,

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,050
that means that it's 60% of Juan's income.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,530
You can do that as Juan's income minus 40% percent of

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,530
Juan's income. That's 0.6 times Juan's income.

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,010
What percentage of Juan's income is Mary's income?

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,410
So let's just do a little substitution.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,200
Substitute this T over here.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:07,010
So you get Mary is equal to 1.6 times 0.6 times Juan.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:22,830
And then what's 6 times 16? 60 plus 36. 96.

18
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,000
We have 2 numbers to the right of the decimal.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,820
So it's 0.96 times Juan's income. So what are they asking?

20
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,960
What percentage of Juan's income is Mary's income?

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,000
Mary's income is 96% of Juan's income. And that's choice C.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,790
0.96 is 96% of.

23
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,960
Problem 116. Looks like something I have to draw.

24
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,360
Each dot in the mileage table above represents an entry

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,310
indicating the distance between a pair of five cities.

26
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:02,890
Let me try to draw this out quickly. So we have five cities.

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:18,060
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

28
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:29,200
And then we have to do it the other way. 1, 2, 3, and then 4.

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,410
They have the same cities on both axes.City A,B, C, D, and E.

30
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:48,160
City A, B, C, D, and E. And they have some dots.

31
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,170
That's a dot, a dot, a dot, a dot, then dots down that way.

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,020
Each dot in the mileage table above represents an entry

33
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,490
indicating the distance between a pair of the five cities.

34
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,610
If the table were extended to represent the distances

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,830
between all pairs of 30 cities, and each distance were

36
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,670
to be represented by only one entry,

37
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,460
how many entries would the table then have?

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,690
So they're saying,

39
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,040
OK, this is essentially the case with five cities.

40
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,340
You don't want to care about the distance between A and A.

41
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,310
They want the distance between all pairs of 30 cities.

42
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,090
So this is the case when you have n is equal to 5.

43
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,000
And the reason why you could say the distance between A and

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,330
B is this dot, you could have also said the distance between

45
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,000
B and A is this dot down here.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,660
But they didn't draw a dot there, because they said and

47
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,210
each distance were to be represented by only one entry.

48
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,110
So they don't want to double-- if this was 5,

49
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,530
this would also be 5. They only want to write it there once.

50
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,060
So relative to 5, how would we figure this out?

51
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,880
So if you think about it, what you're going to have is--

52
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,420
no matter how big this table is,

53
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,090
the diagonal is going to be empty.

54
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,620
You don't have to fill out the distance between

55
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,080
the city and itself.

56
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,770
And then if you just continue the trend that they did,

57
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,890
out of what's left over, ou're just going to fill out half of

58
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,460
them, because the other half is just redundant information.

59
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:25,030
So for example, if you have 5 cities, you're going to have 5

60
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,080
times 5 is equal to 25 squares.

61
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,580
How many squares are going to be in the diagonal?

62
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,590
We're going to have exactly 5 squares in the diagonal.

63
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,040
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So you're going to subtract 5.

64
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,890
So you're going to have 20 boxes left that

65
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,810
aren't in the diagonal.

66
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,060
And then you are going to have to to fill out half of those.

67
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,330
So you're going to fill out exactly 10 boxes,

68
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,060
so 1, 2, 3 ,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

69
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,570
So let's do the same exercise with 30.

70
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,600
If you have 30 cities, you're going to have 30 times 30 boxes

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,030
which is equal to 900.

72
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,170
You're going to take out the 30 boxes

73
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:09,000
that are in the diagonal, so minus 30.So that's equal to 870.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,040
And then you are only going to have to fill out half of those

75
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,600
because you don't want redundant information.

76
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,300
So you are only going to fill out the top half the way they

77
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,160
did it in this diagram.

78
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,660
So if you divide this by 2, you're going to get to what?

79
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,650
870 divided by 2 is 435. And that's choice B.

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,510
Next question, 117.

81
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,060
Which of the following has a value less than 1?

82
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,690
So choice A is 2 times 7/13.

83
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,830
2 times 7 is 14, so that's greater than 13.

84
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:57,010
So it's not A. B, square root of 10/2.

85
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,520
The square root of 10, that's going to be 3 point something,

86
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,080
which is greater than 2. So that's not right.

87
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,090
Choice C is 2 over the square root of 2.

88
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,020
The square root of 2 is less than 2. It's 1 point something.

89
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,980
So this is going to also have a value greater than 1.

90
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,060
So it can't be this. We're looking for less than 1.

91
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,690
Choice D says 1 divided by 1/2.

92
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,030
That's equal to 1 times 2, which is equal to 2.

93
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,340
So I can already tell you the choice is going to be E.

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,040
Let's look at it. So they have 9/10 squared.

95
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,650
That's 81/100, which sure enough is definitely less than 1.

96
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,800
So the choice is E.

97
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,950
Problem 118.

98
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,790
The ratio of the length to the width of a rectangular

99
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,880
advertising display is approximately 3.3:2.

100
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,670
So the length is 3.3 and the width is 2.

101
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,010
At least that's the ratios.

102
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,560
If the width of the display is 8 meters,

103
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,060
what is the approximate length of the display in meters?

104
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,030
So they tell us the length to the width is approximately

105
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:29,780
3.3:2, which is approximately equal to the length to 8 meters

106
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,000
They say the width of the display is 8 meters.

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,010
So we just have to solve this as best as we can for L.

108
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,740
The easiest way to think about it is to go from 2 to 8,

109
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,890
you multiply by 4.

110
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,400
So to go from 3.3 to L we have to multiply by 4.

111
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,420
So L is equal to 3.3 times 4. What's that?

112
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:58,110
33 times 4, or 3.3 times 4. 4 times 3 is 12, plus 1 is 13.

113
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,010
One number behind the decimal point. 13.2.

114
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,790
So they say approximate, and the closest one is choice C, 13.

115
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,420
Problem 119.

116
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,820
The average salary of 15 people in the shipping

117
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,000
department of a certain firm is $20,000.

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,050
So the average of 15 people is equal to $20,000.

119
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,420
The salary of 5 of the employees is $25,000 each, so

120
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,020
we can even say the average of those 5 is going to be $25,000

121
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,030
because all of them make $25,000.

122
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,060
And the salary of 4 of the employees is $16,000 each.

123
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,040
The average of 4 of the employees is $16,000 each.

124
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,020
That's the salary, but if you average 4 people making

125
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,020
$16,000, the average is going to be $16,000.

126
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,080
What is the average salary of the remaining employees?

127
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,980
Let's think about this.

128
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,210
Let's try to find the average of all of the employees.

129
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,720
So if we find the average of all 15 employees,

130
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,810
we're going to sum up all their salaries, divide by 15.

131
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:14,550
And we know that that is going to be equal to $20,000.

132
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,900
Now we have these 5 guys making $25,000,

133
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,090
so the sum of their salaries is going to be 5 times $25,000.

134
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,940
And then you have these 4 people making $16,000,

135
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,070
so it's plus 4 times 16.

136
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,970
I'm just trying to sum up everyone's salaries up here in

137
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,650
the numerator, and I'm going to divide by 15.

138
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,140
And then I'm going to have what?

139
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,500
The average of the remaining people.

140
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,730
How many people are remaining?

141
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,040
I've already done 9 people, so there's 6 people remaining

142
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,140
because there's a total of 15 people.

143
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,030
So the average of the 6 remaining people times 6.

144
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,090
Whatever their average is, times 6,

145
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,050
that'll give you the sum of their salaries.

146
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,070
And now we just solve for the average of those 6.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,760
Let's see what we can do. So 5 times 25, that's 125.

148
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,210
Plus 4 times 16 is 64.

149
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:15,010
Plus 6 times-- let's call it A-- 6A is equal to 20 times 15.

150
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:20,010
So what's 20 times 15? 20 times 10 is 200. 20 times 5 is 100.

151
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,880
So it's equal to 300.

152
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:37,450
125 plus 64 is 189 plus 6A, is equal to 300.

153
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,060
Subtract 189 from both sides.

154
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:52,780
You get 6A is equal to 300 minus 189. That's 111.

155
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,630
89, add 11 to it, you get to 200.

156
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,090
And then you have to add another 100 to get to 300,

157
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,010
so it's 111. 300 minus 189.

158
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,700
And then how many times does 6 go into 111?

159
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,880
Divide both sides by 6.

160
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:15,600
6 goes into 111-- 6 goes into 51 eight times. 8 times 48.

161
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:24,130
18.5 times. $18,500 is the average of their salary.

162
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,030
And luckily enough, that's one of the choices.

163
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,000
That's choice B. $18,500. We did everything in thousandths ?

164
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,050
so we got 18.5, but that's $18,500.

165
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,050
