1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,120
The normal distribution is
arguably, the most important

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,220
concept in statistics.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,660
Everything we do or almost
everything we do in inferential

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,220
statistics which is
essentially, making inferences

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,340
based on data points, is to
some degree, based on the

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,460
normal distribution.

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:23,470
So, what I want to do in this
video, in this spreadsheet, is

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,100
to essentially give you as deep
an understanding of the normal

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,850
distribution as possible.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,070
For the rest of your life if
someone says, we're assuming a

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,810
normal distribution you can
say, oh I know what that is,

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,190
this is a formula and I
understand how to

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,310
use it et cetera.

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,550
So this spreadsheet, just so
you know, is downloadable at

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,880
www.khanacademy.org/downlads/
and if you just type that part

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,550
in you'll see everything
that's downloadable.

17
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,020
Then download/normalintro.xls
and you'll get this

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,470
spreadsheet right here.

19
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,360
I think I did this in
the right standard.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,920
Anyway, if you go onto
Wikipedia and if you were to

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,420
type in normal distribution or
were to do a search for a

22
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,910
normal distribution -- let me
actually get my pen tool going

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,740
-- this is what you would see.

24
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,950
I literally copied and pasted
this right here from Wikipedia.

25
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,040
I know it looks daunting, you
have all these Greek letters

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,620
there, but this is just -- this
sigma right here -- that is

27
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,950
just the standard deviation
of the distribution.

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,510
We'll play with that a little
bit in this chart and

29
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,780
see what that means.

30
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,610
You know what the standard
deviation means in general but

31
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,800
this is the standard deviation
of this distribution, which is

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,620
a probability density function.

33
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,110
And I encourage you to rewatch
the video on probability

34
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,280
density functions because it's
a little bit of a transition

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,880
going from the binomial
distribution, which

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,320
is discreet.

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,180
The binomial distribution will
say, what is the probability of

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,740
getting a 5, and you just kind
of look at that histogram or

39
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,220
that bar chart and say oh,
that's the probability.

40
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,220
But in a continuous probability
distribution or a continuous

41
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,010
probability density function,
you can't just say what is the

42
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,930
probability of me getting a 5.

43
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,590
You have to say what is the
probability of me getting

44
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,920
between, let's say
a 4.5 and a 5.5.

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,180
You have to give it some range.

46
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,700
And then, your probability
isn't given by just

47
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,350
reading this graph.

48
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,265
The probability is given by
the area under that curve.

49
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,450
It be given by this area.

50
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,260
For those of you who know
calculus, if p of x is our

51
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,140
probability density function --
doesn't have to be a normal

52
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,290
distribution although it often
is a normal distribution -- the

53
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,740
way you actually figure out the
probability, let's say between

54
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,890
4 and a half and 5 and half.

55
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,570
What is the probability, the
odds of me getting between 4

56
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,220
and a half and 5 and a half
inches of rain tomorrow?

57
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,460
It'll actually be the integral
from 4 and a half to 5 and a

58
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,060
half of this probability
density function or of this

59
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,800
probably density
function, the x.

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,950
So that's just the
area of the curve.

61
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,370
For those of you who don't know
calculus yet, I encourage

62
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,590
you to watch that playlist.

63
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,030
But all this is saying is
the area of the curve

64
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,660
from here to here.

65
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,150
It turns out for the normal
distribution, this isn't an

66
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,000
easy thing to evaluate
analytical and so you

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,040
do it numerically.

68
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,440
You don't have to feel bad
about doing it numerically

69
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,570
because oh, how do I take
the integral of this?

70
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,990
There's actually functions
for it and you can

71
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,960
even approximate it.

72
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,300
One way you can approximate it
is you could use it the way you

73
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,000
approximate integrals
in general.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,630
You could say well, what
is the area of this?

75
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,750
Well it's roughly the
area of this trapezoid.

76
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,290
So you could figure out the
area of that trapezoid, taking

77
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,880
the average of that point and
that point and multiplying

78
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,750
it by the base.

79
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,880
Or you can just take the level
of -- let me change colors

80
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,830
because I think I'm overdoing
it with the green -- or you

81
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,300
could just take the height of
this line right here and

82
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,910
multiply it by the base.

83
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,060
You'll get the area of this
rectangle, which might be a

84
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,410
pretty good approximation for
the area under the curve.

85
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:49,600
Right?

86
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,060
Because you'll have a little
bit extra over here but you're

87
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,680
going to miss a little bit
over there, so it might be a

88
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,580
pretty good approximation.

89
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,760
That's actually what I do in
the other video, just to

90
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,870
approximate the area under the
curve and give you a good sense

91
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,950
that the normal distribution is
what the binomial distribution

92
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,450
becomes essentially, if
you have many trials.

93
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,720
What's interesting about the
normal distribution -- I don't

94
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,310
know if I mentioned this
already -- this right

95
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,510
here, this is the graph.

96
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,400
This is just another word,
people might talk about the

97
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,410
central limit theorem.

98
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,350
But this is really kind of one
of the most important or

99
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,660
interesting things about our
universe, central

100
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,810
limit theorem.

101
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,560
I won't prove it here but it
essentially tells us, and you

102
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,990
could kind of understand it by
looking at the other video

103
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,690
where we talk about
flipping coins.

104
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,230
If we were to do many flips of
coins -- those are independent

105
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,570
trials of each other -- and if
you take the sum of all of your

106
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,380
flips, if you were to give
yourself one point -- if you

107
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,360
got ahead every time -- and if
you're take the sum of them as

108
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,150
you approach an infinite number
flips, you approach the

109
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,180
normal distribution.

110
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,330
What's interesting about that
is each of those trials -- in

111
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,480
the case of flipping the coin,
each trial is a flip of the

112
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,240
coin -- each of those trials
don't have to have a

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,580
normal distribution.

114
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,950
So we could be talking about
molecular interactions and

115
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,850
every time compound x interacts
with compound y what might it

116
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,600
result doesn't have to have
to be normally distributed.

117
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,010
But what happens is, if you
take a sum of a ton of those

118
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,340
interactions, then all of a
sudden the end result will

119
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,100
be normally distributed.

120
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,550
This is why this is such an
important distribution.

121
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,540
It shows up in nature all of
the time and if you do take

122
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,250
data points from something that
is very complex and it is the

123
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,740
sum of arguably, many almost
infinite individual independent

124
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,160
trials, it's a pretty good
assumption to assume the

125
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,040
normal distribution.

126
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,640
We'll do other videos where we
talk about when it is a good

127
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,860
assumption, when it isn't
a good assumption.

128
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,120
But anyway, just to digest
this a little bit and let

129
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,880
me actually rewrite it.

130
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,590
This is what you'll see on
Wikipedia but this could be

131
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:58,080
rewritten as 1 over sigma times
the square root of 2 pi times

132
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,250
x is just e to that power.

133
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,386
So it's just e to the, this
whole thing over here, minus

134
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:12,670
x minus the mean squared
over 2 sigma squared.

135
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,200
This is the standard deviation.

136
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,900
Standard deviation squared
is just the variance.

137
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,330
Just so you know how to use
this, you're like, oh wow,

138
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,770
there's so many Greek
letters here, what do I do?

139
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,740
This tells you the
height of the normal

140
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,100
distribution function.

141
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:37,950
Let's say that this is the
distribution of people's

142
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,200
heights above 5'9.

143
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,060
Let's say that this
was 5'9 and not 0.

144
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:51,980
What this tells you is, if you
wanted to figure out what is

145
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,600
the probability of finding
someone who was roughly 5

146
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,410
inches taller than the average
right here, what you would

147
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,170
do is you would put in this
number here, this 5 into x.

148
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,390
And then you know the standard
deviation, because you've

149
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,020
taken a bunch of samples.

150
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,200
You know the variance, which is
the standard deviation squared.

151
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,860
You know the mean, and you just
put your x in there and it'll

152
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,200
tell you the height
of the function.

153
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,940
And then you have to
give it a range.

154
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,290
You can't just say how many
people are exactly 5 inches

155
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,850
taller than average.

156
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,330
You would actually say how
many people are between 5.1

157
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,567
inches and 4.9 nine inches
taller than the average.

158
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,080
You have to give it a little
bit of range because no is

159
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,880
exactly, it's almost infinitely
impossible to the atom

160
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,410
to be exactly 5'9.

161
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,230
Even the definition of
an inch isn't defined

162
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,220
that particularly.

163
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,100
So that's how you'd
use this function.

164
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,760
This is so heavily used in,
one, it shows up in nature

165
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,350
but in all of inferential
statistics, I think it behooves

166
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,320
you to become as familiar with
this formula as possible.

167
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,710
I guess to make that happen.

168
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,250
Let me play around a little bit
with this formula just to kind

169
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,890
of give you an intuition of how
everything works out et cetera.

170
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,090
If I were to take this -- I'd
like to maybe help you memorize

171
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,150
this -- this could be rewritten
as, if we take the sigma into

172
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,440
the square root sign, if we
take the standard deviation in

173
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,610
there, it becomes 1 over
the square root of 2

174
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,800
pie sigma squared.

175
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,570
I've never seen it written this
way but it gives me a little

176
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,980
intuition that sigma squared,
it's always written as sigma

177
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,790
squared, but it's really just
the variance and the variance

178
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,990
is what you calculate before
you calculate the standard

179
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,220
deviation, so that's
interesting.

180
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,060
And then this top right here,
this could be written as e to

181
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:35,910
the minus 1 half times and both
of these things here are

182
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:40,850
squared so we could just say x
minus the mean over

183
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,630
sigma squared.

184
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,540
And this kind of clarifies
what's going on here

185
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,570
a little bit better.

186
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,010
Because what's this?

187
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,970
x minus sigma is the distance
between whatever point

188
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,680
we want to find.

189
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,580
Let's say we're here.

190
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,520
x minus mu is the mean so
that's here so that's this

191
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,510
distance, and this is the
standard deviation which

192
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,140
is this distance.

193
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,680
So this in here tells me how
many standard deviations

194
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
I am away from the mean.

195
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,560
That's actually called the
standard z score, I talked

196
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,700
about it in the other video.

197
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,740
And then we square that
and then we take this

198
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,340
to the minus 1/2.

199
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,420
Well let me rewrite that.

200
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,930
If I were to write e to the
minus 1/2 times a, that's the

201
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,530
same thing as e to the a to
the minus 1/2 power right?

202
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,480
If you take something to an
exponent and take that to

203
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,200
an exponent you can just
multiply these exponents.

204
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,460
So likewise, this could be
rewritten as, this is equal to

205
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:46,500
1 over the square root of 2
pi sigma squared, which

206
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,610
is just the variance.

207
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,120
And I'm just playing around
with the formula because I

208
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,165
really want you to see all
the ways, maybe you'll

209
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:52,270
get a little intuition.

210
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,300
I encourage you to email me
if you see some insight

211
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,160
on why this exists.

212
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Once again, I think it is cool
then all of the sudden we have

213
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,950
this other formula that
has pi and e in it.

214
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,970
So many phenomenon are
described by this and once

215
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,320
again pi and e show up together
just like e to the i pi

216
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,120
is equal to negative 1.

217
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,400
It tells you something
about our universe.

218
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:24,870
Anyway, I could rewrite this as
e to the x minus mu over sigma

219
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,690
squared and all of that
to the minus 1/2.

220
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,970
Something in the minus 1/2
power, that's just 1 over

221
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,360
the square root which is
already going on here.

222
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,650
So we could just rewrite this
over here as 1 over the square

223
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:52,180
root of 2 pi times the variance
times e to essentially,

224
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,080
our z score squared.

225
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,600
If we say z is this thing in
here, z is how many standard

226
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,370
deviations we are from the
mean, z score squared.

227
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,500
And all of the sudden
this becomes very clean.

228
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,240
We just say 2 pi times our
variance times e to the number

229
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,700
standard deviations we are away
from the mean and

230
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,760
you square that.

231
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,590
You take the square root of
that thing and invert it and

232
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,880
that's the normal distribution.

233
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,930
Anyway, I wanted to do that.

234
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,590
I thought it was neat
and it's interesting to

235
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,290
play around with it.

236
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,850
Then that way if you see it in
any of these other forms in the

237
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,070
rest of your life your won't
say what's that, I thought the

238
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,240
normal distribution was this or
it was this and now you know.

239
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,480
With that said, let's play
around a little bit with

240
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,060
this normal distribution.

241
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,370
So this spreadsheet,
I've plotted the

242
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:36,880
normal distribution.

243
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,780
You can change the assumptions
that are in this kind

244
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,670
of green, blue color.

245
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,190
So right now it's plotting it
with a mean of zero and a

246
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,360
standard deviation of 4.

247
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,930
I just write the variance here
just for your information,

248
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,090
the variance is just the
standard deviation squared.

249
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,810
And so what happens when
you change the mean?

250
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,170
So if the mean goes from 0
to let's say it goes to 5.

251
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,740
Notice, this graph just
shifted to the right by 5.

252
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:00,920
Right?

253
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,400
It was centered here, now
it's centered over here.

254
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,270
If we make it minus
5, what happens?

255
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,070
The whole bell curve just
shifts 5 to the left

256
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,270
from the center.

257
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,320
Now what happens when you
change the standard deviation.

258
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,490
The variance is the average
squared distance from the mean,

259
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,010
the standard deviation is
the square root of that.

260
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,150
So it's kind of, not exactly,
but kind of the average

261
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,180
distance from the mean.

262
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,790
So the smaller the standard
deviation the closer a

263
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,440
lot of the points are
going to be the mean.

264
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,763
We should get kind of a
narrower graph and let's

265
00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:34,740
see if that happens.

266
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,630
When the standard deviation
is 2, we see that.

267
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,550
The graph you're more likely
to be really close to the

268
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,820
mean than further away.

269
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,450
If you make the standard
deviation, if you make it 10,

270
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,470
all of the sudden you got a
really flat graph and this

271
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,140
thing keeps going on forever.

272
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,880
And that's a key difference:
the binomial distribution

273
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,000
is always finite.

274
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,450
You can only have a finite
number of values while the

275
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,640
normal distribution is
defined over the entire

276
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,860
real number line.

277
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,490
So the probability, if you
have a mean of minus 5 and a

278
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,330
standard deviation of 10, the
probability of getting a

279
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:15,200
thousand here is very low but
there's some probability.

280
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,800
There's some probably that all
of the atoms in my body just

281
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,720
arrange perfectly that I fall
through the seat

282
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,220
I'm sitting on.

283
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,850
It's very unlikely and it
probably won't happen in

284
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,750
the life of the universe
but it can happen.

285
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,260
And that can be described by
normal distribution because it

286
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,880
says, anything can happen
although it could

287
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,480
very unprobable.

288
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,940
The thing I talked about at the
beginning of the video is when

289
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,370
you figure out a normal
distribution you can't just

290
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,260
look at this point on the graph
-- let me get the drop pen tool

291
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,580
back -- you have to figure out
the area under the curve

292
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,570
between two points.

293
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,755
So if I wanted to say -- let's
say this is our distribution

294
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:55,950
-- and I said what is the
probability that I get 0.

295
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,550
I don't know what phenomena
this is describing

296
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,210
but at 0 happened.

297
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,880
If I say exactly 0, the
probability is 0 -- I shouldn't

298
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,290
use 0 too much -- because
the area under the curve,

299
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,960
just under 0, there's no
area, it's just a line.

300
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,280
You have to say
between a range.

301
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,290
So you have to say the
probability between -- and

302
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:28,260
actually I can type it in here
-- between minus .005 and plus

303
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,540
.005 is -- well it rounded -- it
says they're close to 0.

304
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,340
Let me do it, between
minus 1 and between 1.

305
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,450
It calculated at 7 percent
and I'll show you how I

306
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,360
calculated this in a second.

307
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,910
So let me get the
screen draw tool.

308
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,440
So what did I just do?

309
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,690
Between minus 1 and 1 -- and
I'll show you the behind the

310
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,910
scenes, what excel is doing --
we're going from minus 1, which

311
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,770
is roughly right here, to 1.

312
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,090
And we're calculating the
area under the curve.

313
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,220
We're calculating this area or
for those of you who know

314
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:11,710
calculus, we're calculating the
integral from minus 1 to 1 of

315
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,360
this function where the
standard deviation is right

316
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,040
here, is 10 and the
mean is minus 5.

317
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,070
Actually, let me put that in.

318
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,200
So we're calculating, for this
example, the way it's drawn

319
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,130
right here, the normal
distribution function, our

320
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:34,590
standard deviation is 10 times
square root of 2 pi times e to

321
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:40,180
the minus 1/2 times
x minus our mean.

322
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,100
Our mean is negative right now.

323
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,970
Our mean is minus 5 so it's x
plus 5 over the standard

324
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,440
deviation squared which is the
variance, so that's

325
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,730
100 squared dx.

326
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,040
This is what this number is
right here, this 7 percent

327
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,150
or actually .07 is the
area right around there.

328
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,710
Now, unfortunately for us in
the world, this isn't an

329
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,400
easy integral to evaluate
analytical, even for those of

330
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,870
us who know our calculus.

331
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,600
So this tends to be
done numerically.

332
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,850
And kind of an easy way to do
this is -- well not as easy way

333
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,620
-- a function has been defined
called the cumuluative

334
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,860
distribution function that is a
useful tool for figuring

335
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,560
out this area.

336
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,410
So what the cumulative
distribution function is

337
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,350
essentially -- let me call it
the cumulative distribution

338
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,220
function -- it's
a function of x.

339
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,340
It gives us the area under
the curve, under this curve.

340
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,040
So let's say that this is x
right here, that's our x.

341
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,240
It tells you the area
under the curve up to x.

342
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,130
So another way to think about
it, it tells you what is the

343
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,980
probability that you land
at some value less

344
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,990
than your x value.

345
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:53,580
So it's the area from minus
infinity to x of our

346
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,050
probability density function.

347
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:04,220
When you actually use the Excel
normal distribution function,

348
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,300
let me say norm distribution.

349
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,630
You have to give it your
x value, you give it the

350
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,230
mean, you give it the
standard deviation.

351
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,240
And then you say whether you
want the cumulative

352
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,660
distribution, in which case you
say true or you want just this

353
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,610
normal distribution,
which you say false.

354
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,670
So if you wanted to graph
this right here, you

355
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,590
would say false in caps.

356
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,390
If you wanted to graph the
cumulative distribution

357
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,800
function which I do down here
-- let me move this down a

358
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,776
little bit, let me get out of
pen tool

359
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:44,684
so the cumulative distribution function is -- right over here

360
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:47,030
then you say true when you make that Excel call.

361
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,230
So this is a cumulative
distribution function for the same... for this

362
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,260
This is a normal distribution,
here's a cumulative

363
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,890
distribution.

364
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,600
Just so you get the intuition.

365
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,280
If you want to know, what
is the probability that I

366
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,720
get a value less than 20?

367
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,660
So I can get any value
less than 20 given

368
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,320
this distribution.

369
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,990
The cumulative distribution
right here, -- let me make it

370
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,260
so you can see -- if you go to
20 you just go right to that

371
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,510
point there and you say wow,
the probability of getting

372
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,080
20 or less is pretty high.

373
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,220
It's approaching 100 percent.

374
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,210
That makes sense because
most of the area under this

375
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,120
curve is less than 20.

376
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,130
Or if you said what's the
probability of getting

377
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,740
less than minus five.

378
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,630
Well minus 5 is the mean
so half of your results

379
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,160
should be above that and
half should be below.

380
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,390
And if you go to this point
right here you could see that

381
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,130
this right here is 50 percent.

382
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,420
So the probability of getting
less than minus 5 is

383
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,490
exactly 50 percent.

384
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,350
So what you do is, if I wanted
to know the probability of

385
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,410
getting between negative 1 and
1 what I do is -- let me get

386
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:53,600
back to my pen tool -- I figure
out what is the probability

387
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,050
of getting minus 1 or lower.

388
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,560
So I figure out
this whole area.

389
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,510
And then I figure out the
probability of getting one or

390
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,356
lower which is this whole area
-- well I'm going to give it

391
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:10,810
a different color -- 1 or
lower is everything there.

392
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,740
And I subtract the yellow area
from the magenta area and I'll

393
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,870
just get what's ever
left over here.

394
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,670
That's exactly what I did
in the spread sheet.

395
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,322
Let me scroll down.

396
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:28,030
This might be taxing my
computer by taking the

397
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,280
screen capture with it.

398
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,220
So what I did is I evaluated
the cumulative distribution

399
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:39,260
function at one to
be right there.

400
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,740
And I evaluate the cumulative
distribution function at minus

401
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,410
1, which is right there.

402
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,490
And the difference between
these two, I subtract this

403
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,560
number from this number and
that tells me essentially

404
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,250
the probability that I'm
between those two numbers.

405
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:02,490
Or another way to think about
it, the area right here.

406
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,860
I really encourage you to play
with this and explore the excel

407
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,130
formulas and everything.

408
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,640
This area right here
would be minus 1 and 1.

409
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,590
Just so you know this graph,
the central line right

410
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,250
here, this is the mean.

411
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,560
And then these two lines I drew
right here, these are 1

412
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,230
standard deviation below and 1
standard deviation

413
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,280
above the mean.

414
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,430
Some people think what's the
probability that land within

415
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,630
one standard deviation
of the mean?

416
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,540
Well that's easy to do.

417
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,850
What I can do is I'll
just click on this.

418
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,810
And I'll just call this, what's
the probability that I land

419
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:44,110
between 1 standard deviation --
the mean is minus 5 -- one

420
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,720
standard deviation below the
mean is minus 15 and one

421
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,580
standard deviation above the
mean is 10 plus minus 5 is 5.

422
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,190
So that's between 5 and 15.

423
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,740
So 68.3 percent.

424
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,130
That's actually always the case
that you have a 68.3 percent

425
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,800
probability of landing within
one standard deviation of the

426
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,920
mean, assuming you have
a normal distribution.

427
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,640
So once again, that number
represents the area under

428
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,840
the curve here, this
area under the curve.

429
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,670
And the way you get it
is with the cumulative

430
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,660
distribution function.

431
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,730
I'll go down here.

432
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,410
Every time I move this I have
to get rid of the pen tool.

433
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:33,370
You evaluate it at plus
5, which is right here.

434
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,120
This is 1 standard deviation
above the mean, that's a

435
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,370
number right around there.

436
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,220
It looks like it's like 80
something percent, maybe

437
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,920
90 percent roughly.

438
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,050
And then you evaluate it at
1 standard deviation below

439
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,120
the mean which is minus 15.

440
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,230
And this one looks like roughly
15 percent or so, 15, 16, maybe

441
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,220
17 percent, I'll
say 18 percent.

442
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,390
But the big picture is when
you subtract this value

443
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,740
from this value you get
the probability that you

444
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,910
land between those two.

445
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,010
And that's because this
value tells the probability

446
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,600
that you're less.

447
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,080
So when you go to the
cumulative distribution

448
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,540
function you get
that right there.

449
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,630
It keeps crawling
back and forth.

450
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,660
So when you go to five -- and
you just go right over here --

451
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,670
this is essentially tells you
this area under the curve, the

452
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,220
probability that you're
less than or equal to

453
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,500
5, everything up there.

454
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,370
And then when you evaluate it
at minus 15 down here, it

455
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,430
tells you the probability
that you're back here.

456
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,690
So when you subtract this from
the larger thing you're just

457
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,190
left with what's under
the curve right there.

458
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,530
Just to understand this
spreadsheet a little bit better

459
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,930
because I really want you to
play with it and see what

460
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,750
happens if I make this
distribution, the mean was

461
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,605
minus 5 now let me make it 5.

462
00:22:58,605 --> 00:23:00,950
It just shifted to the right.

463
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,410
It just moved over
to the right by 5.

464
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:03,890
Whoops.

465
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,920
Let me use the pen tool.

466
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,595
It just moved over
to the right by 5.

467
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,610
If I were to try to make the
standard deviation smaller

468
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,670
we'll see that the whole thing
just gets a little bit tighter.

469
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,670
Let's make it 6.

470
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,430
And all of a sudden this looks
a like a tighter curve, we make

471
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,370
it 2, it becomes even tighter.

472
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,290
I really want you to play with
this and play with the formula

473
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,620
and get an intuitive feeling
for this, the cumulative

474
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,665
distribution function and think
a lot about how it relates to

475
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:35,900
the binomial distribution and I
cover that in the last video.

476
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,890
To plot this I just took
each of these points.

477
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,170
I went to plot the points
between minus 20 and 20 and

478
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,990
I just incremented by 1.

479
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,460
I just decided to
increment by 1.

480
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,720
So this isn't a continues
curve, it's actually just

481
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,270
plotting a point at each
point and connecting

482
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,220
it with the line.

483
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,890
Then I did the distance
between each of those

484
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,110
points and the mean.

485
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:01,020
So I just took 0 minus 5,
this is this distance.

486
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,270
So this just tells you
the point minus 20 is

487
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,150
25 less than the mean.

488
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,400
That's all I did there.

489
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,560
Then I divided that by the
standard deviation and this

490
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,000
is the z score, the
standard z score.

491
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,420
This tells me how many standard
deviations is minus 20

492
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,720
away from the mean.

493
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,250
It's 12 and a half standard
deviations below the mean.

494
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,410
Then I use that and I just
plugged it into essentially

495
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,270
this formula to figure out
the height of the function.

496
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:33,590
Let's say at minus 20
the height is very low.

497
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,130
Let's say at minus 2 the
heights a little bit better,

498
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,100
the heights going to be
some place, it's going

499
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,130
to be right there.

500
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,180
And so that gives
me that value.

501
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,470
But then to actually figure out
the probability of that, what I

502
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,940
do is I calculate the
cumulative distribution

503
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,960
function.

504
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,470
Well this is the probability
that you're less than that.

505
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,520
So the area under the curve
below that which is very small.

506
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,270
It's not zero, I know it
looks like 0 here but that's

507
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,720
only because I round it.

508
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,320
It's going to be 0001,
it's going to be a

509
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,150
really small number.

510
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,200
There's some probability that
we even get minus a thousand.

511
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,760
Another intuitive thing that
you really should have a sense

512
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,030
for is the integral over this
or the entire area of the curve

513
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,620
has to be 1 because that
takes into account all

514
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,210
possible circumstances.

515
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,810
And that should happen if we
put a suitably smaller number

516
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,410
here and a suitably
large number here.

517
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,530
There you go, we
get 100 percent.

518
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,540
Although, this isn't
a 100 percent.

519
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,180
We'd have to go from minus
infinity to plus infinity to

520
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,370
really get a 100 percent.

521
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,840
It's just rounding
to 100 percent.

522
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,720
It's probably 99.99999 percent
or something like that.

523
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,900
And so to actually calculate
this, what I do is I take the

524
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,920
cumulative distribution
function of this point and I

525
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,730
subtract from that the
cumulative distribution

526
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,680
function of that point.

527
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,270
And that's where I got
this 100 percent from.

528
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:57,760
Anyway, hopefully that will
give you a good feel for

529
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,570
the normal distribution.

530
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,830
I really encourage you to play
with the spreadsheet and to

531
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,320
even make a spreadsheet
like this yourself.

532
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,230
In a future exercise we'll
actually use this type of

533
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,370
spreadsheet as an input
into other models.

534
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,420
If we're doing a financial
model and if we say our revenue

535
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,220
has a normal distribution
around some expected value,

536
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,000
what is the distribution
of our net income?

537
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,050
Or we could think of a
hundred other different

538
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:20,930
types of examples.

539
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,570
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
