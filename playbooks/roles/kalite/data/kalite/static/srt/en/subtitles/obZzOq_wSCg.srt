1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:03,044
Let's do a little bit of probability with playing cards

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:05,055
For the sake of this video we're going to assume

3
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:07,057
that our deck has no jokers in it.

4
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:09,027
You could do the same problems with the joker,

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,034
you'll just get slightly different numbers.

6
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:13,027
So with that out of the way

7
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:15,007
Let's first just think about

8
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:17,862
how many cards we have in a standard playing deck?

9
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:21,086
so you have four suits

10
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:25,518
and the suits are: the spades, the diamonds, the clubs

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:27,023
and the hearts.

12
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:28,024
You have four suits

13
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:31,059
and then in each of those suits you have thirteen different

14
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:34,010
types of cards or sometimes it's called the rank.

15
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:44,057
So each suit has thirteen types of cards

16
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:47,041
You have the ace, then you have the two, the three,

17
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:52,073
the four, the five, the six, seven, eight, nine, ten

18
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:55,588
and then you have the jack, the king and the queen.

19
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,518
And that is thirteen cards

20
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:01,013
So you can have for each suit you can have

21
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:03,096
any of these, for any of these you can have any of the suits

22
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,082
So you can a jack of diamonds, a jack of clubs

23
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:08,660
a jack of spades or a jack of hearts.

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,475
So if you just multiply these two things

25
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:12,762
you could take a deck of playing cards and actually

26
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:14,062
count them, take up the jokers and count them.

27
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:16,061
But if you just multiply this, you have four suits

28
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,096
each of those suits has thirteen types

29
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:21,073
so you're gonna have 4 times 13 cards

30
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:24,084
or you gonna have 52 cards in a standard playing deck.

31
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,088
Another way you can say it is like: look, there is thirteen

32
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:28,044
of these ranks or types

33
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:30,001
and each of those come in four different suits,

34
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:33,065
13 times 4 once again you'd have gotten 52 cards.

35
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:36,013
Now that out of the way, let's think about the probabilities

36
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,266
of different events.

37
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,751
So let's say I shuffled that deck,

38
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:40,369
I shuffled it really, really well.

39
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,033
And then I randomly picked a card from that deck.

40
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:47,043
And I want to think about what is the probability that I pick

41
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:50,049
what is the probability that I pick a jack?

42
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:53,072
Well, how many equally likely events are there?

43
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:57,036
Well, I can pick anyone of those 52 cards, so there's

44
00:01:57,036 --> 00:02:00,059
52 possibilities for when I pick that card.

45
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:04,050
And how many of those 52 possibilities are jacks?

46
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,070
Well, you have the jack of spades, the jack of diamonds

47
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,033
the jack of clubs and the jack of hearts.

48
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:12,026
There's four jacks

49
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:14,013
There's four jacks in that deck.

50
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:17,094
So it is 4 over 52, these are both divisible by four

51
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:19,072
Four divided by four is one

52
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,095
52 divided by 4 is 13.

53
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:26,018
Now let's think about

54
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:29,041
the probability, so I will, you know, we're gonna start over

55
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,079
I'm gonna put that jack back in, I'm gonna reshuffle the deck

56
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:34,006
So once again I still have 52 cards.

57
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:37,055
So what's the probability that I get a hearts?

58
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:40,013
What's the probability that I randomly picked a card from

59
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:43,465
a shuffled deck and it is a hearts? Its suit is a heart.

60
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:47,076
Well once again, there's 52 possible cards I could pick from

61
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:51,063
52 possible, equally likely events that we're dealing with

62
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:55,041
And how many of those have our hearts?

63
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,027
Well, essentially thirteen of them are hearts. For each

64
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:00,823
of those suits you have thirteen types so there's thirteen

65
00:03:00,823 --> 00:03:03,480
hearts in that deck, there thirteen diamonds in that deck

66
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,874
there thirteen spades in that deck, there thirteen clubs in that deck.

67
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:10,992
So the 13 of the 52 would result in hearts.

68
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:14,868
And both of those are divisible by 13, this is the same

69
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:19,010
thing as one forth. One in four times I'll pick it out

70
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,684
or I'll have one forth probability of getting a hearts

71
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:24,014
when I go to that, when I randomly pick a card

72
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:24,971
from that shuffled deck.

73
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:27,069
Now let's do some things a little bit more interesting

74
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,006
or maybe it's a little obvious: what's the probability

75
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:41,644
that I pick something that is a jack and it is a hearts?

76
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:44,092
Well, if you're reasonably familiar with cards, you'll know

77
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:47,083
that there's actually one card that is both jack and a heart

78
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,071
It is literally jack of hearts.

79
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:51,066
So we're saying what is the probability we picked exactly the card

80
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,042
jack of hearts?

81
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:59,058
Well, there's only one event, one card that meets these criteria

82
00:03:59,058 --> 00:04:02,052
right over here and there's 52 possible cards.

83
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:05,559
So there's a 1 in 52 chance that I pick the jack of hearts

84
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:08,736
something that is both a jack and it's a heart.

85
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:11,953
Now let's do something a little more interesting.

86
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:15,077
What is the probability, you may want to pause this and think

87
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:18,010
about this a little bit before I give you the answer, what is the

88
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,044
probability of, so I once again have a deck of 52 cards, I shuffle it

89
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:25,052
randomly pick a card from that deck, what is the probability that

90
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:31,023
that card I picked from that deck is jack or a heart?

91
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:35,061
So it could be the jack of hearts or it could be the jack of diamonds

92
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:38,081
or could be the jack of spades or it could be the queen of hearts

93
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:41,036
or it could be two of hearts. So what is the probability of this?

94
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:44,041
And this is a little bit more of an interesting thing, because it's

95
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:50,022
we know first of all that there are 52 possibilities

96
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:53,043
but how many of those possibilities meet the criteria

97
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,072
meet these conditions, that it is a jack or a heart.

98
00:04:56,072 --> 00:05:00,000
And to understand that I'll draw a Venn diagram.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,066
Sounds kind of fancy, but nothing fancy here.

100
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:05,045
So imagine that this rectangle I'm drawing here represents

101
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:08,072
all of the outcomes. So if you want you can imagine it has

102
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:14,011
area of 52. So this is 52 possible outcomes, now how many of

103
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:16,556
those outcomes result in a jack?

104
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:19,311
So we already learned this, one out of thirteen of those outcomes

105
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:24,893
result in a jack. So I can draw a little circle here with that area

106
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:26,541
and I'm approximating

107
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,091
that represents the probability of a jack.

108
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:32,061
So that should be roughly 1/13 or 4/52 of this area

109
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:37,030
right over here. So I'll just draw it like this. So this right over here

110
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:45,025
is probability of a jack. It is four, there's four possible

111
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:53,090
cards out of the fifty two. So that's 4/52 or 1/13.

112
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,047
Now what's the probability of getting a hearts?

113
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:59,056
Well, I'll draw another circle here, that represents that.

114
00:05:59,056 --> 00:06:03,054
13 out of 52, 13 out of these 52 cards represent a heart.

115
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:07,011
And actually one of them represents both a heart and a jack.

116
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:10,728
So I'll actually overlap them and hopefully this will make sense

117
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:12,808
in a second.

118
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:17,093
So there's actually thirteen cards that are heart.

119
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:21,087
So this is the number of hearts.

120
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:24,094
And actually let me right that top thing that way as well.

121
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:29,017
It makes it a little bit clear, we were actually looking at -- clear that

122
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:39,002
-- so the number of jacks. And of course this overlap

123
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:42,056
right here is the number of jacks and hearts. The number

124
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:45,041
of items out of this 52 that are both a jack and a heart.

125
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:49,013
It is in both sets here it is in this green circle and it is in

126
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:53,062
this orange circle. So this right over here I'm going to do that in yellow

127
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,096
since I did that problem in yellow.

128
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:58,038
This right over here is a number of jack and hearts

129
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,065
so let me draw a little arrow there. It's getting a little cluttered

130
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:03,081
I've actually should've drawn it little bit bigger.

131
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:10,060
The number of jacks and hearts.

132
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,448
And that's an overlap over there, so what's the probability

133
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:15,074
of getting a jack or a heart?

134
00:07:15,074 --> 00:07:19,071
So if you think about it the probability is going to be the number of

135
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:23,043
events that meet this conditions over the total number of events.

136
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,004
Yeah, we already know the total number of events are 52.

137
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:26,083
But how many meet this conditions?

138
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,044
So it's going to be the number, it's going to be

139
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:32,045
you could say: well look, the green circle right there says the number

140
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:36,003
that gives us the jack and the orange circle tells us the number

141
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:38,049
that gives us a heart. So you might wanna say

142
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:43,000
well, why don't we add up the green and the orange,

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,085
but if you did that you'd be double-counting.

144
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:51,000
Cause if you add it up, if just did four plus thirteen

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,070
what are we saying?

146
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,039
We're saying that there are four jacks and we're saying

147
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,010
that there thirteen hearts.

148
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,077
But in both of these we're, in both when we're doing it this way

149
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:06,042
in both cases we're counting the jack of hearts.

150
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:09,043
We're putting jack of hearts here and we're putting a jack of hearts here

151
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:12,023
So we're counting jack of hearts twice, even though there's only

152
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:17,008
one card there. So you'd have to subtract out where they're common.

153
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:22,016
You'd have to subtract out the item that is both the jack

154
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:23,056
and a heart.

155
00:08:23,056 --> 00:08:25,017
So you'd subtract out a one.

156
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:26,075
Another way to think about it is

157
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:33,865
You really want to figure out the total area here.

158
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:36,060
Let me zoom in. I'll generalize it a little bit.

159
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,076
So if you have one circle like that and then you have another

160
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:42,492
overlapping circle like that. And you want to figure the total area

161
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:46,069
of both of the circles combined. You'll look at the area

162
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:53,011
of this circle and then you could add it to the area of this circle.

163
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:56,693
But when you do that, you'll see that when you add the two areas

164
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:59,016
you're counting this area twice.

165
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:02,029
So in order to only count that area once, you have to subtract

166
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,045
that area from the sum.

167
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:09,095
So if this area, if this is, if this area has A, this area is B

168
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:15,025
And the intersection, where they overlap is C

169
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:22,042
the combined area is going to be A plus B minus where they overlap

170
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,002
minus C.

171
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:25,073
So that's the same thing over here.

172
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:28,008
We're counting all the jacks and that includes the jack of hearts

173
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:31,012
we're counting all the hearts and that includes the jack of hearts.

174
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:35,015
So we counted the jack of hearts twice, so we have to subtract one out of that.

175
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:37,663
So it's going to be four plus thirteen minus one.

176
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:46,015
Or this is going to be 16/52. And both of those things are divisible

177
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:48,028
by four.

178
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:50,049
So this is going to be the same thing as

179
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:54,028
if I divided sixteen by four you get four, fifty two divided by four

180
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,079
is thirteen.

181
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:01,477
So this is, there's 4/13 chance that you get a jack or a hearts.
