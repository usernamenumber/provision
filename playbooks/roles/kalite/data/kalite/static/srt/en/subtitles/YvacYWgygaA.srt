1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,580
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,540
I'll now do another conservation
of energy

4
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,110
problem, and this time I'll
add another twist. So far,

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,530
everything we've been doing,
energy was conserved by the

6
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,970
law of conservation.

7
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,740
But that's because all of the
forces that were acting in

8
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,810
these systems were conservative
forces.

9
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,750
And now I'll introduce you to
a problem that has a little

10
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,810
bit of friction, and we'll see
that some of that energy gets

11
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,720
lost to friction.

12
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,340
And we can think about
it a little bit.

13
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,470
Well where does that
energy go?

14
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,980
And I'm getting this problem
from the University of

15
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,230
Oregon's zebu.uoregon.edu.

16
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,990
   

17
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,590
And they seem to have some nice
physics problems, so I'll

18
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,120
use theirs.

19
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,530
And I just want to make
sure they get credit.

20
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:32,860
So let's see.

21
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,910
They say a 90 kilogram
bike and rider.

22
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,725
So the bike and rider combined
are 90 kilograms. So let's

23
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:45,920
just say the mass is 90
kilograms. Start at rest from

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,840
the top of a 500 meter
long hill.

25
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,860
OK, so I think they mean
that the hill is

26
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,710
something like this.

27
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:57,550
So if this is the hill, that
the hypotenuse here is 500

28
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,270
hundred meters long.

29
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:04,160
So the length of that,
this is 500 meters.

30
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,420
A 500 meter long hill with
a 5 degree incline.

31
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,670
So this is 5 degrees.

32
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,850
   

33
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,370
And we can kind of just view
it like a wedge, like we've

34
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,070
done in other problems.
There you go.

35
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,890
That's pretty straight.

36
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,550
OK.

37
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,050
Assuming an average friction
force of 60 newtons.

38
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,490
OK, so they're not telling us
the coefficient of friction

39
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,580
and then we have to figure
out the normal

40
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,620
force and all of that.

41
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,630
They're just telling us, what
is the drag of friction?

42
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,430
Or how much is actually friction
acting against this

43
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,750
rider's motion?

44
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,360
We could think a little bit
about where that friction is

45
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,880
coming from.

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,660
So the force of friction is
equal to 60 newtons And of

47
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,030
course, this is going to be
going against his motion or

48
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,040
her motion.

49
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,150
And the question asks us, find
the speed of the biker at the

50
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,110
bottom of the hill.

51
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,510
So the biker starts up
here, stationary.

52
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,240
That's the biker.

53
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,560
My very artful rendition
of the biker.

54
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,230
And we need to figure out the
velocity at the bottom.

55
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,920
This to some degree is a
potential energy problem.

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,380
   

57
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,790
It's definitely a conservation
of mechanical energy problem.

58
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,610
So let's figure out what the
energy of the system is when

59
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,550
the rider starts off.

60
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,360
So the rider starts off at
the top of this hill.

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,930
So definitely some
potential energy.

62
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,850
And is stationary, so there's
no kinetic energy.

63
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,760
So all of the energy is
potential, and what is the

64
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,600
potential energy?

65
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,030
Well potential energy is equal
to mass times the acceleration

66
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,950
of gravity times
height, right?

67
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,300
Well that's equal to, if the
mass is 90, the acceleration

68
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,830
of gravity is 9.8 meters
per second squared.

69
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,540
And then what's the height?

70
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,960
Well here we're going to have
to break out a little

71
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,810
trigonometry.

72
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,010
We need to figure out this side
of this triangle, if you

73
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,270
consider this whole
thing a triangle.

74
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,630
Let's see.

75
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,080
We want to figure out
the opposite.

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,630
We know the hypotenuse and
we know this angle here.

77
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,920
So the sine of this angle is
equal to opposite over

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
hypotenuse.

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,680
So, SOH.

80
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,910
Sine is opposite over
hypotenuse.

81
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,490
So we know that the height--
so let me do a little work

82
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,010
here-- we know that sine of
5 degrees is equal to

83
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,510
the height over 500.

84
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:25,420
Or that the height is equal
to 500 sine of 5 degrees.

85
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,470
And I calculated the sine of
5 degrees ahead of time.

86
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,380
Let me make sure I
still have it.

87
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,820
That's cause I didn't have my
calculator with me today.

88
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,290
But you could do this
on your own.

89
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,400
So this is equal to 500,
and the sine of

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,806
5 degrees is 0.087.

91
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,870
So when you multiply these
out, what do I get?

92
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,220
I'm using the calculator
on Google actually.

93
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,400
500 times sine.

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,670
You get 43.6.

95
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,900
So this is equal to 43.6.

96
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,970
So the height of the hill
is 43.6 meters.

97
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,390
So going back to the potential
energy, we have the mass times

98
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,850
the acceleration of gravity
times the height.

99
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,740
Times 43.6.

100
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,290
And this is equal to, and then
I can use just my regular

101
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,640
calculator since I don't
have to figure out

102
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,090
trig functions anymore.

103
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:25,380
So 90-- so you can see the whole
thing-- times 9.8 times

104
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:34,860
43.6 is equal to, let's
see, roughly 38,455.

105
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:42,180
So this is equal to 38,455
joules or newton meters.

106
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,270
And that's a lot of
potential energy.

107
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:44,980
So what happens?

108
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,690
At the bottom of the hill--
sorry, I have to readjust my

109
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,070
chair-- at the bottom of the
hill, all of this gets

110
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,590
converted to, or maybe I should

111
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,260
pose that as a question.

112
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,450
Does all of it get converted
to kinetic energy?

113
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,560
Almost. We have a force
of friction here.

114
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,880
And friction, you can kind of
view friction as something

115
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,120
that eats up mechanical
energy.

116
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,250
These are also called
nonconservative forces because

117
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,590
when you have these forces
at play, all of the

118
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,580
force is not conserved.

119
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,160
So a way to think about it is,
is that the energy, let's just

120
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,430
call it total energy.

121
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:30,670
So let's say total energy
initial, well let me just

122
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:40,740
write initial energy is equal
to the energy wasted in

123
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:51,870
friction-- I should have written
just letters-- from

124
00:05:51,870 --> 00:06:00,170
friction plus final energy.

125
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,670
So we know what the initial
energy is in this system.

126
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,120
That's the potential energy
of this bicyclist and this

127
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,730
roughly 38 and 1/2 kilojoules
or 38,500 joules, roughly.

128
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:17,530
And now let's figure out the
energy wasted from friction,

129
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,110
and the energy wasted from
friction is the negative work

130
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,850
that friction does.

131
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,470
And what does negative
work mean?

132
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:29,000
Well the bicyclist is moving 500
meters in this direction.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,740
So distance is 500 meters.

134
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,050
But friction isn't acting
along the same

135
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,290
direction as distance.

136
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,470
The whole time, friction is
acting against the distance.

137
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,690
So when the force is going in
the opposite direction as the

138
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,430
distance, your work
is negative.

139
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,440
   

140
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,500
So another way of thinking of
this problem is energy initial

141
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,420
is equal to, or you could say
the energy initial plus the

142
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,370
negative work of friction,
right?

143
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,090
If we say that this is a
negative quantity, then this

144
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,730
is equal to the final energy.

145
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,920
And here, I took the friction
and put it on the other side

146
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,410
because I said this is going to
be a negative quantity in

147
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,290
the system.

148
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,680
And so you should always just
make sure that if you have

149
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,770
friction in the system, just as
a reality check, that your

150
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,100
final energy is less than
your initial energy.

151
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:25,500
Our initial energy is, let's
just say 38.5 kilojoules.

152
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,290
What is the negative work
that friction is doing?

153
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,530
Well it's 500 meters.

154
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,600
And the entire 500 meters, it's
always pushing back on

155
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,420
the rider with a force
of 60 newtons.

156
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,960
So force times distant.

157
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,690
So it's minus 60 newtons,
cause it's going in the

158
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,530
opposite direction of the
motion, times 500.

159
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,000
And this is going to equal
the ending, oh, no.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,460
This is going to equal the
final energy, right?

161
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,030
And what is this?

162
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:00,100
60 times 500, that's 3,000.

163
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,190
No, 30,000, right.

164
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,975
So let's subtract 30,000
from 38,500.

165
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:06,490
So let's see.

166
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,580
Minus 30.

167
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,460
I didn't have to do that.

168
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,780
I could have done
that in my head.

169
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:19,990
So that gives us 8,455 joules is
equal to the final energy.

170
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,820
And what is all the
final energy?

171
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,530
Well by this time, the rider's
gotten back to, I guess we

172
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,410
could call the sea level.

173
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,890
So all of the energy
is now going to be

174
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,930
kinetic energy, right?

175
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,510
What's the formula for
kinetic energy?

176
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,059
It's 1/2 mv squared.

177
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,580
And we know what m is.

178
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,126
The mass of the rider is 90.

179
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:42,480
So we have this is 90.

180
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,610
So if we divide both sides.

181
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,850
So the 1/2 times 90.

182
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,160
That's 45.

183
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,140
So 8,455 divided by 45.

184
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:59,540
So we get v squared
is equal to 187.9.

185
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,500
And let's take the square root
of that and we get the

186
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,690
velocity, 13.7.

187
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,340
So if we take the square root of
both sides of this, so the

188
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,900
final velocity is 13.7.

189
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,270
I know you can't read that.

190
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,510
13.7 meters per second.

191
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,960
And this was a slightly more
interesting problem because

192
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,480
here we had the energy wasn't
completely conserved.

193
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,460
Some of the energy, you could
say, was eaten by friction.

194
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,700
And actually that energy
just didn't

195
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,080
disappear into a vacuum.

196
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,860
It was actually generated
into heat.

197
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,490
And it makes sense.

198
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,930
If you slid down a slide of
sandpaper, your pants would

199
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,750
feel very warm by the time you
got to the bottom of that.

200
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,400
But the friction of this, they
weren't specific on where the

201
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,420
friction came from, but it
could have come from the

202
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
gearing within the bike.

203
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,550
It could have come
from the wind.

204
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,470
Maybe the bike actually
skidded a little

205
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,280
bit on the way down.

206
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,190
I don't know.

207
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,290
But hopefully you found that
a little bit interesting.

208
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,230
And now you can not only work
with conservation of

209
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,950
mechanical energy, but you can
work problems where there's a

210
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,820
little bit of friction
involved as well.

211
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,380
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

212
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,630
