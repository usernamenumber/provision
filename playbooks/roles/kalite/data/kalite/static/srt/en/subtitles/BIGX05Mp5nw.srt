1
00:00:00,931 --> 00:00:05,435
Let's take the number 7 and divide it by 3.

2
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:12,367
And I'm going to conceptualize dividing by 3 as let me see how many groups of 3 I can make out of the 7.

3
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,770
So let's imagine... Let me draw 7 things.

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,785
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

5
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:21,833
So let me try to create groups of 3.

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,404
So I can definitely create one group of 3 right over here,

7
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:27,541
I can definitely create another group of 3.

8
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:33,167
So I'm able to create two groups of 3 and then I can't create any more full groups of 3.

9
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:36,086
I have essentially this thing right over here left over.

10
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:38,367
So this right over here... I have this thing remaining.

11
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:41,433
This right over here is my remainder.

12
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:44,770
After creating as many groups of 3 as I can.

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,346
And so when you see something like this, people will often say:

14
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:52,367
Seven divided by three... Well, I can create two groups of 3,

15
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:57,030
but it doesn't divide evenly. Or 3 doesn't divide evenly into 7.

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,674
I end up with something left over. I have a leftover, I have a remainder.

17
00:01:01,674 --> 00:01:04,088
I have a remainder of 1.

18
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:08,361
So this is literally saying: 7 divided by 3 is 2, remainder 1.

19
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:09,433
And that makes sense!

20
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:12,680
2 times 3 is 6, so it doesn't get you all the way to 7,

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,600
but then if you have your extra remainder, 6 plus that 1 remainder gets all the way to 7.

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,367
Let's do another one.

23
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:28,367
Let's imagine 15 divided by 4.

24
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:37,944
Let me draw 15 objects:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

25
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:41,334
Now let me try to divide it into groups of 4.

26
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:49,367
So let's see... That's one group of 4, that's another group of 4 and then that's another group of 4.

27
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:54,662
So I'm able to create three groups of 4, but I can't create a fourth full group of 4.

28
00:01:54,662 --> 00:01:57,681
I am then left with this remainder right over here.

29
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:02,603
I have a remainder right over here of 3.

30
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:05,033
I have 3 left over.

31
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:08,100
So we could say that 15 divided by 4 is 3, remainder 3.

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:15,699
4 goes into 15 three times, but that only gets us to 12.
4 times 3 is 12.

33
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:19,367
To get all way to 15 we need to use our remainder, we need to get 3 more.

34
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:23,362
So 15 divided by 4, I have 3 left over.

35
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:28,192
Now let's try to think about this doing a little bit of our long division techniques.

36
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:39,616
So let's say that I want to divide 75 by 4.

37
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:41,613
Well, traditional long division techniques:

38
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:45,033
4 goes into 7 one time.

39
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:50,343
And we're really... if you're looking at place value we're really saying that 4 is going into 70 ten times

40
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:52,340
(because we're putting this in the tens place)

41
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,588
and then we say: 1 times 4 is 4.

42
00:02:57,588 --> 00:03:01,861
But really, once again, it's in the tens place. This is really representing a 40.

43
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:09,616
But either way, we subtract 4 from the 7, we get a 30 and then we bring down this 5.

44
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:18,367
And you say: 4 goes into 35 (let's see... 4 times 8 is 32, 4 times 9 is 36, that's too big) 8 times.

45
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:25,684
8 times 4 is 32, you subtract 35 minus 32 is 3.

46
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:27,867
And 4 doesn't go into 3 any more.

47
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:32,604
So here I have this 3 left over. I have a remainder of 3.

48
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:36,604
So you could say that 75 divided by 4 is equal to 18, remainder 3.
