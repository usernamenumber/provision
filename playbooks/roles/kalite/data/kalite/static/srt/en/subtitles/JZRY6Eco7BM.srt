1
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:09,533
We're in the Tate Modern and we're looking at a Francis Bacon.

2
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:14,380
Actually, we're looking at three Francis Bacons. This is one work of art but in three large

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,750
painted panels. It's a triptych. In fact, that's the title.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,293
Normally when I think of a triptych I think of a renaissance or a medieval

5
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:26,852
alter piece that's in three panels that're connected and therefore something that is

6
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:31,419
spiritual, religious scenes, but here we are in the twentieth century using that format.

7
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:34,911
But there is something dark and spiritual about these images.

8
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:40,077
These were deeply personal paintings and the subject couldn't be closer to home for the artist.

9
00:00:40,077 --> 00:00:44,416
You know, you can tell how personal they are. On either side these figures are very, very powerfully

10
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:51,284
depicted. That seems very psychological and personal and emotional and profound from the way

11
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:55,678
that he's treating the human body. Tell me about what the personal aspect is.

12
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:01,477
So, within these very spare renderings, we have the representation of George Dyer on the left.

13
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:04,204
This is Francis Bacon's lover

14
00:01:04,204 --> 00:01:08,753
who had just recently commited suicide. In fact this painting is seen as one of

15
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:14,716
a series of black paintings that are, in a way, a kind of chronicle of his response to this event.

16
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:21,300
We have the artist himself as a self portrait and then in the middle we've got this composite creature.

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,293
You can just make out two bodies in a kind of violent lovemaking.

18
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:31,103
The reference that's usually drawn by art historians is to the English photographer Muybridge

19
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:36,228
who invented the strobe light and was the first person to use photography to freeze animals

20
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:40,951
and people in action. He did a famous series of wrestlers from which this is drawn.

21
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:46,284
But of course that scientific context is completely transformed in this personal context.

22
00:01:46,284 --> 00:01:51,851
In the image of Dyer there is an immediate sense of death. There's an immediate sense of the flesh

23
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:58,619
disintergrating. With Bacon there's a feeling of the flesh melting or being eaten away.

24
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,494
In fact, in his torso that blackness that's that panel in the back seems to kind of move forward

25
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:12,384
and take over this figure's body. And at the same time there's something very transendent about the face.

26
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:18,393
The eyes are closed, the head tilts up slightly as though there's a way that the figure is somehow

27
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:22,937
transcending the body as the body is being consumed.

28
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:27,836
It's so interesting that you say melting. We can see that shadow that he seems to cast almost as

29
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:31,645
a kind of a pool of flesh to the lower right in some terrible way.

30
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:40,240
The pool is pink and flesh color and the body itself is being taken over by this black.

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,443
It's also that it seems to have a kind of dimension. It seems to be literally seeping out of him.

32
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:49,490
There's a real tension between surface and an illusion of depth to the body.

33
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,024
The depicted space as opposed to the conceptual space. That alternation becomes a

34
00:02:54,024 --> 00:03:00,411
beautiful metaphor. The entire set of paintings places these figures in a kind of isolation in a

35
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:07,446
very spare, very abstracted space. He's created this very uncomfortable, very tense kind of relationship.

36
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:11,548
On the other hand, both panels on either side, although they are flat,

37
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:16,629
they have some sense of dimension by the diagonal line that's in front of either one.

38
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:22,122
And yet in the central panel which is the most abstract and, in terms of the space, right?

39
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:25,352
Because we don't have that diagonal line, we can't locate depth at all.

40
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:31,501
It's almost as though the middle space where those two figures are joined, perhaps where he's rejoined

41
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:37,213
with his lover, in some space beyond the physical, we have the most abstracted space

42
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:42,525
whereas in the two other panels, as you said, there's that conceptual transendent

43
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:47,010
flat space that's in conflict somehow with the organic, three dimensional shapes of the figures

44
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,338
But I also read something else into that diagonal on the right and left panels.

45
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:55,979
Although these are hung on a flat wall these're hinged paintings. And they actually come out

46
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,412
at an angle towards us slightly, referencing that bottom angle.

47
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:02,854
The way a traditional triptych would unfold.

48
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:06,670
Yes, exactly. There's tremendous energy being expended in the brushstrokes.

49
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,920
I see it in the composition and I see it in the tension between the figures.

50
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,804
Sexual or violent or both.

51
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:16,477
Yeah, you have, in fact, that big broad white brush stroke.

52
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:21,852
Yeah, that's interesting in another sense because of course Bacon, although he's working in Britain,

53
00:04:21,852 --> 00:04:24,353
is very much of the generation of the abstract expressionists.

54
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:30,254
Bacon, quite distinctly, and very much unlike the Americans, is maintaining the primacy of the figure.

55
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:35,934
So these are very hard edged, abstract shapes, yet one easily recalls the abstract expressionism.

56
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:41,140
They're both responding to similar existential issues that have to do with the isolation of the figure,

57
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,606
the meaning of the figure.

58
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:49,009
These paintings are difficult to understand and to read. They take time to sort of grapple with.

59
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,973
On the other hand, still having the presence of something that one can recognize,

60
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:56,869
especially the human figure, does give us a handle.

61
00:04:56,869 --> 00:05:02,982
There's something really extraordinary about taking the human figure, painting it so beautifully

62
00:05:02,982 --> 00:05:09,667
but then attacking it, cutting into it, melting it away, making it so grotesque.

63
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:12,717
I think that's what makes these paintings so tough.
