99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want to do in this video is think about

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the antiderivative of one over x

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or another way of thinking about it is

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the antiderivative of x to the negative one power

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we already know that if we somehow try

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to apply that anti-power rule,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that inverse power rule over here,

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we would get something that is not defined.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We would get x to the zero over zero,

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which doesn't make any sense.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you might have been saying, OK, well I know what to do

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in this case. When we first learned about derivatives

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we know that that the derivative with respect to x

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the natural log of x is equal to one over x

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So why can't we just say that the antiderivative of this right over here

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to the natural log of x plus c?

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this isn't necessarily wrong.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The problem here is that it's not broad enough.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And when I say it's not broad enough, it's that the domain

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over here for our original function that we are taking

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the antiderivative of is all real numbers except for x equals zero.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So over here x can not be equal to zero.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
While the domain over here is only positive numbers.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So in this expression, x has to be greater than zero.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it would be nice if we could come up with an antiderivative

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that has the same domain as the function we're taking

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the antiderivative of.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it would be nice if we could find an antiderivative

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that was defined everywhere the original function was

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so pretty much everywhere except x equaling zero.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So how can we rearrange this a little bit so this

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can be defined for negative values as well?

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, one possibility is to think about the natural log of

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the absolute value of x.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The natural log of the absolute value of x.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I'll put a little question mark here because

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we don't really know what the derivative of this thing is

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to be.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'm not going to rigorously prove it here,

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but I'll give you kind of the conceptual understanding.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So to understand it, let's plot the natural log of x

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'd done this ahead of time

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that over there is roughly what the graph of the natural log

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of x might look like.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what would the natural log of the absolute value of x look like?

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well for positive x's, it's going to look just like this

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For positive x's, you take the absolute value of it

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it's just the same thing and taking that original value.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's going to look just like that for positive x's.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But now this is also going to be defined for negative x's.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you're taking the absolute value of negative one,

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that evaluates to just one.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so it's just the natural log of one

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you're going to be right there.

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As you get closer and closer to zero from the negative side

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you're just going to take the absolute value

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's essentially going to be exactly this curve for the natural log of x

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but the left side of the natural log of the absolute value of x

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be its mirror image if you were to reflect around the y-axis

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's going to look something like this

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what's nice about this function is that it's defined everywhere

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
except for x equals zero.
