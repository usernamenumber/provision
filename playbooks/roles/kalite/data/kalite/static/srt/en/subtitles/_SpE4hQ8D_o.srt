1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,820
Let's get started with some problems.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,610
Let's see.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:19,800
First problem: what is fifteen percent of forty?

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,600
The way I do percent problems is I just convert the

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,610
percentage to a decimal and then I multiply it times the

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,700
number that I'm trying to get the percentage of.

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,810
So 15% as a decimal is 0.15.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,350
You learned that from the percent to decimal conversion

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,630
video, hopefully.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,540
And we just multiply this times forty.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,980
So let's say 40 times 0.15.

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,500
five times zero is zero.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,090
five times four is twenty.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,610
Put a zero there.

15
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,640
And then one times zero is zero.

16
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,250
one times four is four.

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,710
And you get six zero zero.

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,470
Then you count the decimal spots.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,660
one, two.

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,730
No decimals up there, so you go one, two and you

21
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,220
put the decimal there.

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:18,870
So 15% of 40 is equal to 0.15 times 40, which equals 6.00.

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,470
Well, that's just the same thing as six.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,630
Let's do another problem.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,700
Hopefully, that didn't confuse you too much.

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,950
And I'm going to try to confuse you this time just

27
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,040
in case you weren't properly confused the last time.

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:47,850
What is 0.2% of-- let me think of a number-- of 7.

29
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,050
So a lot of people's inclinations would just

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,010
say, oh, 0.2%, that's the same thing as 0.2.

31
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,940
And if that was your inclination you would be wrong.

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,600
Because remember, this isn't 0.2.

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,280
This is 0.2%.

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,750
So there's two ways of thinking about this.

35
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:10,340
You could say that this is 0.2/100, which is, if you

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,260
multiply the numerator and denominator by ten, is the

37
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,830
same thing as two / one thousand.

38
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,250
Or you can just do the technique where you

39
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,250
move the decimal space over two to the left.

40
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,350
In which case, if you're starting with 0.2 and you

41
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,610
move the decimal space two to the left, you go bam.

42
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,300
Whoops!

43
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,080
Bam, bam.

44
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,160
That's where the decimal goes.

45
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,360
So it's 0.002.

46
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,400
This is key.

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,360
0.2% is the same thing as 0.002.

48
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,110
This can always trip you up and I've made this careless mistake

49
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,880
all the time, so don't feel bad if you ever do it.

50
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,450
But just always pay careful attention if you see a

51
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,050
decimal and a percentage at the same time.

52
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,390
So now that we've figured out how to write this percentage

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,210
as a decimal we just have to multiply it times the number

54
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,990
that we want to take the percentage of.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,180
So we say 0.002 times 7.

56
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,480
Well, this is pretty straightforward.

57
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,060
seven times two is fourteen.

58
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,700
And how many total numbers do we have or how many total

59
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,830
digits do we have behind the decimal point?

60
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,230
Let's see.

61
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,920
It's one, two, three.

62
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,590
So we need one, two, three digits behind the decimal point.

63
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:36,160
So 0.2% of 7 is equal to 0.014.

64
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,190
And you're probably thinking, boy, that's a really,

65
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,350
really small number.

66
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,540
And it makes sense because 0.2%, if you want to

67
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,850
think about it, that's smaller than even one percent.

68
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,580
So that's even smaller than one / one hundred.

69
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,440
And actually, if you think about it, 0.2% is 1/500.

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,750
And if you do the math, one / five hundred of seven will turn

71
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,180
out to be this number.

72
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,490
And that's an important thing to do.

73
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,240
It's always good to do a reality check because when

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,550
you're doing these decimal and these percent problems, it's

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,270
very easy to kind of lose a factor of ten here or there.

76
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,240
Or gain a factor of ten.

77
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,610
So always do a reality check to see if your answer makes sense.

78
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,620
So now I'm going to confuse you even further.

79
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:27,930
What if I were to ask you four is twenty percent of what number?

80
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,720
So a lot of people's reflex might just be,

81
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,850
oh, let me take twenty percent.

82
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,350
It becomes 0.20.

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,850
And multiply it times four.

84
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,560
And in that case, again, you may be wrong.

85
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,060
Because think about it.

86
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,690
I'm not saying what is twenty percent of four?

87
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,550
I'm saying that twenty percent of some number is four.

88
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,470
So now we're going to be doing a little bit of algebra.

89
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,080
I bet you didn't expect that in the percent module.

90
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,070
So let x equal the number.

91
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:14,620
And this problem says that twenty percent of x is equal to four.

92
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,490
I think now it's in a form that you might recognize.

93
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,240
So how do we write twenty percent as a decimal?

94
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,970
Well, that's just 0.20 or 0.2.

95
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,880
And we just multiply it by x to get four.

96
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,060
So 20%, that's the same thing as 0.2.

97
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,440
It's the same thing as 0.20, but that last trailing

98
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,710
zero doesn't mean much.

99
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,150
0.2 times x is equal to 4.

100
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,070
And now we have a level one linear equation.

101
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,660
I bet you didn't expect to see that.

102
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,540
So what do we do?

103
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,540
Well there's two ways to view it.

104
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,810
You can just divide both sides of this equation

105
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,680
by the coefficient on x.

106
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:54,000
So if you divide 0.2 here and you divide by 0.2 here.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,440
So you get x is equal to 4 divided by 0.2.

108
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,340
So let's figure out what 4 divided by 0.2 is.

109
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,110
I hope I have enough space.

110
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,490
0.2 goes into 4-- I'm going to put a decimal point here.

111
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,300
And the way we do these problems, we move the

112
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,300
decimal point here one over to the right.

113
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,510
So we just get a two and then we can move the decimal point

114
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,410
here one over to the right.

115
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,670
So this 0.2 goes into 4 the same number of times

116
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,010
that two goes into forty.

117
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,520
And this is easy.

118
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,660
two goes into forty how many times?

119
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,150
Well, two goes into four two times and then two goes

120
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,970
into zero, zero times.

121
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,040
You could've done that in your head.

122
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,520
two into forty is twenty times.

123
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,570
So 4 divided by 0.2 is 20.

124
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,560
So the answer is four is twenty percent of twenty.

125
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,270
And does that make sense?

126
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,630
Well, there's a couple of ways to think about it.

127
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,600
twenty percent is exactly one / five.

128
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,800
And four times five is twenty.

129
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,810
That makes sense.

130
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,430
If you're still not sure we can check the problem.

131
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,620
Let's take twenty percent of twenty.

132
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:12,870
So 20% of 20 is equal to 0.2 times 20.

133
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,170
And if you do the math that also will equal four.

134
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,400
So you made sure you got the right answer.

135
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,480
Let's do another one like that.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,810
I'm picking numbers randomly.

137
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:36,130
Let's say three is nine percent of what?

138
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:52,300
Once again, let's let x equal the number that three is nine percent of.

139
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,670
You didn't have to write all that.

140
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,980
Well, in that case we know that 0.09x-- 0.09, that's the same

141
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,420
thing as nine percent of x-- is equal to three.

142
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,760
Or that x is equal to 3 divided by 0.09.

143
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,430
Well, if we do the decimal division, 0.09 goes into 3.

144
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,280
Let's put a decimal point here.

145
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,250
I don't know how many zero's I'm going to need.

146
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,210
So if I move this decimal over to the right twice, then I'll

147
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,970
move this decimal over to the right twice.

148
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,570
So 0.09 goes into 3 the same number of times

149
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,940
that nine goes into three hundred.

150
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,060
So nine goes into thirty three times.

151
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,820
three times nine is twenty-seven.

152
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,040
I think I see a pattern here already.

153
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,290
thirty, three, three times nine is twenty-seven.

154
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,000
You're going to keep getting thirty-three-- the three's are just

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,480
going to go on forever.

156
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,960
So it turns out that three is nine percent of-- you can either write it as

157
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:58,860
33.3 repeating or we all know that 0.3 forever is the

158
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,300
same thing as one / three.

159
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,370
So three is nine percent of thirty-three and one / three.

160
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,210
Either one of those would be an acceptable answer.

161
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,700
And a lot of times when you're doing percentages you're

162
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,880
actually just trying to get a ballpark.

163
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,780
The precision might not always be the most important thing,

164
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,040
but in this case we will be precise.

165
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,380
And obviously, on tests and things you need to

166
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,930
be precise as well.

167
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,010
Hopefully, I didn't go too fast and you have a good

168
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,330
sense of percentage.

169
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,760
The important thing for these type of problems is pay

170
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,730
attention to how the problem is written.

171
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,480
If it says find ten percent of one hundred.

172
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,040
That's easy.

173
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,000
You just convert ten percent to a decimal and multiply it by one hundred.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,560
But if I were to ask you one hundred is ten percent of what?

175
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,330
You have to remember that that's a different problem.

176
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,440
In which case, one hundred is ten percent of-- and if you did the math,

177
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,840
it would be one thousand.

178
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,720
I think I spoke very quickly on this problem on this module, so

179
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,980
I hope you didn't get too confused.

180
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,440
But I will record more.
