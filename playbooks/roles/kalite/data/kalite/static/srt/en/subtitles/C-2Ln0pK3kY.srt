1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
We're on problem 21.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,310
Which product is equivalent
to 4x squared minus 16

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,510
over 2 minus x?

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,780
So let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,300
4x squared minus 16, if we were
to factor out a 4, that's

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:21,980
the same thing as 4 times
x squared minus 4.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,880
That's 4x squared minus 16, all
of that over 2 minus x.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,630
Then x squared minus 4, that's
that same pattern that keeps

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,550
showing up, a squared minus
b squared, right?

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:37,750
So that numerator becomes 4
times x plus 2 times x minus

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,280
2, right? a plus b
times a minus b.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,570
Then the denominator, let's
think about it.

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,620
This has 2 minus x, and we
have an x minus 2 here.

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,300
But what if we were to factor
out a negative 1 from this?

16
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,470
What happens?

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,930
If you factor out a negative 1,
then the negative x becomes

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,130
a positive x, and the positive
2 becomes a minus 2.

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,920
I did that just to show you that
a negative, if you divide

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,430
this by or multiply by
a negative 1, you

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,320
just switch the order.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,070
2 minus x becomes x minus 2,
which is a good thing to

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,110
recognize because we have an x
minus 2 in the numerator, too.

24
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,150
So this will cancel
out with that.

25
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:25,800
If we assume that x does not
ever equal 2 because x

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,200
equaling 2 would make this an
undefined statement because

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,000
you can't divide by zero, but if
we make that assumption, we

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,060
can cancel those out.

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,360
Then we have 4 divided by
negative 1 is minus 4

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,270
times x plus 2.

31
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,480
That is choice D.

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,960
Next question, 22.

33
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,220
I like this cutting and pasting

34
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,260
of the actual question.

35
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,510
It makes it fun.

36
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,610
   

37
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,850
I don't want it to slow down
my computer too much.

38
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,950
I sound like I'm melting
when that happens.

39
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,030
So that's our problem.

40
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,560
I didn't write the
choices down.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,400
All right, let's see
what we can do.

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,390
So they have x squared
plus 4x.

43
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,250
Let me write this.

44
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:23,590
x squared plus 4x over x plus 3
times x squared minus 9, all

45
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,940
of that over x squared
plus x minus 12.

46
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,990
You might say, oh, my God, to
multiply these using algebraic

47
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,890
multiplication would take
forever, then I'd have to

48
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,810
factor it and simplify it.

49
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,470
The trick here is to factor it
and simplify it before you do

50
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,370
any multiplication.

51
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,690
So let's simplify each of these
expressions and cancel

52
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,910
out as much as possible.

53
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,330
So here we can just
factor out an x.

54
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,640
So this just becomes
x times x plus 4.

55
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,090
This is a squared minus b
squared, so this becomes x

56
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,050
plus 3 times x minus 3.

57
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,360
With that you can't do much.

58
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,260
Let's think about this one.

59
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,430
What two numbers add up to a 1,
a 1x, and when you multiply

60
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,840
them, you get a minus 12?

61
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,100
So let's see, if you have an x
plus 4 times x minus 3, that

62
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,510
should work.

63
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,970
4 minus 3 is 1.

64
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,900
4 times minus 3 is minus 12.

65
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,540
So that works.

66
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,190
All right now we're
ready to cancel.

67
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,600
   

68
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:28,910
Normally.

69
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,980
I would just start canceling,
but I just

70
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,070
want to make the point.

71
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:39,140
So this is equal to x times x
plus 4 times these, x plus 3

72
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:52,680
times x minus 3, all of that
over x plus 3 times x plus 4

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,970
times x minus 3.

74
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,890
Now we can cancel.

75
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:04,640
We have an x minus 3, x minus
3, x plus 4 x plus 4, x plus

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,370
3, x plus 3, and all we're
left with is an x.

77
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,250
So all of this fancy expression,
all that

78
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,740
equals is an x.

79
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,280
That's choice B.

80
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,870
Where am I?

81
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,940
Next problem.

82
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,630
Image, clear image, invert
colors, there you go.

83
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,990
All right, let me see
if I have to copy

84
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,510
and paste this one.

85
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,340
Where was I?

86
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,430
Oh, why not?

87
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,570
Another one where they're
trying to get

88
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,520
the simplest form.

89
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,770
So I copied it.

90
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,810
   

91
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,910
Let me paste it.

92
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,170
All right, I hope you
can read this.

93
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,640
So what is the simplest form
of this expression here?

94
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,850
I'll rewrite it.

95
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:52,290
5x to the third y plus 20x
squared y squared plus 20x y

96
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,690
to the third, everything
divided by 5xy.

97
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,560
So 5xy actually goes
into every one of

98
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,810
these terms, right?

99
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,060
Let's just get rid of the 5's.

100
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,570
   

101
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,150
Well, actually, let's just
divide the numerator and the

102
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,310
denominator by 5xy.

103
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,830
So what's 5x to the third
y divided by 5xy?

104
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,600
Well, 5 divided by 5-- I'll
do it in magenta.

105
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,220
5 divided by 5 is 1 so we don't
have to write that.

106
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,950
x to the third divided
by x is x squared.

107
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,590
y divided by y is 1.

108
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,390
So this term divided by this
term reduced to that.

109
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,550
Easy enough.

110
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,600
Next one.

111
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,620
Plus 20 divided by 5 is 4.

112
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,090
x squared divided by x is x.

113
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,356
y squared divided by y is y.

114
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:40,200
We did the second term.

115
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,500
Let's do the third term.

116
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,010
20 divided by 5 is 4.

117
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,465
x divided by x is 1 so we don't
have to write it. y to

118
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:55,150
the third divided by
y is y squared.

119
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,230
What we have here is this
simplified, but that doesn't

120
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,420
look like anything here.

121
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,650
So my guess is that this is
probably one of these.

122
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,760
This is the square
of something.

123
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,010
Let's see if we can
factor this.

124
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,520
This would be x.

125
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:13,170
So what two numbers when I add
them become 4xy or what number

126
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,330
when I multiply it times x is
equal to half of this-- that's

127
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,250
another way to think about it--
and when I square it is

128
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,690
equal to 4y squared?

129
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,220
That's just plus 2y squared.

130
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,850
If that didn't make a lot of
sense, multiply this out and

131
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,540
you'll get this answer.

132
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,960
When you look at the choices,
you should just say, OK, I

133
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,740
know that this choice and
this choice, those look

134
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,970
nothing like that.

135
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,730
Then you say, oh, well,
maybe this is one of

136
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,310
these choices, right?

137
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,460
But you have a 4y
squared here.

138
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,440
This one has no y
at all in it.

139
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,620
So you can even just use
deductive reasoning to say,

140
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,410
oh, the choice must be
x plus 2y squared.

141
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,480
Next problem.

142
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,810
OK, this one I'm definitely
going to copy and paste

143
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,155
because they have a big image.

144
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:04,580
   

145
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,340
All right, let me see
if I can do it.

146
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,140
   

147
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,280
This makes it a lot easier than
having to draw it myself.

148
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,930
   

149
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,730
All right.

150
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,840
If i equals the square root of
negative 1, which, if you

151
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,960
didn't know it, that's what i
is defined as, and I go on

152
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,240
many videos about the magical
of i and e and pi.

153
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,100
Which point shows the location
of 5 minus 2i on the plane?

154
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,990
   

155
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,630
The x-axis is the real axis.

156
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,240
You take the real part,
which is 5.

157
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,840
So you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

158
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,170
So that's the real part.

159
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,400
Then the y-axis is the
imaginary axis.

160
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,950
You take the imaginary part,
minus 2i, minus 2, right?

161
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,440
So you go down 2 in the i
direction and you're at point

162
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,610
D, which is choice D.

163
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,490
Fair enough.

164
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,300
That problem had a lot
of graphics but

165
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,540
was unusually simple.

166
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,790
Next problem.

167
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,140
   

168
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,800
OK, now they're giving us a
whole parade of imaginary

169
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,820
number questions.

170
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,640
So this one I don't have to
cut, copy, and paste.

171
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,810
They say if i is equal to the
square root of negative 1,

172
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,770
which is a definition that we've
all learned, what is the

173
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,270
value of i to the fourth?

174
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,820
   

175
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,250
Well let's just go back.

176
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,250
Let's say you've never seen
i before in your life.

177
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:27,700
Let's think about it.

178
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,915
If i is equal to negative 1--
sorry, this is negative 1.

179
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:33,010
I know that negative looks
like it got messed up.

180
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,549
Let's square both sides
of this equation.

181
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:40,710
i squared will be equal
to negative 1.

182
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,059
Now, let's square both sides
of this equation.

183
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:49,100
i squared squared is equal
to negative 1 squared.

184
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,900
Well, i squared squared is just
i to the fourth, right?

185
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,790
2 times 2 is equal to negative
1 squared, which is

186
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,890
just equal to 1.

187
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,545
And we're done.

188
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:57,795
That's choice C.

189
00:08:57,795 --> 00:09:01,040
   

190
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,580
All right, now they have another
imaginary graph.

191
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,085
So let me just copy and
paste this graph.

192
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:11,760
   

193
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,190
I'll go here.

194
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,720
There you go.

195
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,070
I didn't have to erase
what I had before.

196
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,660
The question they ask us: Which
of the following complex

197
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,330
numbers is represented by the
point on the graph below?

198
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,226
So we just have to figure
out the real and

199
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:26,060
the imaginary parts.

200
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,020
So what's the real part?

201
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,790
This coordinate, its
real part is 3.

202
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,440
   

203
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,640
Its imaginary part is
minus 4 right there.

204
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,500
   

205
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,640
So it's 3, and its imaginary
part, minus 4 in

206
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,620
the imaginary direction.

207
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,090
And we're done.

208
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:45,840
3 minus 4i.

209
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,090
That's choice C.

210
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,660
   

211
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,850
I'm almost out of time.

212
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,080
I'll see you in the
next video.
