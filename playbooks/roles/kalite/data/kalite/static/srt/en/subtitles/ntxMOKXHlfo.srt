1
00:00:00,468 --> 00:00:04,500
Two words you'll hear thrown a lot in macroeconomic circles

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,004
are monetary policy (monetary policy) and

3
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:11,892
fiscal policy (and fiscal policy),

4
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:16,422
and they're normally talked about in the context of ways to

5
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:20,254
shift aggregate demand in one direction or another, and oftentimes to kind of

6
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:23,922
stimulate aggregate demand to shift it to the right

7
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:27,332
and what I want to do with this video is focus on what these two different tools are,

8
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:32,764
who are the actors and how do they go about actually shifting the aggregate demand curve.

9
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:35,140
So monetary policy, this is literally

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,469
deciding how much money to print, so it's literally printing money.

11
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:44,075
Either deciding to print more of it, or deciding to print less (printing money).

12
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:47,293
It tends to be done, in the United States especially and most large countries,

13
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:51,011
it's done by the Central Bank (it's done by the Central Bank)

14
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:54,804
which is sometimes directly part of the government,

15
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:58,298
sometimes it's quasi-independent, in the U.S. it's a quasi,

16
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:02,216
the U.S. Central Bank, which is the Federal Reserve is quasi-independent,

17
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:08,211
and in the future videos we will talk more about the governance structure of the Federal, of the Federal Reserve.

18
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:12,607
Most of the major appointees are made by the U.S. government,

19
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:17,964
all of its excess profits goes back to the U.S. treasury, so in that way it's part of the U.S. government,

20
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:25,601
but it's set up to be, also has some influence from private industry, the member banks have a stake in what's going on,

21
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:28,551
it often coordinates amongst member banks.

22
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:33,275
So you have your Federal Reserve as the Central Bank in the United States, it's quasi-independent,

23
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:36,196
but it's been given the right to print money.

24
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:42,646
And I'll just draw it here as physical dollars, but most of the money that it is going to print actually is electronic money.

25
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:49,405
And the way this affects the aggregate demand curve, the Federal Reserve doesn't just print money and go out and start buying things with that money,

26
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:52,674
well it does buy things, but it doesn't go out and buy goods and services.

27
00:01:52,674 --> 00:01:57,564
What it does with this is it essentially lends it out, so it's essentially buying debt.

28
00:01:57,564 --> 00:02:01,804
So it buys, it buys debt.

29
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:10,072
And if buying debt seems like a weird thing to say, buying debt is the same thing as lending money (lending money).

30
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:13,600
If I buy a treasury bond, so if I'm buying debt,

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,549
I'm buying a treasury bond, means I'm implicitly lending that money,

32
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:21,803
if I buy the bond directly from the government, that means I'm lending that money to the U.S. government.

33
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:29,294
If I buy, if I directly buy a bond from a U.S. corporation, I'm essentially lending that money to the corporation.

34
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:34,803
They are going to give me interest payments in the form of coupons, and then they are going to pay back that money at some future date.

35
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:36,466
So this is essentially lending money.

36
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:41,052
And what this does is it's increasing the supply of money that's out there to be lent.

37
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:44,667
And so if we think of the market for money,

38
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:48,876
so, listen now we have to get microeconomic terms for the market for money,

39
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,071
so the market for money,

40
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:59,138
if this is the price of money, which is really just the interest rate (so interest, interest rate as a percentage),

41
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:03,800
and this right over here is the supply of money (supply of money),

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,216
and I'll just draw, so this might be our supply curve,

43
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:11,736
that's supply, and this is the demand curve,

44
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:15,880
this is the demand curve, and let's say right over here, let's say

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,546
and let's say this is short term money and we won't focus on the different durations and all of that,

46
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:24,369
but let's say we're sitting right over here at a clearing interest rate of 5%.

47
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:27,616
So it makes sense, this is right here, this is our demand,

48
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,600
our demand curve, so all the people who will get more than 5% benefit out of the money,

49
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,987
maybe they have an investment where they can get 10% on the money or 8%, or 5.1%,

50
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:42,466
they're all willing to borrow that money and then invest it in whatever they want to do, or this might even be consumption,

51
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:47,709
people who say "hey, 5%, that's worth it for me to go out and buy that thing that makes me whatever happy."

52
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:49,734
But from an investment point of view it makes even more sense.

53
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:55,130
If I'm going to get an 8% return on my money, that's my benefit, it makes sense for me to borrow it at 5%.

54
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,786
And it makes sense all the way up to 5.0001%, I'd actually borrow it.

55
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:02,801
And so when the Federal Reserve or any Central Bank prints money,

56
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:09,780
and it buys debt, it goes out into debt markets and it buys it, it usually buys the safest kind of debt, but that affects all of the debt markets,

57
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,481
it goes out and buys in the debt market, they're essentially shifting the supply curve of money to the right,

58
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:17,615
they shift the supply curve to the right.

59
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:22,117
And so at any given interest rate you could say that there is more money,

60
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:25,966
and so the supply curve might look something like that,

61
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,619
and this is interesting because assuming the demand has not shifted,

62
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:33,209
what you now have is a different clearing price,

63
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,269
a different equilibrium price for the money.

64
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,674
Maybe this is now at 3%.

65
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:40,675
This is now at 3%.

66
00:04:40,675 --> 00:04:42,945
And you also have more money being lent and borrowed.

67
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:48,403
So if this is the old quantity of money that was lent and borrowed, let's say that this is, I'm just going to make up a number here,

68
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:54,298
let's say that this is, let's say that this is one hundred, one hundred billion dollars at some time period,

69
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:59,388
and now we're at a hundred and twenty billion dollars, one hundred and twenty billion dollars.

70
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:04,769
So now, by essentially printing money, buying debt, increasing the supply of money, two things happen.

71
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:10,298
Interest rates went down, and so now you have all of these characters out here who, before,

72
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:13,294
they weren't going to borrow money at 5% because whatever they were,

73
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:17,050
their benefit on that money was between 5% and 3%.

74
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,010
Maybe it was 4%, or 3.5%.

75
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:25,577
It didn't make sense for them to borrow at 5% and invest it and only get a 4% return, a 3% return,

76
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:27,005
but now that interest rates have gone down,

77
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:34,441
now it does make sense for them to borrow the money all the way down to someone who has some type of project or investment that has a 3% return.

78
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:38,877
They also say "hey I'm neutral, I can borrow at 3% and then I can invest."

79
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:41,550
But definitely the person with 3.1% or 3.2%,

80
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,659
if they have investments that give them that much, they would definitely want to borrow.

81
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:50,051
And we could assume that all this incremental borrowing, so this little example that I did right over here,

82
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:52,678
all this incremental twenty billion dollars of borrowing is going to be spent.

83
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:56,968
People will borrow money not to just, like, not to just sit, but stuff it into their,

84
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:01,739
into their mattresses, they'll borrow that money to go invest it in some way, to spend it.

85
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:05,797
And so what this will do, all of this will shift aggregate demand to the right.

86
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:11,418
Right here we're talking in microeconomic terms, but then if we think about aggregate supply and demand,

87
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:17,634
so this is aggregate, so this is, let me write aggregate, aggregate right over here,

88
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:26,801
this is price, this is real GDP, this is our aggregate demand, aggregate, aggregate demand.

89
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:34,073
And then our short-run aggregate supply might look something like this, aggregate supply in the short-run.

90
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:39,216
And so if we're shifting aggregate demand to the right, where there's going to be more demand

91
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:42,726
for goods and services, these people are going to borrow this money and spend it,

92
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:46,971
you're going to essentially stimulate, you're going to stimulate the economy.

93
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:50,898
So this shifts to the right, you have a situation

94
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:55,299
where real GDP will go from this state to this state right over here.

95
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,002
So it was expansionary.

96
00:06:57,002 --> 00:07:01,608
And obviously, if the Federal Reserve decides to print less money, or if they even decide to,

97
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:07,071
if they essentially soak up the money that's in the market by selling some of the debt that they own,

98
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:10,468
so that they're sucking dollars out of it, then the opposite effect would happen.

99
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:18,136
Now fiscal policy is essentially the government directly going out there and demanding goods and services from the economy.

100
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:22,333
So this is essentially you have the government, you have the government,

101
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:28,133
it has two sources of revenue that it can spend: it has money from taxes, it has tax revenue,

102
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:33,673
and then it can go out and borrow money, and so it also has access to debt markets.

103
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:38,340
And when the government borrows money, they're essentially issuing treasury bills,

104
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,805
if you are talking about the U.S., treasury bills and treasury bonds.

105
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:46,804
If you were to buy those from the U.S. government, you are essentially lending money to the government to finance their debt.

106
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:49,604
And so they can take these two sources of money and then,

107
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:52,672
if they decide to do, if they decide to spend more,

108
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,885
and let's say that they're going to hold taxes fixed,

109
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:57,404
so they're not going to take out any demand from the economy,

110
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:03,474
they might ratchet up debt and then ratchet up spending, ratchet up spending,

111
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:08,469
and then that, the government is directly going out there and demanding more goods and services.

112
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:12,738
So that could also shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.

113
00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:20,470
So these are two different levers, two different tools that have been used in governments all around the world to shift aggregate demand one way or another

114
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,465
or attempt to shift aggregate demand one way or the other.

115
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:25,636
Monetary policy is more indirect.

116
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:30,408
Printing money, using that to increase the supply of money that's out there to be lent,

117
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:33,739
that lowers interest rates, and then, because it lowers interest rates,

118
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:38,403
more money, there's more willingness to borrow and invest that money.

119
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:46,137
Fiscal policy, you're directly going out there and just buying more goods and services by usually ratcheting, ratcheting up your debt.

120
00:08:46,137 --> 00:08:47,636
Or fiscal policy could go the other way.

121
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:50,922
If you're trying to restrain the economy, you could lower your debt, lower your spending,

122
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:54,000
or you could do some other combination.
