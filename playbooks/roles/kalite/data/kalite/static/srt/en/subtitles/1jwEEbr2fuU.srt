1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,070
Where are we? So we're on page 669,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,990
and we're going to start on test number five, section seven.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,580
Problem number one--

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,070
if k is a positive integer divisible by 3,

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,830
and if k is less than 60,

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,570
what is the greatest possible value of k?

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,710
So it's a positive integer greater than--

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,170
it's positive, so it's greater than 0.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,100
It's divisible by 3, and it's less than 60.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,340
k is less than 60.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,510
60 is divisible by 3, right?

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,940
3 times 20 is 60.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,810
So if I subtract 3 from 60,that will also be divisible by 60.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,230
So k is equal to 57.

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,250
Right? k can't be 60 because it's less than 60.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,340
And then the next one down is 57.

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,240
And if you don't believe that 3 is divisible into 57--

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,770
3 goes into 57-- 1, 1 times 3, 27-- goes into it 19 times.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,560
There you go. So the choice is C, 57.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,240
And if you haven't learned this already,

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,620
the easiest way to figure out if the number's divisible by 57

22
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,150
add the digits.

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,250
So 5 plus 7 is 12, 1 plus 2 is 3.

24
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,020
So if when you add the digits,

25
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,320
the sum you get is divisible by 3,

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,140
then the original number is also divisible by 3.

27
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,810
So you could actually have gone down the choices,

28
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,820
but you don't want to waste too much time

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,650
on the first problem.

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,340
Problem two--

31
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,330
the letter H is symmetric with respect to two different lines

32
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,200
as shown in the dotted line in the figure above.

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,060
Which of the following is symmetric

34
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,820
with respect to at least two different lines?

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,580
So when they talk about H,they're saying--

36
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,060
if I draw an H, they draw this line of symmetry here.

37
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,240
And that means if I were to flip H over this way,

38
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,170
I get the same thing.

39
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,030
If I were to flip it over this line, I get the same thing.

40
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,810
It's like a mirror image on either side. Right?

41
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,320
This green line is a mirror image of this purple line.

42
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,910
And the other way is true too.

43
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,850
If I have H,

44
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:03,030
this mauve part is the mirror image of this brown part

45
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,910
along the horizontal axis.

46
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,660
If I were to draw a--if this was the axis of the mirror image

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,510
So which of the other letters has it?

48
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,870
So it should be a letter that looks the same--

49
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,820
that could be kind of folded in half either vertically

50
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,830
or horizontally.

51
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,320
And if we look at all the choices,X is definitely the answer.

52
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,190
Because if you have an X,

53
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,810
and if you have a vertical line of symmetry,

54
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,330
notice that the left-hand side

55
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,690
is the mirror image of the right-hand side.

56
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,080
Or you could flip it over, right?

57
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,870
They look the same.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,340
It almost looks like a reflection of the other side.

59
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,360
Similarly, if you took it the other way.

60
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,840
Also you could flip it up and down,

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
and they also have the mirror image.

62
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,850
None of the other letters have that property.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,320
Next problem. Problem number three.

64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,950
Bobby receives $2.00 for each chore he does during the week,

65
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,720
plus a weekly allowance of $10.00.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,420
If Bobby receives no other money,

67
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,760
which of the following expressions

68
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,620
represents the total dollar amount Bobby receives per week

69
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,910
in which he does n chores?

70
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,060
So if he does n chores,

71
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,070
how much money is he going to get just from doing chores?

72
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,660
He does n chores, and how much does he get per chore?

73
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,810
Well, he gets $2.00. Times 2.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,280
So this is how much he gets just from doing chores,

75
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,030
2n, or n times 2.

76
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,290
And then how much is he going to get

77
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,810
even if he does 0 chores?

78
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,210
He gets a $10.00 allowance no matter what,

79
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,770
far more than I ever got as a child.

80
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,860
So what is the formula?

81
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,620
It's 2n plus 10, is the amount of money he gets.

82
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,930
And that is choice D. Right?

83
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,280
n is the number of chores, he gets $2.00 per chore,

84
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,770
and he gets $10.00 no matter what,

85
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,510
even if n is 0, even if he does no chores.

86
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,730
Next problem, four.

87
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,290
The smallest squares in figure A and figure B

88
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,230
are all equal in size.

89
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,470
If the area in A is 26 square centimeters,

90
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,060
what is the area of figure B?

91
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,370
So let's see if I can draw these figures.

92
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,880
So I'll use the line tool, so a looks like--

93
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,340
let's see, you have a line there.

94
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,330
So let me draw a rectangle.

95
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,680
So the rectangle looks like that. Close enough.

96
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,770
And then there's another rectangle that's like this.

97
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,700
Another rectangle like this--

98
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,350
the drawing is the hardest part, my shaky hands.

99
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,720
OK, almost there.

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,430
I think you get the point,I try my best.

101
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,700
Have to give me credit.

102
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,300
OK, so that's figure A, and then figure B looks like this.

103
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,240
Horizontal line, and then a vertical line like that.

104
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,910
And then, let's see,it has that. Connect these two.

105
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,680
And then-- oh boy,this is tiring. I have a line like that.

106
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,620
And then it gets split roughly in half over there.

107
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,770
And then this connects like that.

108
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,760
That connects like that.

109
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,000
And then I have a line like that.

110
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,260
So what they're telling us is in figure A--

111
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,630
whoops, I don't want to do that, edit undo--

112
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,160
what they're saying is figure A,

113
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,280
each of these squares

114
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,590
are the same size as each of these squares in figure B.

115
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,380
And they also tell us

116
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,600
that figure A is 26 square centimeters.

117
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,810
So the area is 26 centimeters squared.

118
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,070
So we want to figure out the area of B.

119
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,470
We have to just figure out,

120
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,080
how big is each of these little tiles.Right?

121
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,040
So how many tiles are in a? Let's count them.

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:12,140
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 13 tiles.

123
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,000
And they're 26 centimeters cubed total, right?

124
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,730
So if 13 times the area of a tile is equal to 26 centimeters,

125
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,730
a tile-- divide both sides by 13--

126
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,790
is 2 centimeters squared, right?

127
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,360
Each tile is 2 centimeters squared.

128
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,860
And how many tiles does B have?

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,550
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. It has 8.

130
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,060
So its area is 8 times the number of tiles--

131
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,140
or the area of the tiles.

132
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,880
And we know what the area of the tiles are--

133
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,500
it's 2, because it's the same as A.

134
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
So area is equal to 8 times 2,

135
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,910
which is equal to 16 centimeters squared, which is choice C.

136
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,690
Next problem. More drawing for Sal.

137
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:59,410
Oh boys, it's the drawing that really tires me. OK.

138
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,670
And I have to draw it pretty accurately, because otherwise--

139
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,420
this is all about reading a graph.

140
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,570
All right, so let me draw.

141
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:19,150
Let me make the first one-- so Albert goes to like 300.

142
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,890
This is 300.

143
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,840
And then it's 150, which is roughly half of that.

144
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,830
And then the next guy is like a little over 200,

145
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,920
so it's like 2/3.

146
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,710
I'm just trying my best,trying my best.

147
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,570
Then the next guy, I guess at like 250, here.

148
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,450
And then the last guy-- I'm drawing the white boxes,

149
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,640
this is pretty much the same number. Like that.

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
And then let me draw the other one in here,

151
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:00,490
so the other guy is 150. This guy gets to 250.

152
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,240
Which I said was roughly the same amount as

153
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,450
these guys over here.

154
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,820
Next guy looks about the same.

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,040
250, that's about that. And this guy is like that.

156
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,030
All the work I'm doing now is just to redraw

157
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,900
what you already have. Then this guy is like 350,

158
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,690
300 or something,right?

159
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,110
If I were to draw-- let me mark it off.

160
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,470
So this is 300, this is 150--

161
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,890
see those guys that are a little bit under 200.

162
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,660
So this is like 200, this is 250.

163
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,170
They're asking us, according to the graph above,

164
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,930
which salesperson had the greatest increase

165
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,970
in the number of units sold from 1998 to 1999?

166
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,940
So the 1998 ones are the blue ones,

167
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,550
and 1999 are the red ones.

168
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,180
So you're essentially saying,

169
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,790
who had the greatest increase

170
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,920
going from the blue to the red, right?

171
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,920
And this is Albert, this is Goldberg, Patel--

172
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,600
that's nice, they included an Indian guy. Smith, Wang.

173
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,360
I look forward to when they have a Khan on the SAT,

174
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,100
but anyway.

175
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,130
So who increased the most going from the blue year,

176
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,830
1998, to 1999.

177
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,970
This guy clearly decreased,right?

178
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,720
He went from 300 to 150,so it's not him.

179
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,590
This guy decreased,

180
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,670
he went from something larger to something smaller,

181
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,420
so it's not him.

182
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,330
So who had the largest increase?

183
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,150
Well, you could eyeball it, right?

184
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,920
Where are the increases?

185
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,410
This guy increased this much,

186
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,020
compared to a smaller increase here,and a smaller increase here.

187
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:55,700
So the answer is G, or Goldberg,which is choice B.

188
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,010
See you in the next video.
