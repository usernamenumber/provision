1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,380
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,460
We're doing the last part
of Problem 1 of the

4
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,390
2008 Calculus BC exam.

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,670
And I'll repeat the problem.

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,800
It says, the region R models
the surface of a small pond.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,550
At all points in R at a
distance x from the y-axis, the

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,300
depth of the water is given by
h of x is equal to 3 minus x.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,400
Find the volume of the
water in the pond.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,900
So we thought about, this is,
you know, a perspective drawing

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,950
of this, this is the surface
of the pond, right here.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,560
And I was trying to
draw the depth.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,480
So when x is equal to 0, the
pond is exactly 3, I guess, you

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,060
know, we could say feet, or
whatever the units are, deep,

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:48,100
and then when x is equal to
2, the pond is 1 unit deep.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,340
And so to find the volume, we
think about it the same way.

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,730
What does a cross section
at any point of the

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,040
pond look like?

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,430
Well if we, let's see.

20
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,300
So if we were to take a cross
section, so let's say that

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,970
this, let's take this cross
section of the pond.

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,230
Let me do it in a different
color, I know it can

23
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,560
be kind of confusing.

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,610
That's not too different.

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,110
So that's green.

26
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,480
So the height along the surface
of the pond is going to be the

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,730
difference between
the two functions.

28
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:20,220
And we know that the top
function is sine of pi x, and

29
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,990
we know that this bottom
function is x to the

30
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,280
third minus 4x.

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,530
So if I were to draw, let
me see if I can draw

32
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,030
this cross section.

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,530
   

34
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,730
So we know this the height,
sorry, the width along the

35
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,410
surface of this cross section
is going to be the difference

36
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,460
between this function and
this function, right?

37
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,850
So if I were to draw, let me
see if I can, so this is that

38
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:58,790
same cross section, it's the
width along the top, I know I'm

39
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,120
confusing you, is going to be
this function minus

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,870
this function.

41
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:15,580
It's going to be sine of pi x
minus x to the third minus 4x.

42
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,200
And what's going to be
the height, right here?

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,020
Well, they told us.

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,400
The height of the pond, or
the depth of the pond, at

45
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,630
any point, is 3 minus x,
whatever x value we're at.

46
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,720
So this is going
to be 3 minus x.

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,450
So the area of this cross
section of the pond is going to

48
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:45,010
be sine of pi x minus x to the
third minus four x times the

49
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,110
depth of the pond, right?

50
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,410
That's the surface
width times the depth.

51
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,470
So that times 3 minus x.

52
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,610
So that's the area of
each cross section.

53
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,630
So we want the volume for
the entire pond, we take

54
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,150
essentially the volume of
each of these kind of

55
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,950
slivers of the pond.

56
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,730
So we take the area of each
cross section, and we multiply

57
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,060
it by a very small width to
get a very small sliver.

58
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:16,240
So we take that and multiply
it by dx, and we integrate.

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,720
We sum up all of these slivers
of the pond from x is equal

60
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,260
to 0 to x is equal to 2.

61
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,680
So let's do that.

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,660
Let's integrate from x is equal
to 0 from x is equal to 2.

63
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,410
Once again, this is a
really hard integral.

64
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,930
Or it's something that you can
do, especially if you use

65
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,440
integration by parts, but it's
a little bit messy, and you

66
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,170
only have 45 minutes to do all
three problems on the BC exam,

67
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,890
so I'm assuming that they want
you to use the calculator here.

68
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,970
So let's use the calculator
to evaluate it.

69
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,080
So let's see.

70
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,580
   

71
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,480
So this was part c that we
already have in our calculator.

72
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,660
We could do second enter, and
we'll get the previous entry.

73
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,236
Second enter.

74
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,020
Because we already typed
in a bunch of stuff.

75
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,350
The only difference between
what we did in Part C and now

76
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,590
is, now, instead of having in
Part C, we had this

77
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,960
expression squared.

78
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,575
Now, we don't have it squared,
but we're multiplying

79
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:14,355
it by times 3 minus x.

80
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,660
So let's do that.

81
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,970
So if we go here, we can
delete this squared.

82
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,710
We're not squaring it anymore.

83
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,660
Deleted.

84
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,420
And now let's do, I want
you to see my key strokes.

85
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,590
So let's do second insert.

86
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:40,180
So let's insert times 3
minus x close parentheses.

87
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,000
And so, let's see.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,450
We have sine of pi x minus x
to the third plus 4x, right,

89
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,840
that's the same thing as this.

90
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,160
Times 3 minus x.

91
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,810
And our variable of integration
is x, and we're integrating

92
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,520
from x is equal to zero
to x is equal to 2.

93
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,550
Let's hit enter.

94
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,900
   

95
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,980
And it noticed, it
is calculating.

96
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,760
And our answer is 8.37, I
think, is a fair answer.

97
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,470
So the volume this time,
the volume of the pond,

98
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,090
is equal to 8.37.

99
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,270
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

100
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,250
I will, every day, try to do
a couple of these problems.

101
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,340
See you in the next video.

102
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,600
