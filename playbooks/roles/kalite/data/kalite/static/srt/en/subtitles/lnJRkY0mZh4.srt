00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,874
Male voice: We're looking at 
FranÃ§ois Boucher's "De Marcido Pompadour"

3
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:13,040
Female voice: 
But I have, before we go into, to say...

4
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:16,362
...that I don't really like Rococo paintings
but I really like this one.

5
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:19,258
There's something really... beautiful about it.

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:23,437
I'm taken in by the pink ruffles and the lace

7
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:25,285
...and the cameo on her wrist

8
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:28,094
...and the puff that she's using to powder herself

9
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:30,400
...and the flowers on the bottom

10
00:00:30,553 --> 00:00:32,461
...and the pink of the cheeks

11
00:00:32,568 --> 00:00:34,219
...and the blue bow in her hair

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,624
...and the little pink at the end of the brush

13
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:38,579
...that she's using to put on her blush.

14
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:41,418
I mean... it's just... really yummy!

15
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:43,085
Male voice: 
So let's talk about those things for just a moment

16
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,723
because they really do catch the eye.

17
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,445
The lace and the pink ribbons

18
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:50,527
have the kind of almost architectural quality to them.

19
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:53,906
- ...that's really extraordinary.
- Yeah, they have like a kind of veil volume to them.

20
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:55,580
Male voice: 
They have volume and structure

21
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:58,918
and you can feel 
the weight and the stiffness of the fabric

22
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,204
and the proof is the opposite of that.

23
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:04,689
And there's tremendous focus, of course,
on the cameo on her wrist.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,318
- Because it's a portrait of her lover.
- King Louis XV.

25
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:09,573
That's right, of France.

26
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,484
But then contrast that with the rendering

27
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:14,293
of her face, of her head...

28
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:19,553
which is sort of 
impossibly... soft and, sort of, reformed.

29
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,324
Look at the size of the eyes 
in comparison to the size of the mouth.

30
00:01:23,432 --> 00:01:24,882
She's become child.

31
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:26,221
Female voice:
That's true, I haven't thought of that.

32
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:27,852
Male voice: 
It's almost as we're looking at

33
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:30,440
Japanese cartoons... what are those called?

34
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:33,815
Female voice: 
Anime? It's certainly not about her personality

35
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:36,846
and who she was, and her humanity, and then he...

36
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:38,573
Male voice:
No, it's about her persona, right?

37
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:39,888
Female voice:
Yes, her persona.

38
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:42,057
And, that's to me,
that's what the whole painting is about.

39
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,951
It's just about the artifice.

40
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,773
It's like the artifice of the French court

41
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,954
in the 18th century in the Rococo period.

42
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:50,616
It's about the artifice
of the clothing, of the make-up.

43
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:52,718
It's just about the surface.

44
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:56,496
It's true but this is
a very intimate kind of surface, isn't it? And...

45
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:58,689
Female voice:
In regard it's the king's lover, in that way?

46
00:01:58,736 --> 00:02:01,737
Male voice:
Yeah, and also just the sense of proximity.

47
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:03,194
Female voice:
That's true, we're very close to her.

48
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,671
Male voice:
Yeah, we feel as we could've reach out.

49
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:06,976
Female voice:
We're her best friend and she's about to share

50
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,572
- ...an intimate secret.
- That's exactly right.

51
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:11,787
Male voice:
But then our eyes rise up across her wrist

52
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:15,852
over the portrait of her lover,
across her breast, up to her neck,

53
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:20,440
and then finally, we get to 
her face which seems, sort of, almost remote.

54
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:22,755
Female voice:
The first thing I'd noticed was all of those

55
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:24,876
accessories of artifice

56
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:27,391
and then I've looked at 
her face, you know, I've read the label...

57
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:30,134
OK, this is mistress 
to Louis XV and then I thought...

58
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:32,125
Who is this woman?

59
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:36,820
I've looked at her face 
for clues... and I didn't get anything

60
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,288
Male voice:
The sense of clarity with which the artifice

61
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,890
as you put it, is painted against the softness

62
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:46,044
and the indeterminacy of her individuality

63
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:48,359
...is, I think, clearest in the colour.

64
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,902
Look how incredibly crisp, 
almost frozen that colour is

65
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,517
and then look at the softness

66
00:02:54,563 --> 00:02:56,846
but there is this wild sense of indeterminacy

67
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:59,005
...and mystery, I think.

68
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:03,413
