1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
I used simplified numbers when we first thought about

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,469
how the Chinese government intervened

3
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:09,317
in foreign currency markets to keep their currency devalued.

4
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:10,483
What I want to do in this video is

5
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:12,140
to look at some of the real numbers.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,675
So this is from the US bureau economic analysis bea.gov.

7
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:20,421
This is the url where I actually got these data.

8
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:24,401
This right over here is the US balance of payments relative to China.

9
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:27,449
This part right over here is the current account,

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,536
which just really tells us the imports versus exports.

11
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:33,869
And this over here is the capital account

12
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,477
sometimes called financial account

13
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:39,097
depending on how you are accounting for it.

14
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:40,061
And this is telling us about

15
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:43,760
the inflow or the outflow of ownership of assets.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,945
So this is goods. This is assets.

17
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,905
You can think of it as money or securities or other things like that.

18
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:51,661
Now you can look from 2006.

19
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:56,563
In 2006 we did export something to China 72 billion worth.

20
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:59,060
In 2006 this is in millions of dollars.

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,758
So 72 thousand is 72 billion increased to 85 billion,

22
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:06,676
95 billion stayed at around 95 billion in 2009.

23
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:11,026
But the United States imported a ton more 330 billion.

24
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:16,391
330 billions in 2006. 380 billions in 2007.

25
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:18,866
Almost 400 billions in 2008.

26
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:25,688
So we running almost 300 billion trade deficit in 2008 relative to China.

27
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:28,436
And in 2009, it goes down a little bit.

28
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:32,507
This looks like about 260 billion trade deficit.

29
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:38,782
So that’s really because we United States imported fewer goods.

30
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:43,191
To a large degree, that’s probably because of the US recession

31
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:47,338
where consumption in general slowed down.

32
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:49,800
So we would bought fewer goods and services

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,819
from pretty much anyone including ourselves or China.

34
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:55,867
Now you can see that being offset in the financial account.

35
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,846
This, to some degree, tells us the story.

36
00:01:57,846 --> 00:02:00,759
But it doesn't give us full story of the Chinese.

37
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,477
This is just the Chinese government.

38
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:04,395
This is all Chinese ownership.

39
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:08,034
But they are increasing their ownership of US assets.

40
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:13,122
Those assets they could be US treasuries, notes and bills.

41
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:16,605
These could be US stocks. These could be US real estate.

42
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:19,267
But you can see each year this is the increase.

43
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:22,253
Americans are buying assets in China

44
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:25,963
5 billion dollars in 2006, 2 billions in 2007,

45
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:29,114
12 billions in 2008, 18 billions in 2009.

46
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:31,246
To some degree, this is limited by

47
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:35,210
restrictions imposed by the Chinese government.

48
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,162
As you can see Chinese are buying way more assets in the US.

49
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:42,689
This is really kind of that picture of the Chinese

50
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:44,581
especially the Chinese central government

51
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,509
is buying US assets to do that.

52
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:48,951
They have to buy dollars with Yuan

53
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,731
which keeps the dollars strong

54
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:52,849
and it allows their currency stay weak,

55
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:55,439
which, to some degree or to a large degree,

56
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,312
allows the balance of this trade deficit to stay where it is.

57
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:01,995
Now I'll leave you with one conundrum.

58
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:05,461
To a large degree, this is, these numbers right here,

59
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:09,240
they are offsetting the trade deficit, especially in 2008.

60
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,269
The Chinese bought way more US assets than

61
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,485
actually even the trade deficit they more than made up for it.

62
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,283
But in 2009 you don't see them buy enough

63
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:19,992
to make up for the trade deficit.

64
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:23,461
They bought 143 billons and actually on a net basis

65
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:25,980
it would probably be about 120 something billion,

66
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,986
which doesn’t make up for the whole 260 billion,

67
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:32,081
so how did they still keep their currency pegged.

68
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,263
And the answer we are going to look in more detail

69
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:37,543
is they don't have to directly buy US assets.

70
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:39,060
They could buy assets or

71
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,072
they could buy currency from another country.

72
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:44,461
That will put upward pressure on that currency.

73
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:45,930
Let me report it over here.

74
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,194
China could go and buy US currency or

75
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:55,289
it could go to another country and buy their currency.

76
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,324
Country A is going to feel pressure.

77
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:00,894
Its currency is going to go up in value.

78
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:03,062
And it doesn't want that, because it will hurt its trade.

79
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:07,786
So it might go and buy US assets to keep it devalued.

80
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:10,199
That would not show up in that chart.

81
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,571
We will look into that in the next video.

82
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:16,458
