1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,921
I want to write this expression here as a decimal

2
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:06,277
and the first question that might pop into your head is,

3
00:00:06,277 --> 00:00:09,741
Do I multiply four times a thousand, then add three,

4
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:12,471
then multiply a thousand, then add sixty-seven,

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,669
then multiply by one over a thousand?

6
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:18,203
Or, do I do the multiplication first?

7
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:20,203
To answer that question, we just have to remind ourselves

8
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,824
about order of operations.

9
00:00:21,824 --> 00:00:25,271
Order of operations, if you have a bunch of multiplication and addition in a row like this,

10
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:27,938
you will do the multiplication first.

11
00:00:27,938 --> 00:00:30,536
So you will do the multiplication first.

12
00:00:30,536 --> 00:00:32,939
Let me put some parentheses here to remind us of that.

13
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,409
So let's figure out what each of these expressions in the parentheses actually represent.

14
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,491
What's four times one million? Well, that's four million.

15
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:48,106
What's three times one thousand? Well, that's three thousand. Three thousand.

16
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:52,338
What is sixty-seven times one-thousandth?

17
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:54,234
There's a bunch of ways of thinking about this.

18
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:56,581
Actually, let me, let me write them all over here.

19
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:59,485
Well, I'll do the most obvious one right over here:

20
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:05,150
sixty-seven times one-thousandth is sixty-seven thousandths.

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,248
And we can represent this literally as sixty-seven thousandths,

22
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:18,816
or we could represent this as sixty over a thousand plus seven over one thousand,

23
00:01:18,816 --> 00:01:21,149
and what's sixty over a thousand?

24
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:25,316
Well, sixty over a thousand is six hundredths.

25
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:28,447
Six hundredths. And let me put that in a different color.

26
00:01:28,447 --> 00:01:31,983
Six hundredths, seven thousandths.

27
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:33,581
So you can view this as sixty-seven thousandths,

28
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:38,914
or you could view this as six hundredths, and seven thousandths.

29
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:41,581
Either way, let's add all of these things together.

30
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:45,782
So, we have four million. So the four in the millions place

31
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:47,381
literally represents four million.

32
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:52,446
Then we have no hundred-thousands, we have no ten-thousands,

33
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,849
but then we have three thousand. So the three is in the thousands place.

34
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,485
Put a comma here so we can keep track of things.

35
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:03,816
And then we have no hundreds, we have no tens,

36
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:07,733
we have no ones, we don't even have any tenths,

37
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:14,905
but we do have some hundredths. We have six hundredths. We have six hundredths.

38
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:18,981
And then we have some thousandths. We have seven thousandths.

39
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:23,173
So let me put that seven in the thousandths, in the thousandths place.

40
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:25,090
So we could read this as:

41
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,801
four million, three thousand, six hundredths, and seven thousandths.

42
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,339
Or, we could read it as:

43
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:38,600
four million, three thousand, and sixty-seven thousandths.

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,953
Sixty-seven thousandths.
