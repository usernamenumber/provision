Alright, so this video introduces our projectile launcher.

2
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:10,570
It's a project that you can build, and we take you through step-by-step how to do that

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,062
in the next two videos.

4
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:14,183
But first, I wanna just show you some of the things it can do.

5
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:19,089
So, we're adjusting it to 60 degrees, taking it back to position four, and launching the

6
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,828
ping pong ball straight away into the trash can.

7
00:00:21,828 --> 00:00:25,812
This one kinda fires off to the side, but we'll get it on the next go-around.

8
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:33,264
And, so, the launcher allows you to make the calculations for projectile motion come alive.

9
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:39,388
You can get a sense for how to make the projectile launch more accurate, and you

10
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:43,932
can get a sense for how different materials launch differently in the launcher.

11
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:48,560
You can see these hacky sacks don't do so well compared to the ping pong balls.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,410
And the paper, also, was pretty inaccurate.

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,323
So it opens up the opportunity for a lot of conversation around those types of things.

14
00:00:56,323 --> 00:01:03,600
You can look here once we've got the projectile angles and the nature of the projectile

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,932
figured out, we're able to knock the cans down, one right after another, with a high degree

16
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:10,504
of accuracy.

17
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:14,560
So we're gonna take out that Coke can right there.

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,903
Sal has done a great job of putting together a number of projectile motion videos

19
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:22,307
online, and you can take a look at how to do the calculations.

20
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:26,073
I'll have the links down below this video.

21
00:01:26,073 --> 00:01:30,246
We went ahead and took this launcher out to the pool to see what we could do there.

22
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:33,218
To see if we could get the ping pong balls in the life preserver.

23
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:38,114
But, if you like launcher, watch the next two videos and we'll show you how to make it.
