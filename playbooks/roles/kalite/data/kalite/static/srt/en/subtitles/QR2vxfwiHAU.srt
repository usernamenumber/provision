1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,650
Let's say we have an ellipse
formula, x squared over a

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,950
squared plus y squared over
b squared is equal to 1.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,210
And for the sake of our
discussion, we'll assume

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,030
that a is greater than b.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,420
And all that does for us is, it
lets us so this is going to

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,110
be kind of a short
and fat ellipse.

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,600
Or that the semi-major axis,
or, the major axis, is going

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,730
to be along the horizontal.

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,580
And the minor axis is
along the vertical.

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,960
And let's draw that.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,330
Draw this ellipse.

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,070
I want to draw a
thicker ellipse.

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,120
Let's say, that's my ellipse,
and then let me draw my axes.

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,490
OK, this is the
horizontal right there.

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,120
And there we have the vertical.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,830
And we've studied an ellipse
in pretty good detail so far.

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:58,160
We know how to figure out
semi-minor radius, which in

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,970
this case we know is b.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,320
That's the same b right there.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,510
And that's only the
semi-minor radius.

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,670
Because b is smaller than a.

23
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,480
If b was greater, it would
be the major radius.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,170
And then, of course,
the major radius is a.

25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,350
And that distance is
this right here.

26
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,540
Now, another super-interesting,
and perhaps the most

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,750
interesting property of an
ellipse, is that if you take

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,730
any point on the an ellipse,
and measure the distance from

29
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,490
that point to two special
points which we, for the sake

30
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,500
of this discussion, and not
just for the sake of this

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,170
discussion, for pretty much
forever, we will call the

32
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,120
focuses, or the foci,
of this ellipse.

33
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,380
And these two points,
they always sit along

34
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,280
the major axis.

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,180
So, in this case, it's
the horizontal axis.

36
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,090
And they're symmetric around
the center of the ellipse.

37
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,230
So let's just call
these points, let me

38
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,700
call this one f1.

39
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,960
And this is f2.

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,710
And it's for focus.

41
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,920
Focuses.

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,810
f2.

43
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,220
So the super-interesting,
fascinating property

44
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,100
of an ellipse.

45
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,900
And it's often used as the
definition of an ellipse is, if

46
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,490
you take any point on this
ellipse, and measure its

47
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,360
distance to each of
these two points.

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
So, let's say that I have
this distance right here.

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,980
Let's call this distance d1.

50
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,200
And then I have this distance
over here, so I'm taking any

51
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,400
point on that ellipse, or this
particular point, and I'm

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,980
measuring the distance to
each of these two foci.

53
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,060
And this is d2.

54
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,200
We'll do it in a
different color.

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,950
   

56
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,730
So this is d2.

57
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,030
This whole line right here.

58
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,680
That's d2.

59
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,180
   

60
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,100
So when you find these two
distances, you sum of them up.

61
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,280
So this d2 plus d1, this
is going to be a constant

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,980
that it actually turns
out is equal to 2a.

63
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,000
But it turns out that it's true
anywhere you go on the ellipse.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,600
Let me make that point clear.

65
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,620
And I'm actually going to prove
to you that this constant

66
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,460
distance is actually 2a, where
this a is the same is

67
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,280
that a right there.

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,830
So, just to make sure you
understand what I'm saying.

69
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,530
So let me take another
arbitrary point

70
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,240
on this ellipse.

71
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,690
Let's take it right there.

72
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,570
And if I were to measure the
distance from this point to

73
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:27,660
this focus, let's call that
point d3, and then measure the

74
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,760
distance from this point to
that focus -- let's

75
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,830
call that point d4.

76
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,680
   

77
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,630
d4.

78
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,490
If I were to sum up these two
points, it's still going

79
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,030
to be equal to 2a.

80
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,110
Let me write that down.

81
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:49,260
d3 plus d4 is still going
to be equal to 2a.

82
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,280
That's just neat.

83
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,550
And, actually, this is often
used as the definition for an

84
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,180
ellipse, where they say that
the ellipse is the set of all

85
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,330
points, or sometimes they'll
use the word locus, which is

86
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,090
kind of the graphical
representation of the set of

87
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,630
all points, that where the sum
of the distances to each

88
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,540
of these focuses is
equal to a constant.

89
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,900
And we'll play with that a
little bit, and we'll figure

90
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,930
out, how do you figure out
the focuses of an ellipse.

91
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,110
But the first thing to do is
just to feel satisfied that the

92
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,900
distance, if this is true,
that it is equal to 2a.

93
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,060
And the easiest way to figure
that out is to pick these, I

94
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,560
guess you could call them, the
extreme points along the

95
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,570
x-axis here and here.

96
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,630
We're already making the claim
that the distance from here to

97
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,190
here, let me draw that
in another color.

98
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,390
That this distance plus this
distance over here, is going

99
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,450
to be equal to some
constant number.

100
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,240
And using this extreme point,
I'm going to show you that that

101
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,110
constant number is equal to 2a,
So let's figure out

102
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,860
how to do that.

103
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,150
So one thing to realize is that
these two focus points are

104
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,270
symmetric around the origin.

105
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,240
So, whatever distance this is,
right here, it's going to be

106
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,510
the same as this distance.

107
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,250
Right there.

108
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,030
Because these two points are
symmetric around the origin.

109
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,630
So this, right here, is the
same distance as that.

110
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,920
And, of course, we have -- what
we want to do is figure out the

111
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,891
sum of this distance and this
longer distance right there.

112
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:24,740
Well, what's the sum of this
plus this green distance?

113
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,190
Well, this right here
is the same as that.

114
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,710
So this plus the green --
let me write that down.

115
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:37,410
So let me write down these, let
me call this distance g, just

116
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,890
to say, let's call that g,
and let's call this h.

117
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,510
Now, if this is g and this is
h, we also know that this is g

118
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,760
because everything's symmetric.

119
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,010
So what's g plus h?

120
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,130
Well, that's the same
thing as g plus h.

121
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,750
Which is the entire major
diameter of this ellipse.

122
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,970
Which is what?

123
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,960
Well, we know the minor
radius is a, so this length

124
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,960
right here is also a.

125
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,970
So the distance, or the sum of
the distance from this point on

126
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,630
the ellipse to this focus, plus
this point on the ellipse to

127
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,740
that focus, is equal to g plus
h, or this big green part,

128
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,320
which is the same thing as the
major diameter of this ellipse,

129
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,430
which is the same thing as 2a.

130
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:18,890
Fair enough.

131
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,520
Hopefully that that is
good enough for you.

132
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,090
Now, the next thing, now that
we've realized that, is how do

133
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,150
we figure out where
these foci stand.

134
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,770
Or, if we have this equation,
how can we figure out what

135
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,410
these two points are?

136
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,710
Let's figure that out.

137
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,990
So, the first thing we realize,
all of a sudden is that no

138
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,110
matter where we go, it was easy
to do it with these points.

139
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,910
But even if we take this point
right here and we say, OK,

140
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,040
what's this distance, and then
sum it to that distance, that

141
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,560
should also be equal to 2a.

142
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,290
And we could use that
information to actually figure

143
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,210
out where the foci lie.

144
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,905
So, let's say I have --
let me draw another one.

145
00:06:57,905 --> 00:07:06,050
   

146
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,990
So that's my ellipse.

147
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,590
And then we want
to draw the axes.

148
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,930
For clarity.

149
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,480
Let me write down
the equation again.

150
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,310
Just so we don't lose it.
x squared over a squared

151
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,030
plus y squared over b
squared is equal to 1.

152
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,120
Let's take this
point right here.

153
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,310
These extreme points are always
useful when you're trying

154
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,830
to prove something.

155
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,720
Or they can be, I don't
want to say always.

156
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,920
Now, we said that we have these
two foci that are symmetric

157
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,240
around the center
of the ellipse.

158
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,740
This is f1, this is f2.

159
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,530
And we've already said that an
ellipse is the locus of all

160
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,230
points, or the set of all
points, that if you take each

161
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,780
of these points' distance from
each of the focuses, and add

162
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,230
them up, you get a
constant number.

163
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,120
And we've figured out that
that constant number is 2a.

164
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,100
So we've figured out that if
you take this distance right

165
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,320
here and add it to this
distance right here,

166
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,240
it'll be equal to 2a.

167
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:15,370
So we could say that if we
call this d, d1, this is d2.

168
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:21,030
We know that d1 plus
d2 is equal to 2a.

169
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,710
And an interesting thing
here is that this is

170
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,080
all symmetric, right?

171
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,020
This length is going to be the
same, d1 is is going to be the

172
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,340
same, as d2, because everything
we're doing is symmetric.

173
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,760
These two focal lengths
are symmetric.

174
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,160
This distance is the
same distance as this

175
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,710
distance right there.

176
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,870
So, d1 and d2 have
to be the same.

177
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,920
There's no way that you
could -- this is the exact

178
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,050
center point the ellipse.

179
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,090
The ellipse is symmetric
around the y-axis.

180
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,990
So if d1 is equal to d2, and
that equals 2a, then we know

181
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,240
that this has to be equal to a.

182
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,740
And this has to be equal to a.

183
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,690
I think we're making progress.

184
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,760
And the other thing to think
about, and we already did that

185
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,740
in the previous drawing of
the ellipse is, what

186
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,880
is this distance?

187
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,880
This distance is the
semi-minor radius.

188
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,160
Which we already learned is b.

189
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,250
And this of course is the
focal length that we're

190
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,360
trying to figure out.

191
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,530
This should already pop into
your brain as a Pythagorean

192
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,830
theorem problem.

193
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,460
So we have the focal length.

194
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,120
And we could do it on this
triangle or this triangle.

195
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,140
I'll do it on this
right one here.

196
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,490
This focal length is f.

197
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,020
Let's call that f.

198
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,450
f squared plus b squared is
going to be equal to the

199
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,060
hypotenuse squared, which
in this case is d2 or a.

200
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,890
Which is equal to a squared.

201
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,870
And now we have a nice
equation in terms of b and a.

202
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,070
We know what b and a are,
from the equation we were

203
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,160
given for this ellipse.

204
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,820
So let's solve for
the focal length.

205
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,760
The focal length, f squared,
is equal to a squared

206
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,360
minus b squared.

207
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,870
So, f, the focal length, is
going to be equal to the

208
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,020
square root of a squared
minus d squared.

209
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,490
Pretty neat and clean, and
a pretty intuitive way to

210
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,250
think about something.

211
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,520
So you just literally take
the difference of these two

212
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,520
numbers, whichever is larger,
or whichever is smaller you

213
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,340
subtract from the other one.

214
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,140
You take the square root, and
that's the focal distance.

215
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,840
Now, let's see if we can use
that to apply it to some some

216
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,290
real problems where they might
ask you, hey, find

217
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:21,930
the focal length.

218
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,930
Or find the coordinates
of the focuses.

219
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:34,820
So let's add the equation x
minus 1 squared over 9 plus

220
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:42,530
y plus 2 squared over
4 is equal to 1.

221
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,810
So let's just graph
this first of all.

222
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,410
This could be interesting.

223
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,770
So I'll draw the axes.

224
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,320
That's the x-axis.

225
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,790
This is the y-axis.

226
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,890
And we immediately see,
what's the center of this?

227
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,730
The center is going to be at
the point 1, negative 2.

228
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,230
And if that's confusing, you
might want to review some

229
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,740
of the previous videos.

230
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,440
Center's at 1, x is equal to 1.

231
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,560
y is equal to minus 2.

232
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,970
That's the center.

233
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,330
And then, the major axis is the
x-axis, because this is larger.

234
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,050
And so, b squared is -- or
a squared, is equal to 9.

235
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,870
And the semi-minor radius
is going to be equal to 3.

236
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,230
So, if you go 1, 2, 3.

237
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,750
   

238
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,270
Go there.

239
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,940
Than you have 1, 2, 3.

240
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,510
No.

241
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,240
1, 2, 3.

242
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,820
1, 2, 3.

243
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,701
I think this -- let's see.

244
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,530
1, 2, 3.

245
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,130
You go there, roughly.

246
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,010
And then in the y direction,
the semi-minor radius is

247
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,110
going to be 2, right?

248
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,430
The square root of that.

249
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,670
So b is equal to 2.

250
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,440
So you go up 2, then
you go down 2.

251
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,110
And this ellipse is going
to look something like

252
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,050
-- pick a good color.

253
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,750
It's going to look
something like this.

254
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,590
And what we want to do is,
we want to find out the

255
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,830
coordinates of the
focal points.

256
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,220
So, the focal points
are going to sit along

257
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,970
the semi-major axis.

258
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,920
And we need to figure out
these focal distances.

259
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,690
And then we can essentially
just add and subtract

260
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,860
them from the center.

261
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,430
And then we'll have
the coordinates.

262
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,260
What we just showed you, or
hopefully I showed you, that

263
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,420
the the focal length or this
distance, f, the focal length

264
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,670
is just equal to the square
root of the difference between

265
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,750
these two numbers, right?

266
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,660
It's just the square
root of 9 minus 4.

267
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,660
So the focal length is equal
to the square root of 5.

268
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,540
So, if this point right here is
the point, and we already

269
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,920
showed that, this is the point
-- the center of the ellipse

270
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,930
is the point 1, minus 2.

271
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,470
The coordinate of this focus
right there is going to be 1

272
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,970
plus the square root
of 5, minus 2.

273
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,440
And the coordinate of this
focus right there is going

274
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,630
to be 1 minus the square
root of 5, minus 2.

275
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,650
And all I did is, I took the
focal length and I subtracted

276
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,510
-- since we're along the major
axes, or the x axis, I just add

277
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,420
and subtract this from the x
coordinate to get these two

278
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,670
coordinates right there.

279
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,840
So, anyway, this is the really
neat thing about conic

280
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,240
sections, is they have these
interesting properties in

281
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,230
relation to these foci or in
relation to these focus points.

282
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,140
And in future videos I'll show
you the foci of a hyperbola or

283
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,820
the the foci of a -- well, it
only has one focus

284
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,440
of a parabola.

285
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,340
But this is really starting
to get into what makes

286
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,350
conic sections neat.

287
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,740
Everything we've done up to
this point has been much more

288
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,230
about the mechanics of graphing
and plotting and figuring out

289
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,350
the centers of conic sections.

290
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,700
But now we're getting into
a little bit of the the

291
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,340
mathematical interesting
parts of conic sections.

292
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:46,900
Anyway.

293
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,770
See you in the next video.
