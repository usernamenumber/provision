1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,400
Let's say we have
100 light bulbs.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,980
Well, let me actually
just draw them.

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,860
So I have one light
bulb there.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,100
I have another light bulb.

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,760
And I have 100 of them.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,490
100 light bulbs.

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,380
And what I'm going to do is--
Well actually, before I even

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,290
start turning these light bulbs
on and off, let me let

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,260
you know that they
are all off.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,520
So they start off.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,440
   

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,110
Now, the next thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to number

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,110
the hundred light bulbs.

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,590
I'm going to number them
one through 100.

16
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,750
So the first light bulb
is light bulb one.

17
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,780
The second light bulb
is light bulb two.

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,610
All the way to light bulb 100.

19
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,250
And what I'm going to do is,
first I'm going to go and I'm

20
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:53,810
going to switch essentially
every light bulb.

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,210
So if they all start off, I'm
going to turn them all on.

22
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,690
So let me do it.

23
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,110
So on my first pass-- let's
call this pass one-- so in

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,810
pass one, I'm going to
turn all of these on.

25
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,750
On, on, on.

26
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,240
They're all going
to be turned on.

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,130
On.

28
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,430
And then in pass two, what I'm
going to do is I'm going to

29
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,820
switch only every other
light bulb.

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,430
So, for example I'll say, OK, I
won't switch light bulb one.

31
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,470
I'll only switch
light bulb two.

32
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,680
So light bulb one
will stay on.

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,220
Light bulb two will be off.

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,910
Light bulb three will be on.

35
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,180
Light bulb four will be off.

36
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,770
And so essentially, every light
bulb-- if you look at

37
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,500
their numbers-- that
is a multiple of

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,010
two, will be switched.

39
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,720
So 100 will be switched,
so that'll also be off.

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,920
Then I'm going to come-- and
ignore this right here-- and

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,530
I'm going to switch every
third light bulb.

42
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,990
So what's going to happen?

43
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,120
This one's going to-- let me
switch colors arbitrarily--

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,850
this one's going to stay on.

45
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,330
This one's going to stay off.

46
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,320
And I'm going to switch
the third light bulb.

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,720
So this one was on.

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,710
Now this one will be off.

49
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,510
The fourth light bulb will
stay off, because I'm not

50
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,370
touching it.

51
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,680
The fifth light bulb
would have been on

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,890
and it'll stay on.

53
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,510
Now the sixth light bulb, in
this case we switched it off,

54
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,530
and now it'll be on again.

55
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,690
But I think you get the point.

56
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,330
Every third light bulb, or if we
look at the numbers of the

57
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,930
light bulb, every numbered light
bulb would that is a

58
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,700
multiple of three is going
to be switched.

59
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,320
And if it was a multiple of
three and two, it would have

60
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,020
been switched on the
first time and then

61
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,020
off the second time.

62
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,660
But I think you're getting
the point.

63
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,240
But what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to do 100 passes.

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,830
So the first pass, I switch
every light bulb.

65
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,360
They all started off,
so they're all going

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,700
to be turned on.

67
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,750
The second pass, I switch every
other light bulb or

68
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,110
every second light bulb.

69
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,960
The third pass, I do every
third one, or that's a

70
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,630
multiple of three.

71
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:16,130
And my question to you is, after
100 passes, how many

72
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,780
light bulbs are still on?

73
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,165
Or how many are on, period?

74
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:26,640
   

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,090
And that is the brain teaser?

76
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,220
How do you figure out, of
the hundred, which ones

77
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,020
are going to be on?

78
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,340
You should be able to do
this in your head.

79
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,890
You don't have to make an Excel
spreadsheet and actually

80
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,200
do all the on and
off switches.

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,260
So the first question is, how
many of these are going to be

82
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,850
on after I do 100 passes?

83
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,110
And just to make it clear,
what's the 100th

84
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,050
path going to be?

85
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,080
Well, I'm only going to switch
every 100th light bulb.

86
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,630
So whatever this light bulb was
already doing, I'm just

87
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,360
going to switch it.

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,140
If it was off, it'll come on.

89
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,770
If it was on, it'll
become off.

90
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,200
So the first question is, how
many of these are going to be

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,450
on after 100 passes?

92
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,080
And then the bonus question
is, which of these

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,710
are going to be on?

94
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,100
And so that's the question.

95
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,980
Pause it if you don't
want the answer.

96
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,960
And then try to solve it.

97
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,850
I think it shouldn't take
you too much time.

98
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,450
But now I'm going to give
you the answer.

99
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,160
Or maybe I'll start with
a couple of hints.

100
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,050
So, when do we know that a light
bulb is being switched?

101
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,380
So if I'm on the second
pass, I will-- I don't

102
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,030
want to say turn on.

103
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,770
It might already be on.

104
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,190
I will switch every light bulb
that's divisible by two.

105
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,875
And then if I'm on the third
pass, I'll switch every light

106
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,640
bulb that's divisible
by three.

107
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,220
So on every pass,
what am I doing?

108
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:45,210
If I'm on pass n-- this
is a hint if you want

109
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,340
it-- what do I know?

110
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,880
I know all the light bulbs that
are numbered where n is a

111
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,480
factor of that light bulb,
that will get switched.

112
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:11,380
So we know that switched
if n is a factor of

113
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,620
the light bulb number.

114
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,020
   

115
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,240
And that's just a fancy way of
saying, look, if I'm on pass

116
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,320
17, I'm going to switch all
the multiples of 17.

117
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,920
Or I could say, I know that I'm
going to switch light bulb

118
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,300
51, because 17 is
a factor of 51.

119
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,750
So that tells you that we're
always going to be switching

120
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,960
one of these light bulbs on
or off when one of its

121
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,930
factors is our pass.

122
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:51,400
So for example, if we're looking
at light bulb eight.

123
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,930
This is light bulb eight.

124
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,340
So when will it be switched?

125
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,153
So on pass one, we're
definitely going

126
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:56,660
to switch it on.

127
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,660
So pass one, it's going
to be switched on.

128
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,690
Pass two, it'll be
switched off.

129
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,640
I know that because two is
divisible into eight.

130
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,740
Pass three, nothing's
going to happen.

131
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,270
On pass three, nothing's going
to happen because this isn't a

132
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,710
multiple of three.

133
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,660
Pass four, what'll happen?

134
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,480
It will be switched.

135
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,720
It'll be switched back on.

136
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,950
And then pass eight is the next
time we'll touch this

137
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,680
light bulb, and it'll
be switched back.

138
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,510
So every time one of its factors
go by, we're going to

139
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,800
switch this thing.

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,630
And as you can see, in order
for it to be on at the end,

141
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,150
you have to have an odd
number of factors.

142
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,200
So that's an interesting
thing.

143
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:47,920
So in order for a light bulb to
be on, it has to have odd

144
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,036
number of factors.

145
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,850
Now that's an interesting
question.

146
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,740
What numbers have an odd
number of factors.

147
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,210
And this is something that I
think they should teach you in

148
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,820
grade school, and
they never do.

149
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,230
But it's a really interesting
kind of number theory.

150
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,540
It's a simple one, but it's
interesting to think about.

151
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,160
So what numbers are true?

152
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,310
Let's do all the factors for
some of the starting numbers.

153
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,030
So all the factors of one.

154
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,290
Well one, the only factor
is just one.

155
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,200
So one works?

156
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,190
One has an odd number
of factors.

157
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,190
So that means that one
will remain on.

158
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,400
Because you're only going to
turn it on in the first pass.

159
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,930
Makes sense.

160
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,750
Two.

161
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,860
What are all the
factors of two.

162
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,040
Well you have one and two.

163
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,470
So two has an even number.

164
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,740
You're going to switch it on the
first time, then off the

165
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,280
second time.

166
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,360
Then you're never going
to touch it again.

167
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,060
So this is going to stay off.

168
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,980
Three.

169
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,300
Your factors are
one and three.

170
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,250
Four.

171
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,780
Your factors are one,
two and four.

172
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,670
Interesting.

173
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,000
Here we have three factors.

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,040
We have an odd number
of factors.

175
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,380
So four is going to stay on.

176
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,770
We're going to turn it on in our
first pass, we're going to

177
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,530
turn it off on our
second pass.

178
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,960
And we're going to turn it on
again in our fourth pass.

179
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,660
Let's keep going.

180
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,622
So five.

181
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:05,290
The factors of five
are one and five.

182
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:05,770
Six.

183
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,210
The factors are one,
two, three and six.

184
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,540
It's an even number, so they're
going to be off when

185
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,790
we're done with it.

186
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,360
Seven.

187
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,340
it's one and seven.

188
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:14,850
Eight.

189
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,620
We just did that.

190
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,790
It's one, two, four and eight.

191
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,310
Still going to be off.

192
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,860
Nine.

193
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,190
Let's see.

194
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,800
Nine.

195
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,450
The factors are one,
three and nine.

196
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,090
Interesting.

197
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,700
Once again we have an odd
number of factors.

198
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,880
So the light bulb number nine
is also going to be on when

199
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,230
everything's done.

200
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,400
Let's keep going.

201
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,830
I don't know, I actually did
this at our mental boot camp

202
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,419
with some of the kids.

203
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,200
And they immediately said,
the distance between

204
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,380
one and four is three.

205
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,870
The distance between four
and nine is five.

206
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,810
And maybe the distance between
nine and the next number is

207
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,500
going to be seven.

208
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,260
It increases by odd numbers.

209
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,110
What's nine plus seven?

210
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,890
Let's just try that out.

211
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,060
16.

212
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,940
What are the factors of 16?

213
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,640
They're one, two, four,
eight and 16.

214
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,100
Interesting.

215
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,870
That worked, right?

216
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,430
From nine to 16, you incremented
by seven.

217
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,220
From four to nine, you
incremented by five.

218
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,530
So it seems like we
have a pattern.

219
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,080
But can you see something even
more interesting about the

220
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,960
numbers one, four,
nine and 16.

221
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,770
And you could try all the
numbers between nine and 16,

222
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,380
and you'll see that they have
an even number of factors.

223
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,030
But what's interesting about
all of these numbers?

224
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,830
Why do they have an odd
number of factors?

225
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,720
In all of these other cases,
every factor is paired with

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,450
another number.

227
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,920
One times two is two.

228
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,770
One time six is six.

229
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,850
Two times three is six.

230
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,990
There's always a pair.

231
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,360
Except for these numbers.

232
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,670
There's no pair.

233
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,530
Why isn't there?

234
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,740
One times four is four.

235
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,650
But two times two
is also four.

236
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,860
So we only write the two once.

237
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,560
Three times three is nine.

238
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,480
Four times four is 16.

239
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,730
So all the lights that are going
to be on are actually

240
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,890
perfect squares.

241
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,040
That's why they have an
odd number of factors.

242
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,810
So what's our question?

243
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,300
So this problem of what light
bulbs are going to be on,

244
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,170
boils down to how many perfect
squares are there

245
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,760
between one and 100?

246
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,580
And you could just
list them out.

247
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,950
And you could say, oh well
the perfect squares are

248
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,070
one, four, nine, 16.

249
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,430
And you could try to
think of them all.

250
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,680
Or you could say, well how many
numbers can I square and

251
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,890
get a number less than
or equal to 100?

252
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,270
Well 100 is equal
to 10 squared.

253
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,120
So you can only square the
numbers between one and 10 to

254
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,220
get a perfect square.

255
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,130
So there's only 10 perfect
squares between one and 100.

256
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,010
Hopefully you didn't lose that,
but if that confuses

257
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,180
you, just list them all out.

258
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,780
Given that 100 is the largest
number, it's the whole largest

259
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,470
perfect square there.

260
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,330
And that's 10 squared.

261
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,370
The only other perfect squares
in our range we're talking

262
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,160
about are one squared, two
squared, three squared, all

263
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,950
the way up to 10 squared.

264
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,600
And we could do that.

265
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,290
Four squared is 16.

266
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,270
Five squared is 25.

267
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:08,250
36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.

268
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,290
So the light bulbs with these
numbers on it are the ones

269
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,670
that will stay lit when
they're all done.

270
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,150
Anyway, hope you enjoyed that.
