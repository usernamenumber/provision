1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:08,667
Everything in human experience, and really human history or human civilizations experience, is that everything

2
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:15,933
seems to fall to the earth, that if you have water particles, they don't just float up.

3
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:16,433
If they are small enough they are being held up by the wind and all that, but if they are large enough, they will fall.

4
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:25,733
That you don't have people that are able to just float around, they will fall.

5
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:28,400
You don't have taxi cabs that float around, they'll fall.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,467
Not only will the water fall, it will hit the ground, it will puddle up, and if there is a gutter it

7
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:38,200
will fall into the gutter. It is just trying to get lower and lower and lower.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,733
If i were to drop a bunch of needles they would just fall. They don't... If i had a needle at rest here

9
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:49,333
it doesn't just automatically for no reason jump and fly upwards and start to float.

10
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:53,667
And so it is just a thing that is fundamental to everything that we have ever

11
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,933
ever experienced.

12
00:00:55,933 --> 00:01:03,333
And so, for most of human history or human civilization, we just accepted it as a given.

13
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:10,133
We thought, "well look it's just obvious, everything should just fall down, that's just the way the universe is.

14
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:18,933
To think otherwise would just be crazy." And that's why this guy, this guy right over here, is one of the greatest geniuses

15
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:21,600
of all time. He did many more things than just the things I am going to describe in this video,

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,867
and any one of those things would have earned him his place in history.

17
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:31,667
And this, as you may already know, is Isaac Newton.

18
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:38,467
Easily one of the top five minds in all of human history. So a pretty fascinating dude.

19
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:43,236
And one of his big insights about this 'things falling down' problem is:

20
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,041
Do they have to fall down?

21
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:49,467
Is this just something we should assume about the universe?

22
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:58,133
Things just need to fall down, he said, or we were told he said that he was somewhat inspired by

23
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:05,000
observing an apple falling from a tree. It's probably not true that you'll see in some cartoons

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,923
on television that the apple hit his head or hit his head while he was sleeping and gave him the idea.

25
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:15,800
Most people were to see... Let me draw a tree here.

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:30,333
That's a twig right there, some leaves. So if most people... So that is an apple over here.

27
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:38,067
So if most people... If i were to snap this twig over here, the apple would fall. Pretty much common sense. The apple would fall.

28
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:44,067
And if most people were to see that, they would just think it's a normal happening in the universe. But for Isaac Newton, at least on that day,

29
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:50,600
he asked himself, "Why? Why did that apple fall?"

30
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,267
And this, to some degree, is a great example of "out of the box" thinking, because something

31
00:02:54,267 --> 00:03:00,133
for thousands of years or tens of thousands of years human beings had taken for granted, just

32
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:03,733
because that's the way it always was. He actually asked the question why?

33
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:07,067
Does it always have to be that way?

34
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:11,933
And that question took him down a entire line of reasoning that set up the basis for all of

35
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:15,867
classical mechanics for the most part we still use today.

36
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:20,733
It has been tweaked a good bit by this gentleman in the last hundred years. [Albert Einstein]

37
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:26,067
But for most purposes, when we're engineering things on the surface of the planet,

38
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:35,745
and we are not going close to the speed of light, we can still use the mathematics that Isaac Newton came up with from this simple question.

39
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:39,939
And not only was he able to kind of think that there's something...

40
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:42,912
There's something that might be pulling, somehow,

41
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:45,930
acting on this apple, bringing it to the earth.

42
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,599
But he actually formulated an entire, an entire.. I guess

43
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,943
Law around this thing. So, as you can imagine,

44
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:58,796
the thing that Isaac Newton believes brought the apple to the Earth

45
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:00,710
is gravity... is gravity.

46
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:05,311
And he formulated the universal Law of gravitation, or the law of universal gravitation; either way.

47
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:14,267
And in it, he theorizes that the forces between objects

48
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:17,733
now it's a vector quantity, it's always going to attract the two objects to each other.

49
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:23,800
So the direction is towards each other. The force of gravity between two objects...

50
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:33,000
is going to be equal to this this big G, which is really just a number, its a very small number.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,200
I'll give you that number in a second. It's equal to this constant, this gravitation constant.

52
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:49,133
Which is a super-duper small number, times the mass of the first object, times the mass of the second

53
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:57,800
object, divided by the distance between the two objects. Distance squared.

54
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:09,067
So this is distance between two objects.

55
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:14,333
So if you're talking about the force of gravity on Earth, this right over here...

56
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:21,800
You pick one of the masses to be Earth, so this mass over here. You pick one to be Earth.

57
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:29,200
This is the object on Earth. Maybe it's me. Then this is the distance between the center

58
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:38,933
of masses between those two objects. The center of me and center of the Earth.

59
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:42,467
So really it's from roughly the distance from the surface of the Earth or if I'm roughly

60
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:47,000
five foot-nine [inches tall] then about half of that distance to the center of the Earth

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,867
is this number right over here. So right when you see this, before we even talk about me and Earth,

62
00:05:54,867 --> 00:06:01,067
or needles and Earth, or taxi cabs and Earth and that force of gravity, you might have something

63
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:07,867
bizarre raising up in your brain. You might be saying, "the way gravity is defined

64
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:14,400
by Isaac Newton, this formula we're given right here, it's saying we have gravity between

65
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,867
any two objects" and you're saying, "Look, I'm looking at a computer screen right now,

66
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:30,200
so you're looking at a computer screen right now..." And let me draw an old school computer,

67
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,800
not a flat panel. How come your not attracted to the computer screen?

68
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,333
How come it doesn't fly into your face? And the answer there is, this number, this number is

69
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:52,600
really small. And there actually is some force of attraction between you and the computer.

70
00:06:52,600 --> 00:07:00,067
It's just that it's more than overcompensated for the friction between the computer and the desk,

71
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:06,067
the friction between you and your seat, which is frankly being caused by the force

72
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:12,067
between you and the Earth, the force of gravitation between the computer and the Earth.

73
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:17,333
That you and the computer have such small masses that you really can't notice it. It's really negligible.

74
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:23,533
It's being overpowered by other forces that are keeping the computer from even drifting

75
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:29,600
into your face or your face drifting into the computer. So just to get a sense of that...

76
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,000
This G, this big G,

77
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,733
this constant of proportionality, just to get a sense of how small it is... This is, and I'm going to round

78
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:50,667
it here, it's approximately 6.67 times 10 to the negative 11th Newtons.

79
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:53,667
And we'll talk about Newtons, it is the metric unit of force.

80
00:07:53,667 --> 00:08:09,200
Let me actually make sure I say this correctly. Newton meters per kilogram squared. Newton times meter per kilogram, squared.

81
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,400
It's this strange set of units here, but the units are really there. So when you multiply by two masses,

82
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,400
which are in kilograms, and divide by a distance, which is in meters, you'll end up with Newtons.

83
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,933
But I want to make it clear that this is a super small number.

84
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:29,000
Ten to the negative 11th. If I were to just write 10 to the negative 11th, it would be 0.0 and

85
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:46,133
then we would have eleven 0's. So this number right here is the same as 6.67 times

86
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:54,333
this thing over here. So this is a super small number. And that is why if you multipy it by not so

87
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,733
large numbers, if you don't use Earth, if you use yourself and a computer,

88
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:04,667
you're going to end up still with a super duper small force. Something so small that you won't

89
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:08,133
notice it. It is going to be overpowered by other forces, so these things don't fly into each other.

90
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:14,267
But when you think about really massive bodies, like the Earth, the force of gravity

91
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:19,600
starts to become noticeable, very noticeable. And I'm not going to give you the mass of Earth in this

92
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,733
video, you can look it up yourself. But if you put in the mass of Earth right over here,

93
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:30,933
if you put it in right over there, and if you put in roughly the distance from the surface

94
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:37,933
of the Earth to the center of the Earth for R, and you multiply that by G. All of these terms over here...

95
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:44,600
So this term, if you multiply that times that term and multiply by this term squared,

96
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:53,000
they simplify to what is sometimes called little g. Little g. So this right here, we can view that

97
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,400
as the gravitational field at the surface of Earth. It's also the same thing as the acceleration

98
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,933
of gravity at the surface of the Earth, and this, and once again I'm just going to round it

99
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:09,867
for the sake... This is... This comes out to be, units wise, 9.8 meters per second squared.

100
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:18,267
Then you're left with just the other mass. So times M1. So for simplicity, if something

101
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:28,000
is close to the surface of the Earth, the distance does matter. We can say that the force of

102
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,600
gravity can be this "little g" times whatever the mass is close to Earth. For example,

103
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:44,933
if you were to take me, and I weighed 70 kilograms... So, in the case of Sal, Sal has a...Actually I

104
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:51,400
shouldn't say weight, I have a mass of 70 kilograms. I have a mass of 70 kilograms.

105
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,667
Weight is actually a force, but we'll talk about that, clarify that more later.

106
00:10:55,667 --> 00:11:03,733
My mass is 70 kilograms, then we can figure out the force that the Earth is pulling down on me

107
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:10,733
which is actually my weight. So in this situation, the force is going to be g, which is 9.8 meters

108
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:27,400
per second squared, times my mass, which is 70 kilograms. And let me get my handy T85 calculator

109
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:42,067
out to figure this out. So I get 9.8 times 70. That gives me...686. So this is equal to 686

110
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:53,400
kilogram meters per second squared. OR this is the exact same thing as this thing right over here.

111
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:00,867
This IS the definition of a Newton. So this is a newton, which is appropriately named for

112
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:04,000
the guy that is the Father of All Classical Physics.

113
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So my weight on Earth, which is the same thing as the force that Earth is pulling down on me,

114
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:22,400
or that the gravitational attraction between the Earth and me is 686 newtons. Now I will ask you

115
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,333
an interesting question.

116
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:31,267
So here is Earth,

117
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,867
and I am not even a speck of a speck on Earth, but say for simplicity let's say

118
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:40,133
this is me, I'm hanging out in the Indian Ocean some place. So that is me.

119
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:49,267
And we already know that Earth is pulling down on me with a force of 686 newtons.

120
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:57,133
Now my question to you is, "Am I pulling on the Earth with any force? And am I pulling on the Earth with

121
00:12:57,133 --> 00:13:01,067
a larger or small force that is pulling on me?"

122
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:08,200
And your gut or your knee-jerk reaction might be: Earth is so huge, Sal is so tiny.

123
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,333
Clearly the Earth must be pulling with a greater force than Sal is pulling on the Earth.

124
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,800
Unfortunately that is NOT the case.

125
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:26,733
That I am. So the Earth is pulling on Sal with the force of 686 Newtons and Sal is also pulling on the

126
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:34,067
Earth with a force of 686 Newtons. So Sal is also pulling on the Earth. It makes me feel very powerful

127
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:39,333
with the force of 686 Newtons. But you might say, "Wait, that doesn't make sense, Sal."

128
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:47,733
If I have a building over here, and if you were to, let's say, jump from the building, you're going to start...

129
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:52,400
The force of gravity is going to be acting on you, and you're going to start accelerating downwards.

130
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,333
It doesn't seem that the Earth is accelerating up to you. Wouldn't we notice that, every time someone

131
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:03,067
were to jump off a building, that the Earth starting accelerating in a major way. And the way to think

132
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:06,867
about that is that the force is the SAME. And we'll talk about that in other videos.

133
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:17,400
Force is equal to mass times acceleration. So when we are talking about 686 Newtons, in terms of

134
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,400
the force of Earth, the gravitational attraction between myself and Earth. And this is going to be

135
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:30,467
68 kilograms, then this provides a pretty good acceleration on me. So in this case, if you

136
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:39,600
solve for A... Solve for A over here. You're going to get 9.8 meters per second squared. Now, if you

137
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,867
do the same thing for Earth... I already told you that we are pulling on each other with the same

138
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:49,867
force, 686 Newtons. Now if you want to find out how much is the Earth accelerating... That force

139
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:54,400
you're going to get a... I'm not even going to put it here. You're going to put a huge number

140
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:04,000
in here. Huge number times the acceleration of Earth towards me. And since this is such a huge number,

141
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,467
very very very large number, this is going to be an immeasurably small number, super small number.

142
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:16,133
And frankly it's probably averaged out by the acceleration of Earth, or the force of gravity

143
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:26,467
and all the other people and things on the surface of the planet. So it all averages out in the end.

144
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,800
But even if it didn't, it would be negligible, you wouldn't even notice the acceleration of Earth

145
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:36,533
towards me. But you would notice the acceleration of me towards Earth because of our vastly

146
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:41,867
different masses. Even though we have the same force of attraction.
