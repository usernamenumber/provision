1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,010
Hello.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,480
We are now gonna do some slope and y intercept problems as well.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,540
y-intercept problems as well.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,650
Let's get started.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,080
So let me make up a problem.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,310
Let's say we have the points two, five.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,780
The other point, let's make that negative three, negative three.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,400
Well, first let's just graph those two points.

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,760
I'm going to graph them in yellow.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,270
So two, five.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,920
Let's see that's one two.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,710
One, two, three, four, five.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,310
So two, five is going to be right over there.

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,300
OK.

15
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,070
And then let me graph negative three, negative three.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,510
So it's one, two, three.

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,250
One, two, three.

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,810
So negative three, negative three is right over there.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,740
And then now let me draw a line that will connect them.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,760
That's my new technique.

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,710
I draw it in two pieces.

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,780
I think that's good enough.

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,160
OK.

24
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,960
So let's see if we can at least first figure out the slope of

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,630
the line, and then if we have time we'll try to figure

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,460
out the y-intercept.

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,970
And then we'll know the whole equation for the line.

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,550
Let me pick a slightly thinner color, and we'll get started.

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,050
So the slope, if you saw the last module that just

30
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,040
introduces how we calculate the slope, that's

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,430
just rise over run.

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,720
Or, change in y over change in x.

33
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,830
This is y.

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,620
So let's just do that real fast.

35
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,470
So let's take this as our starting point.

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,420
So change in y could be five-- remember, y is the

37
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,930
second coordinate-- five minus negative three.

38
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,850
And that's this one.

39
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,190
Over-- now you do the change in x-- two minus, this

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
is also negative three.

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,350
Well five minus negative three, that's five plus plus three.

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,180
So that equals eight.

43
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,290
And then two minus negative three.

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,300
Once again that's two plus plus three, so that equals five.

45
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,520
So we figured out the slope of this equation.

46
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,060
It's eight / five.

47
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,630
And let's see if that makes sense.

48
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,270
Let's figure out what the rise and the run is.

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,150
If we were to start at this point right here, let's see how

50
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,740
much we have to rise to get to the same y-coordinate

51
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,930
as the other point.

52
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,390
So let's see.

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,470
We're here, and the other point is up here.

54
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,830
So let's figure out what this distance is.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,830
Actually, now is a good time to use the fat.

56
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,110
Oh man, I have a shaky hand.

57
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,520
OK.

58
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,780
Let's figure out what that distance is.

59
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,620
That distance is delta y, which is change in y.

60
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,410
So it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

61
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,160
That equals eight.

62
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,700
And that makes sense, because if you think about it

63
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,800
what did we just do?

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,120
We just took y equals five, which was up here, minus

65
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,210
y equals negative three.

66
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,420
And so obviously we just calculated that distance

67
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,230
just by looking at the two coordinates five minus negative three.

68
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,920
When you do this calculation it actually gives you

69
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,580
this distance right here.

70
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,990
So that's how we figure out how much we have to rise.

71
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,550
So now let's do the run.

72
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,160
Well the run, to go from this point to the other

73
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,280
point, we went this far.

74
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,290
And let's count how far that is.

75
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,870
Well, it's one, two, three, four, five units.

76
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,110
So we can say delta x is equal to five.

77
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,110
And that's exactly what we did. delta y over delta x was equal

78
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,810
to eight / five, or rise over run is equal to eight / five.

79
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,520
And it would have been the same thing if we calculated run here

80
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,290
or if we calculated rise here.

81
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,420
But it's the same thing.

82
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,640
Hope that's making sense to you.

83
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,020
And I hope that also makes sense that if the rise for a

84
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,760
given run becomes more, then the slope of the line is going

85
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,640
to become steeper and it'll become a bigger number.

86
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,370
So let's see what we have so far for the

87
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,480
equation of this line.

88
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,670
So so far we know the equation of this line is equal to, y is

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:31,700
equal to the slope eight / five x plus b.

90
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,730
So we're almost done.

91
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:39,380
We just have to figure out this b right here.

92
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,190
Now that b, just so you remember, that's

93
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,380
the y-intercept.

94
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,120
And that's where we intersect the y-axis.

95
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,180
And since this graph is pretty neat, we can actually inspect

96
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,510
it and see that, well, it looks like we're intersecting

97
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,440
the y-axis at two.

98
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,440
So my guess is we're going to come up with b equals two.

99
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,160
But let's solve it, just in case we didn't have this

100
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,010
neatly drawn graph here.

101
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,190
So how can we solve for b?

102
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,850
Well, we can substitute values that we know

103
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,300
that work for x and y.

104
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,270
Well either of these points are on that line, so we can

105
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,330
substitute them in for x and y.

106
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,300
So let's use the first one.

107
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,730
OK.

108
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:21,910
So the y we get five, will equal eight / five times x.

109
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,040
Well, x there is two.

110
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,670
Times two plus b.

111
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:37,070
Well, now we just get five is equal to sixteen / five plus b.

112
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:44,570
And then we get b equals-- well five is twenty-five / five, right?

113
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:53,070
five is twenty-five / five minus sixteen / five equals nine / five.

114
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,310
All right.

115
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,120
See, so I was actually wrong.

116
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,130
When I looked at this graph I said, oh that looks like

117
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,920
almost two, so yeah it's probably going to be two.

118
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,770
But when we actually did it using algebra, when we did it

119
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,000
analytically, we actually saw that b is equal to nine / five.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,320
So it's almost two.

121
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,470
9/5 is 1 and 4/5, or 1.8.

122
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,420
So that's almost two, but it actually turns

123
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,240
out that it's not.

124
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,610
It's at 1.8.

125
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,860
And I can write it down as a decimal.

126
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,290
1.8.

127
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,320
So the final equation for the line, I'm going to try to

128
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:26,190
squeeze it in at the bottom of this page, it's going to be y

129
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,280
is equal to-- well, we know the slope.

130
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,550
eight / five x.

131
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,000
Now we just add the y-intercept.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,850
Plus nine / five.

133
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,250
There.

134
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,730
We solved it.

135
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,380
Let's do another one.

136
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,190
And so-- that's nine / five.

137
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:43,820
I don't want to be too repetitive.

138
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,390
Let's do another problem.

139
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,910
Time to do another problem, and let me put that

140
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,260
graph back there again.

141
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,940
There you go.

142
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,410
All right.

143
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,170
I'm going to think of two random numbers again.

144
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,410
Let me try to do this fast, because YouTube puts a

145
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,600
ten minute limit on me.

146
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,880
So let's say I had the points two, negative three.

147
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,880
And I had the point negative four, five.

148
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,230
So two, negative three.

149
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,260
Let's plot that sucker real fast.

150
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,800
So x is two, so it's here.

151
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,680
And the negative three.

152
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,110
One, two, three.

153
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,500
So two, negative three is there.

154
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,060
And negative four, five.

155
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,130
So that's one, two, three, four.

156
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,170
One, two, three, four, five.

157
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,180
I have to count like this because this

158
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,550
graph is unlabeled.

159
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,720
But if we actually were to draw in the coordinates you would

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,740
that see this is five, and this is negative four, and so on.

161
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,450
And this is two, and this is negative three.

162
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,760
And now let's just draw a line.

163
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,860
Let's draw it right there with my shaky hand.

164
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,460
OK.

165
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,020
There you go.

166
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,840
Good line.

167
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,470
And another good line.

168
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:03,950
All right.

169
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,900
So first we need to figure out the slope.

170
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,230
Well we could just do that doing the algebra.

171
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,750
So its slope is just delta-- I'm still using the line tool

172
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,250
again-- delta y over delta x.

173
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,720
Change in y over change in x.

174
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,610
Let's take this y as the first point now.

175
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,450
So we'll say five minus this y, negative three.

176
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,910
Over-- now since we used the five first we have to use the

177
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,380
negative four first as well.

178
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,350
Negative four minus two.

179
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,980
Well five minus negative three, that equals eight.

180
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,300
And negative four minus two, well that equals negative six.

181
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,070
And negative eight / six, well that equals-- they're

182
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,200
both divisible by two.

183
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,070
So that equals minus four / three.

184
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,730
And let's see, does that make sense as the slope?

185
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,300
Well, if we were to go down four from this point.

186
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,650
So if the rise was negative four-- one, two, three, four.

187
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,620
So if we go down-- woops, I'm using white.

188
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,040
So that's why you can't see it.

189
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,930
We go down by four here, and then we go to the right

190
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,340
three, positive three.

191
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,580
We still end up on the line.

192
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,190
So it works.

193
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,940
Looks good to me.

194
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,590
Let's see if I can solve the y-intercept in thirty seconds.

195
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,160
Otherwise, I'll start it on the next module.

196
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,960
So we get y is equal to minus four / three x, plus b.

197
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,150
And actually what we'll do is we'll leave off here, and I'm

198
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,520
going to solve for b-- and you could try to do it on your

199
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,980
own-- in the next installment of this presentation.
