1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,460
I'm going to do a quick argument or proof, as to why the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.

2
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:12,252
So remember, a rhombus is just a parallelogram, where all four sides are equal.

3
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:17,918
In fact, if all four sides are equal, it has to be a parallelogram. Just to make things clear,

4
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:22,668
some rhombuses are squares, but not all of them, because you could have a rhombus like this,

5
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:29,231
that comes in where the angles aren't 90°. But squares are rhombuses, because all squares

6
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:34,071
they have 90° angles, that's not what makes them a rhombus, but all of the sides are equal.

7
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:39,502
So all squares are rhombuses, but not all rhombuses are squares. Now, with that said,

8
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:43,940
let's think about the diagonals of a rhombus, to think about that a little bit clearer,

9
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,056
I'm going to draw the dia- I'm going to draw the rhombus really as kind of,

10
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:50,448
I'm going to rotate it a little bit, so it looks a little bit like a diamond shape.

11
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:56,687
But notice, I'm not really changing the properties of the rhombus, I'm just changing

12
00:00:56,687 --> 00:01:01,033
its orientation a little bit. I'm just changing its orientation.

13
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,940
So, a rhombus, by definition, the four sides are going to be equal. Now, let me draw one of its

14
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:10,965
diagonals, and the way I drew it right here is kind of a diamond.

15
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:15,480
One of its diagonals will be right along the horizontal, right like that.

16
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:19,776
Now this triangle on the top and the triangle on the bottom both share this side.

17
00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:23,406
So that side is obviously is going to be the same length for both of these triangles.

18
00:01:23,537 --> 00:01:28,299
In the other two sides of the triangles are also the same thing, they're sides of the actual rhombus.

19
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:32,991
So all three sides of this top triangle and the bottom triangle are the same.

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,637
So this top triangle and this bottom triangle are congruent.

21
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,283
They are congruent triangles. If you go back to your 9th grade Geometry unit, you'd use

22
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:48,013
the Side-Side-Side (SSS) theorem: if three sides are congruent, then the triangles themselves are congruent.

23
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:53,960
That also means all of the angles in the triangle are congruent. So the angle that is opposite this side,

24
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,060
this shared side, right over here will be congruent to the corresponding angle in the other triangle.

25
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,990
The angle opposite this side would be the same thing as that. Now, both of these triangles are also

26
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:13,052
isosceles triangles, so their base angles are going to be the same. So that's one base

27
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:17,290
angle, that's the other base angle. This is an upside down isosceles triangle,

28
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:23,113
this is a right-side-up one. And so, if these two are the same then these are also going to be the same.

29
00:02:23,113 --> 00:02:26,567
They are going to be the same to each other, because this is an isosceles triangle.

30
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:30,960
And, they're also going to be the same to these other characters, down here, because these are

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,138
congruent triangles. Now, if we take an altitude... No, actually I don't have to talk about that

32
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:42,846
since, I don't think that will be relevant when we actually prove what we want to prove.

33
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:50,077
If we take an altitude from each of these vertices, down to this side, so an altitude by definition.

34
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:58,862
An altitude by definition is going to be perpendicular down here. Now, an isosceles triangle is perfectly

35
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:05,269
symmetrical. If you drop an altitude from the the top, or the unique angle, or the unique vertex

36
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:11,800
in an isosceles triangle you will split it into two symmetric right triangles. Two right triangles

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:21,785
that are essentially the mirror images of each other. You will also bisect the opposite side.

38
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:26,518
This altitude is, in fact, a median of the triangle. Now, we could do it on the other side,

39
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:37,518
the same exact thing is going to happen. We are bisecting this side over here, this is a right angle.

40
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:42,881
And so essentially, the combination of these two altitudes is really just a diagonal of

41
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:47,789
this rhombus, and it's at a right angle to the other diagonal of the rhombus.

42
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:53,593
And it bisects that other diagonal of the rhombus. We can make the exact same argument over here.

43
00:03:53,593 --> 00:04:02,654
You could think of an isosceles triangle, over here. This is an altitude of it, it splits it into

44
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:08,920
two symmetric right triangles, it bisects the opposite side, it's essentially a median of that triangle.

45
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:16,436
Any isosceles triangle, of that side equal to that side, if you drop an altitude, these two triangles are

46
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:23,261
going to be symmetric, and you will have bisected the opposite side. So, by the same argument, that side

47
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:30,326
is equal to that side. So the two diagonals of any rhombus are perpendicular to each other

48
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:36,795
and they bisect each other. Anyway, hopefully you found that useful.
