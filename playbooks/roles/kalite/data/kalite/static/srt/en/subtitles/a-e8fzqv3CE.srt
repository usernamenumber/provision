00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,977
While I'm working on some more ambitious projects, I wanted to quickly comment

2
00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:05,657
on a couple 'mathy' things that have been floathing around the internet

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,173
just so you know I'm still alive.

4
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,511
So there's this video that's been floathing around about how to multiply visually like this:

5
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:14,823
Pick two numbers, let's say: 12 times 31...and then you draw these lines:

6
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:18,813
one, two...three, one. Then you start counting the intersections.

7
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,616
One, two, three on the left. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven in the middle.

8
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:23,746
One, two on the right.

9
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:26,731
Put them together: three-seven-two. There's your answer. Magic, right?

10
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,554
But one of the delightful things about mathematics is that

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,438
there's often more than one way to solve a problem

12
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:33,446
and sometimes these methods look entirely different

13
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:36,693
but because they do the same thing they must be connected somehow

14
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:39,253
and in this case, there're not so different at all.

15
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:41,574
Let me demonstrate this visual method again.

16
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,104
This time let's do 97 times 86.

17
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:49,121
So we draw our nine lines and seven lines times eight lines and six lines.

18
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:51,304
Now all we have to do is count the intersections.

19
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:54,975
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... Okay wait!

20
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:55,583
This is boring!

21
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:57,175
How about instead of counting all the dots

22
00:00:57,175 --> 00:00:59,075
we just figure out how many intersections there are.

23
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:01,614
Let's see: there's seven going one way and six going the other.

24
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:04,639
Hey, that's just six times seven which is...Huh!

25
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:09,442
Forget everything I ever said about learning a certain amount of memorization in mathematics being useful

26
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:11,326
at least at an elementary school level,

27
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:14,011
because apparently I've been faking my way through being a mathematician

28
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:16,271
without having memorized six times seven

29
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:19,380
and now I'm going to have to figure out five times seven

30
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:25,717
which is... [mumbling] ...so that's 35 and then add the sixth 7 to get 42.

31
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:27,324
Wow! I really should have known that one.

32
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:31,691
Okay, but the point is that this method breaks down the 'two digit' multiplication problem

33
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,139
into four 'one digit' multiplication problems

34
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:37,097
and if you do have your multiplication table memorized

35
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,479
you can easily figure out the answers.

36
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,163
And just like these three numbers became the ones, tens, and hundreds place

37
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:46,907
of the answer, these do to. Ones. Tens. Hundreds.

38
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:48,761
You add them all up and: voilÃ¡!

39
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:52,199
Which is exactly the same kind of breaking down into single digit multiplication

40
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,722
and adding that you do doing the old boring method.

41
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:57,064
The whole point is just to multiply every pair of digits,

42
00:01:57,064 --> 00:01:59,087
make sure you've got the proper number of zeros on the end,

43
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,512
and add them all up. But of course seeing what you're actually doing is

44
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:05,837
multiplying every possible pair is not something your teachers want you to realize

45
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:07,891
or else you might remember the 'every combinations' concept

46
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,889
when you get to multiplying binomials and it might make it too easy.

47
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,966
In the end, all of these methods of multiplication distract from what multiplication really is.

48
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,158
Which for 12 times 31, is this.

49
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:21,268
All the rest is just breaking it down into well organized chunks

50
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:25,692
Saying, well: 10 times 30 is this. 10 times 1 is this. 30 times 2 is that.

51
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:29,121
And 2 times 1 is that. Add them all up, and you get the total area.

52
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:31,674
Don't let notation get in the way of your understanding.

53
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,513
Speaking of notation...

54
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:37,054
This infuriating bit of nonsense has been circulating around recently.

55
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:39,352
And that there has been so much discussion of it is a sign

56
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,913
that we've been trained to care about notation way too much.

57
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,441
Do you multiply here first? Or divide here first?

58
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:47,739
The answer is that: This is a badly formed sentence.

59
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,056
It's like saying: "I would like some juice or water with ice."

60
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:54,233
Do you mean you'd like either juice with no ice? Or water with ice?

61
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:57,362
Or do you mean that you'd like either juice with ice or water with ice?

62
00:02:57,362 --> 00:03:00,433
You can make claims about conventions of what's right or wrong

63
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,472
but really the burden is on the author of the sentence

64
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:04,387
to put in some commas and make things clear.

65
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:06,581
Mathematicians do this by adding parentheses

66
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:08,481
and avoiding this divided by sign.

67
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:11,479
Math is not marks on a page.

68
00:03:11,602 --> 00:03:13,656
The mathematics is in what those marks represent.

69
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:16,444
You can make up any rules you want about stuff

70
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:17,975
as long as you're consistent with them.

71
00:03:17,991 --> 99:59:59,999
The end.
