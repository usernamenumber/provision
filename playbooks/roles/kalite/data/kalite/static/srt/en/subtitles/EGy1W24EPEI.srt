1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,894
Let's add these two mixed numbers

2
00:00:02,894 --> 00:00:05,681
two and five thirteenths plus seven and six thirteenths

3
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:07,995
and the way I like to think about it in my head,

4
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:13,492
I like to separate out the mixed numbers in to the whole number component and the fractional component

5
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:16,222
so we can rewrite two and five thirteenths as,

6
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:21,531
two plus five over thirteen

7
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:25,882
and then, we can write that plus,

8
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:29,547
then seven and six thirteenths we can rewrite as

9
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:33,129
plus seven plus six thirteenths

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,514
so all I did is I rewrote this and

11
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:44,134
essentially expanded out, I broke up the mixed numbers in to their whole number parts and their fractional parts

12
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:47,271
and then what I like to do is I like to add the whole number parts

13
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:55,750
so this two plus this seven, so I'll do the two plus seven over here...

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,621
I'll add those up, and to that I will add the fractional parts

15
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:02,602
so to that, I will add the five thirteenths

16
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:05,919
to the six thirteenths

17
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:08,521
so if we add the whole number parts

18
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:11,338
two plus seven is nine

19
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:15,259
and the fractional parts, already having the same denominator

20
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:19,050
five thirteenths plus six thirteenths

21
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,346
your going to get eleven thirteenths, five plus six is eleven

22
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:27,682
so you get nine plus eleven thirteenths

23
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:32,581
well that's just the same thing as nine and eleven thirteenths

24
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:35,000
and we are done!
