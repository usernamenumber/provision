1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,527
I want to do a quick primer on refraction.

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,750
And our focus here is going to be on seismic waves.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,799
But the principal of how things refract

4
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:12,288
when they go from a fast to a slow medium or a slow to a fast medium,

5
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,558
It`s actually the same as you would see

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,415
when you're studying ligth waves or any type of wave.

7
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,448
So let's think about it a little bit.

8
00:00:20,448 --> 00:00:24,407
Let&#x27;s say I have a slow medium rigth over here

9
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:29,026
and let&#x27;s say I have a fast medium over here.

10
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:33,316
So that we can travel thorugh both solid and liquid, let&#x27;s think about maybe P-waves,

11
00:00:33,316 --> 00:00:36,679
and a slow medium could be maybe some type of liquid

12
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:40,322
and our fast medium could be some type of solid.

13
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:43,370
So let me draw the boundary right over here.

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,286
And let's say, so if I have something that cut off a P-wave,

15
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:50,396
a P-wave, let's say it going through the water

16
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:53,045
and going right perpendicularly to the boundary,

17
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,584
it will then just continue to travel

18
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:57,718
in the faster medium in the same direction.

19
00:00:57,718 --> 00:01:00,586
Going right if it goes right at the boundary.

20
00:01:00,586 --> 00:01:04,632
If it goes right at the boundary, it`ll just travel faster in the faster medium.

21
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:07,369
And that's because that faster medium is going to be more dense

22
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:09,936
and the molecules are going to bump into each other faster.

23
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,129
In the same amount of time more molucules kind of

24
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:16,216
a chain reaction is going to travel further because they are more closely packed

25
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:19,456
and they rebound faster than it would in the slow medium.

26
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:21,800
So obviusly no refraction is going on.

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,267
It has not been deflected.

28
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,095
And just as a bit of a reminder.

29
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:29,507
In general, refraction is when a wave gets defelcted.

30
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,259
Reflection is when it bounces back,

31
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,528
refraction is when it gets deflected a little bit.

32
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,286
Let me just make that clear.

33
00:01:35,286 --> 00:01:37,463
So if I have some type of boundary here

34
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:39,841
and I have a wave that bounces off, that's reflection.

35
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:42,610
But if the wave goes through the boundary

36
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,837
and just gets bent a little, bit it's direction changes, that is refraction.

37
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:47,313
And that's what we are talking about.

38
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:50,381
So cleary so far this P-wave has not been refracted.

39
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:53,561
But if this P-wave comes in at an angle,

40
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:57,725
so let's make this P-Wave come in at an angle, what's going to happen is,

41
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:01,664
the way you should think about it is, the easiest way to think about which direction

42
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,894
it will be refracted or at least the way I think about it,

43
00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:08,117
is literally, I imagine some type of vehicle.

44
00:02:08,117 --> 00:02:12,912
Some type of vehicle with wheels on it. This is the top view of my vehicle.

45
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:18,713
So if I have some type of vehicle and the wheels will be able to move slowly in this medium.

46
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:20,965
Kind of viewed as kind of a mud. So it doesn&#x27;t get good traction

47
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:24,892
and then the fast medium it is a road so it get&#x27;s good traction, it can move faster.

48
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:28,902
So what's going to happen when the vehicle gets to the boundary.

49
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:32,469
Well, this bottom rigth wheel is going to go on the fast medium

50
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:34,670
before any of the other wheels do.

51
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,186
So it&#x27;s going to get the traction first.

52
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:39,979
these wheels on the left side of the vehicle these wheels right here,

53
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:42,385
these are still going to be stuck in the mud so what&#x27;s going to happen is:

54
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:44,699
this wheel right over here is moving faster

55
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,384
so it's essentialy going to be able to turn the vehicle.

56
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:49,110
These guys are still stuck in the mud.

57
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,287
And so you fast foward a little bit, the direction of the vehicle will change.

58
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:57,099
And so the vehicle will now move in a derection something like this.

59
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,374
The same thing would happen in a wave.

60
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:02,581
If the P-Wave is approaching the boundary like this

61
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:05,525
and something analogous is happening at the molecular level.

62
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:10,193
You can kind of view it as a even billard balls, they are kind of hitting each other -

63
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:13,095
I won't go into that because it can get a little confusing

64
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:16,403
depending on the different cases and the different boundaries.

65
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:19,455
But this is the easiest way to think about which direction it will refract.

66
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:21,730
And hopefully makes a little bit of a intuitive sense.

67
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,382
And so when you go from a slow to fast medium or a P-wave,

68
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:28,634
it's angle would accentuate in that direction.

69
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:32,017
If you went from the fast medium to the slow medium -

70
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:35,173
once again, you can just go to same thought expireeement,

71
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,179
so let's say you have our wave coming like that.

72
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:43,923
Draw the car! Visualise the car right here.

73
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:47,085
And you say: look, this tire is going to get stuck in the mud,

74
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:51,742
because it was on the road now this top tire right over here,

75
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:53,122
is getting stuck in the mud first,

76
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:54,888
so it is going to be moving slower,

77
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:56,897
so these tires are going to be able to move faster.

78
00:03:56,897 --> 00:03:58,663
So the vehicle is going to turn.

79
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:02,101
So you'll be refracted in a direction like that

80
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:04,416
when your going from the fast to the slow medium.

81
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,063
So that is just a primer on refraction generally.

82
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,696
Now, let's think about what would happen

83
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:11,947
when sound waves are travelling through the Earth.

84
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:16,226
And this all help infrom us of essentially how do we figure out

85
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:19,172
what the actual structure of the Earth is.

86
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:22,577
So, if the Earth was just made up of some uniform material

87
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:27,668
and you had an earthquake rigth here on Earth,

88
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,770
maybe a little below the surface, you know,

89
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,945
it's happening in the crust but a little bit below the surface of the Earth.

90
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:36,801
If Earth was of uniform density, it was all the same material,

91
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:39,999
how would those, let's just think about the P-waves

92
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:41,729
because P-waves can travel in anything,

93
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,807
let's think about how those P-waves would travel.

94
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:45,582
Well, they would just go in straight lines,

95
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:47,763
there is nothing that would refract the P-waves.

96
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:51,475
It would just go in straight lines radially outward

97
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:57,862
from where the where the earthquake occured.

98
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:01,113
Now, at a first approximation we know that

99
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:03,570
as we go deeper and deeper in the Earth

100
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,256
there is more and more rock above,

101
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:07,227
that the weight of that rock is kind of compressing the rock below.

102
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:09,325
So you get higher and higher pressures,

103
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:11,205
and higher and higher densities.

104
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:15,987
So this is a uniform Earth.

105
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:20,721
But let's imagine a earth that is made up of unifrom material that is all solid.

106
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,702
A completely solid Earth,

107
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:27,396
but one where the density is constantly increasing as you go down.

108
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:30,419
So let's just think about it in beofre we go into the countinous case

109
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,731
cause we are talking about the density

110
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:35,154
as you go deeper it is getting countinously more dense.

111
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:36,931
Let's think about the discrete case,

112
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:40,249
where we have we the least dense layer.

113
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:41,880
So let me draw it right over here.

114
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,738
So let's say this is the surface of the Earth,

115
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:47,634
and this is least dense.

116
00:05:47,634 --> 00:05:51,910
Then let's say you have another layer over here that is more dense.

117
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,209
So this is more dense.

118
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:00,614
Let's say you have another layer that is even more dense,

119
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:07,709
So you have another layer over here that is even more dense.

120
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,943
Then let's do one more layer.

121
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:14,336
This layer here, this is the densest layer,

122
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:18,881
So in general your P-wave, your seismic wave

123
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:21,488
is going to travel faster in denser material.

124
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:24,383
So it is going to travel the fastest here than here.

125
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,084
Then here it is going to the slowest in the least dense material.

126
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:29,757
So if you are coming in an angle,

127
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,278
let's think about what's going to happen.

128
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:36,289
So let's say you have your P-wave coming in at an angle like this.

129
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,554
So it is going straight thorugh the least dense material.

130
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:40,564
So what's going to happen to the...

131
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:43,385
let me do a slightly shallower angle, let's say it is like that.

132
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:46,187
What is going to happen when it goes into the more dense material?

133
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:49,330
So once again, let&#x27;s imagine in our little car.

134
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,673
So this tire is going to be able to go a little faster

135
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:53,238
before the tires on the other side.

136
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:56,276
So the car is going to be deflected to the left.

137
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:59,500
To the down left so now it is going to travel like this,

138
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,288
so it is now going to travel like this.

139
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,487
Now, what&#x27;s going to happen at this boundary?

140
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,126
Once again, imagine the car!

141
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:09,308
This tire right here is going to be able to travel faster before the other tires

142
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:11,631
so it will be deflected even more in that direction.

143
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,833
Then we go into the densest material.

144
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,521
Once again, the tires on kind of the bottom side when we look at it this way,

145
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,388
will be able to move faster before the other tires.

146
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:23,171
So we are going to get deflected even more.

147
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:25,819
So you see as you go from least dense material to more dense material

148
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,659
you are kind of curving outward.

149
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:32,664
So if this was continous, if we had a countinous structure

150
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:36,052
where as you go down it just gets more and more dense.

151
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:40,196
So this is less dense

152
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:44,709
and then just continuously it gets more dense.

153
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,211
So this is the most dense down here.

154
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:49,292
How would the refraction look?

155
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:52,318
Well, there would just be a continuous curve, it would look like this.

156
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:56,706
Your P-wave would constantly be refracted out like that.

157
00:07:56,706 --> 00:07:58,454
It would curve outwards.

158
00:07:58,454 --> 00:08:02,054
So this was the simplest example where Earth is uniform.

159
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:03,970
And you know, that&#x27;s pretty easy to dismiss,

160
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,410
obviously things will get denser because the more pressure down.

161
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,915
Let&#x27;s assume another thing.

162
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:11,112
We have a uniform Earth in terms of composition

163
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:14,360
but let&#x27;s say it gets denser.

164
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,893
So denser at the center.

165
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:19,838
Then how would the P-waves travel.

166
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:24,293
Or how would any seismic waves travel.

167
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:26,947
Well then, if you have your earthquake right over here,

168
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:30,001
the ones that are going straight down still would go straight down,

169
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,753
because we know that we won&#x27;t get refracted

170
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:37,201
if we&#x27;re kind of going perpendicularly to the change in medium or the change in boundaries.

171
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:40,866
But things that are coming in a slight angle as they get deeper,

172
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:42,779
they are going get deflected more an more and more

173
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,720
and they are going to be refracted outwards

174
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,235
just like we saw in this example here.

175
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,819
They are going in this ange, they are going to be outward like that,

176
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,467
if they go here, they are going to be refracted outward like that.

177
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:54,218
They are going to be refracted outward like that.

178
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:56,749
If you are here, you are going to be refracted outward like that.

179
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,173
If you are here, you are going to be refracted outward like this.

180
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:01,692
What we are going to to in the next few videos

181
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:04,383
is use what we&#x27;ve just learnt about refraction

182
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:06,064
in the case of seismic waves,

183
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:07,712
hopefully we&#x27;ve learnt it in this video,

184
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:11,935
and how we would refract as we are going through ever increasing denser material.

185
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,277
We are going to use that information

186
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:17,583
to essentially try to figure out the composition of the Earth.

187
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,717
Based on what we have actually observed.
