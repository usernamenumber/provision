00:00:00,145 --> 00:00:03,553
I'm here with Jesse Ro, whose a math teacher at Summit San Jose

2
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:05,160
and a Khan Academy teaching fellow

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,403
and you had some interesting ideas or questions.

4
00:00:08,403 --> 00:00:11,599
Yeah, one question that students ask a lot when they start Algebra

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,106
is why do we need letters, why can't we just use numbers for everything?

6
00:00:16,106 --> 00:00:18,076
Why letters? So why do we have all these

7
00:00:18,076 --> 00:00:21,811
Xs and Ys and Zs and ABCs when we start dealing with Algebra?

8
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:22,680
Yeah, exactly.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,286
That's interesting, well why don't we let people think about that for a second.

10
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:30,232
So Sal, how would you answer this question?

11
00:00:30,232 --> 00:00:32,193
Why do we need letters in Algebra?

12
00:00:32,193 --> 00:00:35,824
So why letters. So there are a couple of ways I'd think about it.

13
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:38,026
One is if you have an unknown.

14
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:44,239
So if I were to write X plus three is equal to ten

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,577
the reason why we're doing this is that we don't know what X is

16
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:48,298
It's literally an unknown.

17
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,197
And so we're going to solve for it in some way.

18
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:51,710
But it did not have to be the letter X.

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,703
We could have literally written blank plus three is equal to ten.

20
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:59,725
Or we could have written Question Mark plus three is equal to ten.

21
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:03,147
So it didn't have to be letters, but we needed some type of symbol.

22
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:07,434
It literally could've been Smiley Face plus three is equal to ten.

23
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:12,181
But until you know it, you need some type of a symbol to represent whatever that number is.

24
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:15,700
Now we can go and solve this equation and then know what that symbol represents.

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,916
But if we knew it ahead of time, it wouldn't be an unknown.

26
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:20,387
It wouldn't be something that we didn't know.

27
00:01:20,387 --> 00:01:23,576
So that's one reason why I would use letters

28
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:26,489
and where just numbers by itself wouldn't be helpful.

29
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,942
The other is when you're describing relationships between numbers.

30
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:32,286
So I could do something like - I could say - that

31
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:38,021
whenever you give me a three, I'm going to give you a four.

32
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:43,762
And I could say, if you give me a five, I'm going to give you a six.

33
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:46,050
And i could keep going on and on forever.

34
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,626
If you give me a 7.1, I'm going to give you an 8.1.

35
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:54,431
And I could keep listing this on and on forever.

36
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:57,477
Maybe you could give me any number, and I could tell you what I'm going to give you.

37
00:01:57,477 --> 00:02:00,879
But I would obviously run out of space and time if I were to list all of them.

38
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,259
And we could do that much more elegantly if we used letters to describe the relationship.

39
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:11,296
Maybe what you give me we call X, and what I give you we call Y.

40
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:14,678
And so I say, look, whatever you give me, I'm going to add one to it.

41
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:16,867
And that's what I'm going to give back to you.

42
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:20,670
And so now, this very simple equation here

43
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,717
can describe an infinite number of relationships between X

44
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:28,219
or an infinite number of corresponding Ys and Xs.

45
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:31,497
So now someone knows whatever X you give me

46
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:34,612
you give me three, I add one to it, and I'm going to give you four.

47
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:38,200
You give me 7.1, I'm going to add one to it and give you 8.1.

48
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,166
So there is no more elegant way that you could've done it than by using symbols.

49
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,959
With that said, I didn't have to use Xs and Ys.

50
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,648
This is just a convention that kind of comes to use from history.

51
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:49,725
I could've defined what you give me as Star

52
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:54,827
and what I give you as Smiley Face

53
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:57,733
and this also would've been a valid way to express this.

54
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:01,733
So the letters are really just symbols. Nothing more.
