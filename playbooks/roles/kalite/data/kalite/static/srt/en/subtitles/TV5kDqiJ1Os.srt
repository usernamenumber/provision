1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're asked to complete the square to solve:

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4x squared minus 40x minus 300 is equal to 0.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me just rewrite it.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 4x squared plus 40x minus 300 is equal to 0.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So just as a first step here, I don't like having this 4

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
out front as a coefficient on the x squared term,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'd prefer if that was a 1. So let's just divide both sides of this equation by 4.
