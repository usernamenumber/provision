1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,060
All right, we're on problem 125 on page 288.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,020
If r and s are positive integers, is r/s an integer?

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,550
Is r/s an integer?

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,250
So that's really just another way of saying,

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,880
is s divisible into r? So let's see what the statements are.

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,020
Statement 1. Every factor of s is also a factor of r.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:41,750
That answers our question. Every factor of s is factor of r.

8
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,010
Well, let me ask you a question.

9
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,220
What is the largest factor of s?The largest factor of s is s.

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,850
So this statement tells us that since s is a factor of s,

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,020
that s is also going to be a factor of r.

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,110
And something being a factor of something means that

13
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,120
it's divisible into it.

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,390
So that means that s is divisible into r.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,640
So this means that r/s is an integer.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,050
So it answers our question.

17
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,440
So statement 1, alone, is sufficient. Statement 2 tells us,

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,040
every prime factor of s is also a prime factor of r.

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,450
Every prime factor-- so let me think of-- Immediately,

20
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,350
I can think of a case where that doesn't hold up.

21
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,470
Where I could have every prime factor being a factor of r.

22
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,110
So let's say s is equal to 4.

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,020
And its prime factorization is 2 times 2.

24
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,490
And let's say that R is equal to 6.

25
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,000
And its prime factorization is 2 times 3.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,340
So we have a case here where every factor,

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,070
every prime factor of s, is a prime factor of R.

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,510
The only prime factor of s is 2.

29
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,010
And that's a prime factor of R.

30
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,600
But if we were to say R/s, R/s would be 6/4,

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,180
which is not an integer.

32
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,130
So even though these satisfy the second condition,

33
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,000
this isn't an integer.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,520
But then I could have-- instead of making R equal to 6,

35
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,080
I could've made R equal to 4.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,880
Sorry, I could have made R is equal to 8,

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,890
which is equal to 2 times 2 times 2.

38
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,200
And in this case, it would have been an integer.

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,030
R/s would be equal to 8/4, which is equal to 2.

40
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,150
So statement 2, really doesn't give us information as to

41
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,110
whether r/s is an integer.

42
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,760
So statement 1, alone, is sufficient.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,700
Next problem. Switch colors. 126.

44
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:50,000
If z to the n is equal to 1, what is the value of z?

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,080
z equals what?

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,520
So statement 1 tells us, n is a nonzero integer.

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,230
n does not equal to 0. So let's think about this.

48
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,210
For something to some power to be equal to 1,

49
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,060
what do we know about it?

50
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,070
Well, if anything to the 0th power is equal to 1,

51
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,750
but they just told us that it's nonzero.

52
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,120
So we can't use this condition.

53
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,060
So that actually does restrict z a good bit.

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,090
So if n is a nonzero number, what can I raise to the power

55
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,110
to equal 1? Well, clearly 1, right?

56
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:30,020
1 to anything is going to be equal to 1. But what other--?

57
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,010
Well,there's also the possibility of negative numbers, right?

58
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,830
Negative 1 to the nth power is equal to 1, if n is even.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,330
And I think these are the only two,

60
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,510
if we take imaginary numbers out of the picture.

61
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,570
And I think, on the GMAT,

62
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,690
we assume that we don't have any imaginary numbers.

63
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,030
So assuming that, the only-- If we know that n does not

64
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,330
equal 0 and z to the n is equal to 1,

65
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,310
the only possibilities that this allows for is that z

66
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,030
is equal to 1 or negative 1. And if it's negative 1,

67
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,160
then n would have to be an even number.

68
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,680
But they didn't restrict that yet.

69
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,400
So statement 1, by itself, it helps us.

70
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,640
But it doesn't actually give us enough information.

71
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,090
We can just narrow it down to z being 1 or negative 1.

72
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's see what statement 2 tells us.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,020
Statement 2 tells us, z is greater than 0.

74
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,060
So that, by itself, is useless information.

75
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,010
Because if z is greater than 0 and n can be 0, right?

76
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,400
We're assuming we don't have statement 1 yet.

77
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,400
So if z is greater than 0 and n could be 0,

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,000
z could be a hundred to the 0th power.

79
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,000
z could be a hundred and that equals 1.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,780
z could be 99 to the 0th power, and that could be equal to 1.

81
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,800
So z could be anything to the 0th power as long as

82
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,000
it's greater than 0. So this, by itself, doesn't help us.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,490
But if we use statement 2 and statement 1 in conjunction,

84
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,250
then it's interesting.

85
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,290
Because statement 1 essentially told us that z has

86
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,060
to be 1 or negative 1.

87
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,480
Statement 2 tells us, z has to be greater than 0.

88
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,560
So if you use both the conditions combined, it forces

89
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,400
us to say, well, then z has to be equal to positive 1.

90
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,970
Because negative 1 is not greater than 0.

91
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,850
So both statements combined are sufficient to

92
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,840
answer this question.

93
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,000
Next problem. 127.

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,210
OK, so they've written this thing.

95
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:39,010
They write, s is equal 2/n, all of that over 1/x plus 2/3x.

96
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,680
And they say in the expression above,if xn does not equal 0--

97
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,010
so essentially saying that neither x nor n is 0.

98
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,010
What is the value of s? s is equal to what?

99
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,280
So even before looking at the statements,

100
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,420
I just want to simplify this.

101
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,430
Just because it's too complex right now. So let's see.

102
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,660
This is equal to 2/n over-- let's see.

103
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,170
You have a common denominator 3x. Let's see.

104
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:11,030
This is 3 over 3x. That's the same thing as 1/x. Plus 2.

105
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:17,360
So that equals 2/n over 5/3x,

106
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:27,610
which is equal to 2/n times 3x/5. Which is equal to 6x/5n.

107
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,220
That's a much more pleasing thing to look at and

108
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,040
try to get your brain around.

109
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,190
So statement 1 tells us, x is equal to 2n.

110
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,010
So if x is equal to 2n,

111
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,880
let's just substitute that into this statement for s. Then,

112
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,060
s would be equal to 6 times x, which we know is equal to 2n.

113
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,350
Divided by 5n. n's cancel out. So it equals 12/5.

114
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,410
So statement 1, alone, is sufficient to answer this question.

115
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:06,060
Statement 2 tells us that n is equal to 1/2.

116
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,800
Well, that's fairly useless.

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,320
Because this is what we simplified s down to.

118
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,590
If we put 1/2 here,

119
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:18,960
then we get s is equal to 6x over 5 times 1/2. so that's 5/2.

120
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,230
I can simplify this more, but we still don't know what x is.

121
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,060
You can't cancel the x's out or anything.

122
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,000
This, alone, doesn't help you at all.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,590
So the answer is statement 1, alone, is sufficient.

124
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,940
And statement 2, by itself, is fairly useless.

125
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,940
Problem 128.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,310
If x is an integer,is x times--I think that says the absolute

127
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,900
it's kind of strange to look at it like that.

128
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,690
But they're saying,

129
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:53,280
is x times the absolute value of x less than 2x?

130
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,070
And they tell us that x is an integer.

131
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:01,050
OK, statement 1 tells us that x is less than 0.

132
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,670
So how does that help us?

133
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:08,940
If x is less than 0, then this on the right-hand side is

134
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,620
going to be less than 0. And this will also be less than 0.

135
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,570
Because you'll have a negative number times a positive number

136
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,020
They'll both be less than 0.

137
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,690
If we make x is equal to negative 1,

138
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,810
then this would not-- then this will not be true.

139
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,460
Because you'll have negative 1 times 1.

140
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,060
So you'll have 1 is less than negative 2.

141
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,010
Sorry, you'd have negative 1 times 1, which is negative 1.

142
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,010
Which is less than 2,which is not true. It's not less than 2.

143
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:46,610
Or, if x was less than negative 2, if x was negative 3,

144
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,490
then you would have negative 3 times 3.

145
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,030
Because the absolute value of negative 3.

146
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,180
So you would have minus 9 is less than minus 3 times 2.

147
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,020
Minus 6. This is true.

148
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,850
So just this condition, alone, doesn't get us there.

149
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,510
Because I can still pick an x that meets this condition.

150
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,570
And depending on whether I make that x greater than or

151
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,280
less than negative 2, I can make this true or not.

152
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,050
So statement 1, by itself, isn't enough.

153
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,050
Statement 2 tells us, x is equal to minus 10.

154
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,660
Well, this is an easy one. We can just test it.

155
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,940
So if we have minus 10 times the absolute value of minus 10,

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,720
and we're going to test whether that's less than 2

157
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,520
times minus 10. So the absolute value of--

158
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,300
So this is minus 10 times positive 10.

159
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,010
So it's minus 100, which is less than minus 20.

160
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,450
Which is completely true.

161
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:45,010
So statement 2, alone, is sufficient to answer this question.

162
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,050
And I'm almost out of time,so I'll see you in the next video.
