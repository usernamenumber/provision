1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:03,974
Let's do a little more practice with our trigonometric ratio,

2
00:00:03,974 --> 00:00:06,192
and our trigonometric functions.

3
00:00:06,192 --> 00:00:11,775
So here we're asked to find the values of cosine theta and sine theta.

4
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:15,617
Let's start with cosine theta.

5
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:19,866
What is the cosine of theta, where theta is this angle over here.

6
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:22,606
And it is indeed a right triangle.

7
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,960
So I'll give you a few seconds to think about that.

8
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:30,839
Well to answer this you just have to remember the definitions of the trig functions.

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,674
To help us there, we'll use the mnemonic soh cah toa.

10
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:37,389
Soh

11
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:38,806
Cah

12
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:42,657
Toa

13
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:44,088
soh cah toa

14
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:47,655
And the part of soh cah toa that relates to cosign is the cah part.

15
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:55,472
This defines sine, that's why we have the 's'; this defines cosine, that's why it starts with a 'c'; this defines tangent, that's why it starts with a 't'.

16
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:59,304
So if you look at cah, it says that cosine (let me use that same color)...

17
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:09,689
it says that cosine of an angle is equal to the adjacent side over the hypotenuse.

18
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,256
So in our example here, what is the adjacent side?

19
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:18,389
Well, if we look at it, it's the side that's next to it and not the hypotenuse.

20
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:20,938
This side is next to it and it's not the hypotenuse.

21
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:28,805
This side up here is next to our angle, but it is the hypotenuse; it's the one that's opposite the right angle.

22
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:33,789
So this is the hypotenuse up here.

23
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:37,456
This is... if we're looking at angle theta, this is the adjacent side.

24
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:46,905
And, while we're at it, if you want to think of the oppisite side (we don't have to deal with it for cosine), but it never hurts to label it right now. That is the opposite.

25
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:49,489
And this is relative to angle theta.

26
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:53,472
So, with that out of the way, we say that cosine of theta is equal to adjacent over the hypotenuse.

27
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:59,573
Adjacent has length 4. What is the hypotenuse?

28
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:04,157
Well we know what side is the hypotenuse, but they haven't given us the length yet.

29
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,738
But we can figure it out using the Pythagorean Theorem.

30
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:12,406
We have 2 sides of a right triangle, we can always figure out the third side.

31
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:21,121
We know that the sum of the squares of the 2 shorter sides will be equal to the square of the hypotenuse.

32
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:35,756
So, we have 4 squared, plus 7 squared is going to be equal to, I'll just call it h squared or hypotenuse squared.

33
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:48,805
If 4 squred is 16, and 7 squared is 49 is going to be equal to h squared.

34
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:54,339
And, let's see, 16+50 would be 66, so 16+49 is 65.

35
00:02:54,339 --> 00:03:01,556
So this side over here is 65. H squred is equal to 65.

36
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:06,755
Or we can say that h is equal to the square root of 65.

37
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:15,689
And it doesn't look like there's any perfect squares in here - 65 is 13 times 5, neither of those is perfect squares, so this is about as simplified as we can get this radical.

38
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:19,306
So the hypotenous is equal to the square root of 65.

39
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:28,671
So in this case cosine of theta is equal to the adjacent side, which has length 4, over the hypotenous which has the length square root of 65.

40
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:34,407
Now, let's do the same thing with the sine. What is the sine of theta going to be?

41
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,388
I'm going to give you a few seconds to think about it.

42
00:03:36,388 --> 00:03:45,721
Well, soh tells us that sine is equal to opposite over hypotenuse.

43
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:52,408
In this case, relative to angle theta, the opposite side has length 7.

44
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:58,306
And what is the hypotenuse, or what is the length of the hypotenuse? Well, we just figured it out.

45
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:02,306
It is the square root of 65.
