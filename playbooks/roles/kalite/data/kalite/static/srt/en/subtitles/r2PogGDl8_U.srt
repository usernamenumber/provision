1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,270
Let's say that I have
two nonzero vectors.

2
00:00:05,137 --> 00:00:07,005
Let's say the first vector is
x, the second vector is y.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,757
They are both a part of our set.

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,270
They're both in the set Rn
and they're nonzero.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,133
It turns out that the absolute
value of their-- let me do it

6
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:25,320
in a different color.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,800
This color's nice.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,080
The absolute value of their
dot product of the two

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,280
vectors-- and remember, this is
just a scalar quantity-- is

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,840
less than or equal to the
product of their lengths.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,140
And we've defined the dot
product and we've defined

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,230
lengths already.

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,390
It's less than or equal to the
product of their lengths and

14
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,730
just to push it even further,
the only time that this is

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,930
equal, so the dot product of the
two vectors is only going

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,575
to be equal to the lengths of
this-- the equal and the less

17
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:05,470
than or equal apply only in the
situation-- let me write

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:11,460
that down-- where one of these
vectors is a scalar multiple

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:11,920
of the other.

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,580
Or they're collinear.

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,430
You know, one's just kind of the
longer or shorter version

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,530
of the other one.

23
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,250
So only in the situation where
let's just say x is equal to

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,875
some scalar multiple of y.

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,760
These inequalities or I guess
the equality of this

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,215
inequality, this is called the
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality.

27
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:43,200
Cauchy-Shwarz Inequality

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,580
So let's prove it because you
can't take something like this

29
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,680
just at face value.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,040
You shouldn't just
accept that.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,280
So let me just construct a
somewhat artificial function.

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,180
Let me construct some function
of-- that's a function of some

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,410
variables, some scalar t.

34
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,710
Let me define p of t to be equal
to the length of the

35
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:12,420
vector t times the vector-- some
scalar t times the vector

36
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,880
y minus the vector x.

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,300
It's the length of
this vector.

38
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,320
This is going to be
a vector now.

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,920
That squared.

40
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,130
Now before I move forward
I want to make one

41
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:23,790
little point here.

42
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,740
If I take the length of any
vector, I'll do it here.

43
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,890
Let's say I take the length
of some vector v.

44
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,820
I want you to accept that this
is going to be a positive

45
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,150
number, or it's at least greater
than or equal to 0.

46
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,940
Because this is just going to be
each of its terms squared.

47
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,340
v2 squared all the way
to vn squared.

48
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,640
All of these are real numbers.

49
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,550
When you square a real number,
you get something greater than

50
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,770
or equal to 0.

51
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,290
When you sum them up, you're
going to have something

52
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,670
greater than or equal to 0.

53
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,840
And you take the square root
of it, the principal square

54
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,370
root, the positive square root,
you're going to have

55
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,270
something greater than
or equal to 0.

56
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,930
So the length of any real vector
is going to be greater

57
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,180
than or equal to 0.

58
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,690
So this is the length
of a real vector.

59
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,230
So this is going to be greater
than or equal to 0.

60
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,400
Now, in the previous video, I
think it was two videos ago, I

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,860
also showed that the magnitude
or the length of a vector

62
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,950
squared can also be rewritten
as the dot product of that

63
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,570
vector with itself.

64
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,830
So let's rewrite this
vector that way.

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,750
The length of this vector
squared is equal to the dot

66
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,230
product of that vector
with itself.

67
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:44,880
So it's ty minus x
dot ty minus x.

68
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,120
In the last video, I showed
you that you can treat a

69
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,050
multiplication or you can treat
the dot product very

70
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,330
similar to regular
multiplication when it comes

71
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,420
to the associative, distributive
and commutative

72
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,330
properties.

73
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,200
So when you multiplied these,
you know, you could kind of

74
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,340
view this as multiplying
these two binomials.

75
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,440
You can do it the same way as
you would just multiply two

76
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,360
regular algebraic binomials.

77
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,030
You're essentially just using
the distributive property.

78
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,760
But remember, this isn't just
regular multiplication.

79
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,480
This is the dot product
we're doing.

80
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,149
This is vector multiplication
or one version of vector

81
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,220
multiplication.

82
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,730
So if we distribute it out, this
will become ty dot ty.

83
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,850
So let me write that out.

84
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,850
That'll be ty dot ty.

85
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,430
And then we'll get a minus--
let me do it this way.

86
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,580
Then we get the minus
x times this ty.

87
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,640
Instead of saying times,
I should be very

88
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,720
careful to say dot.

89
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,400
So minus x dot ty.

90
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,810
And then you have this ty
times this minus x.

91
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,860
So then you have
minus ty dot x.

92
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,900
And then finally, you have the
x's dot with each other.

93
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,680
And you can view them as
minus 1x dot minus 1x.

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,080
You could say plus minus 1x.

95
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,500
I could just view this as plus
minus 1 or plus minus 1.

96
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,260
So this is minus 1x
dot minus 1x.

97
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,860
So let's see.

98
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,940
So this is what my whole
expression simplified to or

99
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,710
expanded to.

100
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,890
I can't really call this
a simplification.

101
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,410
But we can use the fact that
this is commutative and

102
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,230
associative to rewrite this
expression right here.

103
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:45,430
This is equal to y dot
y times t squared.

104
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,680
t is just a scalar.

105
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,750
Minus-- and actually,
this is 2.

106
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,810
These two things
are equivalent.

107
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,370
They're just rearrangements of
the same thing and we saw that

108
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,290
the dot product is
associative.

109
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:06,260
So this is just equal to 2
times x dot y times t.

110
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,230
And I should do that in maybe
a different color.

111
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,080
So these two terms result in
that term right there.

112
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,570
And then if you just rearrange
these you have a minus 1

113
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,400
times a minus 1.

114
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,070
They cancel out, so those will
become plus and you're just

115
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,140
left with plus x dot x.

116
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,740
And I should do that in a
different color as well.

117
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,690
I'll do that in an
orange color.

118
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,820
So those terms end up
with that term.

119
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,620
Then of course, that term
results in that term.

120
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,880
And remember, all I did
is I rewrote this

121
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,490
thing and said, look.

122
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,990
This has got to be greater
than or equal to 0.

123
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,620
So I could rewrite that here.

124
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,070
This thing is still just
the same thing.

125
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,450
I've just rewritten it.

126
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,620
So this is all going to be
greater than or equal to 0.

127
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,990
Now let's make a little bit of
a substitution just to clean

128
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,590
up our expression
a little bit.

129
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,280
And we'll later back substitute
into this.

130
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,480
Let's define this as a.

131
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,860
Let's define this piece
right here as b.

132
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,380
So the whole thing
minus 2x dot y.

133
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,780
I'll leave the t there.

134
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:17,020
And let's define this or
let me just define this

135
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,825
right here as c.

136
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:20,130
X dot x as c.

137
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,060
So then, what does our
expression become?

138
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:29,910
It becomes a times t squared
minus-- I want to be careful

139
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,480
with the colors-- b
times t plus c.

140
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,050
And of course, we know that it's
going to be greater than

141
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,780
or equal to 0.

142
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,660
It's the same thing as
this up here, greater

143
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,270
than or equal to 0.

144
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,125
I could write p of t here.

145
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,890
Now this is greater than or
equal to 0 for any t that I

146
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,530
put in here.

147
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,995
For any real t that
I put in there.

148
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,190
Let me evaluate our function
at b over 2a.

149
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,570
And I can definitely do this
because what was a?

150
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,700
I just have to make sure I'm not
dividing by 0 any place.

151
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,850
So a was this vector
dotted with itself.

152
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,290
And we said this was
a nonzero vector.

153
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,680
So this is the square
of its length.

154
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,610
It's a nonzero vector, so some
of these terms up here would

155
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,790
end up becoming positively
when you take its length.

156
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,710
So this thing right
here is nonzero.

157
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,310
This is a nonzero vector.

158
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,880
Then 2 times the dot product
with itself is also going to

159
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,450
be nonzero.

160
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,309
So we can do this.

161
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,990
We don't worry about dividing
by 0, whatever else.

162
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,049
But what will this
be equal to?

163
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,200
This'll be equal to-- and I'll
just stick to the green.

164
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,110
It takes too long to keep
switching between colors.

165
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,230
This is equal to a times this
expression squared.

166
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,340
So it's b squared
over 4a squared.

167
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,090
I just squared 2a to
get the 4a squared.

168
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,270
Minus b times this.

169
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,760
So b times-- this is just
regular multiplication.

170
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,650
b times b over 2a.

171
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,780
Just write regular
multiplication there.

172
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,130
Plus c.

173
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,870
And we know all of that is
greater than or equal to 0.

174
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,080
Now if we simplify this a little
bit, what do we get?

175
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,290
Well this a cancels out with
this exponent there and you

176
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,480
end up with a b squared
right there.

177
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:26,150
So we get b squared over 4a
minus b squared over 2a.

178
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,650
That's that term over there.

179
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,730
Plus c is greater than
or equal to 0.

180
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,440
Let me rewrite this.

181
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,810
If I multiply the numerator and
denominator of this by 2,

182
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,010
what do I get?

183
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,110
I get 2b squared over 4a.

184
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,050
And the whole reason I did
that is to get a common

185
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,660
denominator here.

186
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,670
So what do you get?

187
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,050
You get b squared over 4a minus
2b squared over 4a.

188
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,600
So what do these two
terms simplify to?

189
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,930
Well the numerator is b squared
minus 2b squared.

190
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:01,200
So that just becomes minus b
squared over 4a plus c is

191
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,710
greater than or equal to 0.

192
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,570
These two terms add up to
this one right here.

193
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,490
Now if we add this to both sides
of the equation, we get

194
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,260
c is greater than or equal
to b squared over 4a.

195
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,720
It was a negative on
the left-hand side.

196
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,570
If I add it to both sides it's
going to be a positive on the

197
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,760
right-hand side.

198
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,470
We're approaching something that
looks like an inequality,

199
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,380
so let's back substitute our
original substitutions to see

200
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,060
what we have now.

201
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,660
So where was my original
substitutions that I made?

202
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,790
It was right here.

203
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,970
And actually, just to simplify
more, let me multiply both

204
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,220
sides by 4a.

205
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,020
I said a, not only
is it nonzero,

206
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,130
it's going to be positive.

207
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,070
This is the square
of its length.

208
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,670
And I already showed you that
the length of any real

209
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,170
vector's going to be positive.

210
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,460
And the reason why I'm taking
great pains to show that a is

211
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,510
positive is because if I
multiply both sides of it I

212
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,690
don't want to change the
inequality sign.

213
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,910
So let me multiply both sides
of this by a before I

214
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,380
substitute.

215
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:07,750
So we get 4ac is greater than
or equal to b squared.

216
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,160
There you go.

217
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,890
And remember, I took
great pains.

218
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,400
I just said a is definitely a
positive number because it is

219
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,830
essentially the square of the
length. y dot y is the square

220
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,450
of the length of y, and that's
a positive value.

221
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,320
It has to be positive.

222
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,970
We're dealing with
real vectors.

223
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,470
Now let's back substitute
this.

224
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:30,030
So 4 times a, 4 times y dot y.

225
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,420
y dot y is also-- I might as
well just write it there.

226
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,470
y dot y is the same thing as
the magnitude of y squared.

227
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,490
That's y dot y.

228
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,760
This is a.

229
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,690
y dot y, I showed you that
in the previous video.

230
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,800
Times c.

231
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,760
c is x dot x.

232
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,640
Well x dot x is the
same thing as the

233
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,200
length of vector x squared.

234
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,420
So this was c.

235
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,030
So 4 times a times c is going
to be greater than

236
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,920
or equal to b squared.

237
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,760
Now what was b? b was
this thing here.

238
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:14,610
So b squared would be 2
times x dot y squared.

239
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,880
So we've gotten to this
result so far.

240
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,620
And so what can we
do with this?

241
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,200
Oh sorry, and this whole
thing is squared.

242
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,240
This whole thing right
here is b.

243
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,220
So let's see if we can
simplify this.

244
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,620
So we get-- let me switch
to a different color.

245
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:34,870
4 times the length of y squared
times the length of x

246
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,660
squared is greater than or equal
to-- if we squared this

247
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:46,270
quantity right here, we
get 4 times x dot y.

248
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:54,620
4 times x dot y times x dot y.

249
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,510
Actually, even better, let me
just write it like this.

250
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,090
Let me just write 4 times
x dot y squared.

251
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,950
Now we can divide
both sides by 4.

252
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,600
That won't change
our inequality.

253
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,250
So that just cancels
out there.

254
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,050
And now let's take the
square root of both

255
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,840
sides of this equation.

256
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,040
So the square roots of both
sides of this equation-- these

257
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,380
are positive values, so the
square root of this side is

258
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,840
the square root of each
of its terms. That's

259
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,325
just an exponent property.

260
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:21,150
So if you take the square root
of both sides you get the

261
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:28,010
length of y times the length of
x is greater than or equal

262
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,570
to the square root of this.

263
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,650
And we're going to take the
positive square root.

264
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,480
We're going to take the positive
square root on both

265
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,400
sides of this equation.

266
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,600
That keeps us from having to
mess with anything on the

267
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,260
inequality or anything
like that.

268
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,640
So the positive square root is
going to be the absolute value

269
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,370
of x dot y.

270
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,060
And I want to be very careful
to say this is the absolute

271
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,060
value because it's possible that
this thing right here is

272
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,755
a negative value.

273
00:13:51,755 --> 00:13:55,520
But when you square it, you want
to be careful that when

274
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,710
you take the square root
of it that you

275
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,960
stay a positive value.

276
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,050
Because otherwise when we take
the principal square root, we

277
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,070
might mess with the inquality.

278
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,130
We're taking the positive square
root, which will be--

279
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,965
so if you take the absolute
value, you're ensuring that

280
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:10,590
it's going to be positive.

281
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,000
But this is our result.

282
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,800
The absolute value of the dot
product of our vectors is less

283
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,510
than the product of the
two vectors lengths.

284
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,586
So we got our Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality.

285
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:36,630
Now the last thing I said is
look, what happens if x is

286
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,640
equal to some scalar
multiple of y?

287
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,385
Well in that case, what's
the absolute value?

288
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:45,930
The absolute value of x dot y?

289
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,520
Well that equals--
that equals what?

290
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,080
If we make the substitution that
equals the absolute value

291
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,850
of c times y.

292
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:59,160
That's just x dot y, which
is equal to just from the

293
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,730
associative property.

294
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,800
It's equal to the absolute value
of c times-- we want to

295
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,910
make sure our absolute value,
keep everything positive.

296
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,970
y dot y.

297
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:22,320
Well this is just equal to c
times the magnitude of y-- the

298
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,210
length of y squared.

299
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:31,260
Well that just is equal to the
magnitude of c times-- or the

300
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,986
absolute value of our scalar
c times our length of y.

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,290
Well this right here,
I can rewrite this.

302
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,610
I mean you can prove this to
yourself if you don't believe

303
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,790
it, but this-- we could put the
c inside of the magnitude

304
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,630
and that could be a good
exercise for you to prove.

305
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,300
But it's pretty straightforward.

306
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,180
You just do the definition
of length.

307
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,050
And you multiply it by c.

308
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,530
This is equal to the magnitude
of cy times-- let me say the

309
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:06,600
length of cy times
the length of y.

310
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,620
I've lost my vector notation
someplace over here.

311
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,580
There you go.

312
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,920
Now, this is x.

313
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,370
So this is equal to the length
of x times the length of y.

314
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,360
So I showed you kind of
the second part of the

315
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,650
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality that
this is only equal to each

316
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,510
other if one of them is a scalar
multiple of the other.

317
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,540
If you're a little uncomfortable
with some of

318
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,600
these steps I took, it might
be a good exercise to

319
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,370
actually prove it.

320
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,720
For example, to prove that the
absolute value of c times the

321
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,270
length of the vector y is
the same thing as the

322
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,890
length of c times y.

323
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,790
Anyway, hopefully you found
this pretty useful.

324
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,180
The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
we'll use a lot when we prove

325
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,580
other results in
linear algebra.

326
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,250
And in a future video, I'll
give you a little more

327
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,960
intuition about why this makes a
lot of sense relative to the

328
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,500
dot product.
