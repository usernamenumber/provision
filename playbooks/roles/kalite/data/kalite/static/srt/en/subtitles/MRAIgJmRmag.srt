1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
solve the systems of linear equations by graphing.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they give us two equations here.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
5x + 3y is equal to seven and 3x - 2y is equal to eight.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when they say solve the systems of linear equations

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they are really just saying to find an x and a y that

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
satisfies both these equations.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when they say to do it by graphing we are

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
esentally going to graph this first equation.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
remember the graph is really just depicting

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
all of the x and y that satisfy this first equation

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we graph the second equations thats

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
depicting all the x and y that satisfy that one.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if we are looking for an x and a y that

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
satisfies both that point needs to be on both equations

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so or it has to be on both graphs

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it will be the inter section of the two graphs

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets try to see if we can do that.
