1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,810
In the last video, our
null hypothesis was

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,920
the drug had no effect.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,100
And our alternative hypothesis
was that the

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,300
drug just has an effect.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,990
We didn't say whether the drug
would lower the response time

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,090
or raise the response time.

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,320
We just said the drug had an
effect, that the mean when you

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,290
have the drug will not
be the same thing as

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,440
the population mean.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,580
And then the null hypothesis
says no, your mean with the

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,517
drug's going to be the same
thing as the population mean,

12
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:28,910
it has no effect.

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,420
In this situation where we're
really just testing to see if

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,750
it had an effect, whether an
extreme positive effect, or an

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,380
extreme negative effect,
would have both been

16
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,620
considered an effect.

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,170
We did something called a
two-tailed test. This is

18
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:52,950
called a two-tailed test.
Because frankly, a super high

19
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,700
response time, if you had a
response time that was more

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,510
than 3 standard deviations,
that would've also made us

21
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,410
likely to reject the
null hypothesis.

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,010
So we were dealing with
kind of both tails.

23
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,330
You could have done a similar
type of hypothesis test with

24
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,590
the same experiment where you
only had a one-tailed test.

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,110
And the way we could have done
that is we still could have

26
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:20,075
had the null hypothesis be that
the drug has no effect.

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,670
Or that the mean with the drug--
the mean, and maybe I

28
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,320
could say the mean with the
drug-- is still going to be

29
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,520
1.2 seconds, our mean
response time.

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,030
Now if we wanted to do a
one-tailed test, but for some

31
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,060
reason we already had maybe a
view that this drug would

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,050
lower response times, then our
alternative hypothesis-- and

33
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,220
just so you get familiar with
different types of notation,

34
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,390
some books or teachers will
write the alternative

35
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,170
hypothesis as H1, sometimes
they write it as H

36
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,320
alternative, either
one is fine.

37
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,090
If you want to do one-tailed
test, you could say that the

38
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:08,509
drug lowers response time.

39
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:18,340
Or that the mean with the drug
is less than 1.2 seconds.

40
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,790
Now if you do a one-tailed test
like this, what we're

41
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,040
thinking about is, what we want
to look at is, all right,

42
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,290
we have our sampling
distribution.

43
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,960
Actually, I can just use the
drawing that I had up here.

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,250
You had your sampling
distribution

45
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,610
of the sample mean.

46
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,360
We know what the mean of that
was, it's 1.2 seconds, same as

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,500
the population mean.

48
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,060
We were able to estimate its
standard deviation using our

49
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,260
sample standard deviation, and
that was reasonable because it

50
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,250
had a sample size of greater
than 30, so we can still kind

51
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,530
of deal with a normal
distribution for the sampling

52
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,540
distribution.

53
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,250
And using that we saw that the
result, the sample mean that

54
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,960
we got, the 1.05 seconds,
is 3 standard

55
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,025
deviations below the mean.

56
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,780
So if we look at it-- let me
just re-draw it with our new

57
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,490
hypothesis test. So this is
the sampling distribution.

58
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,920
It has a mean right over
here at 1.2 seconds.

59
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,890
And the result we got
was 3 standard

60
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,810
deviations below the mean.

61
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,480
1, 2, 3 standard deviations
below the mean.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,910
That was what our 1.05
seconds were.

63
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,870
So when you set it up like this
where you're not just

64
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,890
saying that the drug has an
effect-- in that case, and

65
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,460
that was the last view, you'd
look at both tails.

66
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,400
But here we're saying we only
care is does the drug lower

67
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,740
our response time?

68
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,590
And just like we did before, you
say OK, let's say the drug

69
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,040
doesn't lower our
response time.

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,170
If the drug doesn't lower our
response time, what was the

71
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,730
probability or what is the
probability of getting a

72
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,980
lowering this extreme
or more extreme?

73
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,120
So here it will only be one
of the tails that we could

74
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,810
consider when we set our
alternative hypothesis like

75
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,320
that, that we think it lowers.

76
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:22,410
So if our null hypothesis is
true, the probability of

77
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:35,900
getting a result more extreme
than 1.05 seconds, now we are

78
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,140
only considering this tail
right over here.

79
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,050
Let me just put it this way.

80
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,850
More extreme than 1.05 seconds,
or let me say, lower.

81
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,030
Because in the last video we
cared about more extreme

82
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,140
because even a really high
result would have said, OK,

83
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,450
the mean's definitely
not 1.2 seconds.

84
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,110
But in this case we care about
means that are lower.

85
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:00,480
So now we care about the
probability of a result lower

86
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,550
than 1.05 seconds.

87
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,960
That's the same thing as
sampling-- of getting a sample

88
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,270
from the sampling distribution
that's more than 3 standard

89
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,270
deviations below the mean.

90
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,610
And in this case, we're only
going to consider the area in

91
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,790
this one tail.

92
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,310
So this right here would be a
one-tailed test where we only

93
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,290
care about one direction
below the mean.

94
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,980
If you look at the one-tailed
test-- this area over here--

95
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,680
we saw last time that both of
these areas combined are 0.3%.

96
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,760
But if you're only considering
one of these areas, if you're

97
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,680
only considering this one over
here it's going to be half of

98
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,910
that, because the normal
distribution is symmetric.

99
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,790
So it's going to the 0.13%.

100
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:46,920
So this one right here is going
to be 0.15%, or if you

101
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:55,440
express it as a decimal, this
is going to be 0.0015.

102
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,733
So once again, if you set up
your hypotheses like this, you

103
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:04,020
would have said, if your null
hypothesis is correct, there

104
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,990
would have only been a 0.15%
chance of getting a result

105
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,440
lower than the result we got.

106
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:20,200
So that would be very unlikely,
so we will reject

107
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,470
the null hypothesis and go
with the alternative.

108
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,910
And in this situation
your P-value is

109
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,850
going to be the 0.0015.
