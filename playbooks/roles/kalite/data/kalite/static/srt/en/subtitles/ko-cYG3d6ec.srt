1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,830
Let's do a couple more angle
game problems, and hopefully

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,746
this will make you an
angle game expert.

4
00:00:07,746 --> 00:00:11,710
So let's start, I have the star
drawn again, and let's say we

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,120
know the following angles.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,316
We know this angle right
here is 41 degrees.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,710
We know this angle
here is 113 degrees.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,920
We know this angle
here is 101 degrees.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,070
And what we have to figure out
-- this is the goal of this

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,360
angle game -- we want to figure
out what this angle is.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,300
And like always, I encourage
you to try it on your own.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,500
Pause the video and then just
try to work it through.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,520
If you get stuck, then play
the video again and hopefully

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,450
I'll have a solution for you.

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,300
So pause right now, but
otherwise let me explain

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,300
how to do this.

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,895
So let's see, we know this,
this and this, and we're going

18
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:05,740
to figure out this angle.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,060
So how can we figure
out this angle?

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,490
What are the possible
strategies?

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,850
Well, if we knew this
angle here, we could say

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,140
they're supplementary.

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,060
But that angle seems like a
hard angle to figure out

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,610
too, because it's not a
part of any triangles.

25
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,260
But this angle is a
part of this triangle

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,550
right here, right?

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,940
So if we were able to figure
out this angle and this angle,

28
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,540
these green angles, if we're
able to figure out these green

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,840
angles, then we could figure
out this brown angle, which is

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,290
the goal of this angle game.

31
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,920
So, this could also be a good
time to pause because I

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,390
just gave you a hint.

33
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,930
This green angle, well it's
supplementary to this angle

34
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,300
right here, so that means it
adds up to 180 degrees, and

35
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,732
that's clear because it's
on kind of the same line.

36
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:52,180
So this is 101 degrees
and this is going to

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,900
be 79 degrees, right?

38
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,510
So it adds up to 180 degrees.

39
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,890
That's 79.

40
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,480
Now how can we figure
out this angle?

41
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,730
Well, it's kind of left by
itself out in the corner of

42
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,215
some place, so we could see if
it's part of any triangles.

43
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:13,030
But we already said it's
part of this triangle.

44
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,370
But that doesn't help us
because we don't know

45
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,330
this angle and that's
actually our goal.

46
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,560
What other triangles
is it a part of?

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,540
Well, it's a part of this
triangle right here.

48
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,120
That's why I like the star
problem because it has all

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,190
these triangles in it that
might not be obvious to you the

50
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,880
first time you look at it.

51
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,300
But the more you look at you
see all these triangles.

52
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,760
So it's part of this
triangle, and it's also

53
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,890
part of this triangle.

54
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,060
I'm going to draw this triangle
another color because I think

55
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,260
it'll be clear to you that this
is a useful triangle to see

56
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,020
that's it's a part of.

57
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,180
So we have that triangle.

58
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,790
So do we know two of the
angles of that triangle?

59
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,230
Well sure.

60
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,790
We know this angle and
we know this angle.

61
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,740
So we know that this angle plus
113 plus 41 is going to equal

62
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,050
180 degrees because of the
three angles of a triangle.

63
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,870
So let me call this, I
don't know, g for green.

64
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,850
Let's call this g for green.

65
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:28,970
So we know g plus 113 degrees,
that's this one right here,

66
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,800
plus 41 -- remember, we're
looking at this triangle;

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,810
that's the hardest part just
keeping track of which triangle

68
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,970
we're looking at -- is
going to equal 180 degrees.

69
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,300
g plus, what is this, 154?

70
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,580
Right?

71
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,140
40, 50, 154 equals 180 degrees.

72
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,170
That's always where I
mess up on the addition.

73
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,200
And so g is equal to, what is
this, 26 degrees, right,

74
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,510
because I just subtract
154 from both sides.

75
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,890
So we're almost there.

76
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,940
So we figured out g, we
know this green angle.

77
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,430
We just have to figure out
this, and they're all part

78
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,490
of this triangle, this
small one right here.

79
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,570
This small triangle.

80
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,460
So our goal, which is
let's call this x.

81
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,910
x plus g, which is 26 degrees
-- we just figured that out.

82
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,820
26 plus this angle, 79 -- and
we figured that out because it

83
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,010
was supplementary to this
angle -- is going to

84
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,320
equal 180 degrees.

85
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:38,536
So x plus, what is this,
105 equal to 180.

86
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:43,000
So x is equal to 75 degrees,
if I did my addition and

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,530
subtraction correctly.

88
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,660
So x is equal to 75 degrees.

89
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,520
And then we are done.

90
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,940
Let's do another one
of these problems.

91
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,300
And these problems are all
generated on the

92
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,220
Khan Academy website, dynamically
by the computer.

93
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,400
Whoever wrote this software
must be a genius.

94
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,530
But anyway, back
to the problems.

95
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,550
Let me draw some more.

96
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,790
So this is going to be a pretty
straightforward drawing.

97
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,270
It's pretty much just two
triangles next to each other.

98
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,860
Like that and then let me draw
another line that goes like

99
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,160
that, and then we draw a line
that goes like that, and I

100
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,940
think I have done my drawing.

101
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,060
There you go.

102
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,590
I'm have done my drawing.

103
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,000
So let's see.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,610
What do we know about this
triangle and what do

105
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,960
we need to figure out?

106
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm going to tell you that this
angle here, this big angle

107
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,495
here, is 86 degrees.

108
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,355
We also know that this
angle here is 28 degrees.

109
00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:00,590
And we also know that this
angle here is 122 degrees.

110
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,810
And our goal, our mission
in this round is to figure

111
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,390
out what this angle is.

112
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,670
And maybe we can do it, we
can do it in a good color.

113
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,560
Maybe we can do it in a
couple of different ways.

114
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,720
So one thing we could do is we
could figure out what this

115
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,470
angle is, so we could just
subtract this green angle from

116
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,270
86 and we would get our answer.

117
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,940
Well, this angle's easy, right,
because we know two angles

118
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,390
of this triangle, so we
could figure that out.

119
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,730
Let's just call this, I don't
know, let's call this y.

120
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:41,900
So y plus 122 plus 28 degrees
is going to equal 180.

121
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,420
So y plus 150 is equal to 180.

122
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,170
So y is equal to 30
degrees, right?

123
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,780
So this is equal to 30 degrees.

124
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,980
So this is 30 degrees, and
this big angle here is 86.

125
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,130
So our goal, let's call that x,
so x is going to just be equal

126
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:11,230
to the big angle, 86 minus this
angle we just figured

127
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,200
out, minus 30.

128
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,430
So x is going to be
equal to 50 degrees.

129
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,830
Done.

130
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,860
That was a pretty
straightforward problem.

131
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,260
Let's see if we could figure
that out any other way.

132
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,963
Well, we could say instead
of doing it that way --

133
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:28,490
let's forget we just
solved it that way.

134
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,660
We could say this angle here
is supplementary to this

135
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,230
122 degree angle, right, so
it has to add up to 180.

136
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,180
So this plus 122 is 180, so
what does that make this?

137
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,390
It makes this 58
degrees, right?

138
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,830
This plus this is
going to be 180.

139
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,040
So we figured out this.

140
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,740
If we could figure out
this, then we could

141
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,190
use this triangle.

142
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,800
How do we figure
out this angle?

143
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,340
Well, we could look at this big
triangle here, and we know

144
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,540
this side, right, and we
could figure out this.

145
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,410
Let's call this z.

146
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,130
So we know that z plus this
angle, plus 28, plus this big

147
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,620
angle, plus 86 is equal to 180.

148
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:26,070
So z plus, what is this,
106, 114 is equal to 180.

149
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,450
So z is equal to, what
is this, 66 degrees.

150
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,250
I don't know if I'm doing
any of my math correctly,

151
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,770
but let's just hope.

152
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,580
z equals 66.

153
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,000
So z is 66, this angle is 58,
and now we can use this

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,960
triangle here to figure out
what this angle is, our x.

155
00:08:47,960 --> 00:09:00,842
So x plus 66 plus 58
is equal to 180.

156
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:03,440
I already think I might
have made a mistake some

157
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,150
place in the addition.

158
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,080
So this time around I get x
is equal to -- let's see,

159
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,600
66 plus 58 is 110 plus 14.

160
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,110
So 180 minus 124.

161
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,600
So now I got it, x is
equal to 56 degrees.

162
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,350
Oh great, I actually
got the right answer.

163
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,500
I was looking at this, I
thought it was 50, but this

164
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,790
was 56, right -- 86 minus 30.

165
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,150
So x is equal to
56 degrees again.

166
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,420
So we did it two
different ways.

167
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,110
That's what I wanted
to show you.

168
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,790
There's actually not a right
answer, as long as you kind

169
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,970
of get there eventually.

170
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,900
We solved it two different ways
and I did all my addition and

171
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,940
subtraction correctly, and you
get the exact same answer.

172
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,730
So hopefully you find the angle
game fun and you'll be playing

173
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,000
this with your friends.

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,640
I'll see you later.
