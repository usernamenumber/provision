1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,740
Simplify the expression
28a to the fourth, b to the sixth,

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,370
over 7a to the ninth b.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,380
So a good place to start here
is to just try to kind of

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,520
break this up into things that
we can simplify a lot easier.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,255
So the 28 and 7, we know that
28 is divisible by 7.

7
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:22,490
So let's say we break that apart
into 28 times-- 28 over 7

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,030
-- and then we can
break this one apart--

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,380
a to the fourth 
over a to the ninth.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,100
So times a to the fourth
over a to the ninth.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,470
I'm just rewriting what we did
here, but I'm writing it as a

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,020
product of three terms instead
of just one term over here.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,710
And then finally, you have this
last term over here,

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,910
b to the sixth over b.

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,680
So times b to the
sixth over b.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,430
And if you multiplied all this
out, you'd take the product of

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,170
the numerators, you'd
get that up there.

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,200
You get the product of the
denominators, you'd get this

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,970
right there.

20
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,130
The whole reason I did that is
because each of these terms

21
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,170
can be simplified
pretty easily.

22
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,290
This 28 over 7, that's easy.

23
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,550
28 divided by 7 is 4.

24
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,770
Then we have the
a to the fourth

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,790
divided by a to the ninth.

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,240
And when you have an exponent
in the denominator, you can

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,850
subtract it from the exponent
in the numerator.

28
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,930
We have the same base,
a, that's why I

29
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,020
grouped it this way.

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,080
So this is going to be equal to
a to the 4 minus 9 power.

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,870
What's 4 minus 9?

32
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,510
It's negative 5.

33
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,110
4a to the negative 5.

34
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,890
4 minus 9.

35
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,080
And the same thing here
with the b's.

36
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,280
Times b.

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,080
6 minus-- you have a 1 here.

38
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,570
You don't see the 1,
but it's there.

39
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,850
If you just have a b, that's
the same thing

40
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,420
as b to the 1 power.

41
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,360
So b to the sixth divided by 
b to the 1 power is

42
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,240
b to the sixth minus 1, or 
b to the fifth power.

43
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,060
And we're done.

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,840
We've simplified
the expression.

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,750
If you don't want a negative
exponent there, you could say,

46
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:59,450
this is the same thing as
4 times 1 over a to the fifth

47
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,190
-- that's the same thing as
a to the negative 5;

48
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,740
- these two things are the same -
-- times b to the fifth.

49
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,900
And then this, of course, would
be equal to

50
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,500
4 b to the fifth, a to the fifth.

51
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,660
Or you could put 4 b to the fifth 
over a to the fifth.

52
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,850
All of these are legitimate
ways, but all of these are

53
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,350
simplified versions of our
original expression.

54
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,000
