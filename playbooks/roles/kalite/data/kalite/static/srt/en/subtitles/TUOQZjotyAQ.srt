1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,990
So let's see where
we left off.

3
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,130
We were studying the balance
sheet of this Bank A, I think

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,180
that's what I called it.

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,380
And we said, OK on the assets
side, had some government

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,540
bonds, had some AAA
corporate bonds,

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,970
some commercial mortgages.

8
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,530
And then this is the thing
that I really wanted to

9
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,160
highlight, that it also had
$4 billion of residential

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,600
collateralized debt
obligations.

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,070
And I explained little bit
about what those are.

12
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,850
And I have several videos
where I explain

13
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,170
that in more detail.

14
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,460
And how they probably led, or
most definitely led, to the

15
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,390
housing bubble.

16
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,950
And then we have a little bit
of cash on top of that.

17
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,530
On the liability side,
the bank just owes a

18
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,340
lot of money to people.

19
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,120
If this were a commercial bank,
kind of your Bank of

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,340
Americas, or your Chases of
the world, then one of the

21
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,590
liabilities here would have also
been the deposits of the

22
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,270
people who keep their
money at the bank.

23
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,510
But we're not going
to assume that.

24
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,040
This could be just
kind of any bank.

25
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,100
Actually, this could be any type
of financial institution.

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,640
Frankly, it doesn't
have to be a bank.

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,690
This could be the balance sheet
of a hedge fund, or a

28
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,800
private equity firm, or pretty
much any type of financial

29
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,600
institution.

30
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,810
But anyway, back to where
we were in the example.

31
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,950
We said, and we learned it in
the first video, and we

32
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,990
learned it in the balance sheet
video, that if you take

33
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,550
your assets and you subtract
out your liability-- so you

34
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,420
take what you have, you subtract
out what you owe,

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,600
you're left with what
you're really worth.

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,250
And that's called your equity.

37
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,330
And if you're a publicly traded
company, actually you

38
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,730
don't have to be publicly
traded, but if you're a

39
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,760
corporation, that's called your
shareholders' equity.

40
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,390
And what does that mean?

41
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,400
Well that means the people who
own a stake in the company, or

42
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,300
the shareholders, they
share this piece.

43
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,130
And just to hit the point home,
and I think this is an

44
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,000
important one because I
feel like people kind

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,480
of talk past this.

46
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,920
There's two notions, there's
your book value of equity, and

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,240
that's the value of the equity
that comes out of

48
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,070
your balance sheet.

49
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,530
So if you assume that
everything, all of these

50
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,690
numbers, are accurate-- and
we're going to think a lot

51
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,530
about what it means to have an
accurate number here-- and you

52
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,600
assume that all of these
numbers are accurate.

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,970
Then the number that pops out on
the equity side, that is a

54
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,340
book value of your equity.

55
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,710
And just as an example, I said
well let's say that Bank A is

56
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,430
a public company.

57
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,750
It has 500 million shares.

58
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,820
And so that means that if you
take its $3 billion of equity,

59
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,980
divide by 500 million shares,
that means that there is $6.00

60
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,350
of book equity per share.

61
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,870
So that means if all of these
numbers are correct, then the

62
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,490
stock of that company is
worth $6.00 per share.

63
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,470
Exactly $6.00 per share.

64
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,230
And you're saying, wait Sal,
that doesn't make sense, we

65
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,290
all know that the stock market
is a wild ride, especially

66
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,420
banking stocks.

67
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,180
They swing left and right
and up and down.

68
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,290
And how can you tell me that you
know just by looking at a

69
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,020
balance sheet, you can give an
exact amount for what its

70
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,220
equity value is?

71
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,490
And that is an important
distinction.

72
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,190
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

73
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,140
Maybe I'll erase this.

74
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,810
Actually, let me
clear this out.

75
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,550
I think it's a distraction.

76
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,010
You might just want to watch the
video on mortgage-backed

77
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,420
securities and collateralized
debt obligations if you need a

78
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,680
refresher there.

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,970
So what does it mean when, I'm
telling you right now that you

80
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,660
can look at it company's balance
sheet, and if you

81
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,520
believe what they say, you can
actually calculate a book

82
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,100
value per share.

83
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,640
So why do stocks fluctuate
wildly left and right?

84
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,750
Well, it's interesting.

85
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,420
It actually tells you a lot
about what the market thinks

86
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,860
about a company's
balance sheet.

87
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,910
Let me fill this in.

88
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,310
This was $26 billion
of assets.

89
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,540
And then I had $23 billion
of liabilities.

90
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,970
And that's how we got equity
of $3 billion.

91
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,830
And book equity per share,
or the book value

92
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,810
per share of $6.00.

93
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,910
Now let's say we go on to Yahoo
Finance and we type in

94
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,236
the ticker symbol for this
bank-- Bank A, whatever we

95
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:46,960
want to call it.

96
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,840
And let's say that its market
price is I don't know, it is

97
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,560
$12.00 per share.

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,380
So what is happening here?

99
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,180
The book value is $6.00, but the
market saying no, no, no,

100
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,380
we are willing to pay
$12.00 per share for

101
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:05,900
one of those shares.

102
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,240
And just to make a point here,
when you look up a share price

103
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,550
in the stock market, or even
better, when you buy a stock

104
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,720
on the stock market,
that money is not

105
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,170
going to the company.

106
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,660
The company initially raises
money by selling shares.

107
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,980
And that's often done with an
initial public offering.

108
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,360
They will sell some shares
directly to the market.

109
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,230
And that money goes directly
to the company.

110
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,120
Or they might do it in an
offering, and we'll talk more

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,820
about that later.

112
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,260
But 99% of the time, when you
buy a share, it is not going

113
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,180
to the company.

114
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,070
It is going to the previous
person who held that share.

115
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,660
That's why it's called
a secondary market.

116
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,780
It's not going to the company.

117
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,290
So it's just a bunch of people
trading the share price.

118
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,720
And the only reason why that
share price really

119
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,930
fundamentally matters to the
company is if the company were

120
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,370
to raise money at
a future date.

121
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,700
So let's say the share price
today is $12.00.

122
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,860
Let's say I bought a share for
$12.00 dollars a share today,

123
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,520
that means maybe I bought
it from you.

124
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,710
I didn't buy from the company.

125
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,010
But that at least tells the
company that if it needed

126
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,520
money, if it needed to raise
money, it could sell shares

127
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,200
probably at something close
to $12.00 a share.

128
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,490
It also tells someone who wanted
to buy out the whole

129
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,890
company, so if they wanted to
take over the company, that

130
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,400
maybe if they offered some type
of a premium to $12.00 a

131
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,700
share, they could buy out
all of the stock.

132
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,130
But that's not the
topic for this.

133
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,920
And actually, the more I think
about it, I really should do

134
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,980
videos on all of
these concepts.

135
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,960
But anyway, so the market is
giving a $12.00 per share

136
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,860
value, what does that mean?

137
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,860
The person who's paying $12.00
a share is assuming that this

138
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,290
is understated, the book
value is understated.

139
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,610
And so if the book value is
understated, that means that

140
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,180
either the assets are
understated, or the

141
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,530
liabilities are overstated.

142
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,510
Most times the liabilities
are pretty easy to

143
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,220
get a handle on.

144
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,300
Sometimes pension liabilities
or some type of litigation

145
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,140
liabilities, that's hard
to get a grasp on.

146
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,470
But most times, you can look
at a balance sheet and you

147
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,300
say, OK this is the
money they owe.

148
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,560
That's not too hard to value.

149
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,250
What is often very interesting
to value are the assets on a

150
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,200
balance sheet.

151
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,650
So, with this balance sheet, you
would say $6.00 per share,

152
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,380
but the market is willing
to say $12.00.

153
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,920
Then you say, either these
assets or somehow being

154
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,930
undervalued or the company might
have some assets that

155
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,850
somehow are not captured on
the balance sheet, right?

156
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,380
Maybe they're intangible
assets.

157
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,130
Or there's some type of earning
power that in some way

158
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,030
is not captured here.

159
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,515
I think when I originally did
the videos on balance sheets,

160
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:31,820
I actually talked about you
can't quantify charisma and

161
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,500
good looks.

162
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,665
And so that's maybe why I have
more assets than might balance

163
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:37,370
sheet might predict.

164
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,450
Well, this notion is
the same thing, but

165
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,640
on the company level.

166
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,370
Maybe, if this were Goldman
Sachs' balance sheet, maybe

167
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,810
its book value per
share is $6.00.

168
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,220
But the market is willing to pay
$12.00 for it because it's

169
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,450
Goldman Sachs.

170
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,550
That's the corporate equivalent
of charisma and

171
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,190
good looks.

172
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,580
They say, just by their brand
they're able to make more

173
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,570
money than everyone else.

174
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,340
They're able to do more with
whatever assets we give them.

175
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,240
So I'm willing to pay a premium
to their book value.

176
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,580
And whether or not that's true,
that's a tough case.

177
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,200
I think that argument can very
easily be made with a company

178
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,140
like Coca-Cola, where it does
have a very powerful brand.

179
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,180
Where that brand and that
formula, that secret formula,

180
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,540
really are the value of the
firm, and they probably aren't

181
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,960
captured on their
balance sheet.

182
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,250
With a bank, I'd be a little
more skeptical of paying a

183
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,220
significant multiple
of this, right?

184
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,650
Here, what multiple
are we paying?

185
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,670
If this is the market value-- so
let's say this is the stock

186
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:38,900
price, or the market stock
price-- I'd be skeptical of

187
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,830
paying two times
the book value.

188
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,110
But it's actually not hard to
find a lot of companies that

189
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,670
are trading at far more than
two times the book value.

190
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,460
So that's what it means.

191
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,980
That's what the market is
essentially saying if they're

192
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,300
paying $12.00 a share for
something that essentially has

193
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,130
a book value of $6.00
per share.

194
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,660
Or maybe one of these assets
are worth more.

195
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,320
Maybe they had, on the books,
there's a property here in

196
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,990
Manhattan that they bought 50
years ago that they have it on

197
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,950
the books for $0.50.

198
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,580
But maybe the shareholders say,
oh no that's really worth

199
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,640
a million dollars or something,
I don't know.

200
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,570
Another way to think about it
is, if the market is paying

201
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,710
$12 million per share, what's
the market cap of the company?

202
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,020
And the market cap of the
company is really what's the

203
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,370
market's guess of what the
shareholders' equity is?

204
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,870
So the market cap, you take $12
per share, multiply it by

205
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,010
500 million shares.

206
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,930
So 12 times 500 million, or
let's say 0.5 billion.

207
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,580
And you get a $6 billion
market cap.

208
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,750
So if the equity is trading,
or if the stock is trading,

209
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,940
that day at $12.00 dollars per
share, that says that the

210
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,620
market, or at least the people
on the margin trading that

211
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,760
stock that day-- and I'll do
not another whole set of

212
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,350
videos on what that means
and how prices are set.

213
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,250
But that means that they think
that this equity isn't $3

214
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,680
billion, that it's actually
worth $6 billion.

215
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,630
I told you for all the reasons,
maybe the brand is

216
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,640
worth a lot, or they have some
secret formula, or one of

217
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,120
these assets somehow
is understated.

218
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,690
So that's fine.

219
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,700
That's the situation where
the market price is

220
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,090
above the book value.

221
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,210
But what's the situation where,
let's say that on that

222
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:18,830
day of trading, the share price
is that $3.00 per share.

223
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,770
Well if we say 3 times 0.5
billion, that means that the

224
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,040
market says that this company's

225
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,150
market cap is 1.5 billion.

226
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,950
Or another way of viewing it,
is that this is the market's

227
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,730
guess, or you could
call it the market

228
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,610
value of the equity.

229
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,880
This is the market's guess
of the value of

230
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,520
this company's equity.

231
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,800
So the market says, OK I don't
care that Bank A says that

232
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,090
they have $3 billion, that their
assets minus liabilities

233
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,150
are $3 billion.

234
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,100
We don't buy it.

235
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,510
We actually think this is
only worth $1.5 billion.

236
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,380
And it's probably because they
think that one of these things

237
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,390
on the left-hand side of the
balance sheet, one of these

238
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,120
assets, are worth less
than what the bank

239
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,340
says they're worth.

240
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,540
It could be that one of these
liabilities is worth more.

241
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,180
Maybe there's some type of
environmental liability that

242
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,310
the company is somehow
understating.

243
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,000
But let's not get too
complicated right now, I'll do

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,200
a bunch of videos on that.

245
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,240
But when the market value, or
the market cap, is below the

246
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,040
book equity, that's the market
just saying, hey we're calling

247
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,920
your bluff.

248
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,510
Something here doesn't
smell right.

249
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,030
Something here isn't worth
what you say it's worth.

250
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,390
And I just realized that
I'm out of time.

251
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,470
And I will continue this
in the next video.

252
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:31,900
