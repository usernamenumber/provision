1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,770
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,750
So we have this green spring
here, and let's see,

4
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,910
there's a wall here.

5
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,080
This connected to the wall.

6
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,690
And let's say that this is where
the spring is naturally.

7
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,560
So if I were not to push on the
spring, it would stretch

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,040
all the way out here.

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,410
But in this situation, I pushed
on the spring, so it

10
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,560
has a displacement
of x to the left.

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,450
And we'll just worry about
magnitude, so we won't worry

12
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,770
too much about direction.

13
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,680
So what I want to do is think
a little bit-- well, first I

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,710
want to graph how much force
I've applied at different

15
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,920
points as I compress
this spring.

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,140
And then I want to use that
graph to maybe figure out how

17
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,270
much work we did in compressing
the spring.

18
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:45,300
So let's look at-- I know I'm
compressing to the left.

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,990
Maybe I should compress to the
right, so that you can-- well,

20
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,050
we're just worrying about the
magnitude of the x-axis.

21
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,960
Let's draw a little
graph here.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,050
That's my y-axis, x-axis.

23
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,960
   

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,350
So this axis is how much I've
compressed it, x, and then

25
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,170
this axis, the y-axis, is how
much force I have to apply.

26
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,850
So when the spring was initially
all the way out

27
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,180
here, to compress it a little
bit, how much force

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,670
do I have to apply?

29
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,950
Well, this was its natural
state, right?

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,190
And we know from-- well, Hooke's
Law told us that the

31
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,570
restorative force-- I'll write
a little r down here-- is

32
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,400
equal to negative K, where K is
the spring constant, times

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,010
the displacement, right?

34
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,580
That's the restorative force,
so that's the force that the

35
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,470
spring applies to whoever's
pushing on it.

36
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,260
The force to compress it is just
the same thing, but it's

37
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,980
going in the same direction
as the x.

38
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,310
If I'm moving the spring, if I'm
compressing the spring to

39
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,310
the left, then the force I'm
applying is also to the left.

40
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,030
So I'll call that the force
of compression.

41
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,290
The force of compression
is going to be

42
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,270
equal to K times x.

43
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,440
And when the spring is
compressed and not

44
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,680
accelerating in either
direction, the force of

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,320
compression is going
to be equal to

46
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,730
the restorative force.

47
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,120
So what I want to do here is
plot the force of compression

48
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,450
with respect to x.

49
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,320
And I should have drawn it the
other way, but I think you

50
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,810
understand that x is increasing
to the left in my

51
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,760
example, right?

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,270
This is where x is equal
to 0 right here.

53
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,220
And say, this might be x is
equal to 10 because we've

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,030
compressed it by 10 meters.

55
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,530
So let's see how much
force we've applied.

56
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,120
So when x is 0, which is right
here, how much force do we

57
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,300
need to apply to compress
the spring?

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,600
Well, if we give zero force, the
spring won't move, but if

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,640
we just give a little, little
bit of force, if we just give

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,370
infinitesimal, super-small
amount of force, we'll

61
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,980
compress the spring just
a little bit, right?

62
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,530
Because at that point, the force
of compression is going

63
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,340
to be pretty much zero.

64
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,830
So when the spring is barely
compressed, we're going to

65
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:12,380
apply a little, little bit of
force, so almost at zero.

66
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,330
To displace the spring zero,
we apply zero force.

67
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,630
To displace the spring a little
bit, we have to apply a

68
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,290
little bit more force.

69
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,830
To displace soon. the spring 1
meter, so if this is say, 1

70
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:28,870
meter, how much force
will we have to

71
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,380
apply to keep it there?

72
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,690
So let's say if this is
1 meter, the force of

73
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,630
compression is going to
be K times 1, so it's

74
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,880
just going to be K.

75
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,770
   

76
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,790
And realize, you didn't apply
zero and then apply K force.

77
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,650
You keep applying a little
bit more force.

78
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,410
Every time you compress the
spring a little bit, it takes

79
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,670
a little bit more force to
compress it a little bit more.

80
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,950
So to compress it 1 meters,
you need to apply K.

81
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,770
And to get it there, you have to
keep increasing the amount

82
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,735
of force you apply.

83
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:10,330
At 2 meters, you would've been
up to 2K, et cetera.

84
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,900
I think you see a
line is forming.

85
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,650
Let me draw that line.

86
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,480
The line looks something
like that.

87
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,920
And so this is how much force
you need to apply as a

88
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,210
function of the displacement of
the spring from its natural

89
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,190
rest state, right?

90
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,530
And here I have positive x going
to the right, but in

91
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,790
this case, positive
x is to the left.

92
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,470
I'm just measuring its
actual displacement.

93
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,460
I'm not worried too much about
direction right now.

94
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,320
So I just want you to think
a little bit about what's

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,350
happening here.

96
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,330
You just have to slowly keep
on-- you could apply a very

97
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,920
large force initially.

98
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,820
If you apply a very large force
initially, the spring

99
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,620
will actually accelerate much
faster, because you're

100
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,150
applying a much larger force
than its restorative force,

101
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,210
and so it might accelerate and
then it'll spring back, and

102
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,910
actually, we'll do a little
example of that.

103
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,260
But really, just to displace the
spring a certain distance,

104
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,730
you have to just gradually
increase the force, just so

105
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,530
that you offset the
restorative force.

106
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,780
Hopefully, that makes sense,
and you understand that the

107
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,280
force just increases
proportionally as a function

108
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,250
of the distance, and
that's just because

109
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,700
this is a linear equation.

110
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,430
And what's the slope of this?

111
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,250
Well, slope is rise
over run, right?

112
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,350
So if I run 1, this is
1, what's my rise?

113
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,340
It's K.

114
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,590
So the slope of this
graph is K.

115
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,400
So using this graph, let's
figure out how much work we

116
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,400
need to do to compress
this spring.

117
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,650
I don't know, let's
say this is x0.

118
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,115
So x is where it's the
general variable.

119
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:42,840
X0 is a particular
value for x.

120
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,390
That could be 10 or whatever.

121
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,360
Let's see how much
work we need.

122
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,380
So what's the definition
of work?

123
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,750
Work is equal to the force
in the direction of your

124
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,770
displacement times the
displacement, right?

125
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,550
So let's see how much
we've displaced.

126
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:05,370
So when we go from zero
to here, we've

127
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,810
displaced this much.

128
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,950
And what was the force
of the displacement?

129
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,890
Well, the force was gradually
increasing the entire time, so

130
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,330
the force is going to be be
roughly about that big.

131
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm approximating.

132
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,960
And I'll show you that you
actually have to approximate.

133
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,480
So the force is kind of that
square right there.

134
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,980
   

135
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,560
And then to displace the next
little distance-- that's not

136
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,830
bright enough-- my force is
going to increase a little

137
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,770
bit, right?

138
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,120
So this is the force, this
is the distance.

139
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,000
So if you you see, the work I'm
doing is actually going to

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,880
be the area under the
curve, each of

141
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,890
these rectangles, right?

142
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,080
Because the height of the
rectangle is the force I'm

143
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,340
applying and the width is
the distance, right?

144
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,960
So the work is just going to
be the sum of all of these

145
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,740
rectangles.

146
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,450
And the rectangles I drew are
just kind of approximations,

147
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,590
because they don't get
right under the line.

148
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,590
You have to keep making the
rectangle smaller, smaller,

149
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,660
smaller, and smaller, and just
sum up more and more and more

150
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,360
rectangles, right?

151
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,880
And actually I'm touching on
integral calculus right now.

152
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,130
But if you don't know
integral calculus,

153
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:09,950
don't worry about it.

154
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,310
But the bottom line is the work
we're doing-- hopefully I

155
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,290
showed you-- is just going to
be the area under this line.

156
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,910
So the work I'm doing to
displace the spring x meters

157
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:26,020
is the area from here to here.

158
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,430
And what's that area?

159
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,590
Well, this is a triangle, so we
just need to know the base,

160
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,810
the height, and multiply
it times 1/2, right?

161
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,530
That's just the area
of a triangle.

162
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,050
So what's the base?

163
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,860
So this is just x0.

164
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,520
What's the height?

165
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,360
Well, we know the slope is K, so
this height is going to be

166
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,750
x0 times K.

167
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,370
So this point right here
is the point x0, and

168
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,610
then x0 times K.

169
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,840
And so what's the area under the
curve, which is the total

170
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,090
work I did to compress
the spring x0 meters?

171
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:09,500
Well, it's the base, x0, times
the height, x0, times K.

172
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,280
And then, of course, multiply by
1/2, because we're dealing

173
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,420
with a triangle, right?

174
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,230
So that equals 1/2K
x0 squared.

175
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,050
And for those of you who know
calculus, that, of course, is

176
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,910
the same thing as the
integral of Kx dx.

177
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,080
And that should make sense.

178
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,180
Each of these are little dx's.

179
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,490
But I don't want to go too
much into calculus now.

180
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,340
It'll confuse people.

181
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,950
So that's the total work
necessary to compress the

182
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,950
spring by distance of x0.

183
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,659
Or if we set a distance
of x, you can just get

184
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,340
rid of this 0 here.

185
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,770
And why is that useful?

186
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,700
Because the work necessary to
compress the spring that much

187
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,800
is also how much potential
energy there is

188
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,340
stored in the spring.

189
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:57,750
So if I told you that I had a
spring and its spring constant

190
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,890
is 10, and I compressed it 5
meters, so x is equal to 5

191
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,800
meters, at the time that it's
compressed, how much potential

192
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,780
energy is in that spring?

193
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,940
We can just say the potential
energy is equal to 1/2K times

194
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,790
x squared equals 1/2.

195
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:25,050
K is 10 times 25, and
that equals 125.

196
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,920
And, of course, work and
potential energy

197
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,980
are measured in joules.

198
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,110
So this is really what you
just have to memorize.

199
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,240
Or hopefully you don't
memorize it.

200
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,700
Hopefully, you understand where
I got it, and that's why

201
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,030
I spent 10 minutes doing it.

202
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,940
But this is how much work is
necessary to compress the

203
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,030
spring to that point and how
much potential energy is

204
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,790
stored once it is compressed
to that point, or actually

205
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,490
stretched that much.

206
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,520
We've been compressing,
but you can

207
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,690
also stretch the spring.

208
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,730
If you know that, then we can
start doing some problems with

209
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,060
potential energy in springs,
which I will

210
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,110
do in the next video.

211
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,360

212
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,400
