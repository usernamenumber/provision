1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,800
if we were to buy the stock for 50 dollars

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,867
so this is a situation where we're buying the stock

3
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:09,000
we're clearly putting 50 dollars up front

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,667
and if the stock moved up

5
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,333
to 80 dollars and we were perfectly able to call the top

6
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,425
and sell it for that 80 dollars

7
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:17,236
we would make a 30 dollar profit

8
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:20,800
off of a 50 dollar initial investment

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,071
so that's a 60 percent gain

10
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:24,641
that's a 60% gain

11
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:26,102
on our upront capital

12
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:28,718
now on the other side if the stock were to go down

13
00:00:28,718 --> 00:00:31,759
to 20 dollars we would lose 30 dollars

14
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:35,582
of our 50 dollar upfront investment

15
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:37,867
so it would be a 60% loss

16
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:39,944
so in the buying the stock

17
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:42,000
based on the scenario that I painted

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,308
we could lose 60% or we could lose 60%

19
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:47,892
and in terms of the potential upside you can gain

20
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:52,246
an unlimited amount because the stock can just really go to any possible value

21
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:54,077
and int terms of loss, when you buy a stock,

22
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:57,162
the most you can lose is 100%

23
00:00:57,162 --> 00:01:05,200
now let's think about the scenario with the call option

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,867
To buy the call option it only costs us 5 dollars

25
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,733
so we only had to put 5 dollars up front

26
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:14,667
and in this scenario where the stock went up to 80 dollars

27
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:20,867
we figured out we could profit 15 dollars net of the price of the option

28
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:23,000
so on a base of a 5 dollars investment

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,995
we were able to get 15 dollars of profit

30
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:29,554
so we got a 300% gain

31
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:32,108
we were able to get a 300% gain

32
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:35,333
on the other hand, if the stock went down,

33
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,677
we had no reason to actually excersize our option

34
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:43,667
so we essentially just lost all the money in the option

35
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:47,015
We lost 100%

36
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:48,800
and what I want to show here is that

37
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,000
the option gave us leverage

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
it gave us leverage

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,256
and the term comes from physics

40
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:59,333
because a lever will give you mechanical leverage

41
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,467
it can allow you to exert more force than you otherwise could

42
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:04,533
by using that simple tool

43
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:07,733
and a call option is giving you financial leverage

44
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:11,267
You're essentially making the same bet

45
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:13,867
but you're multiplying your potenital gain

46
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,800
or your potenital loss

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,867
the stock in the good scenario, you made 60%

48
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:26,400
but in the call option in the good scenario, you make 300%

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,800
we multiplied, we multiplied out gain

50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,533
But on the downside with the stock we lost 60%

51
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:37,400
but with the call option we lost 100%

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,867
so once again, we multiplied our loss

53
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,267
here it looks like our numbers are still favorable,

54
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:47,200
because our loss multiplication wasn't as much as our gain multiplication,

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,267
but this is really based on some of the numbers I chose

56
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,333
but the important thing to realize is

57
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,667
that if you're dealing with an option

58
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,067
it's the same bet

59
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,733
the bet that the company will go up

60
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:59,667
you're just putting leverage on your bet,

61
00:02:59,667 --> 99:59:59,999
multiplying your gains or losses
