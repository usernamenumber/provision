1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:06,870
We're asked to write 7/8 as a
decimal and as a percent.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,620
We'll start off with a decimal,
and we'll see it's

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,260
pretty easy to go from a
decimal to a percent.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,660
Now, whenever you see a problem
like this, it's

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,510
sometimes confusing.

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,000
It's like, how do I even get
it into a decimal, or as a

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,380
fraction over 100, or
as a percentage?

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,160
And you always have to remember
7 over 8, or 7/8, is

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,490
the exact same thing.

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,120
   

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,090
This means literally
7 divided by 8.

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,830
Not 8 divided by 7.

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,180
7 divided by 8.

15
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,580
The numerator divided
by the denominator.

16
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,260
And you say, well, how do I
turn that into a decimal?

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,010
Well, we just literally do a
long division problem, but we

18
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,410
keep going behind the decimal
point, so that we don't end up

19
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,860
with a remainder, or until we
end up with things repeating.

20
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,540
You'll see what we mean.

21
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,330
In this case, we won't end up
with anything repeating.

22
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,790
So let's try this out.

23
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,555
So it's 7 divided by 8.

24
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:03,070
   

25
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,910
So how many times does
8 go into 7?

26
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,530
Well, 8 does not go into 7.

27
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,250
It goes zero times.

28
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,180
And actually, just so that we
make sure that everything's

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,280
clean, let's put our decimal.

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,020
You can view this as
8 going into 7.000.

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,940
You can keep adding as many
zeroes as you need until

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,130
you're done dividing.

33
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,970
So we have our decimal point
right here, right behind the 7

34
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,640
where it was up here.

35
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,230
So we say 8 goes into
7 zero times.

36
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,090
0 times 8 is 0.

37
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,410
You subtract.

38
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,520
7 minus 0 is 7.

39
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,980
Now we can bring down a 0.

40
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,230
We bring down a 0.

41
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,570
It becomes 70.

42
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,010
And then you say 8 goes into
70 how many times?

43
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,370
Well, 8 times 8 is 64,
so that works.

44
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,950
8 times 9 is 72.

45
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,980
That's too big.

46
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,230
So it goes into it
eight times.

47
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,730
   

48
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,250
8 times 8 is 64.

49
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:03,060
When you subtract,
70 minus 64 is 6.

50
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,080
You still have a remainder,
so let's keep going.

51
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,260
Let's bring down another 0.

52
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,580
So you bring down another 0
right over there, and so you

53
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,520
say, how many times
does 8 go into 60?

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,480
8 times 8 is 64, so
that's too big.

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,670
8 times 7 is 56, so
that'll work.

56
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,680
So it goes into 60
seven times.

57
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,800
7 times 8 is 56.

58
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,010
You subtract.

59
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,300
60 minus 56 is 4.

60
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,780
So we still have a remainder,
so let's keep bringing down

61
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,970
some zeroes.

62
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,210
So let's bring this
0 down here.

63
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,710
And 8 goes into 40
how many times?

64
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,690
Well, 8 times 5 is 40, so it
goes in nice and evenly.

65
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,400
So it goes into it five times.

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,880
5 times 8 is 40.

67
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,890
Subtract.

68
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,200
No remainder.

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,450
So as a decimal, we just figured
out that 7/8, which is

70
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:04,820
equal to 7 divided by
8, is exactly 0.875.

71
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:11,390
So 7/8 as a decimal
is equal to 0.875.

72
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,490
Now we've done the
decimal part.

73
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,200
Now the next thing is
to do a percent.

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,520
And if you have it as a decimal,
doing it as a percent

75
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,160
is very easy.

76
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,440
You literally shift the decimal
place two to the

77
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,280
right, and you put a
percent sign there.

78
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,930
And I think it makes
sense why it works.

79
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,520
Now you're going to say,
how many per hundred?

80
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,600
You can view this as
875 thousandths.

81
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,430
Let me write this down.

82
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,800
You can view this
as a fraction.

83
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,050
You could say, well, this is the
same thing as 875/1,000.

84
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,620
That's how we've read it in
the past. This is the

85
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,950
thousandths spot right here.

86
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:53,340
Or you could read this
as 87.5/100.

87
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,570
If you just go two decimal
places, it's 87.5/100.

88
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,060
Or if you just took this, and
you divide the numerator and

89
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,170
the denominator by 10,
you would get this.

90
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,700
And this is literally saying
87.5 per 100, So this second

91
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,195
statement right here, this is
literally saying 87.5 per

92
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:15,560
hundred, or per cent.

93
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,440
So this is equal to 87.5%.

94
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,560
So that gives you the reasoning
for why it works,

95
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,300
but the really easy way, if you
have a decimal, to make it

96
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,710
into a percent, you literally
multiply the number by 100 and

97
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,820
put the percent there, which
is essentially telling you

98
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,090
that you're going to divide by
100, so you're multiplying and

99
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,040
dividing by 100.

100
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,460
So if you multiply this by 100,
which is equivalent to

101
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,520
shifting the decimal place two
places to the right, that

102
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,570
literally would become
87.5, then you

103
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,630
want to put the percent.

104
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,310
This says this is going
to be over 100.

105
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,360
So you multiply by 100, and
then divide by 100.

106
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,510
You're not really changing
the number.

107
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,010
Hopefully, that makes sense.

108
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,820
Another way to remember, because
sometimes you might

109
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,280
get confused-- Do I put the
decimal to the right?

110
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,550
Do I take it to the left--
is that the decimal

111
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,890
representation will always be
smaller than the percent

112
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,940
representation.

113
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,820
And not only will it be smaller,
but it will be

114
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,060
smaller by exactly
a factor of 100.

115
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,870
This is 100 times smaller
of a number right here

116
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,910
than just the 87.5.

117
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,980
Obviously, when you put this
percent here, these become the

118
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,390
exact same number.

119
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,599
