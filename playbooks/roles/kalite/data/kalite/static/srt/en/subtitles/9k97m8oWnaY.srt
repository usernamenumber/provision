1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,140
In the last video, we finished
off with these two results.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,850
We started off just thinking
about what it means to take

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,000
the partial derivative of
vector-valued function, and I

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
got to these kind of, you might
call them, bizarre results.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,230
You know, what was the whole
point in getting here, Sal?

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,820
And the whole point is so that
I can give you the tools you

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,840
need to understand what
a surface integral is.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,320
So let's just think about,
let's draw the st plane,

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,640
and then see how it gets
transformed into

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,720
this surface r.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,620
So let's do that.

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,490
   

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:43,760
Let's say that is the t-axis,
and let's say that that is the

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,240
s-axis, and let's say that our
vector-valued function, our

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,550
positioned vector-valued
function, is defined from s's

17
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,590
between a and b, I'm just
picking arbitrary boundaries,

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,550
and between t being
equal to c and d.

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,250
   

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,320
So the area under question, if
you take any t and any s in

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,710
this rectangle right here, it
will be mapped to part

22
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,890
of that surface.

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,100
And if you map each of these
points, you will eventually

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,130
get the surface r.

25
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,250
So let me draw r
in 3 dimensions.

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,770
A surface in 3D.

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:33,090
So that is our x-axis, that
is our y-axis, and then

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,930
that is the z-axis.

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,780
And just as a bit of a
reminder, it might look

30
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,370
something like this.

31
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,570
If we were to, this point right
here, where s is equal to a,

32
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,560
and t is equal to c, remember,
we're going to draw the surface

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,540
indicated by the position
vector function

34
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,380
s, r of s and t.

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,230
So this point right here, when
s is a and t is c, maybe it

36
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,120
maps to, I'm just, you
know, that point!

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,070
Right there.

38
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,540
When you take a and c, and you
put it into this thing over

39
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,870
here, you're just going to get
the vector that points at that.

40
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,840
So you could say, it'll
give you a position vector

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,170
that'll point right at that
position, right there.

42
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,407
And then, let's say that this
line, right here, if we were to

43
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:31,570
hold s constant at a, and if we
were to just vary t from c

44
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,810
to d, maybe that looks
something like this.

45
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,080
I'm just drawing some
arbitrary contour there.

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,980
Maybe if we hold t constant at
c, and vary s from a to b,

47
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,210
maybe that'll look at
something like that.

48
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,980
I don't know.

49
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,980
I'm just trying to
show you an example.

50
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,150
So this point right here would
correspond to that point right

51
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,380
there, when you put it into the
vector-valued function r, you

52
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,420
would get a vector that points
to that point, just like that.

53
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,710
And this point right here in
purple, when you evaluate r of

54
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,660
s and t, it'll give you a
vector that points right there,

55
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,850
to that point over there, and
we could do a couple of other

56
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,430
points, just to get an idea of
what the surface looks like,

57
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,390
although I'm trying to keep
things as general as possible.

58
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,730
So maybe, let me do it
in this bluish color.

59
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:37,350
This, if we hold p at d and
vary s from a to b, we're

60
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,230
going to start here.

61
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,540
This is when t is d and s is a.

62
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,880
And when you vary it, maybe
you get something like that.

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,320
I don't know.

64
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,900
So this point right here would
correspond to a vector that

65
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,430
points to that point, right
there, and then finally this

66
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,600
line, or this, if we hold s at
b and vary t between c and d,

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,480
we're going to go from that
point, to that point.

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,140
So it's going to look something
like this-- oh, sorry, we're

69
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,630
going to go from this
point to that point.

70
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,580
We're holding s at b, varying
t from c to d, maybe it

71
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,290
looks something like that.

72
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:26,200
So our surface, we went from
this nice rectangular area in

73
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,250
the ts plane, and it gets
transformed into this

74
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,880
wacky-looking surface.

75
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,920
We could even draw some
other things right here.

76
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,150
Let's say we get some
arbitrary value.

77
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,720
Let me pick a new color,
I'll do it in white.

78
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,430
Or a new noncolor.

79
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,860
And let's say if we hold s at
that constant value and we

80
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,220
vary t, maybe that will look
for something like this.

81
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,690
Maybe that we'll look something
like, well, I don't know.

82
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,180
Maybe it'll look
something like that.

83
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,520
So you get an idea of what
the surface might look like.

84
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,140
Now, given this, I want
to think about what

85
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,350
these quantities are.

86
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,830
And then when we visualize what
these quantities are, we'll be

87
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,630
able to kind of use these
results of the last videos

88
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,160
to do something that I
think will be useful.

89
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,330
So let's say that we
pick arbitrary s and t.

90
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,860
So this is the point, let me
just we pick it right here.

91
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,140
   

92
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,020
That is the point s, t.

93
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,090
s comma t.

94
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,390
If you were to put those values
in here maybe it maps to, and I

95
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,850
want to make sure I'm
consistent with everything I've

96
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,720
drawn, maybe it maps to
this point right here.

97
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,430
Maybe it maps to that
point right there.

98
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:52,620
So this point right here,
that is r of s and t.

99
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,940
For a particular s and t.

100
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,650
I mean, I could put little
subscripts here, but

101
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,790
I want to be general.

102
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,070
I could call this a, well,
I already used a and b.

103
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,010
I could call this x and y,
this would be r of x and y.

104
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,820
It would map to that
point, right there.

105
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,090
So that right there,
or that right there.

106
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,500
Now let's see what happens
if we take, if we move

107
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,790
just in the s direction.

108
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,270
So this is we could
do that as s.

109
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,310
Now let us move forward
by a differential, by a

110
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,310
super small amount of s.

111
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,830
So this right here, let's
call that a s plus a super

112
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,150
small differential in s.

113
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,910
That's right there.

114
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,850
So that point.

115
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,430
Let me do that in a better
color, in this yellow.

116
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,320
So that point right there
is the point s plus

117
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,080
my differential of s.

118
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,550
I could write delta s, but
I wanted a super small

119
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,560
change in s, comma t.

120
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,490
And what is that going
to get mapped to?

121
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,380
Well, if we apply these two
point in r, we're going to

122
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,660
get something that maybe
is right over there.

123
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,570
And I want to be very clear.

124
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:11,190
This right here, that is
r of s plus ds comma t.

125
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,850
That's what that is.

126
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,520
That's the point when we just
shift s by a super small

127
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,000
differential, this distance
here, you can view as ds.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,400
It's a super small change in s.

129
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,930
And then when we map it or
transform it, or put that

130
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,180
point into our vector-valued
function, let me copy and paste

131
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,600
the original vector-valued
function, just so we have a

132
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,900
good image of what we're
talking about this whole time.

133
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:41,080
   

134
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,620
Let me put it right down there.

135
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:51,000
So just to be clear what's
going on, when we took this

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,160
little blue point right here,
this s and t, and we put the s

137
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,480
and t values here, we get a
vector that points to that

138
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,560
point on the surface,
right there.

139
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,770
When you add a ds to your
s-values, you get a vector

140
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,660
that points at that
yellow point right there.

141
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,570
   

142
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,695
So going back to the results we
got in the last presentation,

143
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,640
or the last video,
what is this?

144
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,967
r of s plus delta s, or r of s
plus ds, the differential of

145
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:27,250
s, t, well, that is
that, right there.

146
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,020
That is the vector that
points to that position.

147
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,190
This right here is a vector
that points to this

148
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,480
blue position.

149
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,760
So what is the difference
of those two vectors?

150
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,430
And this is a bit of
basic vector math,

151
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,060
you might remember.

152
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,910
The difference of these two
vectors, head to tails.

153
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,830
The difference of these
two vectors is going

154
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,020
to be this vector.

155
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,450
If you subtract this vector
that vector, you're going to

156
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,190
get that vector, right there.

157
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,695
   

158
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:57,650
A vector that looks
just like that.

159
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,380
So that's what this is
equal to, that vector.

160
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,340
And it makes sense.

161
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,450
This blue vector plus the
orange vector, this vector,

162
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,120
right here, plus the orange
vector, is equal

163
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,755
to this vector.

164
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:09,860
It makes complete sense.

165
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,080
Heads to tails.

166
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,650
So that's what that represents.

167
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,625
Now let's do the same
thing in the t direction.

168
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,880
   

169
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,020
I'm running out of color.

170
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,560
   

171
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,800
I'll go back to the pink,
or maybe the magenta.

172
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,610
So we had that s and t.

173
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:32,960
Now if we go up a little bit,
in that direction, let's say

174
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,360
that that is t, so this is the
point s, t plus a super small

175
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,910
change in t, that's that
point right there.

176
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,180
This distance right there is
dt, you can view it that way.

177
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,280
If you put s and t plus dt into
our vector value function,

178
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,180
what are you to get?

179
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,700
You're going to get a vector
that maybe points to

180
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,390
this point, right here.

181
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,300
Maybe I'll draw it right here.

182
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,690
Maybe it points to this
point, right here.

183
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,660
A vector that points
right there.

184
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,910
So that will be mapped to a
vector that points to that

185
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,550
position, right over there.

186
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,860
Now by the same argument that
we did on the s-side, this

187
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,910
point, or the vector that
points to that, that

188
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,430
is r of st plus dt.

189
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,250
That is the exact same thing
as that right there, and of

190
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,940
course, this, we already saw.

191
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,800
This is the same thing
as that over there.

192
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,370
So what is that vector
minus this blue vector?

193
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,830
The magenta vector
minus the blue vector?

194
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,100
Well, once again, this
is hopefully a bit of a

195
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,960
review of adding vectors.

196
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,600
It's going to be a vector
that looks like this.

197
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,630
I'll do it in white.

198
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,520
It's going to be a vector
that looks like that.

199
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,310
   

200
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,740
And you can imagine, if you
take the blue vector plus the

201
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,210
white vector, the blue vector
plus this white vector is going

202
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,320
to equal this purple vector.

203
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,910
So it makes sense, if the
purple vector minus the blue

204
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,190
vector is going to be equal
to this white vector.

205
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,330
So something interesting
is going on here.

206
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,020
I have these two, this is a
vector that is kind of going

207
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,760
along this parameterized
surface, as we changed our

208
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,590
s by a super small amount.

209
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,700
And then this is a vector that
is going along our surface if

210
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,030
we change our t by a
super small amount.

211
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,190
Now, you may or may not
remember this, and I've

212
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,280
done several videos where
I showed this to you.

213
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,500
But the magnitude, if I take 2
vectors, and I take their cross

214
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,370
product, so if I take the cross
product of a and b, and I take

215
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,870
the magnitude of the resulting
vector-- remember, when you

216
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,870
take the cross product, you
get a third vector that is

217
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,530
perpendicular to both of these.

218
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,030
But if you were just to take
the magnitude of that vector,

219
00:11:51,030 --> 00:12:04,280
that is equal to the area
of a parallelogram,

220
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,510
defined by a and b.

221
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,290
What do I mean by that?

222
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:20,940
Well, if that is vector a and
that is vector b, that's a and

223
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,400
that is b, if you were to just
take the cross product of those

224
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,290
two, you're going to
get a third vector.

225
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,880
You're going to get a third
vector that's perpendicular

226
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,660
to both of them, it kind
of popped out of the page.

227
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,560
That would be a cross b.

228
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,050
But the magnitude of this, so
if you just take a cross

229
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,640
product, you're going
to get a vector.

230
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,210
But then if you take the
magnitude of that vector,

231
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,300
you're just saying, how
big is that vector, how

232
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,690
long is that vector?

233
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,160
That's going to be the
area of the parallelogram

234
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,690
defined by a and b.

235
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,650
And I've proved that in the
linear algebra videos, maybe

236
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,900
I'll prove it again in this.

237
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,690
I mean it's because-- well, I
won't go into that in detail.

238
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,290
I've done it before, don't want
to make this video too long.

239
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,900
So the parallelogram defined by
a and b, you just imagine a,

240
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,400
and then take another kind of
parallel version of a, is right

241
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,230
over there, and another
parallel version of b

242
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,950
is right over there.

243
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,980
So this is the parallelogram
defined by a and b.

244
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,910
So, going back to our surface
example, if we were to take the

245
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,070
cross product of this orange
vector and this white vector,

246
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,720
I'm going to get the surface
area, I'm going to get the area

247
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,580
of the parallelogram, defined
by these two vectors.

248
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,760
So if I take the parallel
to that one, it will look

249
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,800
something like this, and then a
parallel to the orange one it

250
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,570
will look something like that.

251
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,360
So if I take the cross product
of that and that, I'm going to

252
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,880
get the area of that
parallelogram.

253
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,620
Now you might say, this is a
surface, you're taking a

254
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,250
straight-up parallelogram,
but remember, these are

255
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,170
super small changes.

256
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,410
So you can imagine, a surface
can be broken up into

257
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,240
super small changes in
parallelograms, or infinitely

258
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,750
many parallelograms.

259
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,130
And the more parallelograms you
have, the better approximation

260
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,160
of the surface you're
going to have.

261
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,560
And this is no different than
when we first took integrals.

262
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,690
We approximated the area
under the curve with a

263
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,600
bunch of rectangles.

264
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,050
The more rectangles
we had, the better.

265
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:28,190
So let's call this little
change in our surface d sigma,

266
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,660
for a little change, for a
little amount of our surface.

267
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,820
And we could even say that, you
know, the surface area of the

268
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,580
surface will be the infinite
sum of all of these

269
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,070
infinitely small d sigmas.

270
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,700
And there's actually a
little notation for that.

271
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:48,750
So surface area is equal to, we
could integrate over the

272
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,950
surface, and the notation
usually is a capital sigma for

273
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,080
a surface as opposed to a
region or-- so you're

274
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,970
integrating over the surface,
and you do a double integral,

275
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,490
because you're going in
two directions, right?

276
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,450
A surface is a kind of a
folded, two-dimensional

277
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,810
structure.

278
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,310
And you're going to take
the infinite sum of

279
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,380
all of the d sigmas.

280
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,690
   

281
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,460
So this would be
the surface area.

282
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,110
So that's what a d sigma is.

283
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,950
Now we just figured out, we
just said, well, that d sigma

284
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,050
can be represented, that value,
that area, of that little part

285
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,210
of the surface, of that
parallelogram, can be

286
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,800
represented as a cross product
of those two vectors.

287
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,550
So let me write here.

288
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,840
And this is not
rigorous mathematics.

289
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,930
The whole point here is to give
you the intuition of what a

290
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,710
surface integral is all about.

291
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:40,670
So we can write that d sigma is
equal to the cross product of

292
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,940
the orange vector and
the white vector.

293
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,270
The orange vector is
this, but we could also

294
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,860
write it like this.

295
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,840
This was the result
from the last video.

296
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,460
I'll write it in orange.

297
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:57,960
So the partial of r with
respect to, I'm running out of

298
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:04,400
space, with respect to s, ds,
and it's going-- well, d sigma

299
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,120
is going to be the magnitude
of the cross product, not

300
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,860
just the cross product.

301
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,705
The cross product by itself
will just give you a vector,

302
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:11,930
and that's going to be useful
when we start doing

303
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,800
vector-valued surface
integrals, but just think

304
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,360
about it this way.

305
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,400
So this orange vector is
the same thing is that.

306
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,680
And we're going to take
the cross product of that

307
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,280
with this white vector.

308
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,830
This white vector is the same
thing as that, which we saw,

309
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,870
which was the same
thing as this.

310
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,900
The partial of r with
respect to t, dt.

311
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:35,980
   

312
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,430
And we saw, if we take the
magnitude of that, that's going

313
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,630
to be equal to our little small
change in area, or the

314
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,500
area of this little
parallelogram over here

315
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,280
Now, you may or may not
remember that if you take

316
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,390
these, so let's just be clear.

317
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,490
This and this, these
are vectors, right?

318
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,480
When you take the partial
derivative of a vector-valued

319
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,560
function, you're still
getting a vector.

320
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,400
This ds, this is a number.

321
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,810
That's a number and
that's a number.

322
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,600
And you might remember, when
we, in the linear algebra or

323
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,960
whenever you first saw taking
cross products, taking the

324
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,850
cross product of some
scalar multiple.

325
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,670
You can take the scalars out.

326
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,870
So if we take this number and
that number, we essentially

327
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,720
factor them out of
the cross product.

328
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,190
This is going to be equal to
the magnitude of the cross

329
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:30,280
product of the partial of r,
with respect to s, crossed with

330
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,750
the partial of r with respect
to t, and then all of

331
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,370
that times these two
guys, over here.

332
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,820
Times ds and dt.

333
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,920
So I wrote this here, hey,
maybe our surface area, if we

334
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,830
were to take the sum of all of
these little d sigmas, but

335
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,880
there's no obvious way
to evaluate that.

336
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,980
But we know that all of the d
sigmas, they're the same thing

337
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,500
as if you take all of the
ds's and all of the dt's.

338
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,890
So you take all of the
ds's, all of the dt's.

339
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,240
So this is a ds
times a dt, right?

340
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,570
A ds times a dt, ds times
a dt is right there.

341
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:12,420
If we multiply this times the
cross product of the partial

342
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,740
derivative, this times this is
going to give us this area.

343
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,940
So if we summed up all of this
times this, or this times this,

344
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,490
if we summed them up over this
entire region, we will get all

345
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,210
of the parallelograms
in this region.

346
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,280
We will get the surface area.

347
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,870
So we can write-- I know this
is all a little bit convoluted.

348
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,810
And you need to kind of
ponder a little bit.

349
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,830
Surface intervals, at least in
my head, are one of the hardest

350
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,910
things to really visualize, but
it all hopefully makes sense.

351
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,380
So we can say that this thing
right over here, the sum of all

352
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,400
of the little parallelograms on
our surface, or the surface

353
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,250
area, is going to be equal to,
instead of taking the sum over

354
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,280
the surface, let's take the sum
of all the ds times dt's over

355
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,430
this region right here.

356
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,740
And of course, we're also
going to have to take

357
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,750
this cross product here.

358
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,370
And we know how to do that.

359
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,340
That's a double integral.

360
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,440
for going to take the double
integral over this, we could

361
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,400
call it this region, or
this area, right here.

362
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,460
That area is the same thing
as that whole area, right

363
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,230
over there, of this thing.

364
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,710
I'll just write it in yellow.

365
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,080
Of the cross product of the
partial of r with respect to

366
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,550
s, and the partial of
r with respect to t.

367
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,100
ds and dt.

368
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,600
And so you literally just take,
and it seems very convoluted in

369
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,800
how you're going to actually
evaluate it, but we were able

370
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,610
to express this thing called a
surface-- well, this is a very

371
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,710
simple surface integral-- in
something that we can

372
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,505
actually calculate.

373
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:52,720
And in the next few videos, I'm
going to show you examples

374
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,450
of actually calculating it.

375
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,080
Now, this right here will only
give you the surface area.

376
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,560
But what if, at every point
here-- so over here what

377
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,970
we've done in both of these
expressions, is we're just

378
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,780
figuring out the surface area
of each of these parallelograms

379
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,380
and then adding them all up.

380
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,430
That's what we're doing.

381
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,480
But what if, associated with
each of those little

382
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,330
parallelograms, we had some
value, where that value is

383
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:24,030
defined by some third
function f of x, y, z?

384
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,240
So every parallelogram, it's
super small, it's around a

385
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,130
point, you can say it's maybe
the center of it, doesn't

386
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:30,880
have to be the center.

387
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,350
But maybe the center of it
is at some point in

388
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,970
three-dimensional space, and if
you use some other function, f

389
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,080
of x, y, and z, you'll get the
value of that point.

390
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,780
And what we want to do is
figure out what happens if

391
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,610
for every one of those
parallelograms, we were to

392
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,250
multiply it times the value of
the function at that point?

393
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,450
So we could write it this way.

394
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,230
So this is where, you can
imagine, the function

395
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,570
is just one.

396
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,960
We're just multiplying each of
the parallelograms by one.

397
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,640
But we could imagine we're
multiplying each of the little

398
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,360
parallelograms by f of x, y,
and z, d sigma, and it's going

399
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,130
to be the exact same thing,
where this is each of the

400
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,080
little parallelograms, we're
just going to multiply it

401
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,510
by f of x, y, and z there.

402
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,880
So we're going to integrate
it over the area, over that

403
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,120
region, of f of x, y, and z,
and then times the magnitude of

404
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,660
the partial of r with respect
to f, crossed with the partial

405
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,900
of r with respect to t, ds, dt.

406
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,390
And of course, we're
integrating with

407
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,340
respect to s and t.

408
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,120
Hopefully we can express this
function in terms of s and

409
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,590
t, and we should be able
to, because we have a

410
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,980
parameterization there.

411
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,090
Wherever we see an x
there, it's really x is

412
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,510
a function of s and t.

413
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,510
y is a function of s and t.

414
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,530
z is a function of s and t.

415
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,040
And this might look super
convoluted and hard.

416
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,580
And the visualizations for
this, of why you'd want

417
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,410
to do this, it has
applications in physics.

418
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,510
It's a little hard
to visualize.

419
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:04,780
It's easier just to visualize
the straight-up surface area.

420
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,140
But we're going to see the next
few videos that it's a little

421
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,650
hairy to calculate these
problems, but they're

422
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,740
not too hard to do.

423
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,950
That you just kind of
have to stick with them.
