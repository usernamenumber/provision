1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
   

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,820
We now have the tools, I think,
to understand the idea

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,680
of a linear subspace of Rn.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,900
Let me write that down.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,130
I'll just always call
it a subspace of Rn.

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,630
Everything we're doing
is linear.

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,090
Subspace of Rn.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,710
I'm going to make a
definition here.

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,450
I'm going to say that
a set of vectors V.

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:32,410
So V is some subset of vectors,
some subset of Rn.

11
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,020
   

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,430
So we already said Rn, when we
think about it, it's really

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,010
just really an infinitely large
set of vectors, where

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,390
each of those vectors
have n components.

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,620
I'm going to not formally define
it, but this is just a

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,460
set of vectors.

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,240
I mean sometimes we visualize it
as multi-dimensional space

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,290
and all that, but if we wanted
to be just as abstract about

19
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,770
it as possible, it's
just all the set.

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,400
It's the set of all of the --
you know we could call x1, x2,

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,920
all the way to xn-- where each
of these, where each of the

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,250
xi's are a member of the real
numbers for all of the i's.

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,470
Right?

24
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,410
That was our definition of Rn.

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,880
It's just a huge
set of vectors.

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
An infinitely large
set of vectors.

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,040
V, I'm calling that, I'm going
to call that a subset of Rn,

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,590
and which means it's just some
-- you know, it could be all

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,550
of these vectors, and I'll talk
about that in a second.

30
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,140
Or it could be some subset
of these vectors.

31
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,040
Maybe it's all of them but
one particular vector.

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,090
In order for this V to be a
subspace-- so I'm already

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,280
saying it's a subset of Rn.

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,240
Maybe this'll help you.

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,300
If I draw all of Rn here
as this big blob.

36
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,760
So these are all of the vectors
that are in Rn.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,390
V is some subset of it.

38
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,220
It could be all of Rn.

39
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,385
I'll show that a second.

40
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:59,950
But let's just say
that this is V.

41
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,470
V is a subset of vectors.

42
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,970
   

43
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,500
Now in order for V to be a
subspace, and this is a

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:16,140
definition, if V is a subspace,
or linear subspace

45
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:23,210
of Rn, this means, this
is my definition,

46
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,270
this means three things.

47
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,605
This means that V contains
the 0 vector.

48
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:31,970
   

49
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,530
I'll do it really, that's
the 0 vector.

50
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,620
This is equal to 0 all the
way and you have n 0's.

51
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,960
So V contains the 0 vector,
and this is

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,660
a big V right there.

53
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,820
If we have some vector x in V.

54
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:57,470
So let me write this, if my
vector x is in V, if x is one

55
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,870
of these vectors that's included
in my V, then when I

56
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,270
multiply x times any member
of the reals.

57
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:10,470
So if x is in V, then if V is a
subspace of Rn, then x times

58
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,290
any scalar is also in V.

59
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,360
This has to be the case.

60
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,410
For those of you who are
familiar with the term, this

61
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,900
term is called closure.

62
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,700
If I have any element of a set,
this is closure under

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,520
multiplication.

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,180
Let me write that down--
in a new color.

65
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:36,283
This is closure under scalar
multiplication.

66
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:40,720
   

67
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,720
And that's just a fancy way of
saying, look, if I take some

68
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:52,860
member of my set and I multiply
it by some scalar,

69
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm still going to
be in my set.

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,500
If I multiplied it by some
scalar and I end up outside of

71
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,940
my set, if I ended up with some
other vector that's not

72
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,080
included in my subset, then this
wouldn't be a subspace.

73
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,020
In order for it to be a
subspace, if I multiply any

74
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,940
vector in my subset by a real
scalar, I'm defining this

75
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,570
subspace over real numbers, if
I multiply it by any real

76
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,130
number, I should also get
another member of this subset.

77
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,880
So this is one of the
requirements.

78
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,170
And then the other requirement
is if I take two vectors,

79
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,410
let's say I have vector a,
it's in here, and I have

80
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,360
vector b in here.

81
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,320
So this is my other requirement

82
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,710
for v being a subspace.

83
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,430
If a is in a-- sorry-- if vector
a is in my set V, and

84
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:51,100
vector b is in my set V, then if
V is a subspace of Rn, that

85
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:58,470
tells me that a and b must
be in V as well.

86
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,120
So this is closure
under addition.

87
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,840
Let me write that down.

88
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,910
Closure under addition.

89
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,430
Once again, just a very fancy
way of saying, look, if you

90
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,040
give me two elements that's in
my subset, and if I add them

91
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,740
to each other -- these could be
any two arbitrary elements

92
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,990
in my subset -- and I add them
to each other, I'm going to

93
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,980
get another element
in my subset.

94
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,320
That's what closure under
addition means.

95
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,330
That when you add two vectors in
your set, you still end up

96
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,660
with another vector
in your set.

97
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,540
You don't somehow end up
with a vector that's

98
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,380
outside of your set.

99
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,910
If I have a subset of Rn, so
some subset of vectors of Rn,

100
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:45,060
that contains the 0 vector,
and it's closed under

101
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,930
multiplication and addition,
then I have a subspace.

102
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,870
So subspace implies all of these
things, and all of these

103
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,540
things imply a subspace.

104
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,600
This is the definition
of a subspace.

105
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,870
This might seem all abstract to
you right now, so let's do

106
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,860
a couple of examples.

107
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,650
And I don't know if these
examples will make it any more

108
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,860
concrete, but I think if we do
it enough, you'll kind of get

109
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,810
the intuitive sense of
what a space implies.

110
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,550
   

111
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,740
Let me just do some examples.

112
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,370
Because I want to
stay relatively

113
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,470
mathematically formal.

114
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,210
Let's just say I have the almost
trivially basic set.

115
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,760
Let's say my set of vectors, I
only have one vector in it and

116
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,470
I have the 0 vector.

117
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,670
So I'll just do a really
bold 0 there.

118
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,335
Or I could write it like this,
the only vector in my set is

119
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:35,410
the 0 vector.

120
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:35,830
Now Let's say?

121
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,830
We're talking about R3.

122
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,860
So let's say my 0 vector
in R3 looks like that.

123
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:53,710
What I want to know is, is my
set V a subspace of R3?

124
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,670
Well, in order for it to be a
subspace, three conditions.

125
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,030
It has to contain
the 0 vector.

126
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,110
Well the only thing it does
contain is the 0 vector.

127
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,430
So it definitely contains
the 0 vector.

128
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,830
So 0 vector, check.

129
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,980
Now, is it closed under
multiplication?

130
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,650
So that means, if I take any
member of the set, there's

131
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,810
only one of them, and I multiply
it by any scalar, I

132
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,440
should get another member
of the set.

133
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,820
Or I should get maybe itself.

134
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,640
So let's see, there's only
one member of the set.

135
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,670
So the one member of the
set is the 0 vector.

136
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,810
If I multiply it times
any scalar, what

137
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,370
am I going to get?

138
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,120
I'm going to get c times 0 which
is 0, c times 0, which

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,610
is 0, and c times 0.

140
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,280
I'm going to get its
only member.

141
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,250
But it is closed.

142
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:42,140
So it is closed under
multiplication.

143
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,720
You can multiply this one vector
times any scalar, and

144
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,750
you're just going to get
this vector again.

145
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,840
So you're going to end up being
in your 0 vector set.

146
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,010
That's a check.

147
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,000
Is it closed under addition?

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,660
Well, clearly if I add any
member of this set to itself,

149
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,260
I mean, there's only one
member, to another

150
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,070
member of the set.

151
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,650
There's only one option here.

152
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,990
If I just add that to
that, what do I get?

153
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,430
I just get that.

154
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,750
I just get it again.

155
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:18,550
So it definitely is closed
under addition.

156
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,270
Check.

157
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,980
So it does turn out that this
trivially basic subset of r3,

158
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,520
that just contains the 0 vector,
it is a subspace.

159
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,860
Maybe a trivially simple
subspace, but it satisfies our

160
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,140
constraints of a subspace.

161
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,750
You can't do anything with the
vectors in it, they'll somehow

162
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,230
get you out of that subspace.

163
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,640
Or at least if you're
dealing with scalar

164
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,549
multiplication or addition.

165
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,450
Let me do one that maybe the
idea will be a little clearer

166
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,340
if I show you an example
of something

167
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,700
that is not a subspace.

168
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,660
Let me get my coordinate
axes is over here.

169
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,880
Let's say I were to find some
subspace, some subset.

170
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,170
I don't know whether
it's a subspace.

171
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,830
Let me call it my set S.

172
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:19,010
And it equals all the vectors
x1, x2 that are a member of R2

173
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,330
such that, I'm going to make a
little constraint here, such

174
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:30,670
that x1 is greater than
or equal to 0.

175
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,160
It contains all of the vectors
in R2 that are at least is 0

176
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,960
or greater for the first term.

177
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,850
So if we were to graph that
here, what do you get?

178
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,780
We can get anything.

179
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,510
We can move up or down
in any direction.

180
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,110
Right?

181
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,530
We can go up and down in any
direction, but we're

182
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,330
constraining ourselves.

183
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,520
These are all going to
be 0 or greater.

184
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,530
So all of these first
coordinates are going to be 0

185
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,530
or greater.

186
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,950
And this one, we can go up
and down arbitrarily.

187
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:04,390
So we're essentially, this
subset of R2, R2 is my entire

188
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,020
Cartesian plane.

189
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,690
But this subset of R2 will
include the vertical axis,

190
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,125
often referred to
as the y-axis.

191
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,950
It will include the vertical
axis, and essentially the

192
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,175
first and fourth quadrants.

193
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:18,210
If you remember your
quadrant labelling.

194
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,920
So that's the first
quadrant and

195
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,890
that's the fourth quadrant.

196
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:33,810
So my question to you is,
is S a subspace of R2.

197
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,080
So the first question, does
it contain the 0 vector?

198
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,870
So in the case of R2, does
it contain 0, 0?

199
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,395
Well, sure.

200
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:48,790
It includes 0, 0 right there.

201
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,610
We said x is greater than or
equal to 0, so this could be 0

202
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,190
and obviously, there's no
constraint on this, so

203
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,290
definitely the 0, 0 vector
is definitely

204
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,870
contained in our set S.

205
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,410
So that is a check.

206
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,840
Let's try another one.

207
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,520
If I add any two vectors in this
set, is that also going

208
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,820
to show up in my set?

209
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,270
Let me just do a couple
of examples.

210
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,230
Maybe this isn't a proof.

211
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,860
If I add that vector to
that vector, what

212
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,690
am I going to get?

213
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,730
If I put this up here, I'm
going to get that vector.

214
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,660
If I add that vector to
that vector, what

215
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,330
am I going to get?

216
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,530
I could put this one heads to
tails, I would get a vector

217
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:34,140
that looks like that.

218
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,200
And if I did it formally, if I
add -- let's say that I have

219
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,550
two vectors that are a
member of our set.

220
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,503
Let's say the first one is
a, b and I add it to c,

221
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:48,570
d, what do I get?

222
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:55,400
I get a plus c over -- this
was a d -- over b plus d.

223
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,100
So this thing is going
to be greater than 0.

224
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,120
This thing is also going
to be greater than 0.

225
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,550
That was my requirement
for being in the set.

226
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,060
So if both of these are greater
than 0 and we add them

227
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,190
to each other, this thing
is also going to be

228
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,200
greater than 0.

229
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,190
And we don't care what these,
these can be anything, I

230
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,320
didn't put any constraints
on the second

231
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,830
component of my vector.

232
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,410
So it does seem like it is
closed under addition.

233
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,880
   

234
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,790
Now what about scalar
multiplication?

235
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,620
Let's take a particular
case here.

236
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,170
Let's take my a, b again.

237
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,070
I have my vector a, b.

238
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,340
Now I can pick any
real scalar.

239
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,400
So any real scalar.

240
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,830
What if I just multiply
it by minus 1?

241
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,440
So minus 1.

242
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,140
So if I multiply it by minus
1, I get minus a, minus b.

243
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,880
If I were to draw it visually,
if this is-- let's say a, b

244
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,235
was the vector 2, 4.

245
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,500
So it's like this.

246
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,910
When I multiply it by minus
1, what do I get?

247
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,650
I get minus a, minus b.

248
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,580
I get this vector.

249
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,300
Which you can be visually
clearly see falls out of, if

250
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,540
we view these as kind of
position vectors, it falls out

251
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,040
of our subspace.

252
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,500
Or if you just view it not even
visually, if you just do

253
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,070
it mathematically, clearly if
this is positive then this is

254
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,040
going to-- and let's say if we
assume this is positive, and

255
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,250
definitely not 0.

256
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,610
So it's definitely a
positive number.

257
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,300
So this is definitely going
to be a negative number.

258
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,000
So when we multiply it by
negative 1, for really any

259
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,635
element of this that doesn't
have a 0 there, you're going

260
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:39,460
to end up with something that
falls out of it, right?

261
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,460
This is not a member of this
set, because to be a member of

262
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,270
the set, your first component
had to be greater than 0.

263
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,530
This first component
is less than 0.

264
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:54,040
So this subset that I drew out
here, the subset of R2, is not

265
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,920
a subspace, Because?

266
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,650
It's not closed under
multiplication or scalar

267
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,900
multiplication.

268
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:08,330
   

269
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:17,910
This is not a sub space of R2.

270
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,560
Now I'll ask you one interesting
question.

271
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,570
What if I ask you just the span
of some set of vectors?

272
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:34,980
Let's say I want to know the
span of, I don't know, let's

273
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,390
sat I have vector
v1, v2, and v3.

274
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,660
I'm not even going to tell you
how many elements each of

275
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:52,590
these vectors have. Is this
a valid subspace of Rn?

276
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,150
Where n is the number of
elements that each of these

277
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,500
have.

278
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,320
Let's pick one of
the elements.

279
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,610
Let me define, let me just call
u to be the set-- the set

280
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,030
of all linear combinations
of this is the span.

281
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,740
So let me just define
u to be the span.

282
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,830
So I want to know, is
u a valid subspace?

283
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,890
So let's think about
it this way.

284
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,630
Let me just pick out a
random element of u.

285
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,660
   

286
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,090
Actually, does this contain
the 0 vector?

287
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:29,590
Well, sure.

288
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,950
If we just multiply all of these
times 0, if we just say

289
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,530
0 times v1, plus 0 times v2,
these are all the vectors, I

290
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,480
didn't write them bold, plus
0 times v3, we get

291
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,390
the 0 vector, right?

292
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,790
We did everything
just zeroed out.

293
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,720
So it definitely contains
the 0 vector.

294
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,685
This is a linear combination
of those three vectors, so

295
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:52,120
it's included in the span.

296
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:58,740
Now let me just pick some
arbitrary member of this span.

297
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,650
So in order to be a member of
this set, it just means that

298
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,550
you can be represented-- let me
just call it the vector x--

299
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,500
it means that you can be
represented as a linear

300
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,040
combination of these vectors.

301
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:16,420
So some combination, c1 times
v1 plus c2 times v2

302
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,145
plus c3 times v3.

303
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:19,940
Right?

304
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,900
I'm just representing this
vector x, it's a member of

305
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,880
this, so it can be represented
as a linear combination of

306
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,030
those three vectors.

307
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,570
Is this set closed under
multiplication?

308
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,850
Well let's just multiply this
times some arbitrary constant.

309
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,980
What is c times x?

310
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,240
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

311
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,600
What does c times x equal?

312
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,370
Let me do a different
constant actually.

313
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,400
Let me multiply it times some
arbitrary constant a.

314
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,810
What is a times x?

315
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,200
What's a times c1 times v1--
I'm just multiplying both

316
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,300
sides equation times a--
a times c2 times v2

317
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,710
plus a times c3, v3.

318
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,280
Right?

319
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,109
If this was an arbitrary
constant, you could just write

320
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,520
this as another arbitrary
constant.

321
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,050
This is another arbitrary
constant.

322
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,869
This is another arbitrary
constant.

323
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:10,290
I want to be clear.

324
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,520
All I did is I just multiplied
both sides of the equation

325
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,640
times a scalar.

326
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,410
But clearly, this expression
right here, I mean I could

327
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:23,040
write this, I could rewrite this
as c4 times v1 plus c5

328
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,150
times v2, where this
is c5, this is c4.

329
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,890
Plus c6 times v3.

330
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,410
This is clearly another
linear combination

331
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,320
of these three vectors.

332
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,300
So, the span is the set of all
of the linear combinations of

333
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,370
these three vectors.

334
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,100
So clearly this is one of the
linear combinations, so it's

335
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,080
also included in the span.

336
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,980
So this is also in u.

337
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,620
It's also in the span of
those three vectors.

338
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,410
So it is closed under
multiplication.

339
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,130
   

340
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,160
Now we just have to show that
it's closed under addition,

341
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,540
and then we know that the span
of -- and I did three, here

342
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,600
but you can extend an arbitrary
n number of vectors

343
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,620
if the span of any set of
vectors is a valid subspace.

344
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,930
Let me prove that.

345
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,410
We already defined one x here.

346
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,140
Let me define another vector
that's in u, or that's in the

347
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,640
span of these vectors.

348
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,780
And it equals, I don't know,
let's say it equals d1 times

349
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:29,120
v1 plus d2 times v2
plus d3 times v3.

350
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,900
Now what is x plus y?

351
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,090
If I add these two vectors,
what does it equal to?

352
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,550
Well, I could just add.

353
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,570
x plus y means all of this stuff
plus all of this stuff.

354
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,620
So what does that equal?

355
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,020
It means if you just add these
together you get c1 plus d1

356
00:18:52,020 --> 00:19:04,020
times v1 plus c2 plus d2 times
v2 plus c3 plus d3 times v3.

357
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,930
Right?

358
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,260
You had a v3 here, you had a
v3 there, you just add up

359
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,480
their coefficients.

360
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,930
Clearly this is just another
linear combination.

361
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,600
These are just constants
again.

362
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,960
That's an arbitrary constant,
that's an arbitrary constant,

363
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,420
that's an arbitrary constant.

364
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,660
So this thing is just a linear
combination of v1, v2, and v3.

365
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,880
So it must be, by definition, in
the span of v1, v2, and v3.

366
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:36,340
So we are definitely closed
under addition.

367
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,400
Now, you might say, hey, Sal,
you're saying that the span of

368
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,500
any vector is a valid subspace,
but let me show you

369
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,440
an example that clearly, if I
just took the span of one

370
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,900
vector, let me just define u
to be equal to the span of

371
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,250
just the vector, let me just
do a really simple one.

372
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,500
Just the vector 1, 1.

373
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,550
Clearly this can't be
a valid subspace.

374
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,540
Let's think about
this visually.

375
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,190
What does vector
1, 1 look like?

376
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,622
Vector 1, 1 looks like this.

377
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:09,680
Right?

378
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,260
And the span of vector 1, 1--
this is in its standard

379
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,300
position -- the span of vector
1, 1 is all of the linear

380
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,040
combinations of this vector.

381
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,880
Well, there's nothing else to
add it to, so it's really just

382
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,710
going to be all of the
scaled up and scaled

383
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,050
down versions of this.

384
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,020
So if you scale it up
you get things that

385
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,900
look more like that.

386
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,970
If you scale it down, you get
things that look more like

387
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,250
that if you go into the
negative domain.

388
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,060
So just by multiplying this
vector times different values,

389
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,370
and if you're going to put
them all into a standard

390
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,240
position, you'd essentially
get a line

391
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,880
that looks like that.

392
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,070
You say, gee, that doesn't look
like a whole subspace.

393
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,180
But a couple of things.

394
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,800
Clearly, it contains
the 0 vector.

395
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,670
   

396
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,060
We can just scale it by 0.

397
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,180
The span is just all of the
different scales of this.

398
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,820
And if there are other vectors,
you would add it to

399
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,480
those as well.

400
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,750
But this is clearly going
to be the 0 vector.

401
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,580
So it contains the 0 vector.

402
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,980
Is it closed under
multiplication?

403
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,120
Well, the span is the set of all
the vectors, where, if you

404
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,230
take all of the real numbers
for c and you multiply it

405
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,920
times 1, 1, that is the span.

406
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,130
Clearly, you multiply this times
anything it's going to

407
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,590
equal another thing that's
definitely in your span.

408
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,540
The last thing, is it closed
under addition?

409
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,270
   

410
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,190
So any two vectors in the span
could, let's say that I have

411
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,690
one vector a that's
in my span.

412
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:43,660
I can represent it as c1 some
scalar times my vector there.

413
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,305
And then I have another vector
b, and I could represent it

414
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:52,690
with c2 times my one vector
in my set right there.

415
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,020
And so what is this going
to be equal to?

416
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,390
This is going to be equal to,
this is essentially going to

417
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,550
be equal to c-- well, get a
little more space-- this is

418
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:07,030
going to be equal to c1 plus
c2 times my vector.

419
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,150
This is almost trivially
obvious.

420
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,080
But clearly this
is in the span.

421
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,820
It's just a scaled up
version of this.

422
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,260
This is in the span, it's in a
scaled up version of this.

423
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,370
And this is also going to be
in the span of this vector,

424
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,190
because this is just
another scalar.

425
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,380
We could call that c3.

426
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:28,110
If you just do it visually, if I
take this vector right there

427
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,700
and I were to add it to this
vector, if you put them head

428
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,080
to tails, you would end
up with this vector.

429
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,200
Right there in green.

430
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
I don't know if you
can see it.

431
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,410
I'll do it in red right there.

432
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,720
You end up with that vector.

433
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,160
And you could do that any vector
plus any other vector

434
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,020
on this line is going to equal
another vector on this line.

435
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,585
Any vector on this line
multiplied by some scalar is

436
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:55,130
just going to be another
vector on this line.

437
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,280
So you're closed under
multiplication.

438
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,830
Your closed under addition.

439
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,880
And you include the 0 vector.

440
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,640
So even this trivially simple
span is a valid subspace.

441
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,460
And that just backs up the
idea that we showed here.

442
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,290
That, in general, I could
have just made

443
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,740
this a set of n vectors.

444
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,060
I picked three vectors right
here, but it could've been n

445
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,490
vectors and I could have used
the same argument that the

446
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:26,980
span of n vectors is a
valid subspace of Rn.

447
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,050
And I showed it right there.
