1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,230
You could never have too much
practice dealing with the

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,500
normal distribution, because
it's really one of those super

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,270
important building blocks
for the rest of statistics.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,540
And really, a lot of your life.

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,150
So what I've done here is I've
taken some sample problems--

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,750
this is from ck12.org's
open source flex book.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,100
Their AP statistics flex book.

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,170
And I've taken the problems
from their normal

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,720
distribution chapter.

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,300
So you could go to their
site and actually look

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,190
up these same problems.

13
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,630
So this first problem: which of
the following data sets is most

14
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,780
likely to be normally
distributed?

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,610
For the other choices, explain
why you believe they would not

16
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,200
follow a normal distribution.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,030
So let's see, choice a.

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,280
So this is a really--
this is, you know, my

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,290
beliefs come into play.

20
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,500
So this is unusual in
the math context.

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,930
It's more of a,
what do I think?

22
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,290
It's kind of an essay question.

23
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,100
So let's see what
they have here.

24
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,460
A, the hand span.

25
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,950
Measured from the tip of the
thumb to the tip of the

26
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,230
extended fifth finger.

27
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,940
So I think they're talking
about-- let me see if

28
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,120
I can draw a hand.

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,510
So that's the index finger, and
then you've got the middle

30
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,650
finger, and then you've got
your ring finger, and then

31
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,140
you've got your pinky.

32
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,910
And a hand will look
something like that.

33
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,550
I think they're talking
about this distance.

34
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,820
From the tip of the
thumb to the tip of the

35
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,270
extended fifth finger.

36
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,230
Which is a fancy way of
saying the pinky, I think.

37
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,160
They're talking about that
distance, right there.

38
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,840
They're saying, if I were to
measure it on a random sample

39
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,130
of high school seniors,
what would it look like?

40
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,880
Well, you know,
how far this is.

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,650
This is a combination
of genetics and

42
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,990
environmental factors.

43
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,960
Maybe how much milk you drank
or how much you hung from your

44
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,370
pinky from a bar when
you were growing up.

45
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,020
So I would think that it
is a sum of a huge number

46
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,000
of random processes.

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,830
So I would guess that it is
roughly normally distributed.

48
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,040
You know, if I look at my own
hand, and my hand I don't

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,910
think has grown much since I
was a high school senior.

50
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,860
It looks like roughly
9 inches, or so.

51
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,520
I play guitar.

52
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,130
Maybe that helped me
a stretch my hand.

53
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,830
But if that, you know, it's
really an essay question.

54
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,770
So I just have to
say what I feel.

55
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,230
So I would guess that the
distribution would look

56
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,990
something like this.

57
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,430
I don't know.

58
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,320
I've never done this.

59
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,390
But, you know, maybe it has a
mean of 8 inches or 9 inches,

60
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,470
and it's distributed
something like this.

61
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,760
   

62
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,180
Maybe it probably does look
like a normal distribution.

63
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,740
But it probably won't be a
perfect-- in fact, I can

64
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,570
guarantee it won't be a
perfect normal distribution.

65
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:25,840
Because one, no one can have
negative length of that span.

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,380
This distance can
never be negative.

67
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,110
So they're going to have a-- I
guess, you could have no hand.

68
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,240
So that would maybe
be counted as 0.

69
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,300
But the distribution wouldn't
go into the negative domain.

70
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,630
So it wouldn't be a perfect
normal distribution on

71
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,330
the left hand side.

72
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,320
It would really just
end here at 0.

73
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,710
And even on the right hand
side, there are some physically

74
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,560
impossible hand lengths.

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,200
No one can have a hand that's
larger than the height of

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,490
the earth's atmosphere.

77
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,460
Or, you know, an
astronomical unit.

78
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,490
You would start
touching the sun.

79
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,090
There is some point
which is physically

80
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,680
impossible to get to.

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,400
And you know, in a true normal
distribution, if I were to flip

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,860
a bunch of points, there's some
very, very small probability

83
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,330
that I could get 1,000,000
heads in the row, in a row.

84
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,360
It's almost 0, but there's
some probability.

85
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,260
But in the case of hand span,
there's no way-- out here-- you

86
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,600
know, the probability of a
human being who happens to be a

87
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,340
high school senior having a, I
don't know, 1 mile length

88
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,980
hand span, that's 0.

89
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,020
So it's not going to be a
perfect normal distribution of

90
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,300
the outliers, or as we get
further and further

91
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,400
away from the mean.

92
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,210
But I think it'll be a pretty
good-- in our everyday world,

93
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,770
as good as we're going
to get-- approximation.

94
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,250
The normal distribution's
going to be a pretty good

95
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,970
approximation for the
distribution that we see.

96
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,410
I guess one thing that,
you know-- it's funny.

97
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,300
This is high school seniors.

98
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,080
When I did this, it was kind of
from my point of view, a guy.

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,360
And I would argue that, you
know, high school senior guys

100
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,780
probably have larger hands than
women, so that it's possible

101
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,950
that you actually have a
bimodal distribution.

102
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,910
So instead of having it like
this, it's possible that the

103
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,190
distribution looks like this.

104
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,470
That you have 1 peak for
guys, maybe at 8 inches.

105
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,370
And then maybe a slight--
another peak for women

106
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,180
that, you know, I don't
know, at 7 inches.

107
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,910
And then the distribution
falls off like that.

108
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,790
So it's also possible
it could be bimodal.

109
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,470
But in general, a normal
distribution is going to be

110
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,140
a pretty good approximation
for part a of this problem.

111
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,710
Let's see what part b-- what
they're asking us to describe.

112
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,280
The annual salaries of
all employees of a

113
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,520
large shipping company.

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,740
So if we're talking about
annual salaries, we have

115
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,230
minimum wage laws, whatnot.

116
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,900
So I would guess at any
corporation, if we're talking

117
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,620
about full-time workers at
least, there's going to be

118
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,580
some minimum salary
that people have.

119
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,300
So I would say-- and probably
a lot of people will have

120
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,220
that minimum salary.

121
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,590
Because it'll be probably the
most labor intensive jobs.

122
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,180
You probably have-- most people
are down there at the low

123
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,630
end of the pay scale.

124
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,890
And then you have your
different middle level

125
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,290
managers and whatnot.

126
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,920
And then you probably
have this big gap.

127
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,410
And then you probably have
your true executives.

128
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,080
Maybe your CEO or whatnot.

129
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,180
If this mean right here is
maybe $40,000 a year, and this

130
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,920
is probably $80,000, where some
of the mid-level managers lie.

131
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,150
But this out here, this'll
probably be-- you know,

132
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,530
actually if you were to draw it
real, the way I've scaled it

133
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,050
right now, this would be
$80,000, this would

134
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,150
be about $200,000.

135
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,040
Which is actually a
reasonable salary for a CEO.

136
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,740
But the reality is that this
actually might get pushed

137
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,620
way out from there.

138
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,270
It might look
something like that.

139
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,930
It might be way off the charts.

140
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,120
You know, let's say the CEO
made $5,000,000 in a year,

141
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,000
because he cashed in a bunch
of options or something.

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,160
So it could be way over here.

143
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,040
And maybe it's a CEO and a
couple of other people,

144
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,620
the CFO or the founders.

145
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,950
So my guess is it definitely
wouldn't be a normal

146
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,740
distribution.

147
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,000
And it definitely would have a
second-- it would be bimodal.

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,790
You would have another peak
over here for senior management

149
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,810
up at the-- unless we're--
well, they're not saying, you

150
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,560
know, if we're in maybe Europe,
this would probably be

151
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,830
closer to the left.

152
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,060
But it won't be a perfect
normal distribution, and you're

153
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,280
not going to have any values
below a certain threshold.

154
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,610
Below that kind of
minimum wage level.

155
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,810
So I would call this-- when you
have a tail that goes more to

156
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,250
the right than to the
left-- call this a right

157
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,000
skewed distribution.

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,790
   

159
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,290
Since it has 2 humps, right
here-- 1 there and 1 there-- we

160
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,345
could also say it's bimodal.

161
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:25,650
I mean, it depends on what
kind of company this is.

162
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,090
But that would be my guess
of a lot of large shipping

163
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,190
companies' salaries.

164
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,810
Let's look at choice c.

165
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,120
Or problem, part c.

166
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,105
The annual salaries of a
random sample of 50 CEOs

167
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:40,530
of major companies.

168
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,410
25 women and 25 men.

169
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,030
The fact that they wrote this
here, I think they maybe are

170
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,740
implying that maybe men and
women-- you know, the gender

171
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,590
gap has not been closed fully,
and there is some discrepancy.

172
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,990
So if it was just purely 50
CEOs of major companies, I

173
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,540
would say it's probably close
to a normal distribution.

174
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,700
It's probably something like--
well, you know, once again,

175
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,520
there's going to be some level
below which no CEO is

176
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,460
willing to work for.

177
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,420
Although I've heard of some
cases where they work for free,

178
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,330
but they're really getting
paid in other ways.

179
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,300
If you include all of those
things, there's probably some

180
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,930
base salary that all CEOs
make at least that much.

181
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,830
And then it goes up to
some value, you know, the

182
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,030
highest probability value.

183
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,370
And then it probably has a
long tail to the right.

184
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,250
And this is if there
were no gender gap.

185
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,880
So this would just be a purely
right skewed distribution,

186
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,780
where you have a long
tail to the right.

187
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,000
Now if you assume that there's
some gender gap, then you might

188
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,350
have 2 humps here, which would
be a bimodal distribution.

189
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,250
So if you assume there's some
gender gap-- this is part

190
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,030
c right here-- then maybe
there's 1 hump for women.

191
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,760
And if you assume that women
are less than men, then

192
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,520
another hump for men.

193
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,140
And there are 25 of each, so
there wouldn't be necessarily

194
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,310
more men than women.

195
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,740
And then it would skew all
the way off to the right.

196
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,590
And, in fact, I think there
would probably be a chance that

197
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,980
you have this other notion
here, where you have these

198
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,920
super CEOs, or mega CEOs, who
make millions, while most

199
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,710
probably just make, you know,
just-- I'll put it in quotation

200
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,290
marks-- a few hundred thousand
dollars, while there's a small

201
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,360
subset that are way off, many
standard deviations

202
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,920
to the right.

203
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,470
So it could even be a
trimodal distribution here.

204
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,110
So that's choice c.

205
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,390
And then, so far, choice a
looks like the best candidate

206
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,080
for pure-- or the closest to
being a normal distribution.

207
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,230
Let's see what choice d is.

208
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,600
The dates of 100 pennies
taken from a cash drawer

209
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,090
in a convenience store.

210
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,050
100 pennies.

211
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,310
So that's actually an
interesting experiment.

212
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,620
But I would guess, once again,
this is really a question where

213
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,560
I get to express my feelings
about these things.

214
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,710
You know, as long as your
answer is reasonable, I

215
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,790
would say that it is right.

216
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,370
Most pennies are newer
pennies, because they

217
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,080
go out of commission.

218
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,890
They get traded out.

219
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,300
They get worn out as they age.

220
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,490
They get lost.

221
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,270
Or, you know, they get pushed--
you know, pressed-- at the

222
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,470
little tourist place into
the little souvenir things.

223
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,060
I'm not even sure if that's
legal, if you can do

224
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,790
that to money legally.

225
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,280
So my guess is that if you were
to plot it, you would have

226
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,650
a ton of pennies that are
within the last few years.

227
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,070
So if we were-- so the dates of
100 pennies, not their age.

228
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,130
So the dates.

229
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,010
So if this is 2010, I would
guess that right now, you're

230
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,920
not going to find
any 2010 pennies.

231
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,010
But you're probably going to
find a ton of 2009 pennies.

232
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,870
And it probably just
goes down from there.

233
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,270
And, of course, you're not
going to find pennies that are

234
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,670
older than, say, the United
States, or before they even

235
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,590
started printing pennies.

236
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,960
So obviously this tail
isn't going to go to

237
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,210
the left forever.

238
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,720
But my guess is you're
going to have a left

239
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,585
skewed distribution.

240
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:38,800
   

241
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,740
Where you have the bulk of the
distribution on the right, but

242
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,420
the tail goes off to the left.

243
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,170
That's why it's called a
left skewed distribution.

244
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,810
Sometimes this is called a
negatively skewed distribution.

245
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,820
And similarly, this right
skewed distribution

246
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,100
is sometimes called
positively skewed.

247
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,870
And if you have only 1 hump--
you don't have a multimodal

248
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,880
distribution like this-- in a
left skewed distribution,

249
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,360
your mean is going to be to
the left of your median.

250
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,990
So in this case, maybe
your median might be

251
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,970
someplace over here.

252
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,970
But since you have this long
tail to the left, your mean

253
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,650
might be some place over here.

254
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,740
And likewise in this
distribution, your median--

255
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,150
your middle value-- might be
some place like this.

256
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,490
But because it's right skewed,
and for the most part only has

257
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,200
1 big hump-- this hump won't
change things too much, because

258
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,850
it's small-- your mean is going
to be to the right of it.

259
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,920
So that's another reason why
it's called a right skewed,

260
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,180
or positively skewed,
distribution.

261
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,150
So to answer the question,
these are my feelings

262
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,810
about all of them.

263
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,520
But I would say, you know, for
the other choices explain why

264
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,380
you believe they would not
follow-- or they said, which of

265
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,040
the following data sets is most
likely to be normally

266
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,920
distributed?

267
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,930
Well, I would say choice a.

268
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,830
But it's really, you know,
a matter of opinion, at

269
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,580
least in this question.
