1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,620
An electronics warehouse ships
televisions and DVD players in

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,640
certain combinations
to retailers

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,310
throughout the country.

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,660
They tell us that the weight
of 3 televisions and 5 DVD

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,160
players is 62.5 pounds, and the
weight of 3 televisions

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,040
and 2 DVD players-- so they're
giving us different

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,940
combinations-- is 52 pounds.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,200
Create a system of
equations that

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,810
represents this situation.

11
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,770
Then solve it to find out how
much each television and DVD

12
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,990
player weighs.

13
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,280
Well, the two pieces of
information they gave us in

14
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,760
each of these statements can be
converted into an equation.

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,280
The first one is is that the
weight of 3 televisions and 5

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,780
DVD players is 62.5 pounds.

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,550
Then they told us that the
weight of 3 televisions and 2

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,790
DVD players is 52 pounds.

19
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,670
So we can translate these
directly into equations.

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,810
If we let t to be the weight of
a television, and d to be

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,910
the weight of a DVD player, this
first statement up here

22
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,090
says that 3 times the weight
of a television, or 3

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,860
televisions, plus 5 times the
weight of a DVD player, is

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,430
going to be equal
to 62.5 pounds.

25
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,380
That's exactly what this first
statement is telling us.

26
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,390
The second statement, the weight
of 3 televisions and 2

27
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:26,520
DVD players, so if I have 3
televisions and 2 DVD players,

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,300
so the weight of 3 televisions
plus the weight of 2 DVD

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,920
players, they're telling us
that that is 52 pounds.

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,180
And so now we've set up the
system of equations.

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,080
We've done the first part,
to create a system that

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,420
represents the situation.

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,070
Now we need to solve it.

34
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,800
Now, one thing that's especially
tempting when you

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,560
have two systems, and both of
them have something where, you

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,510
know, you have a 3t here and
you have a 3t here, what we

37
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:54,400
can do is we can multiply one of
the systems by some factor,

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,910
so that if we were to add this
equation to that equation, we

39
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,770
would get one of the terms
to cancel out.

40
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,340
And that's what we're going
to do right here.

41
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,750
And you can do this, you can
do this business of adding

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,530
equations to each other, because
remember, when we

43
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,870
learned this at the beginning of
algebra, anything you do to

44
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,030
one side of an equation, if
I add 5 to one side of an

45
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,970
equation, I have to add 5 to
another side of the equation.

46
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,890
So if I add this business to
this side of the equation, if

47
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,890
I add this blue stuff to the
left side of the equation, I

48
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,320
can add this 52 to the
right-hand side, because this

49
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,730
is saying that 52 is the same
thing as this thing over here.

50
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,840
This thing is also 52.

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,150
So if we're adding this to the
left-hand side, we're actually

52
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,220
adding 52 to it.

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,120
We're just writing it
a different way.

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,150
Now, before we do that, what I
want to do is multiply the

55
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,590
second, blue equation
by negative 1.

56
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,100
And I want to multiply
it by negative 1.

57
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,540
So negative 3t plus-- I could
write negative 2d is equal to

58
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,390
negative 52.

59
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,360
So I haven't changed the
information in this equation.

60
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,890
I just multiplied everything
by negative 1.

61
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,090
The reason why I did that is
because now if I add these two

62
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,380
equations, these 3t terms
are going to cancel out.

63
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,470
So let's do that.

64
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,790
Let's add these two equations.

65
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,170
And remember, all we're doing is
we're adding the same thing

66
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,110
to both sides of this
top equation.

67
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,700
We're adding essentially
negative 52 now, now that

68
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,660
we've multiplied everything
by a negative 1.

69
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,330
This negative 3t plus negative
2d is the same thing as

70
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,680
negative 52.

71
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,690
So let's add this left-hand
side over here.

72
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,410
The 3t and the negative
3t will cancel out.

73
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,660
That was the whole point.

74
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,940
5d plus negative 2d is 3d.

75
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,340
So you have a 3d is equal to
62.5 plus negative 52, or 62.5

76
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,810
minus 52 is 10.5.

77
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,445
And now we can divide both sides
of this equation by 3.

78
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:41,050
   

79
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,940
And you get d is equal
to 10.5 divided by 3.

80
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,670
So let's figure out
what that is.

81
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:52,110
3 goes into 10.5-- it goes
into 10 three times.

82
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,450
3 times 3 is 9.

83
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,940
Subtract.

84
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,650
Get 1.

85
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,520
Bring down the 5.

86
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,510
Of course, you have your decimal
point right here.

87
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,010
3 goes into 15 five times.

88
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,450
5 times 3 is 15.

89
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,190
You've got to subtract,
and you get a 0.

90
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,490
So it goes exactly 3.5 times.

91
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,590
So the weight of a DVD player--
that's what d

92
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,570
represents-- is 3.5 pounds.

93
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,300
Now we can substitute back into
one of these equations up

94
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,399
here to figure out the weight
of a television.

95
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,520
We can just use that
top equation.

96
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,790
So you get 3t plus 5 times the
weight of a DVD player, which

97
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,010
we just figured out is 3.5.

98
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,420
Remember, we're just looking for
values that satisfy both

99
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,600
of these equations.

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,920
So 5 times 3.5-- needs
to be equal to 62.5.

101
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,380
So you get 3t plus-- what
is this going to be?

102
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,850
This is going to be 15
plus 2.5, right?

103
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,850
5 times 0.5 is 2.5,
5 times 3 is 15.

104
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,610
So it's 17.5, is
equal to 62.5.

105
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,815
Now we can subtract 17.5 from
both sides of this equation.

106
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:07,650
   

107
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,520
And what do we get?

108
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,960
The left-hand side is
just going to be 3t.

109
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,690
This cancels out, that was
the whole point of it.

110
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,240
3t is going to be equal
to-- let's see.

111
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,060
The 0.5 minus 0.5,
that cancels out.

112
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,830
So this is the same thing
as 62 minus 17.

113
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,050
62 minus 7 would be 55.

114
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,770
And so we're going to
subtract another 10.

115
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,830
So it's going to be 45.

116
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,980
So this is going to
be equal to 45.

117
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,960
Now you can divide both sides
of this equation by 3.

118
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,250
And we get t is equal to 15.

119
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,580
So we've solved our system.

120
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,070
The weight of a DVD player is
3.5 pounds, and the weight of

121
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,060
a television is 15 pounds.

122
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,630
And we're done.

123
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:50,933
