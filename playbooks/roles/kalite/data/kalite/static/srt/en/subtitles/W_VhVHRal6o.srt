1
00:00:00,563 --> 00:00:04,071
We are asked to divide 99.061 or

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:08,015
ninety nine and sixty one thousandths by 100.

3
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:09,393
And there is a few ways to do it

4
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:11,089
but all I'm going to do in this video is focus on

5
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:13,123
kind of a faster way to think about it.

6
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:14,108
And hopefully it will make sense to you.

7
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:17,120
And that is also the focus of it. That it makes sense to you.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,733
Let us just think about it a little bit.

9
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:26,867
So 99.061. So if we were to divide this by 10,

10
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:28,369
just to make the point clear,

11
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,069
if we were to divide this by 10, what would we get?

12
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:33,646
Well, we would essentially move the decimal place

13
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:37,093
one spot to the left. And it should make sense

14
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:38,672
because we have a little over 99.

15
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:43,006
If you took 99 divided by 10, you should have a little over 9.

16
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:46,208
So essentially you would move the decimal place

17
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,790
one to the left when you divide by 10.

18
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:54,740
So this would be equal to 9.9061.

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,413
If you were to divide it by 100,

20
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:00,867
which is actually the focus of this problem,

21
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:06,114
so if we divide 99.061 divided by 100.

22
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:08,346
If we move the decimal place once to the left,

23
00:01:08,346 --> 00:01:10,246
we're dividing by 10.

24
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:12,529
To divide it by 100, we have to divide it by 10 again.

25
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:16,087
So we move it over twice. So one, two times.

26
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:21,456
And so now the decimal place is out in front of that first leading 9.

27
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:25,877
Which also should make sense. 99 is almost 100.

28
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,467
Or a little bit less than 100. So if you divide it by 100

29
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:32,082
we should be a little bit less than 1.

30
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:33,920
And so if you move the decimal place

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,368
two places over to the left,

32
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:37,200
because we're really dividing by 10 twice

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,669
if you want to think of it that way,

34
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:42,738
we will get the decimal in front of the 99.

35
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:46,208
.99061, we should put a 0 out here,

36
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,277
just sometimes it clarifies things.

37
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:50,254
So then we get this right over here.

38
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:52,067
Now one way to think about it,

39
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:53,731
although I do want you to always imagine that

40
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,241
when you move the decimal place over to the left,

41
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:58,164
you really are dividing by 10 when you move it to the left.

42
00:01:58,164 --> 00:02:01,144
When you move it to the right, you are multiplying by 10.

43
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:03,167
Sometimes people say, hey look,

44
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:05,418
you could just count the number of zeros.

45
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:08,637
And if you are dividing, so over here you are dividing by 100,

46
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:14,215
100 has two zeros, so when we're dividing by it,

47
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:18,005
so we can move our decimal two spaces to the left.

48
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,179
That's alright to do that, if you know

49
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:21,773
especially if it's kind of a fast way to do it.

50
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:24,382
If this had 20 zeros, you would have needed to say,

51
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:26,615
ok, let us move the decimal 20 spaces to the left.

52
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:29,705
But I really want you to think about why that's working.

53
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:31,450
Why that makes sense?

54
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,702
Why it's giving you a number that seems to be

55
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:37,085
in the right kind of size number.

56
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:38,884
That this is why it makes sense that

57
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:40,559
if you take something that's almost 100

58
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:44,995
and divide it by 100, you'll get something that's almost 1.

59
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:47,843
And that part, frankly, is just a really good reality check

60
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:50,260
to make sure you're going in the right direction with the decimal.

61
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,338
Because if you were to try this five or ten years from now,

62
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:56,393
maybe your memory of the rule

63
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,309
or whatever you want to call it for doing it,

64
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:00,163
you're like, hey, wait. Do I move the decimal

65
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:01,502
to the left or the right?

66
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:03,033
It's really good to do that reality check

67
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:04,902
to say, ok, look. If I'm dividing by 100,

68
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:07,131
I should be getting a smaller value.

69
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:09,092
And that moving the decimal to the left

70
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:10,561
gives me that smaller value.

71
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:12,984
If I was multiplying by 100, I should get a larger value.

72
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,269
And moving the decimal to the right

73
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,815
would give you that larger value.
