1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,810
We hopefully now have a
respectable working knowledge

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,850
of the sampling distribution
of the sample mean.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,870
And what I want to do in this
video is explore a little bit

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,640
more on how that distribution
changes as we change

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,920
our sample size n.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,130
I'll write n down right here.

8
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,290
Our sample size n.

9
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,090
So just as a bit of review, we
saw before we can just start

10
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,480
off with any crazy
distribution, maybe it looks

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,815
something like this.

12
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,230
I'll do a discrete
distribution.

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,930
Really to model anything
at some point you have

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,000
to make it discreet.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,885
It could be a very granular
discrete distribution.

16
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:33,380
But let's say it's something
crazy that looks like this.

17
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,670
This is clearly not a
normal distribution.

18
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,110
But we saw in the first video
if you take, let's say,

19
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,870
sample sizes of 4.

20
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,880
So if you took 4 numbers from
this distribution, 4 random

21
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,140
numbers where let's say this
is the probably of a 1,

22
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,880
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

23
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,200
If you took 4 numbers at a time
and averaged them-- let me do

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,580
that here-- if you took 4
numbers at a time, let's say we

25
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,760
used this distribution to
generate 4 random

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,500
numbers, right?

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,930
We're very likely to get a 9.

28
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,680
We're definitely not going
to get any 7's or 8's.

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,480
We're definitely not
going to get a 4.

30
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,470
We might get a 1 or 2.

31
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,750
3 is also very likely.

32
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,780
Five is very likely.

33
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,690
So we use this function
to essentially generate

34
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,810
random numbers for us.

35
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,890
And we take samples of 4 and
then we average them up.

36
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,680
So let's say our first average
is, I don't know, let's say

37
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,985
it's a 9, it's a 5, it's
another 9, and then it's a 1.

38
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:26,640
So what is that?

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,010
That's 14 plus 10.

40
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,460
24 divided by 4.

41
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,380
The average for this first
trial, for this first sample of

42
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,400
4, is going to be 6, right?

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,140
They add up to 24 divided by 4.

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,450
So we would plot it right here.

45
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,890
Our average was 6 that time.

46
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,356
Just like that.

47
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:42,820
And we'll just keep doing it.

48
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,900
And we've seen in the past that
if you just keep doing this,

49
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,860
this is going to start
looking something like

50
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,910
a normal distribution.

51
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,160
So maybe we'd do it again,
the average is 6 again.

52
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,220
Maybe we do it again,
the average is 5.

53
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,660
We do it again,
the average is 7.

54
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,500
We do it again,
the average is 6.

55
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,720
And then if you just do this a
ton, a ton of times, your

56
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,900
distribution might look
something that looks very much

57
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,930
like a normal distribution.

58
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,180
So these boxes are
really small.

59
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,760
So we just do a bunch of these
trials, at some point it

60
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,240
might look a lot like
a normal distribution.

61
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,170
Obviously there are
some average values.

62
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,360
It won't be a perfect normal
distribution because you can

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,110
never get anything less than
a 0, or anything less than

64
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,590
a 1, really as an average.

65
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,010
You can't get 0 as an average.

66
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,440
And you can't get
anything more than 9.

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,170
So it's not going to have
infinitely long tails but at

68
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,480
least for the middle part of it
a normal distribution might

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,090
be a good approximation.

70
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,340
In this video what I want
to think about is what

71
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,410
happens as we change n.

72
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,030
So in this case n was 4.

73
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,950
n is our sample size.

74
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,290
Every time we do a trial we
took 4 and we took their

75
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,700
average and we plotted it.

76
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,470
We could have had n equal 10.

77
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,915
We could have taken 10 samples
from this from this population,

78
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:52,540
you could say, or from this
random variable, average them,

79
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,000
and then plotted them here.

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,910
And in the last video
we ran the simulation.

81
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,090
I'm going to go back to
that simulation a second.

82
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,800
We saw a couple of things.

83
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,700
And I'll show it to you
at a little bit more

84
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,420
depth this time.

85
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,360
When n is pretty small, it
doesn't approach a normal

86
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,950
distribution that well.

87
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,170
So when n is small-- I mean,
let's take the extreme case.

88
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,060
What happens when
n is equal to 1?

89
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,800
That literally just means I
take 1 instance of this random

90
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,630
variable and average it.

91
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,410
Well it's just going
to be that thing.

92
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,520
So if I just take a bunch of
trials from the thing and

93
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,540
plot it over time, what's
it going to look like?

94
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,710
Well it's definitely not
going to look like a

95
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,460
normal distribution.

96
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,050
It's going to look-- you're
going to have a couple

97
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,970
of 1's, you're going to
have a couple of 2's.

98
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,490
You're going to have
more 3's like that.

99
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,750
You're going to have no 4's.

100
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,630
You're going to have
a bunch of 5's.

101
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,330
You're going to have some
6's that'll look like that.

102
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,380
And you're going to
have a bunch of 9's.

103
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,730
So there your sampling
distribution of the sample mean

104
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,890
for an n of 1 is going to
look-- I don't care how many

105
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,300
trials you do, it's not going
to look like a normal

106
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,950
distribution.

107
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,740
So the central limit theorem,
although I said you do a bunch

108
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,900
of trials, it'll look like a
normal distribution,

109
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
it definitely doesn't
work for n equal 1.

110
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,460
As n gets larger though
it starts to make sense.

111
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,030
That let's see if we've got n
equals 2--- and I'm all just

112
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,700
doing this in my head, I
don't know what the actual

113
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,520
distributions would look like--
but then, it's still would be

114
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,370
difficult for it to become an
exact normal distribution.

115
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,280
But then you can get more
instance-- that you could get

116
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,610
more-- you know, you might get
things from all of the above.

117
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,670
But you can only get two
in each of your baskets

118
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,490
that your averaging.

119
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,140
You're only going to
get 2 numbers, right?

120
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,250
So?

121
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,800
You're never going to for
example, you're never going to

122
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,640
get 7.5 in your sampling
distribution of the sample mean

123
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,170
for n is equal to 2 because
it's impossible to get a 7 and

124
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,660
it's impossible to get an 8.

125
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,680
So you're never going to get
7.5 as-- so maybe when you plot

126
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,125
it, maybe it looks like this.

127
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:38,020
But there will be a gap at 7.5
because that's impossible

128
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,780
and maybe it looks
something like that.

129
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,750
So it's still won't be
a normal distribution

130
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,230
when n is equal to 2.

131
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,480
So there's a couple of
interesting things here.

132
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,550
So one thing-- and I didn't
mention this the first time

133
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,160
because I really wanted you to
get the gut sense what the

134
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,170
central limit theorem is-- the
central limit theorem says as n

135
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,320
approaches-- really as it
approaches infinity then is

136
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,075
when you get the real
normal distribution.

137
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:02,200
   

138
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,870
But in kind of every day
practice, you don't have to get

139
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,320
that much beyond n equals two.

140
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,220
If you get to n equals 10 or n
equals 15, you're getting very

141
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,400
close to a normal distribution.

142
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,240
So this converges to a normal
distribution very quickly.

143
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,880
Now the other thing is
you obviously wants

144
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,840
many, many trials.

145
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,220
So this is your sample size.

146
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,360
That is your sample size.

147
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,570
That's the size of
each of your baskets.

148
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,700
In the very first video
I did on this, I took

149
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,180
a sample size of 4.

150
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,310
And in the simulation I did
in the last video, we did

151
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,620
sample sizes of 4 and
10 and whatever else.

152
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,572
This is a sample size of one.

153
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:34,900
So that's our sample size.

154
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,250
So as that approaches infinity
your actual sampling

155
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,140
distribution of the sample of
the sample mean will approach a

156
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,080
normal distribution.

157
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,150
Now in order to actually see
that normal distribution and

158
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,520
actually to prove it to
yourself, you would have to do

159
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,590
this many, many-- remember the
normal distribution happens,

160
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,560
this is essentially the
population or this is

161
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,440
the random variable.

162
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,350
That tells you all of
the possibilities.

163
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,770
In real life, we seldom know
all the possibilities.

164
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,060
In fact in real life, we seldom
know the pure probability

165
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,820
generating function.

166
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,320
Only if we're writing
it or if we're writing

167
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,290
a computer program.

168
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,530
Normally we're doing
samples and we're

169
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,660
trying estimate things.

170
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,490
So normally there's some random
variable and then maybe we'll

171
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,880
do a bunch of-- we'd take it a
bunch of samples, we'd take

172
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,460
their means and we'd plot them
and we're going to get some

173
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,740
type of normal distribution.

174
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,210
Let's say we take samples of
100 and we average them.

175
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,160
We're going to get some
normal distribution.

176
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,640
And in theory, as we take those
averages hundreds or thousands

177
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,230
of times, our data set it's
going to more closely

178
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:44,260
approximate that pure
sampling distribution

179
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,100
of the sample mean.

180
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,410
This thing is a
real distribution.

181
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,770
It's a real distribution
with a real mean.

182
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,415
It has a pure mean.

183
00:06:56,415 --> 00:07:04,410
So the mean of the sampling
distribution of the sample

184
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,210
mean, we'll write it like that.

185
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,200
Notice I didn't write it is
just the x with-- what this is,

186
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,540
this is actually saying that
this is a real population mean,

187
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,960
this is a real random
variable mean.

188
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,640
If you look at every
possibility of all of the

189
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,410
samples that you can take from
your original distribution,

190
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,980
from some other random original
distribution, and you took all

191
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,940
of the possibilities of
let's see sample size.

192
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,970
Let's see were dealing
with the world where

193
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,550
a sample size is 10.

194
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,160
If you took all of the
combinations of 10 samples from

195
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,320
some original distribution and
you averaged them out, this

196
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,700
would describe that function.

197
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,140
Of course in reality, if you
don't know the original

198
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,150
distribution, you can't take an
infinite samples from it so you

199
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,340
won't know every combination.

200
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:52,840
But if you did it with 1,000--
if you did the trial 1,000

201
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,320
times-- so 1,000 times you took
10 samples from some

202
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,960
distribution and took 1,000
averages and then plotted

203
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,680
them, you're going
to get pretty close.

204
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,600
Now the next thing I want to
touch on is what happens as

205
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,830
n-- we know as n approaches
infinity it becomes more of a

206
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,170
normal distribution, but as I
said already, n equals 10 is

207
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,295
pretty good and n equals
20 is even better.

208
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:15,860
But we saw something in the
last video that at least I

209
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,660
find pretty interesting.

210
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,390
Let's say we start with this
crazy distribution up here.

211
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,710
It really doesn't matter
what distribution

212
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,770
we're starting with.

213
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:29,440
We saw in the simulation that
when n is equal to 5, our graph

214
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,905
after we try-- we take samples
of 5, average them and we do

215
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:36,550
it 10,000 times-- our graph
look something like this.

216
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,270
It's kind of wide like that.

217
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,820
And then when we did n is equal
to 10 our graph looked a little

218
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,040
bit-- it was actually a
little bit squeezed in like

219
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,610
that a little bit more.

220
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,980
So not only was it more
normal-- that's what the

221
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,310
central limit theorem tells us
because we're taking larger

222
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,340
sample sizes-- but it had a
smaller standard deviation or a

223
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,650
smaller variance, right?

224
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,420
The mean is going to be the
same either case but when our

225
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,780
sample size was larger our
standard deviation

226
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,710
became smaller.

227
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,120
In fact, our standard deviation
became smaller than our

228
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,590
original population
distribution-- or original

229
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,720
probability density function.

230
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,505
Let me show you that
with a simulation.

231
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:16,580
So let me clear everything.

232
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,730
And this simulation is as good
as any, so the first thing I

233
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,750
want to show-- or this
distribution is as good as

234
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,190
any-- the first thing I want to
show you is that n of 2

235
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,910
is really not that good.

236
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,340
So let's compare an n of 2
to let's say an n of 16.

237
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,810
So when you compare an
n of 2 to an n of 16,

238
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,730
let's do it once.

239
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,490
So you get 1, 2 trials,
you average them.

240
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,320
And then it's going to do 16
and then it's going to plot it

241
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,530
down here and average there.

242
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,640
Let's do that 10,000 times.

243
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,520
So notice, when you took an n
of 2, even though we did it

244
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,990
10,000 times, this is not
approaching a normal

245
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,630
distribution.

246
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,230
You can actually see it in the
skew and kurtosis numbers.

247
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,120
It has a rightward positive
skew which means it has a

248
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,990
longer tail to the right
than to the left.

249
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,860
And then it has a negative
kurtosis which means that it's

250
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,000
a little bit-- it has shorter
tales and smaller peaks than a

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,270
standard normal distribution.

252
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,000
Now when n is equal to
16 you do the same.

253
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,930
So every time we took 16
samples from this distribution

254
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,650
function up here and averaged
them-- and each of these dots

255
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,050
represent an average and we did
it 10,001 times-- and notice

256
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,110
the mean is the same in both
places but here all of a

257
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,630
sudden, our kurtosis is much
smaller and our skew

258
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,230
is much smaller.

259
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,080
So we are more normal in
this into situation.

260
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,000
But even a more interesting
thing is our standard

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,480
deviation is smaller, right?

262
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,300
This is more squeezed
in than that is.

263
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,980
And it's definitely more
squeezed in then our

264
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,700
original distribution.

265
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,400
Now let me do it with 2-- let
me clear everything again.

266
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,270
I like this distribution
because it's a very

267
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,780
non-normal distribution.

268
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,180
It looks like a bimodal
distribution of some kind.

269
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,080
And let's take a scenario
where I take an n of--

270
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,990
let's take two good n's.

271
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,895
Let's take an n of 16-- that's
a nice healthy n-- and let's

272
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:02,180
take an n of 25 and let's
compare them a little bit.

273
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,760
   

274
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,720
So if we-- I'll do one trial
animated just because

275
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,630
it's always nice to see.

276
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,010
So first it's going to do 16
of these trials and average

277
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,180
them and there we go.

278
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,680
And then it's going to do 25 of
these trials and then average

279
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,270
them and then there we go.

280
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,550
Now let's do that-- what I
just did animated-- let's

281
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,590
do it 10,000 times.

282
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,270
Miracles of computers.

283
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,360
Now notice something:
this is 10,000 times.

284
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,480
These are both pretty
good approximations of

285
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,860
normal distributions.

286
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,660
The n is equal to
25 is more normal.

287
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,180
It has less skew-- slightly
less skew than n is equal 16.

288
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,180
It has slightly kurtosis which
means it's closer to being

289
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,610
a normal distribution
than n is equal to 16.

290
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,230
But even more interesting,
it's more squeezed in.

291
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,210
It has a lower
standard deviation.

292
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,120
The standard deviation here
is 2.1 and the standard

293
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,120
deviation here is 2.64.

294
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,300
So that's another-- I mean I
kind of touched on that in

295
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,630
the last video-- and it
kind of makes sense.

296
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,350
For every sample you do for
your average, the more you

297
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,030
put into that sample, the
less standard deviation.

298
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,440
Think of the extreme case.

299
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,270
If instead of taking 16 samples
from our distribution every

300
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,440
time or instead of taking 25,
if I were to take 1,000,000

301
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:21,720
samples from this distribution
every time that sample mean is

302
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,180
always going to be pretty
darn close to my mean.

303
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,010
If I take 1,000,000 samples of
everything, if I essentially

304
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,130
try to estimate a mean by
taking 1,000,000 samples, I'm

305
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,860
going to get a pretty good
estimate of that mean.

306
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,260
The probability that a
million numbers are all

307
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,770
out here is very low.

308
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,760
So if n is 1,000,000 of course
all of my sample means when I

309
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,650
average them are all going to
be really tightly focused

310
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,130
around the mean itself.

311
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,660
So hopefully that kind of
makes sense to you as well.

312
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,930
If it doesn't just think about
it or even use this tool and

313
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,430
experiment with it just so you
can trust that is

314
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,315
really the case.

315
00:12:57,315 --> 00:13:00,380
And it actually turns out that
there's a very clean formula

316
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,730
that relates to standard
deviation of the original

317
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,060
probability distribution
function to the standard

318
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,110
deviation of the sampling
distribution of

319
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,140
the sample mean.

320
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,680
And as you can imagine it is a
function of your sample size,

321
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,230
of how many samples you
take out in every basket

322
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,110
before you average them.

323
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,300
And I'll go over that
in the next video.

324
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,833
