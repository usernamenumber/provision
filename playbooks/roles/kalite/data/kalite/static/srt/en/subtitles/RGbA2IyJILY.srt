1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,902
Let's do some more of these classic age word problems.

2
00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:09,469
So we're told that William is 4 times as old as Ben.

3
00:00:09,484 --> 00:00:14,916
12 years ago, William was 7 times as old as Ben.

4
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,769
How old is Ben now?

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,913
So, once again, it's a good idea

6
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:22,992
to try to do this on your own first and

7
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:25,034
then I'll work through it.

8
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:27,577
So, what's the unknown here?

9
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:30,896
The unknown here is: How old is Ben now?

10
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:33,442
So let's set a variable equal Ben.

11
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:36,061
We do x or y but since Ben starts with a B,

12
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:37,833
let's use B for Ben.

13
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:44,392
So let's let B = Ben's current age

14
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:48,169
Ben's age now.

15
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:51,646
So let's see how all these other information relates to

16
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:54,768
Ben's current age and then maybe we could set up

17
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:56,643
some equations and solve for this.

18
00:00:56,643 --> 00:00:59,570
I'll do a little more structure in this,

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,169
where you could have done many of the problems

20
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:02,724
you've been working on in this way,

21
00:01:02,724 --> 00:01:09,139
so let's about Ben, and then let's think about William

22
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:10,769
I'll put 'William' in blue.

23
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:13,101
So let's think about, William.

24
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:17,502
And then there's 2 points in time we're talking about.

25
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:19,432
We're talking about now, today and

26
00:01:19,432 --> 00:01:21,639
we're gonna talk about 12 years ago.

27
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:27,836
Over here, let's say today, or let's call that 'Now'

28
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:29,635
This will be our 'Now' column and this

29
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:32,409
would be our '12 years ago'.

30
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:36,783
So let's see what we can fill in here.

31
00:01:36,783 --> 00:01:39,301
So what is Ben's age now?

32
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:41,206
Well, we just defined that as the variable B.

33
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,506
That's the unknown, that's what we have to figure out.

34
00:01:42,506 --> 00:01:47,770
So that's just going to be 'B'.

35
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,302
What's Ben's age 12 years ago?

36
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:54,569
Well, maybe we want to express it in terms of B.

37
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,902
If it's 'B' now, 12 years ago it was just 'B - 12'.

38
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,570
Fair enough.

39
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,038
Now, what is William's age today?

40
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:08,903
This first sentence gave us the information.

41
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:12,457
William is 4 times as old as Ben, and we can assume

42
00:02:12,457 --> 00:02:16,568
that they are talking about today.

43
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:22,909
So if Ben is 'B', William is going to be '4B'.

44
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:26,569
And so how old was William 12 years ago?

45
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:30,543
If he's '4B' right now, 12 years ago it would be 12 less than that.

46
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:34,637
12 years ago it would be '4B - 12'

47
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:36,301
So that's kind of interesting.

48
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:41,104
But we haven't quite yet made use of the second statement.

49
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:45,569
12 years ago, William, so this is William 12 years ago.

50
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,645
12 years ago, William was 7 times as old as Ben.

51
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:55,775
So 12 years ago, this number is going to be 7 times this number.

52
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,648
or another way to think about it is to take

53
00:02:57,648 --> 00:03:00,171
this number and multiply it by 7

54
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:02,568
and you're gonna get this number.

55
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:08,169
12 years ago, Ben's age was 1/7 of William's age, or

56
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,648
William's age is 7 times Ben's age

57
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,501
Let's see if we can set that up as an equation.

58
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:31,636
We can have, 7 times this, Ben's age 12 years ago,

59
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:37,836
is going to be equal to William's age

60
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:40,503
And it seems like we've done the hard part.

61
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:42,177
We set up the equation, we just have to use

62
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:45,444
our algebraic tools to solve for 'B'

63
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:47,103
Let's do that.

64
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:51,733
The first thing that we want to do. We can distribute the 7.

65
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:55,036
7 times B, 7 times negative 12.

66
00:03:55,036 --> 00:04:09,635
So we have '7B - 84' is going to be equal to '4B - 12'

67
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:14,120
this whole expression is 7 times Ben's age 12 years ago

68
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,776
Now what we can do to solve all of these?

69
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:23,942
Well, we can subtract '4B' from both sides.

70
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:28,197
Actually I can do 2 steps at the same time, but let's just keep it simple.

71
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:30,636
Let's subtract '4B' on both sides.

72
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:33,285
That goes away, and on the right hand side I have a '-12'.

73
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:39,503
On the left hand side, I'm left with, '7B - 4B = 3B'

74
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:41,987
and then I still have my '-84'.

75
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:45,237
I want to get rid of this '-84', so let's minus 84 on the left hand side.

76
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:48,317
So let's add 84 on both sides.

77
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:53,367
On the left hand side, I'm just left with '3B',

78
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:55,236
and on the right hand side, I have

79
00:04:55,236 --> 00:05:03,990
'-12 + 84 = 72'

80
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,108
Now if I want to solve for B, I just have to divide the whole

81
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:08,768
equation by 3.

82
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:17,901
And so I am left with 'B' is equal to, drum roll, '72/3'

83
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,411
It would be 24.

84
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:37,326
So 'B' is equal to 24

85
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:40,244
Going back to our question: What is Ben's age now?

86
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:42,437
It is 24.

87
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:45,574
Let's verify this is actually the case.

88
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:48,374
So they are telling us that William is 4 times as old as Ben.

89
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:50,993
So what is William's current age?

90
00:05:50,993 --> 00:05:54,375
So '4 x 24 = 96'

91
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,711
So William is a senior, we should call him Mr. William.

92
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:05,576
He is 96 years old. Maybe he's Ben's grandfather or great grandfather.

93
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:11,969
Then they say 12 years ago, William, William was 84 years old.

94
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:15,908
They say that he is 7 times as old as Ben.

95
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:21,040
Well, 12 years ago, if he's 24 now, Ben was 12.

96
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,573
And indeed, '84 = 7 x 12'

97
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:28,000
And it all worked out.
