1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,730
What I want to do in this video
is to try to figure out

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,470
what type of reaction or
reactions might occur if we

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,150
have-- what is this?

5
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,710
One, two, three, four,
five It's in a cycle.

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,205
This is bromocyclopentane.

7
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:18,560
If we have some
bromocyclopentane dissolved

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,380
and our solvent is
dimethylformamide.

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,060
Sometimes you'll see that
just written as DMF.

10
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,160
And I've actually drawn the
formula for it here, so we can

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,470
think about what type
of a solvent it is.

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,890
And also, in our solution, we
have the methoxide ion.

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,340
So we also have the methoxide
ion right here.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,250
So let's think about what type
of reaction might occur.

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,400
And just to narrow things down,
we'll think about it in

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,380
the context of the last four
types of reactions

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,850
we've looked at.

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,480
So this might be an Sn2
reaction, an Sn1 reaction, an

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,950
E2 reaction, or an
E1 reaction.

20
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,520
We're going to look at all the
clues and figure out what's

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,060
likely to occur, and then
actually draw the mechanism

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,560
for it occurring.

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,050
Now, the first thing since they
gave us the solvent and

24
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,160
other things that are in the
solvent, let's think about how

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,670
those might affect
the reaction.

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,960
So if we look at this solvent
right here, whenever you look

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,560
at any of these reactions, when
you look at the solvent,

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,330
you just want to
think about it.

29
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,650
Is it protic or not?

30
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,230
And protic means that it has
hydrogens that can kind of be

31
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,120
released or that their electrons
could be nabbed off

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,970
and these protons could
just float around.

33
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,610
And if we look over here, we do
have hydrogens, but all of

34
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,990
the hydrogens are bonded
to carbon.

35
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,910
And carbon is unlikely to just
steal a hydrogen's electrons

36
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,170
and let the hydrogen
float around.

37
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,080
Carbon is not that
electronegative.

38
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,000
If you had hydrogens bonded
to an oxygen, that'd be a

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,650
different question.

40
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,610
Then you would have
a protic solvent.

41
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,180
But in this case, all the
hydrogens bonded to carbons,

42
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,470
not likely to get their
electrons nabbed off and float

43
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,870
around as free protons.

44
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,350
So this is an aprotic solvent.

45
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:54,180
   

46
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,630
Now, we've gone over this a
little bit with Sn2 and Sn1,

47
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,650
but the same idea applies.

48
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:07,020
In order to have an Sn2 or an E2
reaction, you have to have

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,669
either a strong nucleophile or
a strong base, and the same

50
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,160
thing could actually be both,
although they're not always

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,600
correlated.

52
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,940
We've seen that before.

53
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,790
Now, if you had a protic
solvent, it would stabilize

54
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,390
the strong base or the
strong nucleophile.

55
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,080
The protons would
react with them.

56
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,450
They would take the electrons
from that strong base or that

57
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,580
strong nucleophile.

58
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,250
So in order to have an Sn2 or
an E2, you have to have no

59
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,610
protons flying around, so you
need an aprotic solvent.

60
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:40,580
So this aprotic solvent will
favor Sn2 or an E2 reaction.

61
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,670
Now, so our mind is already
thinking in Sn2 or E2, let's

62
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,320
think about the reactants
themselves.

63
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,990
So over here, we have
the methoxide ion.

64
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,460
   

65
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,180
And let's think about whether
it's a strong or weak.

66
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,370
Let's think about it first as a
strong or weak nucleophile.

67
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,610
It's actually a pretty
strong nucleophile.

68
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,010
It is a strong nucleophile.

69
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,470
   

70
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,090
So that would put us in the
direction of an Sn1.

71
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,280
So we have two data points.

72
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,670
I'm sorry, for an Sn2.

73
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,510
We have two data points for Sn2
because remember, it has

74
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,500
to just kind of go in
there and be active.

75
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,640
It's not too big of a molecule,
so it's not going to

76
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,000
be hindered.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,390
But it's also an extremely
strong base, even stronger

78
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,880
than hydroxide.

79
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:38,920
So it's also an extremely strong
base, which might lead

80
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,590
us or that does imply
that we're going

81
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,680
to have an E2 reaction.

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,640
Now, the last thing we need to
think about is the carbon

83
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,660
where the leaving group
might leave from.

84
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,230
And immediately, when you look
at the bromocyclopentane,

85
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,590
there's only one functional
group attached to the chain,

86
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,350
and that is the bromo group
right here, right there.

87
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,760
It is attached to this carbon.

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,860
We could call that the
alpha carbon, and it

89
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,150
is a secondary carbon.

90
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,100
This carbon right here
is bonded to

91
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,655
one, two other carbons.

92
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:10,350
   

93
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,660
This alpha carbon-- let
me write it this way.

94
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:23,040
This alpha carbon is a secondary
carbon, and that

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,540
kind of makes it neutral
in this mix.

96
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,190
If it was a methyl or
primary carbon, it

97
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,740
would favor Sn2, actually.

98
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,540
I mean methyl, the only thing
you could have is an Sn2.

99
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,970
And if it was a tertiary carbon,
it would favor Sn1 or

100
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,500
E1 because it would favor
a stable carbocation.

101
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,770
The leaving group could just
leave. And if this guy was

102
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,210
bonded to another carbon,
it would be very stable.

103
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,300
But in this situation, it's
a secondary carbon

104
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,250
bonded to two carbons.

105
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,460
It's a little bit neutral.

106
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,750
Any of these reactions
might occur.

107
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,000
When we look at all of the other
data points, they're

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,010
pointing at both Sn2 or E2.

109
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,430
We have a strong
nucleophile/base.

110
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,770
We have an aprotic solvent.

111
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,110
It's going to be Sn2
or an E2 reaction.

112
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,000
So let's actually draw
the reactions.

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,860
Let me do the Sn2 first. So
let me do it in orange.

114
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,770
So if we were to have
an Sn2 reaction, let

115
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,020
me redraw the molecule.

116
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,190
   

117
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,630
Let me draw the cyclopentane
part.

118
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,350
I want to make sure-- let me
draw it the same way I had it

119
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,570
drawn up there.

120
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,750
So the pentagon is
facing upwards.

121
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,790
And then we have our bromo
group right there.

122
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:41,910
So we have our methoxide
ion right over here.

123
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,980
So CH3O minus.

124
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,410
Or another way we could view
it is that this oxygen has

125
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,740
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven valence electrons

126
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,440
with a negative charge.

127
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:02,070
One of these electrons right
over here, this can attack the

128
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,410
substrate right over
there, that carbon.

129
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,960
Right when that happens,
simultaneously this bromine is

130
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,460
going to be able to
nab an electron

131
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,880
from that same carbon.

132
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,350
And then we are going to be left
with-- the bromine now

133
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,070
becomes the bromide anion.

134
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,900
   

135
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,620
It had one, two, three,
four, five, six,

136
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,670
seven valence electrons.

137
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,730
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

138
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,000
Now it nabbed one more electron,
making it bromide.

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,180
Now it has a negative charge.

140
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,300
And if we were to draw
the chain, it

141
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,550
would look like this.

142
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,460
   

143
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,195
Well, we could draw it on this,
and I might as well draw

144
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:50,250
it on this side, just so it's
attacking from the other side.

145
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,870
This is the chiral substrate,
so we don't have to be too

146
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,550
particular about how we draw the
connections to the carbon.

147
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,850
We're not actually even
showing anything

148
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,210
popping in or out.

149
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,470
But we would have the methoxide
ion, where now it's

150
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,940
bonded, so it's no longer
an ion, so it's

151
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,450
OCH3, just like that.

152
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,920
It has bonded to this carbon.

153
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,660
Obviously, implicitly this
carbon had another hydrogen

154
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,150
that we are not showing.

155
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,800
Just that quickly, that
was the Sn2 reaction.

156
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,720
That is the mechanism.

157
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,360
Now let's think about what
the E2 reaction is.

158
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,780
To do the E2 properly, to give
it justice, we're going to

159
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,540
have to draw some of
the hydrogens.

160
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,030
So on the E2 reaction, let
me draw that in blue.

161
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,830
   

162
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,320
Let me draw the cyclopentane
part.

163
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,140
Let me draw it big.

164
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,200
Actually, over here, it's less
important to draw it too big.

165
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,890
So let me draw the pentagon.

166
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,130
The pentagon just like that.

167
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,660
That is the bromine, three,
four, five, six, and then it

168
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,590
has a seventh valence electron
right over here.

169
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,080
This is the alpha carbon.

170
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,050
That right there is
the alpha carbon.

171
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,020
And then there are
two beta carbons.

172
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,340
There are two beta carbons right
over there and there.

173
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,970
They each have two hydrogens
on them.

174
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,390
They each have two hydrogens.

175
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,390
I know it's becoming a
little hard to read.

176
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,210
They each have two hydrogens
on them.

177
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,450
And in an E2 reaction, the
strong base will react-- let

178
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,620
me make it a little
cleaner than that.

179
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,370
Let me get rid of the beta.

180
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,070
The beta makes it's
a little dirty.

181
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,440
OK, so they each have two
hydrogens on them.

182
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,890
   

183
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,580
Now in an E2 reaction, the
strong base-- over here, the

184
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,320
methoxide ion was acting as
a strong nucleophile.

185
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,790
In E2, it's going to act
as a strong base.

186
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,470
It's going to nab off a hydrogen
off of one of the

187
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,500
beta carbons.

188
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,800
And you might want to
say, OK, which one?

189
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,730
Let's look at Zaitsev's rule.

190
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,520
It doesn't matter.

191
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,670
These are symmetric.

192
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,550
They are both bonded to
two other carbons.

193
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,430
They both are bonded to the
same number of hydrogens.

194
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,270
It doesn't matter.

195
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,060
It's actually going to be random
which one, and you

196
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,710
actually won't be able
tell the difference

197
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,990
because it's symmetric.

198
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,260
So let's just draw
it like this.

199
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,740
Let me draw the methoxide ion.

200
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,860
One, two, three, four--
or anion, maybe I

201
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,710
should say-- five, six.

202
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,970
And then it has one
bond to the CH3.

203
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,440
It has a negative charge, very,
very, very strong base.

204
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,980
It can go over here and nab
the hydrogen and leave

205
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,310
hydrogen's electron behind.

206
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,870
Maybe I'll take a color.

207
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,160
This electron can be given to
the hydrogen so that it forms

208
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,030
a bond with it.

209
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,220
Hydrogen's electron-- let
me do this in a suitably

210
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,490
different color.

211
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,180
Hydrogen's electron that is
sitting right over there can

212
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,940
now be given to the
alpha carbon.

213
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,940
It can now be given to
the alpha carbon to

214
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,170
form a double bond.

215
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,430
And now that the alpha carbon is
getting that electron, now

216
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,280
the bromo group can leave. It's
a decent leaving group.

217
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,840
And that was another thing that
we should think about in

218
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,250
our equation.

219
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,180
But a good leaving group
actually favors all of the

220
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,140
reactions: Sn2, E2, Sn1, E1.

221
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,800
And so the carbon's getting
the electron, and then the

222
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,150
bromine can then take this
carbon's electron.

223
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,610
And just in one step that's
what's distinctive about the

224
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,470
E2 and the Sn2 reactions.

225
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,910
All of the reactions
are involved in the

226
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,850
rate-determining step and there
really is only one step.

227
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,850
Just like that, after that
happens, what we're left with

228
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,380
is the methoxide anion
takes the hydrogen,

229
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,330
so it becomes methanol.

230
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,450
Let me draw that.

231
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,510
So it becomes methanol.

232
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:39,150
So it had one, two, three, four
and then five, that's

233
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,280
this one right there, but then
this guy goes and bonds with

234
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,540
the hydrogen.

235
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,570
This guy goes and bonds with the
hydrogen, just like that,

236
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,580
and hydrogen leaves its
electron behind.

237
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,580
Let me draw the cyclopentane
part now.

238
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,470
And so the cyclopentane looked
like this before, if I just

239
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,770
focus on the ring.

240
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,700
Now, this guy was bonded
to a hydrogen.

241
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,540
He was bonded to this hydrogen
over here, but now that

242
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,470
electron is going to be used to
form a bond with this alpha

243
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,390
carbon right over here.

244
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,640
Let me draw the alpha carbon.

245
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,040
And the alpha carbon is
right over there.

246
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,680
Obviously, implicitly at
every one of these

247
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,970
edges, we have a carbon.

248
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,670
But now, a double bond
is going to form

249
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,350
with that alpha carbon.

250
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,980
We could just draw it like
that, a double bond.

251
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,620
Obviously, there's another
carbon here.

252
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,200
I could write up another
carbon over there.

253
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,070
And now this double
bond will form.

254
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,280
And now the bromide has left.

255
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,700
It's taken an electron with it
from that carbon now that the

256
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,530
carbon doesn't need it.

257
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,010
It was already starting to
hog it because it's so

258
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,550
electronegative.

259
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,500
So that's bromine.

260
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,250
It takes that orange electron.

261
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,750
   

262
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,040
Now, it is bromide.

263
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,080
And we're done.

264
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,030
And so just to go back to the
original question here, which

265
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,750
reaction is likely to occur
or which mechanism?

266
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,510
It's actually both Sn2 and E2.

267
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,960
You would see a mix of both of
these occurring because you

268
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,520
have all of the environmental
factors that

269
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,800
would enable both.

270
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,130
And so you would have both
of these mechanisms.

271
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,960
Here's the-- let me
separate them out.

272
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,360
Here's the Sn2 reaction.

273
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,650
You would have the Sn2 reaction
occurring in your

274
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,690
whatever, your vial, or your
pot, or whatever you're making

275
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,180
all of this stuff occur in, and
you would also have your

276
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,320
E2 reaction.

277
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,960
So you would see some of all of
these, some of all of those

278
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,780
products and these products
right over there.
