1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,340
I've been doing a ton of videos
on the mechanics of

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,530
taking the Laplace Transform,
but you've been sitting

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,620
through them always wondering,
what am I learning this for?

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,670
And now I'll show you, at
least in the context of

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,870
differential equations.

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,140
And I've gotten a
bunch of letters

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,680
on the Laplace Transform.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,570
What does it really mean?

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,390
And and all that.

11
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,050
And those are excellent
questions and you should

12
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,120
strive for that.

13
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,410
It's hard to really have an
intuition of the Laplace

14
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,030
Transform in the differential
equations context, other than

15
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,630
it being a very useful tool that
converts differential or

16
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,530
integral problems into algebra
problems. But I'll give you a

17
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,980
hint, and if you want a path
to learn it in, you should

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,520
learn about Fourier series and
Fourier Transforms, which are

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,710
very similar to Laplace
Transforms. And that'll

20
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,360
actually build up the intuition
on what the

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,610
frequency domain is all about.

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,200
Well anyway, let's actually use
the Laplace Transform to

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,630
solve a differential equation.

24
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,680
And this is one we've
seen before.

25
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,210
So let me see.

26
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,300
So let's say the differential
equation is y prime prime,

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,330
plus 5, times the first
derivative, plus

28
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,210
6y, is equal to 0.

29
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,930
And you know how to solve this
one, but I just want to show

30
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,490
you, with a fairly
straightforward differential

31
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,540
equation, that you could solve
it with the Laplace Transform.

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,930
And actually, you
end up having a

33
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,630
characteristic equation.

34
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:27,400
And the initial conditions are
y of 0 is equal to 2, and y

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,490
prime of 0 is equal to 3.

36
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,100
Now, to use the Laplace
Transform here, we essentially

37
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,280
just take the Laplace Transform
of both sides of

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,460
this equation.

39
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,590
Let me use a more
vibrant color.

40
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,060
So we get the Laplace Transform
of y the second

41
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,090
derivative, plus-- well we
could say the Laplace

42
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,590
Transform of 5 times y prime,
but that's the same thing as 5

43
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,745
times the Laplace Transform--
y prime.

44
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:59,310
   

45
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,190
y prime plus 6 times the
Laplace Transform of y.

46
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,910
And let me ask you a question.

47
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,780
What's the Laplace
Transform of 0?

48
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,130
Let me do that.

49
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,990
So the Laplace Transform of 0
would be be the integral from

50
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,160
0 to infinity, of 0 times
e to the minus stdt.

51
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,330
So this is a 0 in here.

52
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,400
So this is equal to 0.

53
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,340
So the Laplace Transform
of 0 is 0.

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,870
And that's good, because I
didn't have space to do

55
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,560
another curly L.

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,730
So what are the Laplace
Transforms of these things?

57
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,210
Well this is where we break
out one of the useful

58
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,500
properties that we learned.

59
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,530
Let me write it over here.

60
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,820
I think that's going
to need as much

61
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,656
real estate as possible.

62
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:44,320
Let me erase this.

63
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,850
   

64
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,080
So we learned that the Laplace
Transform-- I'll do it here.

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,860
Actually, I'll do
it down here.

66
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,150
The Laplace Transform of f
prime, or we could even say y

67
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:08,990
prime, is equal to s times
the Laplace Transform of

68
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,690
y, minus y of 0.

69
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,800
We proved that to you.

70
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,300
And this is extremely
important to know.

71
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,800
So let's see if we
can apply that.

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,810
So the Laplace Transform of y
prime prime, if we apply that,

73
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:33,296
that's equal to s times the
Laplace Transform of-- well if

74
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,540
we go from y prime to y,
you're just taking the

75
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,390
anti-derivative, so if you're
taking the anti-derivative of

76
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,140
y, of the second derivative, we
just end up with the first

77
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,950
derivative-- minus the first
derivative at 0.

78
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,530
Notice, we're already using
our initial conditions.

79
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,130
I won't substitute
it just yet.

80
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,950
And then we end up with plus 5,
times-- I'll write it every

81
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:07,530
time-- so plus 5 times the
Laplace Transform of y prime,

82
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,800
plus 6 times the Laplace
Transform of y.

83
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,970
All of that is equal to 0.

84
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:20,490
So just to be clear, all I did
is I expanded this into this

85
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,350
using this.

86
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,410
So how can we rewrite the
Laplace Transform of y prime?

87
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,870
Well, we could use this once
again, so let's do that.

88
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,630
So this over here-- I'll do it
in magenta-- this is equal to

89
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,830
s times what?

90
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,950
s times the Laplace Transform
of y prime.

91
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:48,410
Well that's s times the Laplace
Transform of y, minus

92
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,220
y of 0, right?

93
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,300
I took this part and replaced
it with what I have in

94
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,310
parentheses.

95
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:05,800
So minus y prime of 0-- and now
I'll switch colors-- plus

96
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,370
5 times-- once again the Laplace
Transform of y prime.

97
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,360
Well we can use this again.

98
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:24,550
So 5 times s times Laplace
Transform of y, minus y of 0,

99
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,540
plus 6 times the Laplace
Transform-- oh I ran out of

100
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,160
space, I'll do it in another
line-- plus 6 times the

101
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,250
Laplace Transform of y.

102
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,190
All of that is equal to 0.

103
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,730
I know this looks really
confusing but we'll

104
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,820
simplify right now.

105
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,680
And we could get rid of this
right here, because we've used

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,550
it as much as we need to.

107
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,050
So now we just simplify.

108
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,900
And notice, using the Laplace
Transform, we didn't have to

109
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,030
guess at a general solution
or anything like that.

110
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,900
Even when we did a
characteristic equation, we

111
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,030
guessed what the original
general solution was.

112
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,900
Now we're just taking Laplace
Transforms, and let's see

113
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,595
where this gets us.

114
00:05:57,595 --> 00:05:59,410
And actually I just want to
make clear, because I know

115
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:09,830
it's very confusing, so I
rewrote this part as this.

116
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,260
And I rewrote this
thing as this.

117
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,360
And everything else
is the same.

118
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,610
But now let's simplify
the math.

119
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:23,930
So we get s squared, times the
Laplace Transform of y-- I'm

120
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,900
going to write smaller, I've
learned my lesson-- minus s

121
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,150
times y of 0.

122
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,860
Let's substitute y of 0 here. y
of 0 is 2, so s times y of 0

123
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,970
is 2 times s, so 2s, distribute
that s, minus y

124
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,770
prime of 0.

125
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,590
Y prime of 0 is 3.

126
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:52,720
So minus 3, plus-- so we have
5 times s times the Laplace

127
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,830
Transform of y, so plus 5s times
the Laplace Transform of

128
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:07,450
y, minus 5 times y of 0. y
of 0 is 2, so minus 10.

129
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,980
Minus 10, right?

130
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:14,040
5 times-- this is 2 right here--
so 5 times 2, plus 6

131
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,950
times the Laplace
Transform of y.

132
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,450
All of that is equal to 0.

133
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,070
Now, let's group our Laplace
Transform of y terms and our

134
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,800
constant terms, and we
should be hopefully

135
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,790
getting some place.

136
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,750
So let's see, my Laplace
Transform of y terms, I have

137
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,700
this one, I have this one,
and I have that one.

138
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,480
So what am I left with?

139
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,020
Well let me factor out the
Laplace Transform of y part.

140
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,160
So I get the Laplace Transform
of y-- and that's good because

141
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,980
it's a pain to keep writing
it over and over-- times s

142
00:07:50,980 --> 00:08:02,120
squared plus 5s plus 6.

143
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,370
So those are all my Laplace
Transform terms. And then I

144
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,460
have my constant terms. So let's
see, I have 1s, so minus

145
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:20,040
2s, minus 3, minus 10,
is equal to 0.

146
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,480
And what can we do here?

147
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Well, this is interesting,
first of all.

148
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,270
Notice that the coefficients on
the Laplace Transform of y

149
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,200
terms, that those are that
characteristic equation that

150
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,840
we dealt with so much, and that
is hopefully, to some

151
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,909
degree, second nature to you.

152
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,240
So that's a little bit of a
clue, and if you want some

153
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,690
very tenuous connections, well
that makes a lot of sense.

154
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,030
Because the characteristic
equation to get that, we

155
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,030
substituted e to the rt, and the
Laplace Transform involves

156
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,140
very similar function.

157
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,670
But anyway, let's go back
to the problem.

158
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,400
So how do we solve this?

159
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,190
And actually, let me just give
you the big picture here,

160
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,630
because this is a good point.

161
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,830
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to solve this.

162
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,280
I'm going to say the Laplace
Transform of

163
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,970
y is equal to something.

164
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,260
And then I'm going to say,
boy, what functions the

165
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,100
Laplace Transform
is at something?

166
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,220
And then I'll have
the solution.

167
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,010
If that confuses you, just wait
and hopefully it'll make

168
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,380
some sense.

169
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,630
From here until that point
it's just some

170
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,610
fairly hairy algebra.

171
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,830
So let's scroll down a little
bit, just so we have some

172
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,900
breathing room.

173
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,720
And so I get the Laplace
Transform of y, times s

174
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,800
squared, plus 5s, plus 6, is
equal to-- let's add these

175
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,950
terms to both sides of this
equation-- is equal to 2s plus

176
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,930
3 plus 10-- oh, that's
silly-- plus 13.

177
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,630
This is minus 13 here.

178
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,630
A phone call.

179
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,770
Who's calling?

180
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,650
I think it's some kind of
marketing phone call.

181
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,600
Anyway, 2s plus 13, and
now what can I do?

182
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:51,910
Well.

183
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,130
Let's divide both sides by this
s squared plus 5s plus 6.

184
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:08,030
So I get the Laplace Transform
of y is equal to 2s plus 13,

185
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:13,910
over s squared plus 5s plus 6.

186
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,540
Now we're almost done.

187
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,440
Everything here is just a
little bit of algebra.

188
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,350
So now we're almost done.

189
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,730
We haven't solved for y yet, but
we know that the Laplace

190
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,970
Transform of y is
equal to this.

191
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,160
Now, if we just had this in
our table of our Laplace

192
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,210
Transforms, we would immediately
know what y was,

193
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,750
but I don't see something, or
I don't remember anything we

194
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,790
did in our table that looks
like this expression of s.

195
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,130
I'm essentially out of time, so
the next video we're going

196
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,950
to figure out what functions
Laplace Transform is this.

197
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,490
And it actually turns out it's
a sum of things we already

198
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,590
know, and we just have to
manipulate this a little bit

199
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,640
algebraically.

200
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,620
See you in the next video.

201
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:50,900
