1
00:00:00,662 --> 00:00:03,283
A function f of x is plotted below -

2
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:06,228
highlighted interval where f prime of x

3
00:00:06,228 --> 00:00:08,509
requisite the first derivative of x

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,988
or the first derivative of f was aspect to x

5
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:13,105
is greater than zero

6
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:17,545
and f double prime of x with the second derivative of f with aspect to x

7
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:18,796
is less than zero.

8
00:00:18,796 --> 00:00:20,415
So lets think about what they're saying.

9
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:22,299
So we're looking for a place with a first derivative

10
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:24,311
is greater than zero

11
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:27,277
that means that the slope of the tangent line is positive

12
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:31,013
that means that the function is increasing over that interval.

13
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:32,631
So if we just think about it here

14
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:34,547
over this whole region right over here

15
00:00:34,547 --> 00:00:36,505
the fuction is clearly decreasing.

16
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:40,033
Then the slope becomes zero right over here,

17
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:42,038
then the function starts increasing again

18
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:46,220
all the way until this point right over here hits zero

19
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,384
and then it goes and the fuction starts decreasing.

20
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,036
So we're gonna - just as first constraint right over here

21
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:54,271
tells us it's going to be something in this interval right over there

22
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:59,590
and then they say when the second derivative is less than zero.

23
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,318
So this means that the slope itself -

24
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:05,307
whether it's positive or negative -

25
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:07,822
that it's actually decreasing.

26
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:10,892
We're gonna be concave downwards right over here.

27
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:13,056
The slope itself, it could be positive,

28
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:15,927
but it'll be coming less and less and less positive.

29
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:18,540
And so we're looking for a place where the slope is positive,

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,731
but it's becoming less and less and less positive.

31
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:23,424
If you're looking right over here -

32
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:25,826
the slope is positive, but the slope is increasing -

33
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:28,669
it's getting steeper and steeper and steeper as we go -

34
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:30,129
and then all of the sudden it's getting

35
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,349
less steep, less steep, less steep, less steep -

36
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:35,164
all the way to when the slope gets back to zero.

37
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:36,618
So if we wanna select an interval

38
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:39,538
it would be this interval right over here.

39
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:43,076
Out slope is positive, our function is clearly increasing,

40
00:01:43,076 --> 00:01:46,143
but it is increasing at a lower and lower rate.

41
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:48,481
(so I will select that right over there).

42
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:51,089
Lets do one more example:

43
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:52,848
A function f of x is plotted below.

44
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:57,019
Highlight an interval where f(x)>0

45
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:59,446
so the same thing where our function is increasing

46
00:01:59,446 --> 00:02:02,739
but it's increasing at a slower and slower rate.

47
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:07,995
So our function is increasing in this whole region right over here

48
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,453
and we see it's really steep here

49
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:11,631
then it's getting less steep and less steep

50
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,141
and it's getting closer and closer to zero

51
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:16,984
- the slope of the tangent line or the rate of increase of the function.

52
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:20,984
So I would pick anything right around this region right here.
