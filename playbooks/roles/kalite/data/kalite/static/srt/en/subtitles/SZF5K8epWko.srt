1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:05,884
[music playing]

2
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:09,117
We're looking at a really wonderful Caravaggio.

3
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:15,522
This is a painting of "The Calling of St. Matthew"
in San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome.

4
00:00:15,522 --> 00:00:16,956
In the Contarelli chapel.

5
00:00:16,956 --> 00:00:18,388
That's right. In the larger church.

6
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:21,955
And it's in a chapel with two
other paintings by Caravaggio,

7
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,357
all about Matthew.

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,639
So Matthew is one of Christ's disciples.

9
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:28,721
And so which one is he here?

10
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:31,228
It's a little hard to find him here actually.

11
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:33,361
It's a complicated group of figures here.

12
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,961
It's very complicated.

13
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:36,243
I love the subject.

14
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:37,660
Christ is walking in.

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,377
Now which one is Christ?
There are two figures on the right.

16
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:44,444
Yeah. I think St. Peter is in
front of Christ on the right.

17
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,675
He's the sort of heavy, powerful,
rough-looking guy.

18
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:49,709
Yeah. With the short-
cropped hair.

19
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:55,892
And behind him, half obscured,
facing us is Christ with his arm outstretched.

20
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:59,360
He looks much more noble,
younger, more delicate actually.

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,342
And there is a kind of delicacy
to his gestures that remove him, I think,

22
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:10,309
from the regular world of the other figures
seem to occupy as he seems to point over,

23
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:14,276
and Matthew is the one who is
pointing to himself in disbelief.

24
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:16,925
He's the older figure
with the large beard.

25
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:17,759
With a black hat.

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,375
Yes, and a dark tunic.

27
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:23,709
And I think, if I remember correctly,
the story is that Matthew is a tax collector,

28
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,710
and he's sitting with his fellow
tax collectors as Christ walks in,

29
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,309
and he says Matthew, and basically says,
"you, come with me."

30
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:32,742
And it's this moment of conversion.

31
00:01:32,742 --> 00:01:35,426
This is this incredible moment
of spiritual awakening.

32
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:38,860
Right, which is a very typical
subject in Baroque art.

33
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,160
So there's this notion of
transformation.

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,392
At this moment that Christ says,
"hey you, you're coming with me."

35
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:47,641
Matthew points to himself, "me?"

36
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,838
You can't possibly mean me.

37
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:50,895
Right. I'm a tax collector.

38
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:52,794
Well, there is all kinds of negative implications.

39
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:54,844
It's not just that he's working for the I.R.S.

40
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:57,944
A little bit more shady than the I.R.S.

41
00:01:57,944 --> 00:01:59,946
It's much more shady.
Look at the environment they're in.

42
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:01,562
It's so important for Caravaggio.

43
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:03,511
He's not showing Christ in Heaven.

44
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:07,545
He's not showing Christ in an
elevated, classicized environment.

45
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:12,194
He's in this what looks like the back room of a tavern.

46
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:16,160
And when we look at it,
it looks like he is surrounded by younger men

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,461
who are counting money.

48
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:21,949
Yeah, they are leaning over
sort of greedily, the figure especially on the left.

49
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:25,749
And their arms. They've got swords.
They're dressed in very fancy clothes.

50
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:27,598
You can sort of imagine one of them 
whipping out their swords

51
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,633
and getting into a bar room brawl almost.

52
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:32,800
That's right. But there is this
real sense of this money

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,483
is not gotten legally.

54
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:37,848
Imagine if you walked into a bar now
and you walked into the back room

55
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:42,616
and there were very overly dressed,
ostentatiously dressed young men with guns

56
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:44,416
counting money.

57
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,049
Would that be an environment you
would want to be in?

58
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,499
I think that's what makes this moment
of conversion all the more wonderful.

59
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:54,749
But how potent this must have been
when this painting was made in 1599 or 1600

60
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:59,564
when Christ is being shown in really
this much more contemporary environment

61
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:01,365
and all of this is made real.

62
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:07,365
Very real. The figures are so removed 
from the idealized beauty of the High Renaissance.

63
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:11,198
It must have been challenging, a little scary,
but really exciting.

64
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:16,515
Caravaggio brings the spiritual down to 
an everyday level that we can all totally relate to

65
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:19,398
instead of that distance that was 
there in the High Renaissance.

66
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:23,098
But it is really interesting if you think that
these are paintings in Rome,

67
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:28,299
with all the pomp and ceremony of Rome,
and Caravaggio is giving such a fresh --

68
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:30,349
it is really wonderful and fabulous.

69
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:34,182
The thing that I always think about
with this painting when I try to relate it

70
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:38,607
to living in the 21st century, I imagine
sometimes my own version of it reading

71
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:44,672
maybe it's the holidays, and I'm supposed
to be shopping for friends and family,

72
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:48,506
and instead I'm buying something for myself,
and I'm getting my credit card out,

73
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:54,069
trying to imagine Christ walking in a door
of Banana Republic and saying,

74
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,354
"You. I've chosen you."

75
00:03:57,354 --> 00:04:00,270
Look at the way that Caravaggio
is handling light here.

76
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,104
It's not just Christ walking in.

77
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:06,688
He is the embodiment of a
kind of spiritual force

78
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:11,087
in that as he points to Matthew,
and your eye can go from his glance

79
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:14,854
across his hand to Matthew's finger,
following that diagonal line,

80
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,319
of the sunlight which seems to be
pouring in maybe with a doorway

81
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:18,969
that they've opened.

82
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:19,904
Who knows what.

83
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:25,656
And it is almost as if that point of Christ
sends these piercing rays to Matthew

84
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:30,272
that gets to him but also in a way
that interrupts this moment

85
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:31,672
of reality in the tavern

86
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:38,073
so that he is sort of suspended between this moment
of calling and transformation and conversion,

87
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:40,590
but also still immersed in his reality.

88
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:47,135
Of course it is also a very Baroque characteristic
of this caught extreme moment of time,

89
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:51,986
and also what is very Baroque about it 
that I appreciate is this way the divine

90
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:54,136
has entered everyday life.

91
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:58,552
We see that with St. Theresa and so 
many other Baroque paintings.

92
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:02,691
In a sense the Baroque is taking these 
intensely spiritual forms

93
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:03,675
that have come out of the Renaissance,

94
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:09,134
maintaining the high naturalism and really building
on the high naturalism of the Renaissance

95
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:11,468
but putting it in an environment, where
as you said earlier,

96
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:14,750
it is completely accessible, and very,
very real and immediate.

97
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,867
There is something to me sometimes not even
just real and immediate,

98
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:20,350
but almost pedestrian and dirty.

99
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,317
If you look at the bare feet of Peter, of Christ,
there is something gritty about Caravaggio.

100
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:27,017
Look at the window.

101
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:30,450
It looks as though it has been covered so as
not to let light in.

102
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,200
It's soot.

103
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,517
The walls look dirty and grimy.
This is not an ideal environment.

104
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:37,933
I have one thing I thought
is always very curious.

105
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:42,233
If you look at Christ's hand, because there
is a lot of attention compositionally on that hand,

106
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,367
right under the cross of the window,

107
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,000
and that slight bend of the wrist,

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,500
it is the hand that Michaelangelo had painted,
but of Adam,

109
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,367
but here, in an interesting
kind of reversal,

110
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:56,618
there has been the tradition of course of
seeing Christ as the second Adam.

111
00:05:56,618 --> 00:05:57,467
That's right.

112
00:05:57,467 --> 00:06:02,167
Adam causes the fall of mankind and
Christ redeems mankind.

113
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,218
And so in a sense bookends on this story.

114
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:07,483
And this moment of redemption,
personal redemption for Matthew.

115
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:11,483
Just as Adam was created, in a sense
Matthew is recreated.

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Díváme se na úžasný Caravaggiův obraz

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Díváme se na úžasný Caravaggiův obraz.Je to obraz
