1
00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:03,932
Alright, now we have a very interesting situation.

2
00:00:04,193 --> 00:00:09,951
On both sides of the scale, we have our mystery mass and now I'm calling the mystery mass having a mass of Y.

3
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:12,066
Just to show you that it doesn't always have to be X.

4
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:14,902
It can be any symbol as long as you can keep track of that symbol.

5
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:18,523
But all these have the same mass. That's why I wrote Y on all of them.

6
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:23,680
And we also have a little 1 kilogram boxes on both sides of the scale.

7
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:28,867
So the first thing I wanna do, we're gonna do step by step and try to figure out what this mystery mass is.

8
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:35,025
But the first thing I wanna do is, is, is, have you think about, whether you can represent this algebraically?

9
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:40,155
Whether with, with a little bit of mathematic symbolry, you can represent what's going on this scale.

10
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:46,638
Over here, I have three Ys and three of these boxes and their total mass is equal to this one Y.

11
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:49,751
And I think I have about let's see, I have 7 boxes right over here.

12
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:51,504
So I'll give you a few seconds to do that.

13
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:58,445
So let's think about the total mass over here. We have 3 boxes and a mass Y.

14
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:04,334
So they're going to have a mass of 3Y, and then you have 3 boxes with a mass of 1 kilogram.

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:11,892
So they're going to have a mass of 3 kilograms. Now over here, I have 1 box with a mass of Y kilograms.

16
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:17,429
So that's going to be my 1Y right over there. I could've written 1Y but that's, I don't need to.

17
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:23,299
A Y is the same thing as 1Y. So I have the Y kilograms right there. And I have seven of these, right?

18
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:30,254
1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Yup, seven of these. So I have Y plus 7 kilograms on the right-hand side.

19
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:35,908
And once again, it's balanced. The scale is balanced. This mass, total mass is equal to this total mass.

20
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:40,869
So we can write an equal sign, right over there. So that's a good starting point.

21
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,833
We were able to represent this situation to this real-life simple situation.

22
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:50,931
You know, back in the day, when people actually had to figure out the mass of things if you were to go the jewelry store, whatever.

23
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:55,646
They actually did had problems like this. We were able to represent it mathematically.

24
00:01:56,014 --> 00:02:03,498
Now the next thing to do is, what are some reasonable next steps? How can we start to simplify this a little bit?

25
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:05,915
You know, once again, I'll give you a few seconds to think about that.

26
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:12,680
Well, the neat thing about algebra is there's actually multiple paths that you could go down.

27
00:02:12,772 --> 00:02:19,154
You might say, well why won't we remove 3 of these what, of these yellow blocks from both sides?

28
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:24,110
That would be completely legitimate. You might say, well, why won't we remove 1 of these Ys from both sides?

29
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:29,486
That also would be legitimate. And we could do it in either order. So let's just pick one of them.

30
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:35,834
Let's say that we've first want to remove, let's say that we first want to remove the, a Y from either sides.

31
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:39,579
Just so that we feel a little bit more comfortable with all of our Ys sitting on the 1 side.

32
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:46,234
And so the best way, if we don't want all of our Ys to sit on the 1 side, we can remove, we can remove a Y from each side.

33
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:52,903
Remember, if you removed a Y from only 1 side, that would unbalance the scale. The scale was already balanced whatever you have to do to the one side after you do the other.

34
00:02:53,163 --> 00:03:02,178
So I'm gonna remove a Y, I'm gonna remove Y mass from both sides. Now what will that look like algebraically?

35
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:09,381
Well. I remove the Y from both sides. So I subtracted Y from the left-hand side and I subtracted Y from the right-hand side.

36
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:14,189
That's exactly what I did. The mass, it had a massive Y. I don't know what that is but I did take it away.

37
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:20,682
I lifted that block, that little, that little block. And so, on the left-hand side, on the left-hand side, what am I left with?

38
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:23,986
That you can pick it up mathematically, you can even look up here, and look up here what you're left with.

39
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:29,566
If I had 3 of something, and I take away 1 of them, if I take away 1 of them, I'm left with 2 of that something.

40
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:35,088
So I'm left with 2Y, right over here, you see it. I had 3, I got rid of 1, so I'm left with 2.

41
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:44,543
And I still have those 3 yellow blocks. So I still have those 3 yellow blocks. On the right-hand side, I had a Y, I took away the Y, and so now I have no Ys left.

42
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:51,898
We see it visually right over here. And I still have 7 of the yellow blocks. So I still have 7 of the yellow blocks.

43
00:03:52,082 --> 00:04:01,332
And since I took the exact same mass from both sides of the scale, the scale is still going to be balanced. It was balanced before, I took away the same thing from both sides.

44
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:07,662
And so the scale is still, is still balanced. So this is going to be equal to that.

45
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:12,319
Now, now just trying to look a bit similar to what we saw in that last video.

46
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,311
But I will ask you, what can we do from this point?

47
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:24,059
What can we do from this point to simplify it further or so, even better, think of it so we could isolate the, these Ys on the left-hand side.

48
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:26,949
And I'll give you a few seconds to think about that.

49
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:35,894
Well, if we want to isolate these Ys on the left-hand side, these 2 Ys, the best way is to get rid of this 3, to get rid of these 3 blocks.

50
00:04:35,894 --> 00:04:41,862
So why won't we do that? Let's take 3 blocks from this side but we can't just take it from that side if we want to keep it balanced.

51
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:46,746
We have to do it to this side too. We gotta take away, we gotta take away 3 blocks.

52
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:50,761
So we're subtracting 3 from that side, and subtracting 3 from the right side.

53
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:58,230
So on the left-hand side, on the left-hand side, we're gonna be left with just these 2 blocks of mass Y.

54
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:04,068
So our total mass is now going to be 2Y. These 3 minus 3 is 0, and you see that here.

55
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:08,905
We're just left with 2Ys right over here, and on the right-hand side, we got rid of 3 of the blocks.

56
00:05:08,905 --> 00:05:17,705
So we only have 4 of them left. So you have 4 of them left. So you have 2 of these Y masses is equal to 4 kilograms.

57
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,084
And because we did the same thing to both sides, the scale is still balanced.

58
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:27,626
And now, well how do we solve this? And you might be able to solve this in your head. I have 2 times something is equal to 4.

59
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:33,769
And you can kind of think about what that is, but if we want to stay true to what we've been doing before, let's think about it.

60
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:39,287
I have 2 of something, is equal to something else. What if I multiply both sides by 2?

61
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:45,499
Oh, sorry, what if I multiply both sides by 1/2 or another way is dividing both sides by 2.

62
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:52,763
If I multiply this side by 1/2, if I essentially take away half of the mass, or I'll only leave half of the mass,

63
00:05:52,763 --> 00:06:00,903
Then, I'm only gonna have 1 block here, and if I take away half of the mass over here, I'm gonna have to take away 2 of these blocks right over there.

64
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:06,724
And what I just did, you could say I multiplied both sides by 1/2 or just for a sake of a little change,

65
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:13,570
You could say I divided both sides by 2. And on the left-hand side, I'm left with a mass of Y.

66
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:23,333
And on the right-hand side, I'm left with a mass of 4 divided by 2 is 2. And once again I can still write this equal sign because the scale is balanced.

67
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:29,489
I did the exact same thing to both sides. I left half to what was on the left-hand side, and half of it was on the right-hand side.

68
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:34,712
It was balanced before, half of each side, so it's going to be balanced again. But there, we've done it.

69
00:06:34,865 --> 00:06:39,115
We've solved something that's actually not so easy to solve. Or it might not look so easy first.

70
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:47,098
We figured out that our mystery mass Y is 2 kilograms. And you can verify this, this is the really fun thing about algebra.

71
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:53,739
Is it, once you get to this point, you can go back and think about whether the original, the original problem you saw made sense.

72
00:06:54,108 --> 00:07:01,334
Let's do that. Let's think about whether the original problem made sense. And to do that, I want you to, I want you to calculate.

73
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:06,670
Now that we know what the mass Y is it's 2 kilograms. What was the total mass on each side?

74
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:18,423
Well, let's calculate it. We have 2 right, right over here, this is 2 kilograms, I'll do that in purple color,so this is a 2, this is a 2, this is a 2.

75
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:29,678
So we had 6 kilograms plus these 3, we had 9 kilograms on the left-hand side. And on the right-hand side, I had these 7 plus 2 here, 7 plus 2 is 9 kilograms.

76
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:34,231
That's why it was balanced. Our mystery mass, we had 9 kilograms, total on both sides.
