1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:05,982
The owner of a restaurant wants to find out where his patrons are coming from

2
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:12,769
one day he decided to gather data about the distance in miles that people commuted to get to his restaurant

3
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:17,518
People reported the following distances traveled. So here are all the distances traveled.

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:23,136
He wants to create a graph that helps him understand the spread of distances

5
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:32,282
this is a key word, the spread of distances and the median distance, that people travel.

6
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:36,951
What kind of graph should he create?

7
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:41,686
So, the answer to what kind of graph he should create should be more straight forward

8
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:45,237
than the actual creation of the graph which we will also do

9
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:50,137
but he's trying to visualize the spread of information and at

10
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:56,049
the same time he wants the median, so what graph captures both of that information?

11
00:00:56,049 --> 00:01:01,481
Well, a box and whisker plot! So let's try to draw a box and whisker plot!

12
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:05,737
To draw a box and whisker plot we need to come up with the median and we'll also see the median of the two

13
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:09,682
halves of the data as well, and whenever we try to take the median of something, it's

14
00:01:09,682 --> 00:01:12,345
really helpful to order our data.

15
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:16,583
So let's attempt to order our data. So what is the

16
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:25,011
smallest number here? Let's see, there's one 2, so we mark it off. And then we have another 2

17
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:33,600
so we got all the 2's. And then we have this 3, then we have this 3. I think we got all the 3's

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,249
And then we have that 4, and then we have this 4

19
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:46,215
Do we have any 5's? No, do we have any 6's? Yup, we have that 6.

20
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:52,468
And that looks like the only 6. Any 7's? Yep, we have this 7 over here. And I just realized

21
00:01:52,468 --> 00:02:01,032
I missed this 1 so I'm going to put it at the beginning of the set, actually I missed two 1's.

22
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:05,034
Both 1's are right at the beginning of the set.

23
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:10,782
So I have: 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, no 5's this is one 6, one 7, one 8

24
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:17,400
Let's see, any 9's? No 9's. Any 10's? Yep, there's a 10.

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,267
Any 11's? Yes, we have an 11. Any 12's? Nope.

26
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:35,352
We have 14 and 15. We also have a 20 and 22.

27
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:39,369
So, we've ordered all our data is should be relatively straightforward to find the middle of our

28
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:42,304
data. The median. So how many data points we have?

29
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:46,435
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

30
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:49,770
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

31
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,885
So the middle number is the number that has 8 numbers larger than it

32
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:57,684
and 8 numbers smaller than it. So let's think about it. One, two, three, four

33
00:02:57,684 --> 00:03:00,469
five, six, seven, eight. So the number 6 here

34
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:06,512
is larger than eight of the values and if I did the calculations right

35
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:10,084
it should be smaller than eight of the values, one, two, three, four

36
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:13,362
five, six, seven, eight. So it is indeed

37
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:17,812
it is indeed the median. Now when we take

38
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:25,854
a box and whisker plot, the convention is we have our median and it is essentially dividing

39
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:29,494
our data into two sets, now let's take the median of each of

40
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:33,117
those sets, and the convetion is to take our median out and have the sets

41
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:36,801
that are left over. Some times people leave it in, but the standard convention

42
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:41,787
take this median out and look separately at this set and look separately at this set.

43
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:45,382
So if we look at this first, the bottom half of our numbers essentially

44
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:49,216
what's the median of these numbers?

45
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:52,865
Well, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

46
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:57,301
eight, data points. So we are actually gonna have two middle numbers.

47
00:03:57,301 --> 00:04:01,247
So the two middle numbers are this 2 and this 3

48
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:04,220
three numbers less than these two and three numbers greater than them

49
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,950
and so when we are looking for a median, we have this two middle numbers and we are taking the mean

50
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,015
of these two numbers. So halfway between 2 and 3 is 2.5

51
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:16,830
2 plus 3 is 5. 5 divided by 2 is 2.5

52
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,510
So here we have the median of this bottom half of 2.5.

53
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,461
And then the middle of the top half, once again we have eight data points, so our

54
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:33,098
middle two numbers are gonna be this 11 and this 14

55
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:38,969
And so if we want to take the mean of these two numbers, 11 plus 14 is 25. Half of

56
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:47,798
25 is 12.5. 12.5 is exactly halfway in between 11 and 14.

57
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:53,320
And now we have all the information we need to actually

58
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,253
plot our box and whisker plot

59
00:04:55,253 --> 00:05:02,302
So let me draw a number line, so my best

60
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:07,619
attempt at a number line. So that's my number line

61
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:10,503
And let's say this over here is 0.

62
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:14,142
I need to make sure I get up to 22 or beyond 22

63
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:18,683
This is 0, this is 5, this is 10

64
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:22,700
that could be 15, that could be 20

65
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,436
this could be 25, we can keep going

66
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:29,897
30, maybe 35. So the first

67
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:33,751
thing we might want to think about,there's several ways to draw it.

68
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:37,503
We wanna think about the box part of the box and whisker

69
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:42,053
Essentially represents the middle half of our data. So it's essentially

70
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:46,083
trying to represent this data, right over here

71
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:50,457
so the data between the two between the

72
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:53,816
medians of the two halves. So this is the part we would represent

73
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:57,445
with the box. So we would start right over here at this

74
00:05:57,445 --> 00:06:00,462
lower at this 2.5, this is essentially seperating

75
00:06:00,462 --> 00:06:05,351
the fist quartile from the second quartile, the first quarter of our numbers from the second quarter

76
00:06:05,351 --> 00:06:08,953
of our numbers. So let's put it over here, this is 2.5

77
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:13,112
2.5 is halfway between 0 and 5 so that's

78
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:17,504
2.5 and then up here we have 12.5

79
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:22,501
and 12.5 is right over here

80
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:28,567
It's right over here, 12.5

81
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,278
This is halfway between, well halfway

82
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:34,795
between 10 and 15 is 12.5

83
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,913
12.5 right over here, 12.5

84
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:41,514
So that separates the third quartile from the fourth quartile

85
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:44,981
and then our boxes, everything in between, so this is gonna be the middle half

86
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:48,733
of our numbers, the middle half of our numbers, and we wanna

87
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:52,361
show where the actual median is so that's actaully one of things we want to think about

88
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:55,204
in our original.. When the owner of the restaurant

89
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:59,279
how far people are travelling from. So the median is 6

90
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,801
So we can plot it right over here

91
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:08,565
this is about 6, that's a pink color.

92
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:11,900
So this right over here, is 6. And then

93
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,180
the whiskers of the box and whisker plot, essentially show us the range

94
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,186
of our data, and so , let me do that.

95
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:22,114
I will do it in a new color, how about orange?

96
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:23,950
So essentially if we wanna see

97
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,827
look the numbers go all the way up to 22

98
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:31,201
this is 22 right over here, our numbers go all the way

99
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:36,821
up to 22. Our numbers go all the way up to 22.

100
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:41,111
And they go as low as 1

101
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,913
1 is right about here. They go as low

102
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:47,497
as 1...

103
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:51,019
So there you have it. We have our box and whisker plot. And you can see

104
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:53,720
if you have a plot like this, just visually you can immediatly see

105
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,117
what is the median? It is the middle of the box

106
00:07:57,117 --> 00:08:01,928
it shows the middle half, or how far spread is, the meat of the spread

107
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:06,285
it shows beyond that, it shows the range, that goes way beyond

108
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,931
that it goes. Or how far the total spread of our data

109
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:13,119
is. So it gives us a pretty good sense of both the median and

110
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:17,119
the spread of our data
