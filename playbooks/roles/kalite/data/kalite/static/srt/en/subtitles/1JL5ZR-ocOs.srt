1
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:06,941
You know--the Florentines get all the credit

2
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:09,354
and it's important to remember that

3
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:12,823
there was another major city in the 1300s

4
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:14,076
--that was also in Tuscany

5
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:15,913
--that was another independent republic

6
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:18,784
and this is the Republic of Siena with the capital city of Siena.

7
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:21,831
And there was an enormously important and influential painter there

8
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:23,696
whose name was Duccio.

9
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:26,060
And so let's look at one of his most important paintings

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,380
--the Rucellai Madonna.

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,255
Dr. Beth Harris: We're looking at a painting of the Madonna holding the Christ child

12
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:34,407
surrounded by three angels on either side,

13
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:35,645
and twelve feet high

14
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:37,464
--so a very large painting.

15
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:38,646
Dr. Zucker: Yeah, it's a huge painting.

16
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:41,513
In fact, the virgin Mary herself is twice the height

17
00:00:41,513 --> 00:00:43,692
if not larger than a human being

18
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:47,868
--it's an altar piece that's meant to be seen a great distance within a huge church.

19
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:51,044
Dr. Harris: And there's so many decorative patterns here,

20
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:52,755
on the throne,

21
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:56,805
in the spaces in between the posts that make up the throne,

22
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,939
we see reds and blues.

23
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:03,455
And then we've got more patterning in the drapery behind the throne.

24
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:05,933
Dr. Zucker: The characteristics that you're referencing

25
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:11,767
are seen by art historians to be the definition of Sienese art of this time

26
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,209
--highly decorative, highly patterned

27
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:18,297
and with a subtlety of color that we don't often see in Florentine.

28
00:01:18,297 --> 00:01:22,576
Dr. Harris: First of all, Mary's whole body is in this lovely ultramarine blue

29
00:01:22,576 --> 00:01:24,902
which was a very expensive paint,

30
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:29,904
but the angels--we see purples and greens and pinks and blues

31
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:31,646
Dr. Zucker: And they are subtle and prismatic

32
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:33,381
in a way that we don't so much see

33
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:36,149
in the flatter colors of the Florentine style.

34
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:38,980
Dr. Harris: It's hard to say that Mary's sitting "in" her throne.

35
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,542
(laughter)

36
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,253
Dr. Harris: The throne itself is so flat.

37
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:43,677
Dr. Zucker: It's almost a background against which she is seen.

38
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:47,054
There's so much details and so much decorative patterning in the throne,

39
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:49,404
especially in the cloth that drapes the throne

40
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,827
--that it's structure get's lost,

41
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:54,649
because pattern of course does emphasize the two dimensional.

42
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,278
You know when I look at Sienese art

43
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:57,780
especially the Rucellai Madonna,

44
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,280
I tend to think of an artist

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,097
who is so in love with the ability to create beauty

46
00:02:03,097 --> 00:02:08,055
that pattern and form tend to trump the overall representation

47
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:12,143
and the emphasis on any kind of naturalism--or any physicality.

48
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:15,884
For instance look at the Byzantine influenced hands of Mary

49
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:17,355
--look how long those fingers are.

50
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:19,405
It's almost as if the artist has gotten lost

51
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,961
in the length of those fingers

52
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:22,859
as they wrap around christ waist.

53
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:24,724
Dr. Harris: They are very beautiful--those hands.

54
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,736
I'm thinking also about the amount of gold here.

55
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:31,450
We see the disappearance of all of that gold

56
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,965
through the 1300s and to the 1400s.

57
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:37,133
Here the painting's value is largely

58
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:40,614
in that ultramarine paint that was expensive

59
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:42,150
and in the use of gold.

60
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,883
And what happens during the Renaissance

61
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:48,503
is that the artist, himself, is valued

62
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:50,956
--the artist's skill becomes more valued.

63
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:53,823
Not that Duccio's skill wasn't valued,

64
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:58,050
but the value was also heavily in the materials that were used

65
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,145
that were often dictated by the patron.

66
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:03,666
Dr. Zucker: Now the ultramarine blue that you are referencing

67
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,541
was actually made of the semi-precision stone--lapis lazuli.

68
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,476
And during the Renaissance,

69
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:11,140
the only mines that were available for lapis were in Afghanistan

70
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,493
--still a remote place for us in the 21st century.

71
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:17,679
One can only image how exotic and rare and difficult

72
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:21,142
importing from Afghanistan would have been in the 1200s.

73
00:03:21,142 --> 00:03:24,701
Dr. Harris: And here we have an enormous quantity of that color being used.

74
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:27,233
Dr. Zucker: So this is--in some ways--ostentatious.

75
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,738
In some ways this is a painting

76
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:32,474
that is broadcasting its value, its wealth, its importance.

77
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:34,992
what's so interesting is this was a commission

78
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:38,924
for the main altar in Santa Maria Novella in Florence

79
00:03:38,924 --> 00:03:40,592
although it's by a Sienese artist

80
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:43,985
and Santa Maria Novella is the main Dominican church

81
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,906
that is one of the mendicant orders

82
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:47,878
--this order of begging monks

83
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:49,787
that had renounced worldly pocessions

84
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,176
so there's this interesting tension

85
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:53,907
--we had mentioned that this is called the Rucellai Madonna

86
00:03:53,907 --> 00:03:55,961
and that's a later title

87
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,540
this painting was later moved away from the main altar

88
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,510
in Santa Maria Novella and into the Rucellai Chapel

89
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,055
--that is the private chapel that was controlled

90
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:06,524
by the Florentine family--the Rucellai

91
00:04:06,524 --> 00:04:20,170
(music)
