1
00:00:00,739 --> 00:00:07,950
We are asked to plot (8,10). So the first number in this ordered pair, this is our x coordinate.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,819
This tells us how far we move into the x direction.

3
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:14,660
It's a positive 8, so we move 8 in the x direction.

4
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:20,791
And then the second point or the second number in our ordered pair is 10.

5
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:24,382
That is our y coordinate; that tells us how far we move in the y direction.

6
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:30,188
Since it's positive we move up 10. So we move up 10 all the way over here.

7
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:32,493
And you could have thought about it either way. You could have said:

8
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:39,821
'Hey, look, this is our y coordinate, this is 10, so I could move up 10 and then my x coordinate is positive 8,

9
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:44,656
so I'll move 8 along the positive x axis or I'll move 8 to the right.

10
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:51,077
You see right over here, I have moved 8 to the right, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

11
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:57,719
and I have moved 10 up: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

12
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,251
You might be tempted to move 8 up and then 10 to the right which would put you there,

13
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:05,520
but then you would've had the 2 numbers mixed up.

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,251
You would've had the x and y coordinates mixed up.

15
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:16,154
The 8 tells you how far to move in the horizontal direction, the 10 tells you how far to move in the vertical direction.

16
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:19,652
Let's do a couple more of these.

17
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:27,252
Plot (6,10). Well, once again, the first number in the ordered pair is the x coordinate,

18
00:01:27,252 --> 00:01:30,785
how far we move in the x direction, so we move 6 to the right

19
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:35,583
and then the second number, the 10 tells us our vertical coordinate, our y coordinate.

20
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:40,851
So it's positive 10, so we move 10 up.

21
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,857
Let's do one more.

22
00:01:42,857 --> 00:01:45,053
(5, 7)

23
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:49,317
So, my horizontal coordinate is 5, so I move 5 to the right

24
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:58,487
and then my vertical one is 7, or my y coordinate is 7. So I move 7 up: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

25
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:01,491
And as long as you remember which one is horizontal and which one is vertical,

26
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:04,924
or which one is the x coordinate and which one is the y, you should be fine!

27
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,195
You could say: 'Look, this is my y coordinate, 7.

28
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:12,448
So I'm going to move 7 up, and my x coordinate is 5, so I'm going to move 5 to the right

29
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:14,299
and we'll get you to that exact same point.

30
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:18,346
This specifies exactly one point in the coordinate plane.
