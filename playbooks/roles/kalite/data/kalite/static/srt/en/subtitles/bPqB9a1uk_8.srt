1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,060
So far we've learned what a complex number is; we've even

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,050
learned how to graph it.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,160
And we learned how to add, subtract, and multiply it.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,630
Where I left off in the last video was, how do we divide

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,180
two complex numbers.

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,100
So I said, let's say I have one complex numbers, zone.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,540
And that equals a plus b i.

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,960
i.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,130
And I want to divide that by ztwo.

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,970
Which is, c plus d i.

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,510
So let me ask you a question.

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,380
And I touched on this in the last video.

13
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,030
And let me do it in a different color over here.

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:40,790
We know that a plus b times a minus b is equal to a

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,080
squared minus b squared.

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,390
And you can multiply it out, in case you're not sure.

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,740
Remember, it's just a times a plus b times a minus

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:57,530
a times b, plus a times a, and you'll get this.

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,890
But you know how to do this, anyway.

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,000
There's a review of it, if you need to do it.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,670
So, given that, what is c plus d?

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,140
What happens if we do something very similar

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,660
with a complex number?

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:20,450
If we say c plus d i times c minus d i.

25
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,730
Well, in this case a is c.

26
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,200
And b is d i, right?

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,550
So this is just going to be equal to c squared

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,290
minus d i squared.

29
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,960
d i squared.

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,190
And that equals c squared minus d squared i squared.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,270
And that equals c squared minus d squared.

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,060
And i squared is negative one, right?

33
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,860
So this is going to be multiplied by negative one, so

34
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,150
it cancels out this negative.

35
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,140
So you get c squared plus d squared.

36
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,500
That's interesting.

37
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,340
When I multiply a complex number times this other number,

38
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,260
which is very similar to it, but it's kind of the imaginary

39
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,370
part, goes in the other direction.

40
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,510
When I multiply the two, I get a completely real number.

41
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,590
All of the i's disappear.

42
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,510
And, in general, this number -- if we call this -- well, in our

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:28,340
example this was ztwo, so if we say that ztwo equals c plus d i,

44
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,650
the quantity c minus d i is called its conjugate.

45
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,320
And that's just good terminology to know.

46
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,550
And the sign for conjugate is that line over the top.

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,840
So the conjugate of ztwo is c minus d i.

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,830
Or you could say, the conjugate of c minus d i

49
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,610
is equal to c plus d i.

50
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,820
Or you could say it the other way around.

51
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:58,020
The conjugate of c plus d i is equal to c minus d i.

52
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,250
And notice, we're just switching the direction in

53
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,120
the imaginary -- along the imaginary axis, when we take

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,510
the conjugate of something.

55
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,700
With that said, let me erase that and go back

56
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,690
to our original problem.

57
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,000
Because the conjugate is the tool we're going

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,040
to use to divide this.

59
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,810
So we know when we multiply an imaginary number times its

60
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,990
conjugate, we get a real number.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,200
And we know, also, if we multiply -- we can multiply

62
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,800
anything by one, and we get the same number.

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,370
So let's multiply the numerator and denominator of this

64
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,620
expression by the conjugate of the denominator.

65
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,620
So let me do that.

66
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,690
So the conjugate of the denominator is going

67
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,550
to be c minus d i.

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,250
So c minus d i over c minus d i.

69
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,790
So this was c plud d i, so this is its conjugate.

70
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,010
And so what do we get?

71
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,720
So in the numerator, we get a c -- I don't want to run out of

72
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:09,870
space, I always do -- a c, so a times c, minus a d i, minus a d

73
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,940
i -- these i's are looking funny -- this is an i.

74
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:23,060
Plus b c i; plus b c i.

75
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,810
And then the last term, we have a plus b minus b.

76
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,430
So it's minus b d i squared.

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,560
Minus b d i squared.

78
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,130
All of that.

79
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,880
And this is a plus b times a minus b.

80
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,240
So it's equal to a squared minus b squared.

81
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,680
So this is going to be equal to -- and it this will become

82
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,410
second nature to you after a while, but you might want

83
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,100
to just multiply it out.

84
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,470
This equals c squared plus d squared.

85
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,470
And don't take my word for it.

86
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,290
Actually, algebraically, multiply this out and just

87
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,320
realize you can only add real parts to real parts and

88
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,810
imaginary parts to imaginary parts.

89
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,490
So let me simplify that.

90
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,390
That equals -- let's see, the real parts.

91
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,380
This is real, a c.

92
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,530
And this is minus b d i squared.

93
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,860
So the i squared is minus one.

94
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,480
So it switches the sign here, so it becomes plus b d.

95
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,040
And we can get rid of d i.

96
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,050
So the real parts are, a c plus b d.

97
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,610
That's that, and that.

98
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,920
And then the imaginary parts are plus -- this one's

99
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:39,410
positive, so I'll put one first -- b c minus a d i, all of that

100
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,670
over c squared plus d squared.

101
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,760
And that still might not look like a complex number to you.

102
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,180
But then we can separate them out and we could say well,

103
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:56,510
that equals a c plus b d over c squared plus d squared.

104
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,620
And that's the real part.

105
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:07,710
Plus b c minus a d over c squared plus d squared.

106
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,350
And that times i, and that's the imaginary part.

107
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,420
So you can't merge, when you're adding and subtracting, the

108
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,920
real part to the imaginary part.

109
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,290
But you can most definitely scale an imaginary

110
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,410
number by a real number.

111
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,370
And that's essentially what we're doing.

112
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,230
We're multiplying one over c squared plus d

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,890
squared times this.

114
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,810
So, division might seem a little complicated when I

115
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,600
write it all in variables.

116
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,070
But let me give you an example and you will hopefully see that

117
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,560
it -- with real numbers, and -- not real numbers, with

118
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,920
actual numbers, I should be careful with what I say.

119
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,680
Let's say I have one plus two i.

120
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,430
And I want to divide that by, I don't know, let's divide it by,

121
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,190
I'm going to pick a random number.

122
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,510
two plus threei.

123
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,430
And so what do we do?

124
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,340
We multiply it times the conjugate of the denominator.

125
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,720
two minus threei over -- over itself, right?

126
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,050
Because then we're not changing the number.

127
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,300
This is just one, this simplifies to one.

128
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,540
It equals -- the bottom, we can multiply it out.

129
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,070
But hopefully it's second nature to you.

130
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:18,070
It equals four plus nine, right?

131
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,820
Because that's just a squared plus b squared.

132
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,480
Right?

133
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,730
Well, I mean, it's a squared minus b squared, but then the

134
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,100
i's, when you multiply, and it becomes a negative number.

135
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,000
Try it out if you don't believe me.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,120
And then the top, we get one times two is two.

137
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,490
one times minus threei is minus threei.

138
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,100
And you have twoi times two, which is plus fouri.

139
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,160
And then you have twoi times minus threei.

140
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,060
So that's minus six.

141
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,680
Minus sixi squared.

142
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,940
Well, what does i squared equal?

143
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,590
That equals negative one.

144
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,890
So negative one times negative six.

145
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,600
Get rid of the i squared and this becomes a positive.

146
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,890
So then, what are our real parts?

147
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,980
Our real parts are two and six.

148
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,240
so two plus six is eight.

149
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,500
And what are our imaginary parts?

150
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,290
Minus threei plus fouri.

151
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,170
So that's just plus onei, right?

152
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,430
Minus three plus four is positive one.

153
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,700
So it's just plus onei.

154
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,790
Over thirteen.

155
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,170
Or we could write that as -- if we wanted to write that in the

156
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:30,420
traditional complex form -- is eight / thirteen plus one over thirteeni.

157
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,730
So when I divided one complex number by another, I got

158
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,080
another complex number.

159
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,270
And an interesting exercise for you to do is, pick some

160
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,830
random complex numbers.

161
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,480
Plot them out on complex plane, and see what happens when you

162
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,570
multiply them, when you divide them, when you add them,

163
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,670
when you subtract them.

164
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,480
And when you scale them.

165
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,900
Or when you take the conjugate.

166
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,980
And that'll give you a better intuition of what's going

167
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,300
on with these numbers.

168
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,400
Anyway, I will see you in the next video.
