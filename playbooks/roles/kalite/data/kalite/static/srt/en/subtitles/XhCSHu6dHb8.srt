1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,980
Let's say I have a subspace v
that is equal to all of the

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:15,325
vectors-- let me write it this
way-- all of the x1, x2, x3's,

4
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:24,980
so all the vectors like this
that satisfy x1 plus x2 plus

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,050
x3 is equal to 0.

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,030
So if you think about it, this
is just a plane in R3, so this

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,180
subspace is a plane in R3.

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,810
And I'm interested in finding
the transformation matrix for

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:44,350
the projection of any vector
x in R3 onto v.

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,840
So how could we do that?

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,780
So we could do it like we
did in the last video.

12
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,280
We could find the basis for
this subspace right there.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,580
And that's not too hard to do.

14
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,290
We could say x1, if we assume
that, let's say, that x2 and

15
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,080
x3 are kind of free variables,
then we could say that x1 is

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,550
equal to minus x2, minus x3.

17
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,940
And then let's just, just so we
can write it in, kind of,

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,130
our parametric form, or if we
can write our solution set as

19
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,650
the combination of basis
vectors, we can say x2 is

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,520
equal to, let's say
it's equal to some

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,930
arbitrary constant, C2.

22
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,360
And let's say that x3
is equal to some

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,900
arbitrary constant, C3.

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:35,860
Then we can say that v, we can
rewrite v, we could say that v

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,220
is-- I'll do it here-- v is
equal to the set of all x1's,

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:51,590
x2's, and x3's that are equal
to C2 times-- so x1 is equal

27
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,320
to minus-- let me rewrite
this with a C2--

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,230
this is equal to C2.

29
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,190
This is equal to C3.

30
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:05,050
So x1 is equal to minus
C2, minus C3.

31
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:12,470
So x1 is equal to minus 1 times
C2, plus C3 times what?

32
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,560
Plus C3 times minus 1.

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,550
And then what is x2 equal to?

34
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,470
x2 is just equal to C2.

35
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,420
So it's 1 times C2,
plus 0, times C3.

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,450
x3 is just equal to C3,
so it's 0 times C2,

37
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,700
plus 1, times C3.

38
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,410
And so this is another way
of defining our subspace.

39
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,810
All of the vectors that satisfy
this is equal to this

40
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,590
definition here.

41
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,660
It's all the vectors whose
components satisfy, or that

42
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,450
lie in this plane, whose entries
lie in that plane.

43
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,420
And that's for any real
numbers right there.

44
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,590
Or another way of writing this,
is v is equal to the

45
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:05,230
span of the vectors minus 1, 1,
and 0, and the vector minus

46
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,430
1, 0, and 1.

47
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,100
Just like that.

48
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,000
And we know that these are
actually a basis for v because

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,480
they're linearly independent.

50
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,640
There's no way I can take linear
combinations of this

51
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,390
guy and make the second
entry equal a 1 here.

52
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,670
And likewise there's no way I
can take linear combinations

53
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,480
of this guy and make this third
entry equal a 1 here.

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,390
So these are also
a basis for v.

55
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,560
So given, that just using the
technique we did before, we

56
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,120
could set some vector, we could
set some matrix A equal

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:45,930
to minus 1, 1, 0, and then
minus 1, 0, and 1.

58
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,280
And then we can figure out that
the projection of any

59
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:59,440
vector x in our 3 onto v is
going to be equal to, and we

60
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,640
saw this, it's going to be equal
to A times the inverse

61
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,210
of A transpose A.

62
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:12,190
All of that times A transpose
and all of that times x.

63
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,750
And you can do it.

64
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,500
You have A here.

65
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,860
You can figure out what the
transpose of A is very easy.

66
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,615
You can take A transpose A,
then you can invert it.

67
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:22,500
And it'll be very similar to
what we did in the last video.

68
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,530
It'll be a little less work,
because this is a 3 by 2

69
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,720
matrix, instead of
a 4 by 2 matrix.

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,260
But you saw it is actually
a lot of work.

71
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,800
It's very hairy and you might
make some careless mistakes.

72
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,620
So let's figure out if there's
another way that we can come

73
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,060
up with this matrix
right here.

74
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:50,280
Now we know that if x is a
member of R3, that x can be

75
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:58,550
represented as a combination of
some vector v, that is in

76
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:05,720
our subspace, plus some vector
w, that is in the orthogonal

77
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,820
complement of the subspace,
where v is a member of our

78
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:19,760
subspace, and w is a member of
the orthogonal complement of

79
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,950
our subspace.

80
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,290
Now by definition, that right
there is the projection of x

81
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,030
onto v, and this is the
projection of x onto the

82
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,510
orthogonal complement of v.

83
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:42,070
So we can write that x is equal
to the projection onto v

84
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:49,650
of x, plus the projection onto
v's orthogonal complement, or

85
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,190
the orthogonal complement
of v of x.

86
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,190
So this is by definition, that
any member of R3 can be

87
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,000
represented this way.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,220
Now if we want to write this as
matrix vector products, and

89
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,620
two videos ago I showed you
that these are linear

90
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,346
transformations.

91
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:06,940
So let me write that here.

92
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,230
So they're linear
transformations.

93
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,780
So they can be written as
matrix vector products.

94
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,190
You see that right there.

95
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:19,130
Let me define this matrix, I
don't know, let me call this

96
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:25,060
matrix T, let me
just call it T.

97
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,250
And let me do another.

98
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,180
Let me do a letter,
let me do B.

99
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:40,200
And let's say that the
projection onto the orthogonal

100
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,270
complement of v of x, let's say
that that's equal to some

101
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:50,125
other matrix C, times x.

102
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,650
And we know this is a linear
transformation, so it can be

103
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,720
represented as some
matrix C times x.

104
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,060
So what are these going
to be equal to?

105
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,610
Well x, if I want to write it as
a linear transformation of

106
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,730
x, I could just write it as the
3 by 3 identity matrix,

107
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,370
times x, right?

108
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,880
That's the same thing as x.

109
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,710
That's going to be equal to the
projection of x onto v,

110
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,800
well that's just the same
thing as B times x.

111
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,010
   

112
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,870
And then plus the projection
of x onto v's orthogonal

113
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,640
complement, well that's
just C times x.

114
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,050
Plus C times x.

115
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,390
And if you want to factor out
the x on this side, we know

116
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,830
that the matrix vector
products exhibit the

117
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,260
distributive property, so we
could write that the identity

118
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:47,180
matrix times x is equal
to B plus C, times x.

119
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,000
Or another way to view this
equation is that this matrix

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,740
must be equal to these
two matrices.

121
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:02,530
So we get that the identity
matrix in R3 is equal to the

122
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:09,100
projection matrix onto v, plus
the projection matrix onto v's

123
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,580
orthogonal complement.

124
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,740
Remember, the whole point of
this problem is to figure out

125
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,800
this thing right here,
is to solve or B.

126
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,520
And we know a technique
for doing it.

127
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,520
You take A transpose, you can do
this whole thing, but that

128
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,760
might be pretty hairy.

129
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,520
But maybe it's easy
to find this guy.

130
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,400
Maybe, I don't know.

131
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,780
It actually turns out in the
video, this one will be easy.

132
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,050
So if it's easy to find this
guy, we can just solve for B.

133
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,200
If we subtract C from both
sides, we get that B is equal

134
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,760
to I, is equal to the identity
matrix, minus the

135
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,960
transformation matrix for the
transformation onto v's

136
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,300
orthogonal complement.

137
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,730
So let's see what this is.

138
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,460
Let's see if we can figure out
what C is right there.

139
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,860
So let's go back to
our original.

140
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,200
So remember-- let me rewrite
the problem actually--

141
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:09,940
remember that v was equal to,
essentially it's equal to all

142
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:24,140
of the x1's, x2's, x3's that
satisfy x1 plus x2, plus x3 is

143
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,960
equal to 0.

144
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,500
Or another way to say it is that
all the x1's, x2's, and

145
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:39,800
x3's that satisfy the equation
1, 1, 1, times x1, x2, x3 is

146
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,900
equal to the 0 vector.

147
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,610
Or this case it'll just be 0.

148
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,440
We could write the 0 vector
just like that.

149
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,180
So 1 times x1, plus 1 times x2,
plus 1 times x3 is going

150
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,350
to equal the 0 vector.

151
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,350
This is another way
to write v.

152
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,670
Now all of the x's that
satisfied this right here,

153
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,110
what is that?

154
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,170
This is saying that v is equal
to the null space of this

155
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,920
matrix right there.

156
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,550
The null space of this matrix
is all of the vectors that

157
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,330
satisfy this equation.

158
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:14,370
So v is equal to the null
space-- let me write it this

159
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,440
way-- the null space of 1,
1, 1, just like that.

160
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,050
Up here we, kind of, figured
out v in kind of the

161
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,710
traditional way.

162
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,730
We figured out that v is the
span of these things, but now

163
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,600
we know that's the same thing is
the null space of 1, 1, 1.

164
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,890
These two statements
are equivalent.

165
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,080
Now we at least had a hunch that
maybe, you know, we could

166
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,070
figure out, straight up, this B
here by doing all of this A

167
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,120
transpose and, you know,
by doing all of

168
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,970
this silliness here.

169
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,040
But our hunch is maybe if
we could figure out the

170
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,650
transformation matrix for the
orthogonal complement of v

171
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,560
right there, that then we could
just apply this, kind

172
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,600
of, that we can just solve for
B given that the identity

173
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,840
matrix minus this guy is
going to be equal to B.

174
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,590
So let's see if we can figure
out the projection matrix, if

175
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,420
we can figure out the
transformation matrix for the

176
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,260
orthogonal projection, for
x onto the orthogonal

177
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,820
projection of v.

178
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,380
So this is v.

179
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,550
What is v compliment?

180
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,650
v compliment is going to be
equal to the orthogonal

181
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,680
complement, or v perp is going
to be equal to the orthogonal

182
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,340
complement of the null space
of this matrix right here.

183
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,210
Which is equal to what?

184
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:41,180
Remember, the null space, its
orthogonal complement-- a null

185
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:49,220
space's orthogonal complement is
equivalent to the row space

186
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,620
or the column space
of A transpose.

187
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,650
We saw that multiple times.

188
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,690
Or you could say the orthogonal
complement of the

189
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,990
row space is the null space.

190
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,120
We've seen this many,
many times before.

191
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,790
So the orthogonal complement of
this guy is going to be the

192
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,880
column space of his transpose.

193
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,305
So the column space of the
transpose of this guy.

194
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:21,560
So it's 1, 1, 1,
just like that.

195
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,570
Or we can write that v's
orthogonal complement is equal

196
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,490
to the span of 1, 1, 1.

197
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,320
The column space of this matrix,
we only have one

198
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,540
column in it, so its column
space is going to be the span

199
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,860
of that one column.

200
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,340
So just to visualize what
we're doing here, that

201
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,780
original equation for v, that
satisfies that, that's just

202
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,030
going to be some plane in R3.

203
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,660
   

204
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,570
That is v right there.

205
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,100
And now we just figured
out what v's

206
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,610
orthogonal complement is.

207
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,050
It's going to be a line in R3.

208
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,270
It's going to be all
of the linear

209
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,880
combinations of this guy.

210
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,640
So it's going to be
some line in R3.

211
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,900
I haven't drawn it.

212
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,960
You know this is going to be
tilted more, and so is this,

213
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,000
but it's going to
be some line.

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,840
So this is the orthogonal
complement of v.

215
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
So let's see if we
can figure out.

216
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,820
So remember, the projection--
let me do it this way.

217
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,920
So this is the basis for v's
orthogonal complement.

218
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,200
So let's construct
some matrix.

219
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,760
I don't know, let me
use a letter that I

220
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,020
haven't used before.

221
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:34,250
Let me construct some matrix D,
whose columns are the basis

222
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,710
vectors for the orthogonal
complement of v.

223
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,580
Well, there's only one
basis factor, so

224
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,730
it's going to be that.

225
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,930
And we learned, in the last
video and the video before

226
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:53,550
that, that the projection of
any vector in R3 onto v's

227
00:13:53,550 --> 00:14:00,580
orthogonal complement is going
to be equal to D times D

228
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:09,520
transpose D inverse, times
D transpose, times x.

229
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,230
Or another way to view it is
that this thing right here,

230
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,590
that thing right there is the
transformation matrix for this

231
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,470
projection.

232
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,455
That is the transformation
matrix.

233
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:23,940
   

234
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,020
matrix

235
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,620
So let's see if this is easier
to solve this thing than this

236
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,190
business up here, where we
had a 3 by 2 matrix.

237
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,490
That was the whole motivation
for doing this problem.

238
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,180
To figure out the projection
matrix for v's subspace, we'd

239
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,150
have to do this with
the 3 by 2 matrix.

240
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,100
It seems pretty difficult.

241
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,720
Instead, let's find the
projection matrix to get to

242
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,780
the production onto
v's orthogonal

243
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,770
complement, which is this.

244
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,050
So what is D transpose?

245
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,910
So D transpose is just going
to be equal to 1, 1, 1.

246
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,230
What is D transpose times D?

247
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,770
Well, that's D transpose.

248
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,220
This is D, just like that.

249
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,540
So what is this going
to be equal to?

250
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,460
This is just the dot product
of that and that.

251
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:13,210
1 times 1, plus 1 times 1, plus
1 times 1, it equals 3.

252
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,690
So this thing right here is
equal to a 1 by 1 matrix 3.

253
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,540
So let's write it down.

254
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:26,700
So this is equal to D-- which
is this matrix, 1, 1, 1--

255
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,770
times D transpose D inverse.

256
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,670
So D transpose D is just
a 1 by 1 matrix.

257
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,010
And we're going to have
to invert it.

258
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,750
Actually, I've never defined the
inverse of a 1 by 1 matrix

259
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,510
for you just now, so it's
just mildly exciting.

260
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,420
Times D transpose.

261
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,280
So D transpose looks
like this, 1, 1, 1.

262
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,940
And then all of that's
times x.

263
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,920
But this is the transformation
matrix right there.

264
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,490
Now what is the inverse
of a 1 by 1 matrix?

265
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,930
Now you just have to remember
that A inverse times A is

266
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,730
equal to the identity matrix.

267
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,850
If we're dealing with a 1 by 1
matrix, then I'm just trying

268
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:11,030
to figure out what, let's say,
what matrix times 3 is going

269
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,880
to be equal to the 1 by
1 identity matrix.

270
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:26,500
So let's say that 3 inverse
times 3 has to be equal to the

271
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,600
identity matrix.

272
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,710
1 by 1 identity matrix.

273
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,600
Well, the only matrix that's
going to make this work out,

274
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,040
to get this entry I'll just take
this guy's entry times

275
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,880
that guy's entry, is going to
be this guy right here.

276
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,500
The inverse of this 1
by 1 matrix has to

277
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,920
be the matrix 1/3.

278
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,200
1/3 times 3 is equal to 1.

279
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,700
This is almost trivially
simple, but this is the

280
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,270
inverse, that right there is the
inverse matrix, for the 1

281
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,020
by 1 matrix 3.

282
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,790
So this right here
is just 1/3.

283
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,360
And we could actually
just take that out.

284
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,660
It's a 1 by 1 matrix,
which is essentially

285
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,430
equivalent to a scalar.

286
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:08,599
So this is going to be equal--
let me just draw a line here--

287
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:13,547
this thing is equal to 1/3--
actually, I don't want to

288
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:13,930
confuse you.

289
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,050
Let me rewrite it.

290
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:21,410
So we get the projection of
any vector in R3 onto the

291
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:28,510
orthogonal complement of v, is
equal to 1/3, that's 1/3,

292
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,330
times the vector 1, 1, 1,
times-- sorry, or wait, that

293
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,120
is a vector or the matrix 1
on 1-- times that matrix

294
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,880
transposed, 1, 1, 1.

295
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,860
And then all of that times x.

296
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,580
And you can see, this is a lot
simpler than if we have to do

297
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,040
all of this business
with this matrix.

298
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,160
That's a harder matrix
to deal with.

299
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,910
This 1, 1, 1 matrix
is very easy.

300
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,840
Now what is this going
to be equal to?

301
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,930
This is going to be equal to
1/3 times, we have a 3 by 1

302
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,510
times a 1 by 3 matrix,
so it's going to

303
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,195
result in a 3 by 3 matrix.

304
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:07,880
   

305
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,560
And what do we get?

306
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,980
So this first entry is going to
be 1 times 1, which is 1.

307
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,970
The second entry is going to
be 1 times 1, which is 1.

308
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,840
The third entry is going to
be 1 times 1, which is 1.

309
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,450
I think you see the pattern.

310
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,430
The second grow, first column,
1 times 1, which is 1.

311
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:26,480
So this is going to be a
3 by 3 matrix of 1's.

312
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,060
So just like that we were able
to get-- that was a pretty

313
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,780
straightforward situation--
we were able to get the

314
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,170
projection matrix for any
vector in R3 onto v's

315
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,820
orthogonal complement.

316
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:49,270
Now, we know that this thing
right here is our original C

317
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,510
that we said.

318
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,760
And we said that the identity
matrix-- we wrote it up here.

319
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,760
Let me refer back to what
I wrote way up here.

320
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,410
We said, look, the identity
matrix is equal to the

321
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,590
transformation matrix for the
projection onto v, plus the

322
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,790
transformation matrix for the
projection onto v's orthogonal

323
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,780
complement.

324
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,490
Or we can write that the
transformation matrix for the

325
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,540
projection onto v is equal to
the identity matrix minus the

326
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,990
transformation matrix for the
projection onto v's orthogonal

327
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,240
complement.

328
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,050
   

329
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:35,430
So if we say that the projection
onto v of x is

330
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:40,780
equal to B times x, we know that
B is equal to the 3 by 3

331
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,980
identity matrix, minus C, and
this is C right there.

332
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:52,560
So B is equal to the identity
matrix-- so that's just 1, 0,

333
00:19:52,560 --> 00:20:04,160
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1-- minus C,
minus 1/3, times 1, 1, 1, 1,

334
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,850
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, just like that.

335
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,405
And what is this going
to be equal to?

336
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:11,650
   

337
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,720
Let's see, let's, in our heads,
multiply this out.

338
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,040
All of these entries are going
to be 1/3 essentially, if we

339
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,240
multiply this out like that.

340
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,200
So if we have 1 minus 1/3.

341
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,155
I could write it
out like that.

342
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:28,440
It's 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.

343
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,530
Everything is 1/3.

344
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:36,740
1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3,
and this just becomes a 1.

345
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,810
So 1 minus 1/3 is 2/3.

346
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,290
And all of the 1's minus 1/3
are going to be 2/3, so we

347
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,910
could just go down
the diagonal.

348
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,880
And then the 0's minus 1/3 are
going to be minus 1/3.

349
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,750
Minus 1/3, minus
1/3, minus 1/3.

350
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,090
You have minus 1/3, minus
1/3, and minus 1/3.

351
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,740
And just like that, we've been
able to figure out our

352
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,450
projection, our transformation
matrix, for the projection of

353
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,390
any vector x onto v, by
essentially finding this guy

354
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,010
first, for finding the
transformation matrix for the

355
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,760
projection of any x onto v's
orthogonal complement.

356
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,870
Anyway, I thought that
was pretty neat.

357
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:25,850
And you could rewrite this as v
equal to 1/3 times 2, 2, 2,

358
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,470
2's along back the diagonals
and then you have minus 1's

359
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,720
everywhere else.

360
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,040
   

361
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,600
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
