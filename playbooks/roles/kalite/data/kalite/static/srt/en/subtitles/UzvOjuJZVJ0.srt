1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,210
We're on problem number six and
I actually figured out how

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,780
to cut and paste from the PDF
file to my little writing

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,020
board, so we actually have
access to the problem.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,460
So it says: What system of
inequalities best represents

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,270
the graph shown below?

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,130
So we want to figure out what
inequalities represents this

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,670
shaded area.

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,580
So a good place to start is just
to figure out what these

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,320
dotted line graphs, what the
equations of them look like.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,790
So this one, let's do the
hard one first, right?

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,810
This is at an angle.

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,960
So whenever I look at a line,
I like to think what's it's

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,180
slope and what it's y-intercept,
right?

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,860
And then you could just write
it in the form y is equal to

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,790
mx plus b, where b is
the y-intercept

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,170
and m is the slope.

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,680
So let's try to figure out the
equation of this line up here,

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,510
this dotted line.

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,670
So what's its slope?

21
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,730
So when I move over 1 and x,
when I move over to the right,

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,970
when x increases by 1, or let's
say when x increases by

23
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,920
2, how much does y increase?

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,070
Well, y increases
by 2 as well.

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,950
Or whatever we increase x by.

26
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,230
If x increases by 1, then
y increases by 1.

27
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,580
So the slope is 1, right?

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,520
Slope is just change in
y over change in x.

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,350
So the slope of this
first line is 1.

30
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,950
So m is equal to 1, for at least
this first line up here.

31
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,170
And what's it's y-intercept?

32
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,055
The y-intercept is just what
does the graph equal when x is

33
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,110
equal to 0 or where does it
intersect the y-axis?

34
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,810
Well, it intersects the y-axis
right here at y is equal to 1,

35
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,140
so b is equal to 1.

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,720
So the equation of this dotted
line up here is y is equal to

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,100
mx, the slope times x, we
figured out the slope was 1,

38
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,450
so that's x plus the
y-intercept, which we also

39
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,430
figured out was 1.

40
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,770
So that's the graph of
that line, right?

41
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,750
But notice, the shaded region
is below that line.

42
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,760
And it also does not include
the line, right?

43
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,960
That's why they drew
a dotted line.

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,200
If it was a solid line, that
means that we're including the

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,290
line itself.

46
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,720
But the shaded region does
not include the line.

47
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,680
But it's below it.

48
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,260
Think of it this way: For any
given x-- let's pick this x.

49
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,450
Let me do it in a
different color.

50
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,940
Let me do it in blue.

51
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,680
If I were to pick x is equal to
1, this is the point y is

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,310
equal to x plus 1.

53
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,470
That's the equation.

54
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,420
Now, my question to you is y
above y is equal to x plus 1?

55
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,900
Is the shaded region y is
greater than x plus 1, which

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,270
would be that region?

57
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,990
Or would it be y is less
than x plus 1,

58
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,370
which is this region?

59
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,350
Well, clearly, it is y is
less than x plus 1.

60
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,450
You pick any x, x
is equal to 3.

61
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,795
This is what y would be equal
to. y would be equal to 3 plus

62
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:50,330
1 if you picked this choice.

63
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,620
But the y's that satisfy the
grey area are always less than

64
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,730
this point.

65
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,940
So at least the grey area
relative to this equation, we

66
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:05,030
can write the inequality y
is less than x plus 1.

67
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,630
And we know it's not less
than or equal to.

68
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,730
It would be less than or equal
to if they had filled in this

69
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,660
line, if this was part of
the area, but it's not.

70
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,610
They drew a dotted line.

71
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,750
So that's why we know it's
less than, right?

72
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,820
If the grey area was up here
it would be greater than.

73
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,430
You just pick an x, you say,
oh, the y's less than the

74
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,980
line, not the y is greater.

75
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,450
But we're not done, right?

76
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,780
Because this would be the
solution set if all of this

77
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,520
area was grey.

78
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,500
But it's only grey up
to a certain point.

79
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,070
It's only grey up to this
line down here.

80
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,930
This line is easier.

81
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,000
This line has no slope, right?

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,996
No matter what my change in
x, my change in y is 0.

83
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:41,530
So what's the equation
of this?

84
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,100
The equation of this line
is just slope is 0.

85
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,770
So y is equal to 0x plus
the y-intercept.

86
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,060
Well, the y-intercept
is minus 2.

87
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,250
So the equation of this line
is y is equal to minus 2.

88
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,940
Let me do it in the purple.

89
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,540
I'll just write it here.

90
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,740
That equation is y is equal to
minus 2, Which makes sense.

91
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,690
For all x, y is equal
to minus to 2.

92
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,810
Now, my question to you
is this grey area.

93
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:13,130
For any given x, the y is
greater than the line or the y

94
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,020
is less than the line?

95
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,450
Well, let's pick this x.

96
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,680
When x is equal to 3, y is
equal to negative 2.

97
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,980
That's this line.

98
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,670
Now, is the grey area-- the
y's for that x-- above the

99
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,220
line or below it?

100
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,790
Well, it's above the
line, right?

101
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,640
So if we look at it from the
point of view of this

102
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,430
boundary, we say that y has to
be greater than minus 2.

103
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,330
That's the shaded area.

104
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,110
y is equal to negative 2 is this
dotted line's equation.

105
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,230
The shaded area, at least
relative to this line, is y is

106
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,480
greater than negative 2.

107
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,030
   

108
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,790
If I just had this by itself,
I would shade up everything

109
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,980
above y is equal to
negative 2, right?

110
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,070
But I want just the combination
of both of these.

111
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,460
So essentially, we have to say
that y-- let me do it in a

112
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,650
nice, vibrant color.

113
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,400
Since the shaded area is below
this line, we know that y is

114
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,740
less than x plus 1.

115
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,850
And since the shaded area is
above this line, we know that

116
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,060
y is greater than negative 2.

117
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,990
Where could I write that?

118
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,240
I'll write it right here.

119
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,010
   

120
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,700
So which of the choices
satisfy that?

121
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,050
Let's see.

122
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,290
Whoops, I went to the
next problem.

123
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,530
So we know that y is greater
than negative 2.

124
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,030
So these can't-- let me
just cross those out.

125
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,270
That and that can't
be the answer.

126
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,520
And then we also know that
y is less than x plus 1.

127
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,090
So we know that this
is the answer.

128
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,520
And frankly, if you just looked
at the choices, you

129
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,450
really didn't have to figure out
the slope and y-intercept.

130
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,480
They're essentially giving you
the equations of the two

131
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,080
lines, right?

132
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,950
You say, like, oh, one is x plus
1 and one is negative 2,

133
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,230
and I just have to figure out
whether y is greater than or

134
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,730
less than each of those lines.

135
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,170
And you can say, OK, relative
to the y equals negative 2,

136
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,600
we're definitely greater than
negative 2, so I'm one of

137
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,730
these two choices, and relative
to y is equal to x

138
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,630
plus 1, we're definitely less
than that line, so we have to

139
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,200
be choice b.

140
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,360
Next problem.

141
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,460
Which point lies in the solution
set for the system?

142
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,350
So you essentially just have
to say which coordinates

143
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,460
satisfy both of these
equations?

144
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,370
And frankly, you could graph
them and you could draw the

145
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,930
area like we did in the last
one, or you could just try out

146
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,870
the numbers, right?

147
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,270
Let's just try the numbers.

148
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,970
That never hurts.

149
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,060
So minus 4, 1.

150
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,190
Let's see if it satisfies it.

151
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,510
So remember, the first
coordinate is x, the

152
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,370
second one is y.

153
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:41,900
So 2y would be 2 times
minus 1 minus x.

154
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,240
So minus minus 4.

155
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,480
Now, is that greater than
or equal to minus 6?

156
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,270
Well, this is minus 2 plus 4.

157
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,590
And this is what?

158
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,120
Minus 2 plus 4 is equal to 2,
which is definitely greater

159
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,980
than or equal to minus 6.

160
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,900
So it satisfies the
first equation.

161
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,480
Let's see if it satisfies
the second equation.

162
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,720
I'll do it in another color and
I'll do it up in the black

163
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,140
area up here.

164
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,620
So 2 times y.

165
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,980
So it's 2 times minus 1--
y is minus 1-- minus

166
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,835
3 times minus 4.

167
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:19,550
   

168
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,780
And they want to know is
that less than minus 6?

169
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,490
So you get minus 2.

170
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:32,070
3 times 4 is 12, so
it's plus 12.

171
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,700
Negative times a negative is a
positive, so that equals plus

172
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,890
10, which is not less
than negative 6.

173
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,590
So the first one
does not work.

174
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,020
That is not the answer.

175
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,400
Let's try the second one.

176
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,030
3 comma 1.

177
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,220
So y is 1.

178
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:50,950
So it becomes 2 times 1, which
is just 2, minus 3.

179
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,430
Is that greater than or
equal to negative 6?

180
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,730
So you get negative 1 is
definitely greater than

181
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,450
negative 6, so this satisfies
the first equation.

182
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,140
Does it satisfy the
second one?

183
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,150
2 times y.

184
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:09,295
2 times 1 is 2, minus
3 times 3.

185
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:12,890
   

186
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,600
Is that less than minus 6?

187
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,520
So you get 2 minus 9.

188
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,780
Is that less than minus 6?

189
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,350
You get minus 7 is less
than minus 6.

190
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,750
So that is true.

191
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,830
So choice b works.

192
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,390
You don't have to
go any further.

193
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,060
That point lies in the solution
set, which just means

194
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,630
it satisfies both of
these inequalites.

195
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,950
Next problem.

196
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,970
Scroll down a little bit.

197
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,570
Which system of linear
equalities is represented by

198
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,179
this graph?

199
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,059
So now we can use some of the
skills we used the last time.

200
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,120
I don't have much space
to draw all of them.

201
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,980
So let's just to figure out
the-- let's see, do they gives

202
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,900
us-- no, they don't even give
us the equations because all

203
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,110
the equations are different, so
we have to figure out the

204
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,740
equations of these two graphs.

205
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,450
So let's do this top
one first. So let's

206
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,460
figure out its slope.

207
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,920
When you increase-- and you
can just eyeball this one.

208
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,350
When you increase x by
3, y increases by the

209
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,250
same amount, right?

210
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,630
So change in y over change
in x would be 3 over 3.

211
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,860
Whatever you change x by, y
increases the same amount.

212
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,890
So the slope of this first one
at least-- let me do it in a

213
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,530
color you can see over black--
the slope is equal to 1.

214
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,870
And what's its y-intercept?

215
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,720
Well, you just look at where did
it intercept the y-axis?

216
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,650
Right there.

217
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,860
So the y-intercept is
equal to minus 2.

218
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,770
So this first equation
right here is y is

219
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,370
equal to x minus 2.

220
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,000
Fair enough.

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
And this grey area, is
it above or below it?

222
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,150
It's below it.

223
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,480
You pick any x.

224
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,940
For any x, this is y is
equal to x minus 2.

225
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,090
The grey area is for all
the y's that are

226
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,060
less than it, right?

227
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,040
And notice, now the
line is shaded in.

228
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,840
So the line is part of
the solution set.

229
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,930
So at least relative to this, we
know that the grey area is

230
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,990
all y's that satisfy y is less
than or equal to x minus 2.

231
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,430
Less than because it's below it,
and it's equal to because

232
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,000
they actually drew
in the line.

233
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,500
But now we have to figure
out the lower bound.

234
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,870
What's the equation
of this line?

235
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,560
So let's think about
it a little bit.

236
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,650
This one's a little
more interesting.

237
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:27,220
If I increase x by 1, so if
I'm going from this point,

238
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,310
what happens to y?

239
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,910
y goes down by 2, right?

240
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,680
1 minus 2.

241
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,500
If I increase x by 2, y
goes down by 4, right?

242
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,740
Minus 4.

243
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,380
So at least in this case, the
slope, change in y, is minus 4

244
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,550
whenever change in
x is positive 2.

245
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,180
Or it could've been change in
y is minus 2 whenever change

246
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,740
in x is plus 1, right?

247
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,590
So it equals minus 2.

248
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,330
And that makes sense.

249
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,710
For every 1 you go over,
the slope goes down 2.

250
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,280
And what's it's y-intercept?

251
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,440
Let's see, y-intercept is just
right there. y is equal to 3.

252
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,960
So b is equal to 3.

253
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:14,720
So this second graph is y is
equal to minus 2x plus 3.

254
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,630
And then, once again, the shaded
area includes this, but

255
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,200
we have to be greater than
or equal to this graph.

256
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,060
We have to be greater than,
because if you pick any x, the

257
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,400
y's that satisfy the shaded area
are equal to the graph or

258
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,350
greater than for any x.

259
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,210
So there we have
our inequality.

260
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,940
So this one, this area, you
could kind of say is y has to

261
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,250
be greater than or equal
to minus 2x plus 3.

262
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,420
That's from this boundary.

263
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,300
And we also know that y
has to be less than or

264
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,840
equal to x minus 2.

265
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,450
Now, hopefully, that's
one of the choices.

266
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,610
If we haven't a made
a careless mistake.

267
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,400
Let me see.

268
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,330
All right.

269
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:02,350
y is greater than or
equal to-- OK, so

270
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,530
this is not the answer.

271
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,670
Neither of these are
the answers.

272
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,890
That's not the answer.

273
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,320
Let me cross that out.

274
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,200
y is greater than or
equal to-- we have

275
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,860
minus 2x plus 3, right?

276
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,740
Let me make sure I
got that right.

277
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,620
Minus 2x plus 3.

278
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,520
Yeah, let me see.

279
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,760
Right, so they're tricky.

280
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,100
So the slope on that second
line was minus 2x plus 3.

281
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,840
They got the second
part right.

282
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,500
Maybe I made a careless mistake,
but I don't think

283
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,660
this is right either.

284
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,770
Let's see if we can rearrange.

285
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,440
So these other two, they put
the x's and the y's on the

286
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,830
same side, so let's do that.

287
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,250
That top equation, we
can rewrite it.

288
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,890
Add 2x to both sides.

289
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,560
You get 2x plus y is greater
than or equal to 3.

290
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,340
And the second equation, if we
were to subtract x from both

291
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:57,860
sides, you get y minus x is less
than or equal to minus 2.

292
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,390
And now this is interesting.

293
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,490
So there's no minus 2 on the
right-hand side here,

294
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,050
but what can we do?

295
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,990
If we multiply both sides
of this equation by

296
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,770
minus 2, what happens?

297
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,040
Sorry, multiply both sides of
the equation by minus 1.

298
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,585
You get minus y plus x.

299
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,330
And when you multiply an
inequality by a negative

300
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,240
number, multiply or divide, you
switch the inequalites.

301
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,700
So it's greater than or equal
to-- and we're multiplying by

302
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,260
negative 1-- 2.

303
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,890
So it becomes x minus y is
greater than or equal to 2.

304
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,190
So our two equations turn into
2x plus y is greater than or

305
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,890
equal to 3, which is this one.

306
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,460
And we get x minus y is greater
than or equal to 2,

307
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,890
which is that one.

308
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,440
And we're done.

309
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,480
It's choice d.

310
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,520
See you in the next video.

311
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:43,900
