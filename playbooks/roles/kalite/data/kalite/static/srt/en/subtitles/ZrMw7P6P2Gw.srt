1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,400
Last video, we saw what
happens when we have

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,970
resistors in series.

4
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,390
Now let's see what happens
when we have

5
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,600
resistors in parallel.

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,860
All right, let me pick
a new color.

7
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,960
New color will be magenta.

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,720
There's my battery: positive,
negative.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,140
There's my ideal conducting
wire.

10
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,000
Here's my ideal conducting wire,
but then-- and this is

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,460
new-- it branches off, and
I have two resistances.

12
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,710
I have one here.

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:41,910
   

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,140
And that's another resistance.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,320
And let's say that this has a
resistance R1, this has a

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,130
resistance R2.

17
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,220
And, of course, the
non-intuitive convention is

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,180
that the current flows from the
positive to the negative

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,410
terminal, but we know that the
electrons are actually flowing

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,370
in the other direction.

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,910
And I want to keep saying that,
because I think it's so

22
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,700
important to understand what's
actually happening as opposed

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,870
to the convention.

24
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,450
Well, anyway, in the previous
video, we said, well, when we

25
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,610
have devices or components in
series, that the current

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,540
through the entire circuit
is constant.

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,770
But let's think about
what happens here.

28
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,660
So we have these electrons--
actually, let's think about it

29
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,300
from the electron flow.

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,240
The electrons are flowing,
flowing, flowing at a given

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,770
rate, and then here they
have a choice.

32
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,070
Some of them can take this top
path, some of them can take

33
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,160
this bottom path.

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,110
So if you think about it, the
flow of electrons in this

35
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,920
branch plus the flow of
electrons in that branch have

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,130
to add up to the flow
of the electrons in

37
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,190
this branch, right?

38
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,610
And then they're going to meet
back up, and then the flow of

39
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,490
electrons here-- so if we think
of it this way, and now

40
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,510
I'm going to go back to the
convention, this is I1.

41
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,150
   

42
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,110
So you have these electrons
flowing at a given rate.

43
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,160
This is the current
right here.

44
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,560
They're going to branch off,
and maybe half of them go--

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,800
we'll see if the resistances
are equal, if both of these

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,280
branches have an equal amount
of capacity in terms of how

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,030
fast the electrons
can flow through.

48
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,220
If they're equal, or since we're
going to current in this

49
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,390
direction, let's talk about
positrons or positive charges.

50
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,950
If the positive charges--
although I just want to keep

51
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,350
saying that it is
not the positive

52
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,170
charges that are moving.

53
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:26,900
It's the electrons.

54
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,680
But if you say that the lack of
electrons can flow equally

55
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,950
easily between both paths,
that's if the resistances were

56
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,500
the same, we could imagine that
the current, the flow,

57
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,270
would split itself up,
and then over here

58
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,180
would meet back up.

59
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,000
And then we would say that the
current here would also be I1.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,970
But let's figure out where
the current's going.

61
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,120
Let's call this current I2 and
let's call this current I3.

62
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,260
   

63
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,660
So I think it is reasonable, and
you can imagine with water

64
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,550
pipes or anything, that the
current going into the branch

65
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,590
is equal to the current
exiting the branch.

66
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,830
Or you could even think of it
that the current entering--

67
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,110
when the currents I2 and I1
merge, that they combine and

68
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,520
they become Current 1, right?

69
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,450
I mean, think about it.

70
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,800
In a given second, if this is
5 coulombs per second-- I'm

71
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:31,660
just making up numbers-- and
this is 6 coulombs per second,

72
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,320
in a given second right here,
you're going to have 5

73
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,760
coulombs coming from this branch
and 6 coulombs coming

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,850
from this branch, so you're
going to have 11 coulombs per

75
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,190
second coming out once they've
merged, so this would be 11

76
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,800
coulombs per second.

77
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,420
So I think hopefully that makes
sense to you that this

78
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,480
current is equal to the
combination of this current

79
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,120
and that current.

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,900
Now, what do we also know?

81
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:03,090
We also know the voltage along
this entire ideal wire is

82
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,800
constant, so then voltage-- let
me draw that in another

83
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,260
color, in blue.

84
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,900
So, for example, the voltage
anywhere along this blue that

85
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,350
I'm filling in is going to be
the same, because this wire is

86
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,220
an ideal conductor, and you can
almost view this blue part

87
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,830
as an extension of the positive

88
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,810
terminal of the battery.

89
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,850
And very similarly-- I'll do it
in yellow-- we could draw

90
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,430
this wire as an extension
of the negative

91
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,750
terminal of the battery.

92
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,280
This is an extension
of the negative

93
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,530
terminal of the battery.

94
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:45,150
   

95
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,800
So the voltage difference
between here and here-- so

96
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
let's call that the total
voltage, or let's just call it

97
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,480
the voltage, right?

98
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,980
The voltage difference between
that point and that point is

99
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,600
the exact same thing as the
voltage difference between

100
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,290
this point and this point, which
is the exact same thing

101
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,180
as the voltage difference
between this

102
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,200
point and this point.

103
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,510
So what can we say?

104
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,890
What is the total current
in the system?

105
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,880
If we just viewed this as a
black box, that this is some

106
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,880
type of total resistance, well,
the total current in the

107
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,260
system would be the total
voltage, the voltage divided

108
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,590
by-- let's call this our total
resistance, right?

109
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,580
Let's say we couldn't see this
and we just said, oh, that's

110
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,840
just some total resistance,
and that is equal to the

111
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,140
current going through R1.

112
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,350
This is I1.

113
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,100
This is a 1 right here.

114
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,350
This is current I1.

115
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,730
   

116
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,560
What's current I1?

117
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,160
Well, it's going to be the
voltage across this resistor

118
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,990
divided by the resistance,
right?

119
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,210
That's what Ohm's law tells
us: V is equal to IR, or

120
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,770
another way we could say it is V
over R is equal to I, right?

121
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,080
So I1 is equal to the voltage
across this resistor, but we

122
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,590
just said that voltage
is the same thing as

123
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,350
this voltage, right?

124
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,330
The voltage here is the same
thing as the voltage here.

125
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,090
The voltage here is the same
thing as the voltage here.

126
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,840
So the voltage across that
resistor is still V, and so

127
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,980
the current flowing across that
resistor is V over R1.

128
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,400
And the same logic:
what is I2?

129
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,160
I2 is this current.

130
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,900
What is the voltage across
this device?

131
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,930
Well, that's just
V again, right?

132
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,400
It's the same thing as the
voltage across this device, so

133
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,450
it's V over R2 by Ohm's law.

134
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,870
Well, all these V's are the
same, so we can divide both

135
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,100
sides of that equation by V,
and we get 1 over the total

136
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:46,160
resistance is equal to 1
over R1 plus 1 over R2.

137
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,300
And you could make that argument
if we had an R3 here.

138
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,520
Let's say that we had another
device, and that is R3.

139
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,430
You could use the exact same
argument, and you would have a

140
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,590
plus 1 over R3.

141
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,260
And if you had Rn or 10 of them,
you'd just keep that 1

142
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,350
over R4, R5, et cetera.

143
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,170
So let's see if we can use
this information we have

144
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,100
learned to actually solve a
problem, and I actually find

145
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,760
that it's always easier to
solve a problem than to

146
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,740
explain the theory
behind a problem.

147
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,750
You'll see that with most of
these circuit problems, it's

148
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,860
actually very basic
mathematics.

149
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,510
So let's say I have a 16
volt battery plus,

150
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,380
minus, it's 16 volts.

151
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,660
And just to hit the point home
that you always don't have to

152
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,090
draw circuits the same, although
it is nice if you're

153
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,900
actually drawing complicated
circuits, I could

154
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,950
draw it like this.

155
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,650
I could draw the circuit like
this, and let's say that

156
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,806
there's a resistor here.

157
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:43,230
And then let's say there's a
wire and then there's another

158
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,460
resistor here, and that this
decides to do some random

159
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,200
loopy thing here and that they
connect here, and that they

160
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,590
come back here.

161
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,710
This strange thing that I have
drawn, which you will never

162
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,970
see in any textbook, because
most people are more

163
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,080
reasonable than me, is the exact
same-- you can almost

164
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,440
view it topologically as the
exact same circuit as what I

165
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,740
drew in the previous diagram,
although now I will assign

166
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,730
numbers to it.

167
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:16,810
Let's say that this resistance
is 20 ohms and let's say that

168
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:23,590
this resistance is 5 ohms. What
I want to know is, what

169
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,690
is the current through
the system?

170
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,040
First, we'll have to figure
out what the equivalent

171
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,460
resistance is, and then we could
just use Ohm's law to

172
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,720
figure out the current
in the system.

173
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,070
So we want to know what the
current is, and we know that

174
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,240
the convention is that current
flows from the positive

175
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,400
terminal to the negative
terminal.

176
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,679
So how do we figure out the
equivalent resistance?

177
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,890
Well, we know that we just
hopefully proved to you that

178
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,950
the total resistance is equal to
1 over this resistor plus 1

179
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,930
over this resistor.

180
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,300
So 1 over-- I won't
keep writing it.

181
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,880
What's 1 over 20?

182
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,750
Well, actually, let's just
make it a fraction.

183
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,130
So it's 1/20 plus-- 1/5
is what over 20?

184
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,880
That's 4/20, right?

185
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,060
So 1 over our total resistance
is equal to 5/20, which is

186
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,650
equal to what?

187
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,900
1/4.

188
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,210
   

189
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,520
So if 1/R is equal to 1/4,
R must be equal to 4.

190
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,850
R is equal to 4 ohms.

191
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,260
So we could redraw this
crazy circuit as this.

192
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,100
I'll try to draw it
small down here.

193
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,840
   

194
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,950
We could redraw this where this
resistance is 4 ohms and

195
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,600
this is 16 volts.

196
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,140
We could say that this whole
thing combined is really just

197
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,770
a resistor that is 4 ohms. Well,
if we have a 16-volt

198
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,340
potential difference, current
is flowing that way, even

199
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,910
though that's not what the
electrons are doing.

200
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,890
And that's what our
resistance is, 4

201
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,270
ohms. What is the current?

202
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,870
V equals IR, Ohms law.

203
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,020
The voltage is 16 volts.

204
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:11,330
It equals the current times 4
ohms. So current is equal to

205
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,460
16 divided by 4, is
equal to 4 amps.

206
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,150
So let's do something
interesting.

207
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,640
Let's figure out what the
current is flowing through.

208
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,470
What's this?

209
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,330
What's the current I1 and
what's this current I2?

210
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,430
Well, we know that the potential
difference from here

211
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,330
to here is also 16
volts, right?

212
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,530
Because this whole thing is
essentially at the same

213
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,420
potential and this whole thing
is essentially at the same

214
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,990
potential, so you have 16
volts across there.

215
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,610
16 volts divided by 20 ohms,
so let's call this I1.

216
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:54,830
So I1 is equal to 16 volts
divided by 20 ohms, which is

217
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,300
equal to what?

218
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,660
4/5.

219
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:02,820
So it equals 4/5 of an ampere,
or 0.8 amperes.

220
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,440
And similarly, what is the
amount of current flowing

221
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,810
through here?

222
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,590
I2?

223
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,110
I'm going to do this in
a different color.

224
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,546
It's getting confusing.

225
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,030
I'll do it in the
vibrant yellow.

226
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,090
So the current flowing through
here, once again, the

227
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,680
potential difference from here--
that's not different

228
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,890
enough-- the potential
difference from here to here

229
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,190
is also 16 volts, right?

230
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,240
So the current is going to be
I2, is going to be equal to

231
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:35,390
16/5, which is equal
to 3 1/5 amps.

232
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,730
So most of the current is
actually flowing through this,

233
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,530
and that makes sense because the
resistance is less, right?

234
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,230
So that should hopefully give
you a little bit of intuition

235
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,980
of what's going on.

236
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,910
And less current is flowing
through here, so I2 through

237
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:53,630
the 20-ohm resistor is 0.8 amps
is I1, and I2 through the

238
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,250
5-ohm resistor is equal
to 3.2 amps.

239
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,740
And it makes sense that when
you add these two currents

240
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,560
together, the 3.2 amperes
flowing through here and the

241
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,000
0.8 amperes flowing through
here, that when they merge,

242
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,840
they merge and then you have 4
amperes flowing through there.

243
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,280
Anyway, hopefully, I have given
you some intuition on

244
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,850
what happens when we put
resistors in parallel.

245
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,100
I will see you in
the next video.

246
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,130
