00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:36,933
Let us think about the above example a little bit so 'I' for Ian can rake 1 lawn and bag leaves in 5 hours - so we

2
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:47,533
can also write 5 hours for 1 lawn. But writing it this way is more useful - 1 over 5 lawn per hour

3
00:00:47,533 --> 00:01:14,072
or 1/5th of a lawn per hour. Now let us do the same thing for Kyandre, he can rake the same lawn

4
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:20,733
and bag the leaves in 3 hours.

5
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:39,405
We can write it as 1/3rd of a lawn per hour and let us look at the combined

6
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:53,667
rate. Ian + Kyandre, what is going to be their combined rate?

7
00:01:53,667 --> 00:02:00,800
They tell us that when working together how long will it take to rake and bag the leaves. Let 't' = how

8
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:24,667
long it will take them together to rake the lawn and bag the leaves. Then we could say combined they will do 1 lawn in every 't' hours, Assuming 't; is an hour/

9
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:44,933
1 over 't' = 1/t th of a lawn per hour. So here we have the rate of Ian and Kyandre and the combined rate, so the combined rate

10
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:48,933
is going to be the sum of each of their rates.

11
00:02:48,933 --> 00:03:14,667
Their combined rate will be 1/5th of a lawn per hour and 1/3rd of a lawn per hour.

12
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:24,893
1/5th of lawn per hour for Ian + 1/3rd of lawn for Kyandre =1/t lawns per hour.

13
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:49,333
Let us total them - let us take the common denominator of 15. 3/15 +5/15 = 1/t

14
00:03:49,333 --> 00:04:08,933
We have a common denominator now, 3+5 /15, 8/15=1/t.

15
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:24,824
If we flip over both sides - flip the left side we get 15/8 and we flip the right side we get t/1 hour.

16
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:47,733
15/8 hours per lawn. The whole time earlier we had lawns per hour.

17
00:04:47,733 --> 00:05:05,993
15/8 is same thing as 1 and 7/8th of an hour - let us get the calculator out. If we have 60 mins in an hour x7/8=52.5 mins

18
00:05:05,993 --> 99:59:59,999
Our answer combined - it will take them 1 hour and 52.5 mins per lawn or to do this lawn in question. Hope you found that useful.
