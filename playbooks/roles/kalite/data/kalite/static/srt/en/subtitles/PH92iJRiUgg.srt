1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,210
   

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,610
We're on problem 16.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,960
And they want to know what is
the area of the shaded square?

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,590
Let me shade it because they
call it shaded square.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,100
So what's that area?

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,030
So how can we do it?

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,180
Well, it's a bit of a trick, but
what you need to realize

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:26,880
is, you could draw-- Let me draw
some things that might--

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,610
This is actually a really
fun problem.

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,900
Let me draw some interesting
rectangles here.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,162
   

12
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:38,020
Let me draw a rectangle there.

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,640
Let me draw another rectangle
there to there.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,226
This really is just kind
of a brain teaser.

15
00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:50,510
Draw another rectangle
from there to there.

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,680
   

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:06,930
And then let me draw another
rectangle from there to there.

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,410
   

19
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,720
OK, so let me ask you
a couple of things.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,980
One: what is the distance of
the base of this rectangle

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,820
right here?

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,090
This distance.

23
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,540
Well, we know this entire--
whoops, wrong tool-- we know

24
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,490
this entire distance
is 3, right?

25
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,310
Because they tell us-- oh,
they don't even tell us.

26
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,910
They tell us that this
distance is this 1.

27
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,300
So we know that this
is a cube, right?

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,110
That this distance is 3.

29
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,180
So this distance is 1.

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,580
And then this distance
down here is 3.

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,445
And they tell us that this is
a shaded square, right?

32
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:51,770
So all the sides of this
inner shape are also

33
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,510
going to be the same.

34
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,280
So if this is 1, this
is 2, this is also

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,220
going to be 2, right?

36
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,970
That's going to be 2, that's
going to be 1, that's going to

37
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,780
be 1, this is going
to be 2, 1.

38
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,580
I think you get when
I'm saying, right?

39
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,830
And what is the distances
of the smaller

40
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,520
square inside of here?

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,940
Well, if this distance is 1,
this distance is 1 from here

42
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,870
to here, this distance
is also going to be 1

43
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,640
because 1 plus 1 is 2.

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,660
That's 1.

45
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,200
Same reason, you can make
the same argument.

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,410
This is 1, this is
1, this is 1.

47
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,280
So the area of this small square
inside, what's the area

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,740
of that small square?

49
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,370
What's the area of the magenta
square that I just filled in?

50
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,270
Well that area is
going to be 1.

51
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,610
right?

52
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,240
The magenta square is 1.

53
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,420
So now all we have to figure
out is the area of these 4

54
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,630
yellow triangles.

55
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,360
And what are the areas of each
of those yellow triangles?

56
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,300
Well, each of those yellow
triangles are-- they have a

57
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,140
dimension, on the long side,
the dimension is 2.

58
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,570
Let me find a good color.

59
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,450
On the long side, the dimension
is 2, right?

60
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,220
This distance right here is 2.

61
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,610
And on the short side,
the distance is 1.

62
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,950
So its area, each yellow
triangle is 2 times 1 times

63
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,850
1/2, right?

64
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,890
Because area of a triangle
is area equals

65
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,160
1/2 base times height.

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,880
So area of each of those
triangles is going to be 1/2

67
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,950
times 2 times 1, so that
equals 1, right?

68
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,390
So the area of this triangle
is 1, the area of this

69
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,006
triangle is 1, the area of this
triangle is 1, the area

70
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:40,020
of this triangle is 1.

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,800
And then the area of the square
inside is also 1.

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,540
So it's 1 plus 1 plus
1 plus 1 plus 1.

73
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,360
The total area is 5.

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,920
Area equals 5, that
was pretty neat.

75
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,990
And the big thing you need to
realize is that you can split

76
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,205
up the square on the
inside like this.

77
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:03,200
Let me think if there
was another way.

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,440
That's the way that
it occurred to me.

79
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,130
Maybe there's another way, maybe
I'm over-complicating

80
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,900
it, I don't know.

81
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,100
But it looks nice.

82
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,850
Next problem.

83
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,899
For all positive integers, j
and k, let j-- I like these

84
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,680
where they define new math
operations-- j square with an

85
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,780
r inside of it, k, be defined as
the whole number remainder

86
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,070
when j is divided by k.

87
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,320
So this equals remainder
when j is divided by k.

88
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,680
If you're familiar with the
concept of a modulus, that's

89
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,890
essentially what this
operation is.

90
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:47,760
If 13-- I guess we'll call this
remainder operation-- k

91
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,010
is equal to 2, what
is the value of k?

92
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,780
And they tell us in the
beginning that j and k, all of

93
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,870
these things have to be positive
numbers, right?

94
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,790
So this is essentially saying
that when I divide 13 by some

95
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:12,510
positive number, I get
a remainder of 2.

96
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,160
Well, what number when I
divide it into 13 is 2?

97
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,620
I guess another way to think
about it is 13 minus 2 is a

98
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,040
multiple of this
number, right?

99
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,050
So you could say, what's
13 minus 2?

100
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,270
Well it's 11.

101
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,170
So 11 is a multiple of k, and
actually 11 should be k

102
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:36,310
because if 11's a multiple of k,
and 11's not a multiple of

103
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,090
much, right?

104
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,320
Eleven's only a multiple of 1
and 11, so k has to be 11.

105
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,510
And you can test it out.

106
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,050
I mean, if you get confused,
just try

107
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,300
out different numbers.

108
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,500
   

109
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,460
13 divided by 11 is equal
to one, right?

110
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,450
Because 11 goes in
13 one time.

111
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,020
Remainder 2.

112
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,920
Which satisfies this.

113
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,830
13 remainder 11 is equal to 2.

114
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,080
Next problem.

115
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,810
   

116
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,270
Problem 18.

117
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,720
The average of the test
scores of a class of

118
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,060
p students is 70.

119
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,190
The average is 70, so what
do we know about that?

120
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,130
We know that if we were to add
up all of the p students--

121
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,170
well, actually, let me read the
rest of the problem before

122
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,670
I do anything.

123
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,150
And the average of the test
scores of a class of n

124
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,620
students is 92.

125
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,150
When the scores of both classes
are combined, the

126
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,450
average score is 86.

127
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,750
What is the value of p/n?

128
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:43,880
OK, so what is the sum of
the p student scores?

129
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,720
So their average is 70, so the
sum of all of their scores is

130
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,810
going to be 70p, right?

131
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,320
You can take the average
and multiply it by

132
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,440
the number of students.

133
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,260
And then you get the sum of all
of their scores, right?

134
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,300
And if that doesn't make a lot
of sense, think about it.

135
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,375
What's the definition
of average?

136
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:10,920
It's the sum divided by p is
equal to the average, right?

137
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,520
So if you multiply both sides by
p, you get the sum is equal

138
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,940
to p times the average.

139
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,690
In this case, the
average is 70.

140
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,590
So 70 times p is the sum of
the first class, and then

141
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,560
what's the sum of the
second class?

142
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,810
It's going to be 92n for
the same exact reason.

143
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,430
And now, how many total students
are we averaging?

144
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,380
Well there are p in this sum and
there are n in this sum,

145
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,640
so it's p plus n, and they
tell us that this average

146
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,370
score is 86.

147
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,410
So we set up our equation
and now let's solve.

148
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:53,040
Let's multiply both sides by p
plus n, so you get 70p plus

149
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:03,410
92n is equal to 86p plus 86n,
right? p plus n times 86,

150
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,360
distribute the 86.

151
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,180
Now what do we want to do?

152
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,650
We eventually want to figure out
p/n, so let's put the n's

153
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,020
on the left-hand side.

154
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,220
So I'm going to subtract 86n
from both sides, so you get

155
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:22,710
70p plus-- 92 minus 86 is 6n
is equal to 86p, right?

156
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,590
I subtracted this from
the other side.

157
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,690
And then let's subtract 70p from
both sides, so you get 6n

158
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,360
is equal to 16p, right?

159
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,140
86 minus 70.

160
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,965
And then we want to know p/n.

161
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:40,309
   

162
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:46,620
So we divide both sides by n,
you get 6 is equal to 16p/n

163
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,920
and now divide both sides
by 16, and you get

164
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,090
6/16 is equal to p/n.

165
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,300
And, of course, we
can reduced 6/16.

166
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,030
6/16 is the same thing as 3/8.

167
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,040
That is our answer for p/n.

168
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,170
I'll see you in the
next section.

169
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:05,400
