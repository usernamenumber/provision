99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Here we're looking at the baptistry in Piza, a building that was begun in the mid-twelfth century.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it's in a very famous location that perhaps people have seen.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is where the Leaning Tower of Piza is

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's right. The Leaning Tower of Piza, as it's known, is actually the bell tower of the catherdral and this building

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the baptisry is in front of the cathedral and usually this is how the buildings were arranged in these late medieval

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Italian cities. The cathedral with the baptisry in front of it as a kind of religious and civic center of the city.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we see that in cities like Florence. That´s right, you see the same kind of arrangement there. And baptiseries

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were specially important buildings. Of course that is where baptisims would be performed.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But that had a great great importance in the cities which were dominated by their Christian faith and practices.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because it was a place where essentially the individual, through baptism, was welcomed into the Christian community of that city.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it makes sense that this is a place that city government would want to decorate.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They were usually very richly decorated places, focuses of a lot of patronage and attention because of their importance in the cities of this type.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Woa, who is going to say this? So, this is when the middle ages architecture, right? Exactly. Then when we go inside...well, inside it´s leading to a great transition

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are relatively revolutionary in fact. And that´s when we look at this sculture here which is inside. This is the

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by Nicolo Pisano in the piece of Baptistry, which was finished by

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
about 1260. And pulpit would be a place where the priest

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
would stand to deliver a ceremony. That´s right, they would clim up and
