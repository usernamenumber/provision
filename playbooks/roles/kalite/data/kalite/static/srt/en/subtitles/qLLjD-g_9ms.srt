1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,630
This is the fourth of
the five problems that

3
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,020
Kortaggio sent me today.

4
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,430
And I've been doing these
problems because I think

5
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,190
they're really neat
applications of essentially

6
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,520
fairly basic, even you could
call it physics, rate problems,

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,750
and a little bit of algebra.

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,280
But you're able to figure out
pretty neat things, where

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,850
you're not sure if there's
enough information at first.

10
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,710
So, here we have train A,
represented by these two dots

11
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,000
and arrow, is 200 meters long.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,810
And I did this because I think
we want to be specific about

13
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,480
the configurations we're
talking to later

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,230
in the problems.

15
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,390
Let's just read it.

16
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,440
Train A is 200 meters long.

17
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,410
Train B is 400 meters long.

18
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,620
They run on parallel tracks
at constant speeds.

19
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,250
When moving in the same
direction, A passes

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,770
B in 15 seconds.

21
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,460
From, so these are
the configurations.

22
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,760
From A is right behind B, to
A is right in front of B.

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,720
So let me draw that.

24
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,050
So, train A, I'll do
in this blue color.

25
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,670
So train a is like that.

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,380
And it's 200 meters long.

27
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,210
And then train B, I'll
do in this green color.

28
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,430
Train B is double the length.

29
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,360
So it's 400 meters.

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,390
And so this is a
starting configuration.

31
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,090
The outline right here.

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,400
And it says, it takes 15
seconds to pass it, to go

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,670
to this configuration.

34
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,080
So the ending configuration
looks like this.

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,340
Ending configuration.

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,600
Train B here.

37
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,830
And then train A has
passed train B.

38
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,600
200 meters.

39
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,070
Once again, this is
400 meters here.

40
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,410
And this situation
takes 15 seconds.

41
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,850
So this takes 15
seconds to happen.

42
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,010
15 seconds.

43
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,380
So, A passes B in 15 seconds.

44
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,370
So this whole sentence right
here, is this right here.

45
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,820
We go from the situation
to that situation.

46
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,540
And then in opposite
directions, they pass

47
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,390
each other in 5 seconds.

48
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,260
So from this
configuration to that.

49
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,480
So let me draw that.

50
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,540
So, in the opposite direction
example, they start like this.

51
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,260
Train A is 200 meters.

52
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,540
Train B is facing in
the other direction.

53
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,660
I'm doing it probably little
bit too long, 400 meters.

54
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,160
And then in 5 seconds they
get from this configuration

55
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,160
to this configuration.

56
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,890
To that configuration,
right there.

57
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,900
200.

58
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,850
And, of course, this
right here is 400.

59
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,540
And this takes-- this right
here takes 5 seconds.

60
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,890
So in opposite directions they
pass each other in 5 seconds.

61
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,620
Now, their question is how
fast is each train moving

62
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,980
in meters per second?

63
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,270
So, once again they gave us--
they didn't really give us a

64
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,490
lot of velocity information.

65
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,140
They just tell us how
long it takes to pass.

66
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,830
But maybe using both of these
pieces of information,

67
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,110
we can solve it.

68
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,370
So let's say that--
well, you have velocity

69
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,900
of train A, so vA.

70
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,840
Velocity of train A, and
then of course you have

71
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,960
the velocity of train B.

72
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,820
And regardless of which
direction they're facing, it

73
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,470
assumes that they're always
going at the same velocity.

74
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,330
So in this situation, and we
always have to just

75
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,970
remember, distance is equal
to rate times time.

76
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,900
So relative, if we assume,
because when you take a

77
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,110
velocity, you can always
take a velocity relative

78
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,160
to something else.

79
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,090
So, first of all, relative to
this train right here, to train

80
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,510
B, how far does train A travel?

81
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,510
Well, it goes from this point.

82
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,710
It goes from right here.

83
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,880
To, not just 400 meters, it
gets to the point where the

84
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,930
front of the train is out here.

85
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,560
So it has to travel 400 meters.

86
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,650
And another 200 meters.

87
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,136
So it travels 600 meters.

88
00:03:42,136 --> 00:03:44,660
It travels 600 meters
in this situation.

89
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,530
And how far does it travel
in this situation?

90
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,680
Well, once again, if we assume
that this train is stationary,

91
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,420
and that's, I guess, the key
assumption we have to make.

92
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,090
We're going to do
everything relative.

93
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,660
We're going to assume that,
even though it is moving at a

94
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,800
velocity, the position we're
going to make relative.

95
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,330
So, relative to this train,
we move from right here,

96
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,630
we move 400 meters.

97
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,010
And then we move 200 more.

98
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,990
So, again, in both situations,
we move 600 meters.

99
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,310
In this situation we move
600 meters, relative.

100
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,020
I guess you could say, we move
600 meters relative to the back

101
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,190
of train B in this situation.

102
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,640
And we move 600 meters relative
to the front of train

103
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,560
B in this situation.

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,330
In this situation, we
do it in 15 seconds.

105
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,890
That's because we're, kind of,
where the velocity of train A

106
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,510
is being eaten away by
the velocity of B.

107
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,050
If the velocity of B was 0, if
this green train was really

108
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,870
stationary, then we'd be moving
relative to this train

109
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,010
with velocity A.

110
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,400
But now this is moving
at some velocity.

111
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,135
So our relative velocity
to this train is going

112
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:48,970
to be something lower.

113
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,150
And what is the
relative velocity?

114
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,390
If you're a passenger sitting
in train B, if you're a

115
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,830
passenger sitting in train B,
right there, how fast will it

116
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,180
look like train A is going?

117
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,290
What will be the
relative velocity?

118
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,720
Well, it's going to be the
difference between the two.

119
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,930
Right?

120
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,710
So it's going to
be vA minus vB.

121
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,910
If you're sitting in
this train right there.

122
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,380
And you would say, it
takes 15 seconds.

123
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,270
So, rate times time.

124
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,700
Times 15 seconds.

125
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,860
Is equal to a distance
that it traveled.

126
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,480
And, once again, if you're a
passenger sitting in this green

127
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,120
train right here, you would
say, OK, it went

128
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,830
from this point.

129
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,420
It crossed this entire
train then it went

130
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,980
another 200 meters.

131
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,500
So it went 600 meters.

132
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,360
Now, and this is of
course in seconds.

133
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,220
Now, obviously both of
these trains in this have

134
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,680
some positive velocity.

135
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,470
This train would have moved
even more than 600 meters.

136
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,880
This train moved 100 and
this train would've

137
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,050
moved 700 meters.

138
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,830
But I'm doing everything
relative to what this passenger

139
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,870
in the green train sees.

140
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,800
Likewise.

141
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,350
The passenger in the green
train here, let's say the

142
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,820
passenger in the green
train right here.

143
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,040
Oh, I'm doing his arms
coming out of his head.

144
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,990
But what velocity does he see
this blue train coming in at?

145
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,970
Well, he's going in
this direction at 400

146
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,990
meters per second.

147
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,150
The other train is coming in--
no, sorry he's going in this

148
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,640
direction at velocity
of train B.

149
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,470
We don't know what that is.

150
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,450
400 is how long it is.

151
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,250
And this train is coming with
velocity, want to do it

152
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,350
in blue, with velocity a.

153
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,920
So you would add the
two velocities.

154
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,380
If this is coming at 60 miles
per hour and this is going in

155
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,040
that direction at 60 miles per
hour, to this guy who's

156
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,350
stationery in train B, he would
just feel like this train

157
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,720
is approaching him at
120 miles per hour.

158
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,920
Or the addition of those two.

159
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,940
So from this guy's point of
view, this train is approaching

160
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,970
with the velocity-- let me do,
is approaching with the

161
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,690
velocity vA plus vB.

162
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,850
   

163
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,985
And in 5 seconds-- and they
give us that information.

164
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:58,895
In 5 seconds-- so velocity
times time, or rate times

165
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:02,900
time, is equal to distance--
it travels 600 meters.

166
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,150
Remember, this is all relative
to the guy, or the gal,

167
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,660
sitting on this green train.

168
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,540
And that's kind of the key
assumption you have to make to

169
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,330
make this problem solvable.

170
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,530
Well, now we have two equations
and two unknowns, we should

171
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,560
be able to solve this.

172
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,450
For the velocity of
the two trains.

173
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,490
So, just to simplify,
let's divide both sides

174
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,510
of this one by 15.

175
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,190
So we have the velocity of A
minus the velocity of B, is

176
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,510
equal to 40 meters per second.

177
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,960
Right?

178
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,050
60 divided by 15 is 4.

179
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,080
Yep, 40.

180
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,900
And then here we have the
velocity of A plus the velocity

181
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:43,190
of B, that's an A, is equal
to 120 meters per second.

182
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,140
And, see, we could just
take this equation.

183
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,060
Put it down here.

184
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,730
We could add the two
equations to each other.

185
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,870
So if the velocity of A minus
the velocity of B is equal

186
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,980
to 40 meters per second.

187
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,210
Add the two equations.

188
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,030
We get 2 times the
velocity of A.

189
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,770
These two cancel out.

190
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,200
Is equal to 160
meters per second.

191
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,230
Or the velocity of A is equal
to 80 meters per second.

192
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,780
And then we can just
back-substitute here.

193
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,020
The difference between
the two is 40.

194
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,490
So it's the 80 minus the
velocity of B is equal to

195
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,360
40 meters per second.

196
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,290
So what's the velocity of B?

197
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,540
Well, you could subtract
80 from both sides.

198
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,100
You get minus velocity of
B is equal to minus 40.

199
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,940
Or the velocity of B is equal
to 40 meters per second.

200
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,410
And we've done the problem.

201
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,960
And the key assumption there is
to do everything relative to

202
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,270
the green guy sitting
inside of train B.

203
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,260
You could have done
it the other way.

204
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,780
You could have picked
other relative positions.

205
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,480
But that, in my brain, is the
easiest way to figure it out.

206
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,330
So, this guy, in this case,
is going at the speed at

207
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,530
40 meters per second.

208
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,930
And this guy is going at
80 meters per second.

209
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,890
In this situation, this guy is
traveling at 80 meters per

210
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,240
second and this guy going in
this direction at 40

211
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,330
meters per second.

212
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,030
Anyway.

213
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,000
Thanks again to Kortaggio
for that problem.

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,194
