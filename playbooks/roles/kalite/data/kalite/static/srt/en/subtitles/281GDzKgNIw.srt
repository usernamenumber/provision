1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,630
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,710
Almost done.

4
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,040
We're on problem number 19.

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,330
Let me read it out loud.

6
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,870
At a bottling company, machine
A fills a bottle with spring

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,580
water, and machine B accepts the
bottle only if the fluid

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,930
ounces is between 11
7/8 and 12 and 1/8.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,770
So let me say O for ounces.

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:32,970
So the ounces have to be
between 11 and 7/8.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,450
That's O, not 0.

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,010
Maybe I'll use x.
x for ounces.

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,570
That's an x, that weird
looking symbol.

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,790
And 12 and 1/8.

15
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,130
That's what B accepts if the
ounces are between that.

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:53,490
If B accepts a bottle containing
n fluid ounces,

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,400
which of the following
describes all

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,910
possible values of n?

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,830
So they're actually saying
n for ounces.

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,020
We could just say this.

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,420
So n is between these two terms.
And they give a bunch

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,300
of choices that involve
absolute values.

23
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,250
And what I'm going to do is
actually-- I'm going to draw

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,730
this on a number line, and
then I think the absolute

25
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,010
values are going
to make sense.

26
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,330
Let me do another color just to
change things a little bit.

27
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:38,760
So if this is the number line
and this is 11 and 7/8.

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,670
And this is 12 and 1/8.

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,680
And n has to be between
these two numbers.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,800
n can be anything between
these two numbers.

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,660
So when they're doing absolute
value, I guess you can see

32
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,670
that they're saying that-- they
have all these 12's and

33
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,750
all that-- and I think you could
immediately see that 12

34
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,660
is right in the middle
of these two numbers.

35
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,070
12 is right there
in the middle.

36
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,110
Let me do a different color.

37
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,020
This is 12.

38
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,550
It's right smack dab
in the middle.

39
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,010
And as long as n is a little bit
less than 12 or a little

40
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,500
bit more than 12, we're OK.

41
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,540
The machine B is going
to accept it, right?

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,890
So how much more than
12 can n be?

43
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,120
This is n. n can be anywhere
in this range.

44
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,980
Obviously if n is 12,
it's like perfect.

45
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,250
It's just like right
in the middle.

46
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,960
It's definitely nowhere close
to one of the bad ounces.

47
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,225
It's kind of the
perfect ounces.

48
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,600
The perfect number of
ounces in the bottle

49
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,980
of the spring water.

50
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,880
Let's see.

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,910
So how much more can--
it can be 1/8 more.

52
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,140
This distance is 1/8.

53
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,780
How much more can
n be than 12?

54
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,680
It can be 1/8 more.

55
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,490
And how much less?

56
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,800
Well this distance
is also 1/8.

57
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,390
   

58
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:04,240
So we know that n minus 12-- the
difference between n and

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,750
12-- and we don't know if n
is greater than 12, or n

60
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,080
is less than 12.

61
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,560
So we'll say just
the difference.

62
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,830
And we're going to take
the absolute value.

63
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,850
Because if n is greater, the
absolute value doesn't matter.

64
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,380
And if n is less, then n minus
12 will be a negative number.

65
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,560
But we just care about the
absolute difference.

66
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,500
We don't care whether one is
negative or one is positive.

67
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,200
So we say that n minus 12 has
to be less-- the difference

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,650
between n and 12-- and that's
just the absolute value of n

69
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,210
minus 12-- has to be less
than or equal to

70
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,065
this kind of tolerance.

71
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:42,810
You probably haven't done much
manufacturing yet, but if you

72
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,270
do this is the kind of thing
you'll deal with.

73
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,080
So it has to be less than
or equal to 1/8.

74
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,250
And I want you to play
around with this.

75
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,760
I mean you could say, well
n can't be more than

76
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,470
1/8 more than 12.

77
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,670
So you could say that n minus
12 has to be less than or

78
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,590
equal to 1/8.

79
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,360
And then you could also say
that on this side, n minus

80
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,360
12-- right, if n is around
here-- n minus 12.

81
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,399
So this if n is greater
than 12.

82
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,560
And then if n is less than 12,
then n minus 12 has to be

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,150
greater than or equal
to minus 1/8.

84
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,390
This might be more confusing
to you, and I'm debating

85
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,510
whether I should
even write it.

86
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,970
But these two things would
also translate into this.

87
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,140
But the big picture, absolute
value just means the

88
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,440
difference between
two numbers.

89
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,590
I don't care if one is bigger
than the other.

90
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,340
I'm just saying that the
difference between these two

91
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,660
numbers cannot be
more than 1/8.

92
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,160
So n minus 12, the absolute
value is less

93
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,810
than or equal to 1/8.

94
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,760
And this choice-- well actually,
it's between these

95
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,120
two values.

96
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,380
It can't equal these values.

97
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,020
So it can't equal these
values, so it's not

98
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,990
less than or equal.

99
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,230
It's just less than.

100
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,170
So n minus 12 is
less than 1/8.

101
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,740
That's choice C.

102
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,045
And we are on the
last problem.

103
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:12,360
   

104
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,020
Number 20.

105
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,150
Almost there.

106
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,160
The least integer of a
set of consecutive

107
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,340
integers is minus 25.

108
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,970
So the least, the smallest
is equal to minus 25.

109
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,340
The least is minus 25.

110
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:41,650
If the sum of these integers is
26, how many integers are

111
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,080
in this set?

112
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,150
This is interesting.

113
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:51,940
So I have minus 25 plus
something plus

114
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,290
something plus something.

115
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:04,340
And when I add up all of
the integers, I get 26.

116
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,530
So it's the least integer
of a set of consecutive

117
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,020
integers is minus 25.

118
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,400
If the sum of these integers is
26, how many integers are

119
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,230
in this set?

120
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,560
Well we start with minus 25.

121
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,120
So the rest of the integers are
going to have to equal--

122
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,610
this is an equation--
minus 25 plus all of

123
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,330
these random things.

124
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,040
So let's add 25 to both
sides of these things.

125
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,880
So the rest of the integers are
going to have to equal--

126
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,400
so you know, let's call it this
is I2 because this is I1,

127
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,320
integer 3, integer 4 plus
integer n, because we don't

128
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,610
know how many there are.

129
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:56,090
So that means that I2 plus I3
plus bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

130
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,000
We don't know, a bunch.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,400
In is going to equal-- I'm just
adding 25 to both sides

132
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,740
of this equation.

133
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:10,980
So that is equal to 51.

134
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,860
Let's see, the least integer
of a set of consecutive

135
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,260
integers is minus 25.

136
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,980
Oh, I forgot.

137
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,510
That's consecutive integers.

138
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,310
So we would actually know what
these values are, consecutive.

139
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,910
So I2 is going to be minus 24--
you could almost ignore

140
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,730
what I said just now.

141
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,800
Let me actually clear this.

142
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
I didn't read that
consecutive.

143
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,000
It's important to read your
problems properly.

144
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,280
So it's minus 25 plus minus 24
plus minus 23 is all-- and

145
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:49,360
then we don't know how high it
goes, but that is equal to 26.

146
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,150
So what do we know?

147
00:07:51,150 --> 00:08:01,420
We know that we go from minus
25 plus minus 24 plus minus

148
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,090
23, and we're going to
go all the way to 0.

149
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,660
And then we're going to keep
adding that to 1 plus 2 plus 3

150
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,190
plus 4, and we're going
to add-- so you know.

151
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,260
Well let me write it this way.

152
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:22,110
Minus 25 plus minus 24 plus
minus 23 plus bam, bam, bam,

153
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:38,120
bam, bam plus minus 1 plus 0
plus 1 plus 2 plus 24 plus 25.

154
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,110
So I claim that the sum of all
of the integers from minus 25

155
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,260
to 25 is going to be 0.

156
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,610
And how do I know that?

157
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,930
Well because minus 1-- let me
switch colors-- minus 1 is

158
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,770
going to cancel out with 1.

159
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,490
Minus 2 is going to
cancel out with 2.

160
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,120
Minus 23 is going to cancel
out with positive 23.

161
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,560
Minus 24 is going to
cancel out with 24.

162
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,840
And negative 25 is going to
cancel out with positive 25.

163
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,100
And so the last term, 26, has
nothing to cancel out with it.

164
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,860
And that's the sum because
all of the other

165
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,780
terms canceled out.

166
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,440
So how many terms are there?

167
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:23,430
So to go from minus 25 to minus
1, that is 25 terms.

168
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:30,650
Then to go from 1 to 25, that's
25 terms. And then we

169
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,380
have 0 is one term, and then
26 is another term.

170
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,130
So 25 plus 25 is 50
plus 1 plus 1.

171
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,580
52 terms. And that
is choice E.

172
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,920
And we are done that
first section.

173
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,040
I hope you had fun.

174
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,630
I'll see you soon.
