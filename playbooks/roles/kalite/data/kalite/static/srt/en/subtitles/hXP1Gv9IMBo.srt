00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,020
Welcome to the presentation
on figuring out the slope.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,320
Let's get started.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,780
So, let's say I
have two points.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,270
And, as we learned in previous
presentations, that all

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,080
you need to define a
line is two points.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,200
And I think if you think about
that, that makes sense.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,200
Let's say we have two points.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,450
And let me write down the two
points we're going to have.

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:25,020
Let's say one point is,
why isn't it writing.

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,846
Sometimes this thing
acts a little finicky.

11
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:30,080
Oh, that's because I was
trying to write in black.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:38,160
Let's say that one point
is, negative 1, 3.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,660
So, let's see.

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,500
Where do we graph that?

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,470
So, this is 0, 0.

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,490
We go negative 1, this
is negative 1 here.

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,970
And then we're
going to go 3 up.

18
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,530
1, 2, 3.

19
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,560
Because this is 3 right here.

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,580
So, negative 1, 3 is going
to be right over there.

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,310
OK, so that's the first point.

22
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,210
The second point, I'm going to
do it in a different color.

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,890
The second point is 2, 1.

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,290
Let's see where we
would put that.

25
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,080
We would count 1, 2.

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,610
This is 2, 1.

27
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,670
Because this is 1.

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,530
So the point's
going to be here.

29
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,710
So we've graphed
our two points.

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,600
And now the line that connects
them, it's going to look

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,450
something thing like this.

32
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,060
And I hope I can draw it well.

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:36,300
35
00:01:36,3 --> 00:01:39,078
Through that point.

34
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:40,430
Like that.

35
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,070
Then I'm going to do it.

36
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,170
And then I'm just going to try
to continue the line from here.

37
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,400
That might be the
best technique.

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,293
Something like that.

39
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:57,680
42
00:01:57,68 --> 00:01:58,57
So, let's look at that line.

40
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,270
So what we want to do in this
presentation is, figure out

41
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:07,120
I think will help you.

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,410
So, there's a couple
ways to view slope.

43
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,930
I think, intuitively, you
know that the slope is the

44
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,170
inclination of this line.

45
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,470
And we can already
see that this is a

46
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,880
downward sloping line.

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,820
Because it comes from the top
left to the bottom right.

48
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,590
So it's going to be a
negative number, the slope.

49
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,200
So you know that immediately.

50
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,770
And we'll have -- what we're
going to do is figure out how

51
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,750
to figure out the slope.

52
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,280
So the slope, let me write this
down, slope and -- oftentimes

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,700
they'll use the variable m, for
slope, I have no idea why.

54
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,060
Because m, clearly, does
not stand for slope.

55
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,370
That is equal to -- there's
a couple of things

56
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,300
you might hear.

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,270
Change in y over change in x.

58
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,920
That triangle, which is
pronounced, delta just a Greek

59
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,560
letter, that means change.

60
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
The change in y
over change in x.

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,970
And that also is equal
to rise over run.

62
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,800
And I'm going to explain what
all of this means in a second.

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,650
So let's start at one
of these points.

64
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,130
Let's start at this green
point, negative 1, 3.

65
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,760
So how much do we have to rise
and how much do we have to run

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,710
to get to the second
point, 2, 1?

67
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,130
So let's do the rise first.

68
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:21,640
Well, we have to go minus
2, so that's the rise.

69
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,400
So the rise is
equal to minus 2.

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,120
Because we have to go down
2 to get to the same y

71
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,290
as this yellow point.

72
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,450
And then we have to
run right there.

73
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,830
We have to run plus 3.

74
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:42,140
So rise divided by run is
equal to minus 2 over 3.

75
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,340
Well, how would we do that if
we didn't have this nice graph

76
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,790
here to actually draw on?

77
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,400
Well, what we can do is, we
can say let's take this

78
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,690
as a starting point.

79
00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:00,360
Change in y, change in y, over
change in x, is equal to

80
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,110
we take the first y
point, which is 3.

81
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,010
And we subtract the
second y point, which

82
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,700
is 1, you see that?

83
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,590
We just took 3 minus 1.

84
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,620
So that's the change in y over,
and we take the first x point.

85
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,250
Negative 1, minus the
second x point, minus

86
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,345
2, so 3 minus 1 is 2.

87
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:30,590
And negative 1 minus 2
is equal to minus 3.

88
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:30,990
So, same thing.

89
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,880
We got minus 2 over 3.

90
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,070
Now we could have done
it the other way.

91
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,850
And I'm running out
of space here.

92
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,380
But we could've made
this the first point.

93
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,770
If we made that the first
point, then the change in y

94
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,100
would have been -- I want to
make it really cluttered,

95
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,460
so to confuse you.

96
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,300
Change in y would be this y.

97
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:57,380
1 minus 3 over change in x,
would be 2, minus minus 1.

98
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,960
Well, 1 minus 3 is minus 2.

99
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,330
And 2 minus negative 1 is 3.

100
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,620
So, once again, we got minus
2/3, So it doesn't matter which

101
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,030
point we start with, as long
as, if we use the y in this

102
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,310
coordinate first, then we have
to use the x in that

103
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,480
coordinate first.

104
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,900
Let's do some more problems.

105
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,280
Actually, I'm going to do a
couple just so you see the

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,565
algebra without even
graphing it first.

107
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:22,450
113
00:05:22,45 --> 00:05:24,56
So, let's say I wanted to
figure out the slope between

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:33,100
the points 5, 2, and 3, 5.

109
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,760
Well, let's take this
as our starting point.

110
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,930
So, change in y over change in
x, or rise over run, well,

111
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,430
change in y would be this 5.

112
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,950
5 minus this 2.

113
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,471
Over this 3 minus this 5.

114
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:59,110
And that gets us 3, this
is a 5, over minus 2.

115
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,890
Equals minus 3/2.

116
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,370
Let's do another one.

117
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,070
This time I'm going to try to
make it color-coded so it'll

118
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,070
more self-explanatory.

119
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,410
Say, it's 1, 2.

120
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,990
That's the first point.

121
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:17,390
And then the second
point is 4, 3.

122
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:25,120
So, once again, we say slope
is equal to change in

123
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,790
y over change in x.

124
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,980
Well, in y.

125
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,180
We take the first y.

126
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,270
Let's start here.

127
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,850
And we'll call that y1.

128
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:42,250
So that's 3 minus the
second y, which is that 2.

129
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:47,240
And then all of that over,
once again, the first x.

130
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:54,045
Which is 4, minus the
second x, which is that 1.

131
00:06:54,045 --> 00:07:00,230
And this equals 3
minus 2, is 1.

132
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,620
And 4 minus 1 is 3.

133
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,540
So the slope in this
example is 1/3.

134
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,860
And we could have actually
switched it around.

135
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,440
We could have also
done it other way.

136
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:22,380
We could have said, 2
minus 3 over 1 minus 4.

137
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,820
In which case we would
have gotten negative

138
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,800
1 over negative 3.

139
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,170
Well, that just
equals 1/3 again.

140
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,750
Because the negatives
cancel out.

141
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,660
So I'll let you think about
why this and this come

142
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,110
out to the same thing.

143
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,810
But the important thing to
realize is, if we use the 3

144
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,290
first, if we use the 3 first
for the y, we also have to

145
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,320
use the 4 first for the x.

146
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,550
That's a common mistake.

147
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,810
And also, you always have to be
very careful with the negative

148
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,240
signs when you do these
type of problems.

149
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,240
But I think that will give you
at least enough of a sense that

150
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,740
you could start the
slope problems.

151
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,450
The next module, I'll actually
show you how to figure

152
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,380
out the y intercept.

153
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,250
Because, as we said, before
the equation of any line is,

154
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,880
y is equal to m x plus b.

155
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,680
And I'm going to go
into some more detail.

156
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,280
Where m is the slope.

157
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,310
So if you know the
slope of a line.

158
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,403
And you know the y intercept of
a line, you know everything you

159
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,350
need to know about the line,
and you can actually write down

160
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,180
the equation of a line, and
figure out other points

161
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,990
that are on it.

162
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,400
So I'm going to do that
in future modules.

163
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,660
I hope I haven't
confused you too much.

164
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,620
And try some of those
the slope modules.

165
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,410
You should be able to do them.

166
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,710
And I hope you have fun.

167
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,585
