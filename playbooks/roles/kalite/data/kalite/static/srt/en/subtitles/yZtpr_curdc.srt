1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,210
We're on problem 42.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,430
And they've drawn this little,looks like a pie graph.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,220
And they say,in the circular region with center o

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,550
shown above,the two unshaded sections constitute 3/7

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,360
and 1/3 of the area of the circular region. Fair enough.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,870
The shaded section constitutes what fractional part of

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,270
the area of the circular region?

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,080
So the shaded section is just the whole area

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,090
minus these two fractions,right?

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,370
So if you said what fraction of the whole area is

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,750
the whole area,you would say that's 1.

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,360
And you would subtract out these two areas

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,240
to get the shaded area.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:41,680
So 1 minus 3/7 minus 1/3 is equal to the fraction of

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,880
the totally area that this shaded area is.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,350
And let's just add or subtract those fractions.

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,530
The least common multiple is 21.1 is the same thing as 21/21.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,930
Minus 3/7.Let's see,7 goes into 21 3 times.So 3 times 3 is 9.

19
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,730
So this is the same thing as minus 9 over 21.

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,290
And minus 1/3 is the same thing as minus 7 over 21.

21
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:11,400
So this is equal to 21 minus 16 over 21.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,990
And that's 5/21,which is choice D. Next question.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,600
0.3. [SNEEZES] Excuse me. My apologies.

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,920
0.3 to the 5th over 0.3 to the 3rd.

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,740
Well,anything to the 5th divided by anything to the 3rd,

26
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,460
you could essentially say divide the top and the bottom

27
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,500
by 0.3 squared. Well,actually,

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,560
you could divide the top and the bottom by 0.3 cubed.

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,480
You could say this is the same thing as 0.3 to the 5th times

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,960
0.3 to the minus third.That's just another way of doing this.

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,030
And so if you're dividing these two numbers,

32
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,000
you would subtract the exponents. But now we're multiplying.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,940
We're adding the exponents.

34
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,120
But either way,it becomes 0.3 squared.

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,160
And that is equal to 3 times 3,which is 9.

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,870
And you're going to have two numbers

37
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,280
behind the decimal points,right? 0.3 times 0.3.

38
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,570
Two numbers behind the decimal points. 1,2.

39
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,600
So two numbers behind the decimal point. So 0.09.

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,810
Or another way of saying it is 30% of 0.3 is 0.09.

41
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:38,530
And that is choice C. 44. In a horticultural experiment--

42
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,760
this is sounding interesting already--

43
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,980
200 seeds were planted in plot 1. So plot 1 got 200 seeds.

44
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:59,510
And 300 were planted in plot 2. So plot 2 got 300 seeds.

45
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:13,400
If 57% of the seeds in plot 1 germinated,and 42% of the seeds

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,340
in plot 2 germinated,what percentage of the total number of

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,660
planted seeds germinated?

48
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,470
So the total number of planted,what percent?

49
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,980
So how many total seeds germinated is going to be

50
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,620
200 times 0.57. That's how many in plot 1 germinated.

51
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,540
Plus 300 times 42%,or 0.42.

52
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,030
That's how many in plot 2 germinated.

53
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:49,750
All of that divided by 500. Right? And how do I know 500?

54
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,200
Because there were a total of 500 seeds.

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,020
So just to simplify the math,we could just divide everything

56
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,220
by 100, right from the get go.

57
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,870
So if you divide the bottom by 100 and the top by 100,

58
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,080
you have to do both terms by 100.

59
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,960
So you get 2 times 0.57 plus 3 times 0.42 divided by 5.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,360
2 times 0.57. That is what?

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:22,900
Let's see,this is 1.14 plus 1.26. Is that right?

62
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,630
3 times 4 is 12. 3 times 2 is 6. Right? 1.26.

63
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,900
All of that over 5. This becomes what?

64
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:44,160
This is equal to 2.4 divided by 5. And so 5 goes into 2.4.

65
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:52,190
Let's see,goes into 4,4 times 5 is 20. 48. So 0.48.

66
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,270
So the answer is 48% or 100 times 0.48. And that's choice C.

67
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,440
Question 45. Let's switch to a more interesting color.

68
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,950
3 and 8 are the lengths of two sides of a triangular region.

69
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,420
Which of the following can be the length of the third side?

70
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,840
OK. So let's think about it a little bit.

71
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,600
3 and 8 are the lengths of two sides of a triangular region.

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,020
Let me write their choices down. Choice one is 5.

73
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:29,810
I can easily imagine a triangle that has sides 3,8,and 5.

74
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,640
That seems completely reasonable. I'm just experimenting.

75
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,530
I don't know where this is going. 8.

76
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,280
Well,sure,that's just an isosceles triangle.

77
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,220
You can easily have a triangle that has 8,8,and 3.

78
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,490
Choice three. 11. Now,this is interesting.

79
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,530
Let me ask you a question.

80
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,980
Can I have a triangle that looks like this?

81
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,450
11 and then 3 and then 8. Is this possible?

82
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,230
Well,no,because 3 plus 8 is 11.

83
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,380
So the only way you're going to get 11 is

84
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,310
if you push this side all the way flat.

85
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,810
That's the only way you're going to get the length of

86
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,890
this third side to be 11. In fact,

87
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,780
11 is the upper bound on what this third side could be.

88
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,080
Because imagine this.

89
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,300
Imagine if I made the triangle really flat,

90
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,420
I made this angle right here really wide,

91
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,040
as close to 180 as I can. And I make it really flat.

92
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,180
Right? If this length plus this length,

93
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,800
or this length plus this length is equal to 11,

94
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,990
this length is going to be shorter than it.

95
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,320
This length right here has to be shorter than this length

96
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,570
plus this length,right?

97
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,590
Because it's kind of a straight-line distance between

98
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,550
this point and this point. So 11 is the upper bound,right?

99
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,860
The only way to get 11 is if you completely flatten out

100
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,910
this triangle,at which point that's not a triangle anymore.

101
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,100
It'll be a line. So it can't be choice three.

102
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,200
So the only possibility.

103
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,940
They say,which of the following can be the length of

104
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,500
the third side? So it's only choices one and two.

105
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:04,670
And that is choice C. Next problem. 46.

106
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,340
How many integers n are there such that 1 is less than

107
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:22,950
5n plus 5,which is less than 25? OK.

108
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:28,670
So they say how many integers n are there so that 5n plus 5.

109
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,220
So they didn't say positive integers,right?

110
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,000
So that's an interesting thing to keep in mind.

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,790
So let's just try to simplify this a little bit.

112
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:40,130
Let's subtract 5 from all sides of this double inequality.

113
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,130
So if you subtract 5 from everything you get minus 4 is

114
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:50,970
less than 5n,which is less than 20. Right?

115
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,150
So another way you could say it,is let's just divide

116
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,440
everything by 5.

117
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,050
So because 5 is positive you don't have to change

118
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,520
the inequalities.

119
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,960
So you get minus 4/5 is less than n,which is less than 20

120
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,810
divided by 5,is 4. So now the question becomes a lot simpler.

121
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,110
How many integers n are there such that this?

122
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,580
How many integers are there between minus 4/5 and 4?

123
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,690
And it's not equal to any of those. So 0 is an integer.

124
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,260
1,2,and 3. So there are 4 integers. So that is B.

125
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,190
OK,next problem. 47.

126
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:49,580
A car dealer sold x used cars and y new cars during May.

127
00:08:49,580 --> 00:09:00,070
So number used is equal to x. Number new is equal to y.

128
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,620
During May.

129
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,060
If the number of used cars sold was 10 greater than the

130
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,480
number new cars,

131
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,860
which of the following expresses this relationship?

132
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,250
So the number of used cars,x,was 10 greater than the number

133
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,100
of new cars.

134
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,430
So it's 10 greater than y,so it equals y plus 10,right?

135
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,800
This says that the number of used cars is 10 more than

136
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,080
the number of new cars.

137
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,540
So we just have to look for that.x is equal to y plus 10.

138
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,420
That's choice D.

139
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,010
I think we have time for one more. 48.

140
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,070
If a 10% deposit that has been paid toward the purchase of

141
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,930
a certain product is $110,

142
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,170
how much more remains on the product?

143
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,050
So essentially they're saying,110 is 10% of what number?

144
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,160
That's the first thing you have to say.

145
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:08,120
So 110 is equal to 0.1 times what number?So that's the price.

146
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,220
Let's call that the original price of the product.

147
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,860
So the original price of the product is going to be what?

148
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,660
It's going to be 110 divided by 0.1,

149
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:23,590
which is just this times 10. Which is 1,100,right?

150
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,900
Just add a 0.

151
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,740
So that's original purchase price of the product.

152
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,180
The deposit is $110 and they want to know

153
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,010
what do you have left.

154
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,180
So you're going to put $110 deposit on it.

155
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,080
This was the original purchase price. You put $110 deposit.

156
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,580
Let's see,1,100 minus 100 would be 1,000,

157
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,380
but then we have another 10. So it would be 990.

158
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,490
So that is choice B. And you could do it the other way.

159
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,060
You could just do a little bit of borrowing.

160
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,020
Anyway,you get the idea.

161
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,790
And you would get choice B,which is 990.

162
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,650
And I'm out of time. See you in the next video.
