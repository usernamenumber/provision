1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Between the ancient Roman world and the modern world

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and between the ancient roman emperors and napoleon

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the was only one ruler

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that controlled most of western europe

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the person that you're referring to is

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Charlemagne,

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or Charles the Great, or Carolus Magnus

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so few fragments of information

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this was so long ago

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
9th century

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is a really long time

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
On christmas day, in the year 800 exactly

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Charlemagne was crowned Emperor by the Pope in Rome

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a huge deal.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Roman emperors in ancient world had ruled from Rome

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
until Constantine moved the empire to Constantinople

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where is now his temple.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so the center of power had shifted to the east.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now in 800, 500 years after constantine

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have an emperor in the west

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there's still an emperor in the east

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who still had more authority that

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
people still looked into the emperor in the east

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the byzantine empire

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets think about what happened in western europe

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that allowed Charlemagne to become the new emperor

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well the first thing important to understand

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the western roman empire basically fell apart

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we see specially in a few centuries

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the dissolution of the

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
institution of the roman empire

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the idea of the roman empire hangs on

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but its ability to govern comes apart

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to understand what happend to roman empire in the west

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you have to recognize the pressure

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from serious invasions from people

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the Romans thought of as barbarians
