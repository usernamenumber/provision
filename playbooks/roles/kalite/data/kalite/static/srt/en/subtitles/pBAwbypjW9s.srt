1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
   

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,820
In the last few videos, I showed
you amines, and, in

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,076
particular, it was ethylamine,
involved in Sn2 reactions.

4
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:10,110
But what I want to show you in
this video, it doesn't always

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,080
have to be an Sn2 reaction.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,390
In fact, in this video, we'll
look at an Sn1 reaction.

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,090
So let's say I had
some methylamine.

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,220
So let's say it looks
like this.

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,790
So this is our methyl group
bonded to a nitrogen, which is

10
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,542
bonded to two hydrogens,
just like that, and it

11
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:29,710
has its lone pair.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:36,150
So this is methylamine
right there.

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,970
And let's say it's in solution
with something

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,850
that looks like this.

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:48,380
Let's say we have something
that looks like this.

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,080
So then we have a bromo group.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,900
Now, there's a couple of
different ways that you can

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,040
name this, but maybe the
simplest way, you find the

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,410
longest chain here.

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,493
It has one, two, three carbons,
so that is a propane.

21
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:10,410
   

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,670
And then on the two carbon,
regardless of whether you

23
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,180
start counting from here or
there, so this is one, two,

24
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,720
three, on the two carbon, you
have a bromo group and you

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,910
have a methyl group
right there.

26
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,520
So this would be 2-bromo.

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,850
You want to write it in
alphabetical order.

28
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,100
2-bromo-2-methylpropane.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,320
   

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,120
What we care about is what
would happen over here?

31
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,090
Now, over here, you have a
situation where you have a

32
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,050
carbon right here attached
to the bromine.

33
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,450
And if your brain is really in
Sn2 mode, you might say, hey,

34
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,460
maybe these electrons attack
this carbon and then this

35
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,360
electron that's with the carbon
right now gets taken by

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,190
the bromine.

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,310
But if you really think about
what are the conditions for an

38
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,550
Sn2, you'll probably remember
that this won't happen because

39
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,590
it's sterically hindered.

40
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,460
You have these three
other carbons here.

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,830
And actually, these are not just
carbons, these are CH3's.

42
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,100
The hydrogens aren't
even drawn.

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,040
But this is a CH3 here.

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,930
This is a CH3 over here.

45
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,750
This is a CH3.

46
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,110
These things are going to block
the nucleophile's access

47
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,770
to this carbon, so you're
not going to see an

48
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,690
Sn2 reaction here.

49
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,550
But what you can see is, because
this guy is a tertiary

50
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,960
carbon, he is bonded to three
other carbons, it would

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,180
actually be a fairly
stable carbocation.

52
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,120
So what you could see in step
one of this reaction is just

53
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,890
the bromine leaves.

54
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,730
So if you have just the bromine
leaves, then our

55
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,580
situation looks like this.

56
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,800
You have a tertiary
carbocation.

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,880
This electron leaves, so it
now has a positive charge

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,450
right over there.

59
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,190
That's why it's a
carbocation now.

60
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,210
And now the bromine has
taken an electron.

61
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,550
It already had one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven

62
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,530
valence electrons.

63
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,070
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

64
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,580
And it just took one more
electron from that carbon.

65
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,610
   

66
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,275
It now has a negative charge.

67
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:19,570
It's now a bromide anion.

68
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:25,670
But now that the bromine has
left, now the methylamine can

69
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,970
get involved.

70
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,220
This would be methylamine
right over here.

71
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,740
So now this, as we learned in
the previous video, has a

72
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,680
partial negative charge, has
these extra electrons, it will

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,165
be attracted to this
carbocation.

74
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:41,640
So let me draw the
methylamine.

75
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,610
So you have the nitrogen,
hydrogen, hydrogen bonded to a

76
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,960
methyl group right like that.

77
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,410
And in an Sn1 reaction,
that's what this is.

78
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,310
Remember, the rate-determining
step right here only involves

79
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,280
one of the reactants.

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,190
That's where the number
one comes from.

81
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:05,010
In an Sn1 reaction like this,
the nucleophile could attack

82
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,320
from either side.

83
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,450
This no longer is a
tetrahedral shape.

84
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,980
It's now a triangular planar
shape, so it could go in from

85
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,340
this direction or from
that direction.

86
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,520
So, in this case, well,
I'm just going to

87
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,050
draw it in this direction.

88
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:22,180
So this nucleophile can give
this electron right here to

89
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,640
the carbocation, in which case,
we will end up with

90
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,930
something that looks
like this.

91
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,190
We have our nitrogen.

92
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,580
It has bonded to two hydrogens
over there.

93
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,460
It has a methyl group,
just like that.

94
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,760
It has this electron
over here.

95
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,630
Now, this magenta electron has
been given to this carbon over

96
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,270
there, and then that carbon is
bonded to three other carbons:

97
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,860
one, two, three.

98
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,280
And so, just like that,
we have created--

99
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,040
oh, we have to remember.

100
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,600
We've given away an electron
to this carbocation.

101
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,930
The carbocation is
now neutral.

102
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,025
It gained an electron.

103
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:02,460
Let me write the the
carbon right there.

104
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,240
But since the nitrogen gave away
an electron, it now has a

105
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,150
positive charge.

106
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,200
So what will we call this
molecule right over here?

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,950
Now, this is a little
bit tricky.

108
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,720
So you have a methyl
group over here.

109
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,830
Well, this is no longer amine.

110
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,400
It's an ammonium because it
has this positive charge.

111
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,320
We have four bonds
on the nitrogen.

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,260
So we could call this
right here N-methyl.

113
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,940
   

114
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,020
That tells us that the methyl
is bonded to the nitrogen.

115
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,340
It's not bonded to the
other carbon chain.

116
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,570
N-methyl.

117
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,620
And then this right here, these
four carbons, one, two,

118
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,625
three, four, this you could view
as a tert-butyl group.

119
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,100
There's other ways to
name it, but that's

120
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,840
the most common one.

121
00:05:50,840 --> 00:06:01,220
So it's N-methyl-tert-butyl
ammonium.

122
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,960
Remember, we have that positive
charge there.

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,420
   

124
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,900
And as we saw in the previous
video, this isn't ammonium

125
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,660
right now, but you had some of
your original methylamine

126
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,910
floating around.

127
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,520
   

128
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,730
If you have some of your
original methylamine floating

129
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,360
around, and this could in
theory, or it can in practice

130
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,910
even, nab away one of these
hydrogens, or at least the

131
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,680
proton part.

132
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,430
So it gives its electron to that
hydrogen, and then the

133
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,620
hydrogen's electron gets taken
back by what was an ammonium.

134
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,710
And then if you have
that-- and this is

135
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,770
a reversible reaction.

136
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,060
It can go in either direction.

137
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,370
This methylamine is now
methyl ammonium.

138
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,850
So it now looks like this.

139
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,430
It now has three hydrogens on
it because this guy bonded

140
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,400
with that hydrogen.

141
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,220
It now has three hydrogens, so
this is methyl ammonium.

142
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,460
And then this thing over here
will now look like this.

143
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,720
It lost a hydrogen.

144
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,330
So you have a methyl group
bonded to an N, bonded to an

145
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,530
H, which is then bonded
to a tert-butyl group.

146
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,720
   

147
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,400
So now this has become,
as I just said,

148
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,430
this is methyl ammonium.

149
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,395
But this over here
is N-methyl.

150
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:22,010
   

151
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,010
Once again, the N tells us
that this methyl group is

152
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,815
bonded to the nitrogen.

153
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:33,700
N-methyl-tert-, and now instead
of calling it butyl

154
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,120
ammonium, and actually we didn't
have to have this dash

155
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,940
over here; this is
butyl ammonium.

156
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,650
It's now butylamine, tert-butyl,
and then obviously

157
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,410
because we have that nitrogen
there, butylamine.

158
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,950
Anyway, I just wanted to show
you that, that the mechanisms

159
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,420
or the reactions I showed in
the last video, they're not

160
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,350
the only type of things
that can occur.

161
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,790
You can also have Sn1.

162
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:02,090
And, in general, it can
act as a weak base.

163
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,030
It's definitely not
a strong base.

164
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,750
But it's the most basic of all
of the neutral functional

165
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,350
groups, which I've said
over and over again.

166
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,010
So there's many different
types of reactions.

167
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,350
I've just tried to give
you a sample of a few.

168
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:14,599
