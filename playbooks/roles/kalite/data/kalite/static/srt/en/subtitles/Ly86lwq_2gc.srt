1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,440
What I wanna do in this video is

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,980
See if we can identify similar triangles here

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,640
And prove to ourselves that they really are similar

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,830
Using some of the postulates that we've set up

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,090
So over here I have triangle B, D, C it's inside of triangle A, E, C

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,270
They both share this angle right over there

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,470
So that gives us one angle

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,140
We need two to angle -angle which gives us similarity

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,420
And we know that these two lines are parallel

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,610
And we know if two lines are parallel we have transversal

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,120
That corresponding angles are gonna be congruent

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,950
So that angle is gonna correspond to that angle right over there

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,000
And we're done

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,020
We have one angle and triangle A, E, C that is congruent

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,320
to another angle in B, D, C

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,050
and then we have this angle that is obviously congruent to itself,

17
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,380
That's in both triangles

18
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,510
So both triangles have a pair of corresponding angles

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,610
that are congruent, So they must be similar

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,780
So we can write triangle A, C, E

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,640
A, C, E is gonna be similar triangle

22
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,640
We wanna get the letters in the right order

23
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,620
So where the blue angle is here, the blue angle there is vertex B

24
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,450
We're gonna go to the white angles C

25
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,710
and then we go to the unlabeled angle right over there B, C, D

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,610
B, C, D

27
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,960
So we did that first one

28
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,310
Now let's do this one right over here

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,560
This is kinda similar

30
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,930
but at least it looks just superficial looking at it

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,040
YZ is definitely not parallel to ST

32
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,720
So we won't be able to do this corresponding angle argument

33
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,420
Alright, especially cuz I didn't even labelled this parallel

34
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,430
And so you wanna, you don't wanna look at things

35
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,710
just by the way they look

36
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,000
You definitely want to say what am I given and what am I not given

37
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,290
These weren't labelled parallel,

38
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,820
we wouldn't be able to make this statement

39
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,520
Even though if they look parallel

40
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,150
One thing we do have is that we have this angle right here,

41
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,760
This common to the inner triangle and to the outer triangle

42
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,580
And then given us a bunch of sides

43
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,740
So maybe we could use SAS for similarity

44
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,400
Meaning if we can show the ratio of the sides

45
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,090
on either sides of this angle,

46
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,020
And they have the same ratio from the smaller triangle

47
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,140
to the larger triangle

48
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,100
Then we can show similarity

49
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,010
So let's go, we have to go on either side of this angle

50
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,670
right over here

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,090
Let's look at shorter side on on either side of this angle

52
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,400
So the shorter is 2, and let's look at the shorter side

53
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,860
on other side of the angle for the larger triangle

54
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,860
Well then the shorter side is on the right hand side

55
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,660
And that's gonna have, that's gonna be xt

56
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,010
So we wanna compare is the ratio between, right this way,

57
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:30,350
We wanna see is xy/ xt, over xt is that equal to the ratio

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,530
of the longer side Or if we're looking relative to this angle,

59
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,080
the longer of the two

60
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,770
I'm sorry the longest of the triangle,

61
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,240
though it looks like that as well

62
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,000
Is that equal to the ratio of xz,

63
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,690
xz over the longer of the two sides,

64
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,200
When you're looking at this angle right here

65
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,330
on either side of that angle

66
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,530
for the larger triangle over xs, over xs

67
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,870
And it's a little confusing cuz we've kinda flip with side

68
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,010
But I'm just thinking about the shorter side

69
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,680
on either side of this angle and between,

70
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,290
and then the longer side of either side of this angle

71
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,470
So these are the shorter side for the smaller triangle

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,680
and the larger triangle

73
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,950
These are the longer sides for the smaller triangle

74
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,290
and the larger triangle

75
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,990
And we see xy this is 2

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:24,360
Xt is 3 +1 is 4, xz is 3, xz is 3 and xs is 6

77
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,280
So you have 2/4 which is ? which is the same thing as 3/6

78
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,940
So the ration between the shorter sides on either side of the angle

79
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,150
And the longer side on either sides of the angle for both triangles

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,090
The ratio is the same, so by SAS we know,

81
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,840
so by SAS we know that the 2 triangles are congruent

82
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,960
But we have to be careful on how we state the triangles

83
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,950
We wanna make sure we get the corresponding sides

84
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,890
So we could say that triangle, and I'm running out of space here

85
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,600
Let me write it write above here

86
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:04,090
We can write the triangle xyz, xyz is similar, is similar to triangle

87
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,300
So we started up at x which is the vertex of the angle

88
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,640
And we went to the shorter side first

89
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,690
So now we want to start at x and go to shorter side of large triangle

90
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:19,380
So x, so you go to xts, xts

91
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,330
Xyz is similar to xts

92
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,370
Now let's look at this over here,

93
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,780
so in our larger triangle we have a right angle here

94
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,040
But we really know nothing, we really know nothing about

95
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,170
What's going on with any of these smaller triangles

96
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,770
in terms of their actual angles

97
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,030
You know this looks like a right angle

98
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
We cannot assume it

99
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,350
And it shares, if we look at this smaller triangle right over here

100
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
It shares one side with the larger triangle,

101
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,890
Well that's not enough to do anything

102
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,980
And then this triangle over here also shares another side,

103
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,630
But that also doesn't do anything

104
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,240
So we really can't make any statement here

105
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,860
About any kind of similarities

106
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,710
So there's no similarity going on here

107
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,290
If they, if they gave us, if they gave us,

108
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,380
And well there are some, there are some shared angles

109
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,470
This guy they both share that angle

110
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,880
the larger triangles, small triangle

111
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,620
So there could be a statement of similarity we can make

112
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,500
If we knew that this definitely was a right angle

113
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,000
Then we can make some interesting statement about similarity

114
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,410
But right now we can't really do, we can't do anything as is

115
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,980
Let's try this one out or this pair right over here

116
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,400
So this the first ones that we've actually separated out the triangles

117
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,010
So they've given us the 3 sides of both triangles,

118
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,940
So let's just figure out the ratios

119
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,410
between corresponding sides are a constant

120
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,730
So let's start with the short side

121
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,370
So the short side here is 3, shorter side is here is 9,

122
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,040
So we have, wanna see whether this the ratio of 3 to 9 is equal to

123
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:47,360
The next longest side over here is 3, is equal to 3 over

124
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:53,130
the next longest side over here which is 27, which is 27

125
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,520
And then if that's gonna be equal to,

126
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,360
if that's gonna be equal to the ratio of the longest side

127
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,620
So the longest side here is 6, 6

128
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,160
and then the longest side over here is 18, 18

129
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,480
So this is going to give us, let's see this is 3

130
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,490
This is 8, let me do this in a neutral color

131
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,430
So 3, we could this becomes 1/3

132
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:28,390
This becomes which seems like a different number

133
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,190
But we wanna be careful here

134
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,060
And this right over here this becomes,

135
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,900
this is a if you divide the numerator and denominator by 6

136
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,980
this becomes a 1 and this becomes 3

137
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:48,660
So you get 1 , 1/3 is to be equal to 1, needs to be equal of /9

138
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:53,300
which needs to be equal to 1/3

139
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,890
At first they don't look equal

140
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,460
But we can actually rationalize this denominator right over here

141
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:04,130
We show that 1/ 3 if you multiply it by a /,

142
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,170
This actually gives you a numerator of / 9

143
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,490
is 3 times 3 is 9

144
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
So these actually are all the same

145
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,120
This is actually saying this is 1/ 3 root 3

146
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,050
which is the same thing as

147
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,580
Which is this right over here which is the same thing as 1 /

148
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,270
So actually these are similar triangles

149
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,640
So we actually say it and I'll make sure I get the order right

150
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,050
So let's start with E which is between

151
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,300
the blue and the magenta side

152
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,320
So that's between the blue and the magenta side that is H,

153
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,650
right over here

154
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,170
So triangle E, I'll do it like this,

155
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,810
triangle E and then I'll go along the blue side F

156
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,240
Then I go over along, along the blue side over here side

157
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,530
Let me do it this way

158
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,240
Actually let me just write it this way

159
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,390
E triangle E, F, G we know is similar to triangle

160
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,060
So E is between the blue and magenta side,

161
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,330
blue and magenta side that is H

162
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,590
And then we go along the blue side to F

163
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,910
Go along the blue side to I

164
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,080
And then we're go along the orange side to G

165
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,980
Then you go along the orange to J

166
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,360
So triangle E,F,J is, E,F,G is similar to triangle H,I,J

167
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,910
by side, side, side similarity

168
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,020
They're not congruent sides

169
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,870
They all have just the same ratio or the same scaling factor

170
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,300
Now let's do this last one right over here

171
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,290
So we have, let's see, we have an angle

172
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,630
that's congruent to another angle right over here

173
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
And we have 2 sides,

174
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,290
and so it might be attempting to use side angle side

175
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,460
Because we have side angle side here

176
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,500
And even the ratio's looks kind of tempting

177
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,300
Because 4 times 2 is 8, 5 times 2 is 10,

178
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,850
But it's tricky here because they aren't the same

179
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,660
corresponding sides

180
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,020
In order to use side angle side,

181
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,900
the 2 sides that have the same corresponding ratios

182
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,930
That could be on either side of the angle

183
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,340
So in this case they are aren't on either of the angle

184
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,530
In this case the 4's on one side of the angle

185
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,640
but the 5 is not, the 5 is not

186
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,020
So because if this 5 was over here,

187
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,100
if it was over here then we could make it an argument for similarity

188
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,440
But this 5 not being on the other side of the angle

189
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,390
is not sandwiching the angle with the 4

190
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,060
We can't use side angle side

191
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,890
and frankly there's nothing that we can do over here

192
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,140
So we can't make some strong statement

193
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,020
about similarity for this last one
