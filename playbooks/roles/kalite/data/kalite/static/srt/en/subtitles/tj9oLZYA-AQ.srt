1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
   

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,300
Shelagh and Luana realize that
they could express their ages

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,420
more specifically if they
used fractions.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,080
Doing this will allow them to
calculate the difference in

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,270
their ages more precisely.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,650
If Shelagh describes her age
as 15 and 1/2 years old and

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,580
Luana is 7 and 7/12-- I'm
assuming years old-- what is

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,060
the difference in their ages?

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,320
Write the answer as a simplified
mixed number.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,945
So Shelagh is older, so she's
15 and 1/2 years old, so we

11
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:36,560
literally want to find the
difference between 15 and 1/2

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,950
and 7 and 7/12.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,870
Now we can see immediately-- or
maybe it's not obvious to

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,210
you, but 1/2 is the same
thing is 6/12, which

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,920
is a less than 7/12.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,060
So if we separated out the whole
number parts and the

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,810
fraction parts, this fraction
is actually smaller.

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,620
The 1/2 is smaller than the
7/12, so it might be easier to

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,240
just do this as mixed numbers so
we don't have to do all of

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,080
that borrowing and regrouping.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,860
So let's write both of them
as mixed numbers.

22
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,680
So we have 1 and 1/2.

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,820
We're still going to-- sorry,
let's write both of them as

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,650
improper fractions, so we're
going to keep 2 in the

25
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,000
denominator.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,560
And as an improper fraction, 2
times 15 is 30 plus 1 is 31.

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,370
So 31/2 the same thing as
15 and 1/2, so these are

28
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,250
equivalent.

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,310
And then 7 and 7/12, if we
write it as an improper

30
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,630
fraction, so we're still going
to have the minus sign out

31
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,360
there, the denominator is 12.

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,680
12 times 7 is 84.

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,540
84 plus 7 is 91.

34
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,170
It is 91.

35
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,540
Did I do that right?

36
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,510
91.

37
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,010
Yep, that looks right.

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,520
91/12.

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,690
Now, we've written both of them
as improper fractions,

40
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,410
but we still have different
denominators, so we have to

41
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,620
have a common denominator.

42
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,890
So what is the least common
multiple of 2 and 12, or

43
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,060
what's the smallest
number that's

44
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,740
divisible by both of them?

45
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,850
Well, 12 is divisible by 12, and
12 is also divisible by 2,

46
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,180
so 12 is the least
common multiple.

47
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,000
So we want both of them
to be over 12.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,500
And this fraction already is
over 12 so we don't have to

49
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,810
change it: 91/12.

50
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,060
Now, on the blue one, to
go from 2 to 12 in the

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,720
denominator, we have to multiply
by 6, so we also have

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,385
to multiply by 6 in
the numerator.

53
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:39,320
So if we multiply 31 by
6, what do we get?

54
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,860
You can even do this
in your head.

55
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:50,360
6 times 30 is 180, 6 times 1 is
6, so it's going to be 186.

56
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,880
And now we subtract.

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,300
So the difference in their
ages is going to be-- the

58
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,900
denominator is going to be 12.

59
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,010
It's going to be 186 minus 91,
which is equal to-- over 12.

60
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:10,090
Let's see, 186 minus just 90
would be 96, but we're

61
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,140
subtracting 91, so it's
going to be 95.

62
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,590
95, right?

63
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,750
6 minus 1 is 5, and then
180 minus 90 is 90,

64
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,390
so that works out.

65
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,090
So the way we've expressed it
right now, it isn't is an

66
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,460
improper fraction, but they
want us to write it as a

67
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,520
simplified mixed number,
so let's do that.

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,120
So how many times does
12 go into 95?

69
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,190
Let's see, 8 times 12 is 96, so
that's too big, so 12 goes

70
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,830
seven times.

71
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,210
So this is equal to 7.

72
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,170
And if we take-- well,
let me write it out.

73
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,830
We don't want to do too
much in our head.

74
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,360
If we go 12 into 95, I'm saying
it goes seven times.

75
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,340
So if that's true, if that's the
largest number, then the

76
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,460
remainder should be
less than 12.

77
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:07,090
7 times 12 we know is 84 from
our times tables, or you could

78
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,060
just think it's going to be 14
plus 10 times 7, which is 70.

79
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,720
Either way.

80
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,360
And let's see, 95 minus 84: 5
minus 4 is 1, 9 minus 8 is 1,

81
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,310
so we have a remainder of 11.

82
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,779
So 12 goes into 95
seven times.

83
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,180
You get 7 wholes and you
have 11 left over.

84
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,840
So 95/12 is 7 and 11/12.

85
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,890
And we're done!

86
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,410
The difference between Shelagh
and Luana's age is 7 and

87
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,310
11/12, or Shelagh is 7 and 11/12
years older than Luana.

88
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,534
