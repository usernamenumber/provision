1
00:00:00,258 --> 00:00:04,793
What I want to do in this video is compare investment to consumption

2
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:06,942
and we're going to think about it in two contexts.

3
00:00:06,942 --> 00:00:09,025
One I would call the everyday conventional context

4
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:13,692
and the other one would be how we think about in an economics context

5
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:18,575
because these words mean something very particular to an economist

6
00:00:18,575 --> 00:00:21,149
and it's important that it means something particular

7
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:24,509
because we're going to start using these words or this terminology or this classification

8
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:27,574
to understand where GDP is coming from.

9
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:34,758
So every day, so let me draw a line over here, this is going to be, this is kind of every day

10
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:41,159
or conversational versions of this term, and down here we'll put the economics

11
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:49,383
the economic versions of these terms, especially when we think of it in the context of accounting for GDP

12
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:53,692
and there not necessarily all different, but they are different in important ways

13
00:00:53,692 --> 00:01:00,880
so an investment, really in both cases, you can generally view it as something that you do to get some future gain

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,509
so for example, if I today, build a house, so I build a house

15
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:10,141
So that is the house I build today and that will be the time line

16
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:13,225
the house will keep lasting and it's an investment because it's going to be giving me future gain

17
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:18,925
a year from now, I'll still be able to live in this house, so I will be able to have the same rent, which is a future gain

18
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:22,774
Future gain two years from now -- it'll keep giving some kind of gain.

19
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:26,775
You could have a financial instrument, maybe some kind of debt instrument

20
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:30,758
you're lending money to someone else, so maybe, maybe you buy a bond,

21
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,108
which is essentially you lending money to someone else.

22
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:37,259
That is an investment, because in the everyday sense of it,

23
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:44,692
because when you make, when you have that asset, it's going to pay off something in the future

24
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:47,975
it's going to pay off some interest or some profit

25
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:52,275
and in the everyday sense, I would consider something like, hopefully it would be

26
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:54,158
going to college, would be an investment.

27
00:01:54,158 --> 00:02:00,875
so education, so I'll say education. So if you invest time and money into education,

28
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,509
it's going to keep paying off.

29
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,159
hopefully by doing that, you're going to get better employment and higher wages.

30
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,376
the rest of your life. It will keep paying off.

31
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:11,492
So this is the everyday notion of investment.

32
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:14,842
The everyday notion of consumption, the way I think about it is,

33
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:18,744
you are buying something or you are doing something that you're just going to use

34
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:25,460
up in the short term, and just by using it up, whatever that object is, if you just use it up,

35
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:32,841
and it's just going to hopefully benefit you in some way, but it's more of a short term thing,

36
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:36,393
I would consider that consumption in the everyday sense.

37
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:39,609
So if you go buy a candy bar and eat it, you have consumed the candy bar.

38
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:47,160
You have not made an investment. If you go to a movie, that is consumption.

39
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,110
And I'm not making any value judgment that one is better than the other.

40
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,492
Investment, at the end of the day, you are investing so that you can get future benefit

41
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:59,460
that could lead to consumption, because at the end of the day, consumption is one of the things

42
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,342
that might make your life a little bit better off. So I'm not saying that one is better than the other.

43
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:10,091
But watching a movie, that would also be consumption. Spending time buying a book, well you could debate

44
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:15,142
if that's education or not, but let's say you buy a book that is not educational

45
00:03:15,142 --> 00:03:20,825
that is consumption. but it is making you happier. Hopefully it's making your life better in some way

46
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:24,992
Now, the economic definitions are related to these everyday definitions

47
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:28,642
but they're a little bit more precise. And they make the definitions in a way

48
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:33,492
that they're easier to account for if you are a nation. They're easier to keep track of

49
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:37,359
So the way an economist would define it,

50
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:45,168
they would define economic investment as spending on capital equiment,

51
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:48,742
capital equipment are things like if you are a factory,

52
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:53,275
you will buy the equipment to run your factory, you buy the robots, and you buy the assembly line

53
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,092
and you buy the wheel barrow and whatever else.

54
00:03:56,092 --> 00:04:01,821
the things that have to cart things around. It would be things like inventory

55
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:05,609
so for example, the inventory -- and this is still not so different --

56
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:09,258
both are being used to produce things in the future

57
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:13,908
to produce future benefit. You're buying inventory, sometimes raw material,

58
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:17,009
you're going to add value to it, and then they're going to be used to produce something

59
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:24,648
in the future. It includes things like the structures, the buildings

60
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,324
and, and so for all of this, in the economic sense, and this is why it's easier to count for

61
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:36,691
this, for the most part, is done by the firms, and it also includes the one thing that

62
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:40,794
households do, which is build -- construction of new homes.

63
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:44,293
New homes.

64
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:50,461
This is from the household. Households. Actually, the buying of a house

65
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:53,889
does not show up in consumption or investment because nothing new is produced

66
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,309
Something just changed hands. So anytime we talk about any of these things, especially

67
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:02,626
when we're talking about specific economic terms, is the production of new capital equiment,

68
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:05,892
new inventory, new structures, new homes,

69
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:09,491
if I just buy a factory from someone else, that does not add to GDP

70
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:12,960
it would not be considered investment or consumption because I'm just transferring

71
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,724
an asset from one person to another.

72
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:18,975
It would only be added to GDP when it is first created. And on the consumption side,

73
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,076
from an economic point of view -- so let me draw a little bit of a line right over here --

74
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:31,035
consumption is considered to be any spending, any spending on final goods

75
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:43,054
by households except for new homes.

76
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:45,224
So let me make this even clearer

77
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:48,559
because remember if we're just transferring goods that shouldn't count

78
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:53,441
so let me put new, newly produced goods

79
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:59,474
now what's unintuitive over here, according to the way we account for GDP

80
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:02,876
the tuition that you spend on a college education, that is new spending

81
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:10,009
on final goods, let me write final goods or services, that would be consumption

82
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,600
so education would fall here in the economic sense,

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,776
while in the everyday sense, I would consider education right over here.

84
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:21,091
Maybe you're buying a car, you're not buying a car for leisure purposes,

85
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:24,309
you're buying a car because you need your car to go to work.

86
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:28,824
There's an argument that that could be an investment in the everyday sense

87
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:34,091
by buying, by having that car, you have something that can take you to work every day

88
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:38,092
so you're getting future benefit, so there's an argument that maybe that's an investment

89
00:06:38,092 --> 00:06:40,710
in the everyday sense. But in the accounting sense,

90
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,360
that car, the car would sit right here.

91
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,658
You bought a new car, but that is considered consumption.

92
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:52,358
You did not buy a new house. And the whole reason or at least as far as I understand,

93
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:57,674
this is easier to account for. You look at all the spending by firms,

94
00:06:57,674 --> 00:07:00,891
that's easy to account for. You essentially call that investment

95
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:04,593
because at the end of the day, all the spending that the firms are making

96
00:07:04,593 --> 00:07:06,991
is they're doing to produce some good or service.

97
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:10,859
So, we call this investment any spending that the firms do and on top of that,

98
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:14,960
when households purchase new homes, we also call that investment

99
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,742
and that's just easier for the accounting offices of governments to keep track of

100
00:07:19,742 --> 00:07:22,775
and everything else that households do, we consider consumption

101
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:27,742
and we'll see in the next few videos, there are few other categories of things

102
00:07:27,742 --> 99:59:59,999
that the governments do, and then we'll have to think about imports and exports.
