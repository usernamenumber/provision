1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,170
Everything we've talked about
so far with this startup

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,800
company selling socks and all
of that, has been raising

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,710
money from an equity.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,350
We raised private money-- when
the company was private it

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,980
went to VCs and it went to angel
investors, and maybe you

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,790
could go to your friends and
family to raise money.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,500
And then the company could go
public and raise money from

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,640
the public markets.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,000
But there's actually
two ways that a

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,220
company can raise capital.

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,125
So this is why this playlist is
called capital markets, or

12
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,500
it's part of it, the name
of raise capital.

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,870
Capital is just essentially--
I mean the easy way to think

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,160
about it is you're raising cash
that you want to invest

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,240
in some way to grow your
business or to sustain your

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,820
business or start
your business.

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,610
So everything we talked about so
far was equity, and that's

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,080
essentially selling shares in
your company to raise money.

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,360
And so that's all of
those VC examples.

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,990
The equity investor-- so when
you sell equity, you're

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,070
essentially selling-- you're
kind of making that person

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,600
who's buying the stock-- you
know, an equity is the same

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,920
thing as stock-- you're making
the person who's buying a

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,960
stock kind of a partner
in the company.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,550
So if the company-- let's say
there's two situations-- if

26
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,260
the company goes bankrupt-- and
I'll talk a lot more about

27
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,080
what bankruptcy even means--
but if the company goes

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,770
bankrupt, all the shareholders
end up with nothing.

29
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,880
They end up with nil.

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,580
But if the company has a lot
of upside, the stock gets a

31
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,010
lot of upside.

32
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,610
Because they're partners
in it.

33
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,510
If this was a company, that
start-up that we talked about,

34
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,000
if it turns into Amazon.com and
becomes a billion-dollar

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,970
company, everyone is going
to do really well.

36
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,630
Everyone's going to share
in that upside.

37
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,890
But there's another way to raise
money, and actually this

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,390
is probably something that's
more familiar at

39
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,610
the household level.

40
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,680
I mean at the household level
you never raise equity.

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,860
You never say, you know what--
well you can, but you're not

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,400
going to say hey, I need to buy
a house, why don't I go to

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,890
my rich friend and offer to sell
10% of the stake in my

44
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,460
house to him and he'll be kind
of a partner in my house.

45
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,570
That could happen but for the
most part it doesn't.

46
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,360
Usually when you do something on
a personal level you raise

47
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,610
money through debt.

48
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,940
And that's interesting.

49
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,350
So what's good about debt is
it's-- so let's think about it

50
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,180
from the point of view of
the person who's lending

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,480
the money to you.

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,880
Debt is just borrowing money.

53
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,300
I think all of us know what
borrowing money is.

54
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,830
I go to my rich friend and I say
hey, could I borrow $1 and

55
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,630
I'll give you $1.25 in a year?

56
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,340
And he says, OK, you're
good for it.

57
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,290
But I'm essentially promising
I'm going to give the money

58
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,860
back at some future date.

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,060
If I sell equity, I'm not
promising anything.

60
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm like hey, I got a great
business, why don't you give

61
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,700
$1 and then you get a 20%
cut of my business.

62
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,840
If my business does awesome,
you get 20% of all of the

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,900
profits of my business.

64
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,010
If my business does horrible,
well you took a risk, you get

65
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,370
nothing and I get nothing.

66
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,310
Debt says regardless of how my
business does, if it does

67
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,160
awesome all you're going
to get is the interest.

68
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,930
That's kind of the upside.

69
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,550
So the upside's limited,
right?

70
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,060
If I borrow money at 9%
interest, all that person's

71
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,230
going to get is 9%.

72
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,230
Even if my company becomes the
next Google or Microsoft or

73
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,810
whatever else, that person's
just going to

74
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,170
get 9% on their money.

75
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,440
While this person might have
gotten a hundred times their

76
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,930
money because they made a bet.

77
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,080
On the other hand, this downside
is much lower.

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,470
So limited downside.

79
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,920
Because they're going to get
their money back at a

80
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,560
certain-- you know, there's a
certain payment schedule.

81
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,550
And they're going to get their
money back before the

82
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,740
stockholders-- so let's say
in a situation where the

83
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,180
company's going into
difficulty-- and we'll do a

84
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,130
whole playlist on bankruptcy--
the people who lend money to

85
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,030
the company will see their money
before the stockholders

86
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,150
see anything.

87
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,750
So how does all of this come
out from the balance sheet?

88
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,040
So let's say we have
a public company.

89
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,430
If you wonder what a CFO at a
company does, this is really

90
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,370
the main decision that they're
always making.

91
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,010
Do we raise money-- well, how
do we raise money if we need

92
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,890
it, and do we raise money from
the equity markets or from the

93
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,850
debt markets?

94
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,010
So let's come up with
a company again.

95
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,840
Let's say that that's
its current assets.

96
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,450
Not current-- I don't want to
say current assets, it's the

97
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,649
assets that it currently has.

98
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,470
Current assets means something
different, and we'll talk

99
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,090
about that in the future.

100
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,437
But let's say, so that's
its assets.

101
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,220
You know it might have
some cash here.

102
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,920
We'll go into more detail.

103
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,580
We'll actually look at real
company balance sheets and

104
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,150
decipher what all of the terms
on the balance sheet mean.

105
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,830
But that's its assets for now.

106
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,340
And let's say right now all of
its money it's raised so far

107
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,970
has been equity.

108
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,430
And let's say it's a publicly
listed company.

109
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,480
It doesn't have to be.

110
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:59,580
Let's say that's all of its
equity, and let's say it has,

111
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,980
I don't know, 10
million shares.

112
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,500
And the other interesting thing
about when a company's

113
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,750
public-- remember, every time
when a company was private and

114
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,330
it took an investor, when it
took equity investors, they

115
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,280
had to sit and have a
negotiation saying what is

116
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,630
this worth?

117
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,020
What are these assets worth?

118
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,470
But what's cool is, is when
you have a publicly traded

119
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,830
company, these shares are traded
on an exchange, right?

120
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,330
These shares are on, let's
say it's on the

121
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,780
New York Stock Exchange.

122
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,430
So every day you could
go to Yahoo!

123
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,060
Finance or wherever and you
can look at a chart.

124
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,000
Let me draw a chart.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,290
You can draw a chart.

126
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,150
And we've all seen stock
charts, I think.

127
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,390
So let's say that this is this
could have been its IPO date

128
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,010
or it could just be the start
that we're looking at, and

129
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,540
let's say the stock IPO went up,
and then the whole market

130
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,380
went down a little bit.

131
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,530
But the stock-- maybe
it's there, right?

132
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,660
But on any given, really almost
any given second,

133
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,750
there's a price that somebody
traded that stock at and it

134
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,790
might not be the best price,
but it is a price.

135
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,660
And we'll talk about why that
happens, because you might

136
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,280
have 10 million shares, and if
only, I don't know, 100 shares

137
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,040
get traded at any second, or
let's say only 100 shares get

138
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,870
traded in the day, is that
an indicative price?

139
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,830
Because that's not
a huge percentage

140
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,740
of all of the shares.

141
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,440
But anyway, we'll talk more
about what volume means

142
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,220
relative to the total float
and all of that.

143
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,320
But let's say at this split
second the company shares

144
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,320
traded at $15 a share.

145
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,640
This is $15, right, at
this second in time.

146
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,810
This is like right now.

147
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,720
Traded at $15 a share, and you
could look it up on your

148
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,740
Bloomberg terminal
or whatever else.

149
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,450
So essentially the market
is providing us a

150
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,180
value for this company.

151
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,400
The market is saying wow, the
market is willing to trade the

152
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,390
share at $15.

153
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,610
There was a willing buyer and
a willing seller at exactly

154
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,390
$15 a share.

155
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,450
So that means that the market at
that moment is valuing this

156
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,880
company at $15 per share times
10 million shares.

157
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:05,040
So $15 per share times 10
million shares-- not

158
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,290
necessarily a dollar sign.

159
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,090
So the market is assigning
a, 15 times 10 is 100.

160
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,560
$150 million market cap.

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,640
Market capitalization
for the company.

162
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,350
And you could look on the kind
of, I think it's the key

163
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,590
statistics tab on Yahoo!

164
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,260
Finance, and you'll see market
capitalization for a company.

165
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,200
And it's just the number
of shares times the

166
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,630
price of the shares.

167
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,380
This is essentially what
the market's value

168
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,240
of the equity is.

169
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,680
The market is saying that
this piece right here

170
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,600
is worth $150 million.

171
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,030
And since this piece is the same
size as the assets, we

172
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,190
have nothing else on the
right-hand side, the market's

173
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,020
essentially saying that the
assets right now are worth

174
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,820
$150 million.

175
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,320
And these aren't always
going to be equal.

176
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,960
We'll see probably in a few
videos when you start raising

177
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,000
debt you have to do an extra
calculation to figure out what

178
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,870
the asset value or-- and I'll
throw out a new term here, the

179
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,020
enterprise value
of the firm is.

180
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,850
The enterprise value's
essentially the asset value

181
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,600
minus excess cash.

182
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,750
The cash the company really
doesn't need to operate.

183
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,590
And we'll go into more
detail of that.

184
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,950
But we'll just view it as
the assets for now.

185
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,850
So if I'm the CFO of this
company, and let's say we need

186
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,710
to raise another, I don't
know, $15 million.

187
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,520
I have two options.

188
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,359
I could say OK, the company is
trading at $15 per share, I

189
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:36,049
need to raise $15 million,
so I could issue

190
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,280
another million shares.

191
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,360
It wouldn't be the initial
public offering because I'm

192
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
already public.

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,490
It would be a follow-on
offering, or sometimes it's

194
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,620
called a secondary offering.

195
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,410
Although the word secondary has
kind of two connotations.

196
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,810
But it would be a follow-on
offering where I would issue,

197
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,320
I'd go to the board, we would
essentially create another

198
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,470
million shares, and then sell
them into the market, and

199
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,470
hopefully people will buy it at
$15 a share or probably a

200
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,250
little bit less because we're
kind of flooding the market

201
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,420
with a ton of shares.

202
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,820
Maybe they buy it at $14
per share, and we

203
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,610
would raise $14 million.

204
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,060
And that would be a follow-on
offering.

205
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,600
So we can always use the public
markets as a way to

206
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,780
raise more money.

207
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,830
We didn't have to go to all
this-- I mean, for the most

208
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,940
part we didn't have to do this
huge valuation exercise and

209
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,610
negotiations and do all of this,
hire banks and all that.

210
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,290
Although the banks will
still collect fees.

211
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,750
We actually would have to
hire banks to do this.

212
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,730
So that's one option.

213
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,540
Or the other option is we're an
established company, we're

214
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,200
generating cash, we could
make interest

215
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,380
payments if we want to.

216
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,380
We could go to a bank.

217
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,100
And actually there's a lot of
different ways to do this.

218
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,030
But we could essentially
borrow money.

219
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,050
And let's just say we do that.

220
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,500
Instead of doing this--
let's say we do both.

221
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,870
So let's say we did a $1 million
follow-on offering,

222
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,130
that gave us $14 million.

223
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,400
And let's say we want another
$2 million, but this time

224
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,030
instead of selling shares--
so right now how many

225
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,470
shares do we have?

226
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,880
We sold 1 million, we
had 10 million, we

227
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,580
have 11 million shares.

228
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,310
Let's say, you know what, let's
say as a CFO I feel like

229
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,500
our shares are going to
move up a lot more.

230
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,830
So we don't like selling
them at this low price.

231
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,060
And let's say interest
rates are really low.

232
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,270
Instead we're going
to borrow money.

233
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,640
That's essentially
raising debt.

234
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,480
So let's say we borrow another
$3 million because we need it.

235
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,280
So actually this would be debt,
$3 million of debt, and

236
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,625
we would get $3 million
of cash.

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,340
So now our assets are
all of this stuff on

238
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,040
the left-hand side.

239
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,850
And what are our liabilities
now?

240
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,590
Now, we didn't have liabilities
before because

241
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,690
everything we had
were equities.

242
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,340
But now we do.

243
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,340
Now we owe somebody $3
million right here.

244
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,560
And I'll talk more about all the
different ways to kind of

245
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,660
borrow money.

246
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,180
But it's essentially, it could
just literally be a bank loan.

247
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,580
They might have just gone to
Bank of America and said hey,

248
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,730
we're a big company and we're
good for the money, why don't

249
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,260
you lend us $3 million.

250
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,020
And maybe it would be $3 million
at a low interest

251
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,930
rate, at maybe 6% per year.

252
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,710
And Bank of America feels good
because you have a high--

253
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,190
we'll talk more about credit
ratings and all of that-- but

254
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,670
they say oh, you have
essentially a good company

255
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,020
credit score.

256
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,810
So we'll give it to you at
a low interest rate.

257
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,720
So what happens in the future
is, these assets are going to

258
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,980
generate, hopefully,
some cash.

259
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,250
And before these guys see it--
let me do to it in the--

260
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,330
before these equity holders--
this is the equity holders

261
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,820
right now-- before the equity
holders see anything, these

262
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,750
guys have to get paid their
interest. And I'll show you

263
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,260
all of that on a line-by-line
basis in an income statement.

264
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,960
Everything we've done so far
has been a balance sheet.

265
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,970
But something interesting
is happening now.

266
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,913
Now all of a sudden your assets,
which is that side-- I

267
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:50,820
know I just keep writing over
the same drawing-- your assets

268
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,700
are now larger than
your equity.

269
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
I think now, and this is just
kind of a review of the

270
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:02,730
balance sheet video, you see
that the assets are equal to

271
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:09,390
your equity, which is this right
here, your equity plus

272
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,340
your liabilities.

273
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,170
Your liabilities now
are $3 million.

274
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,930
Plus liabilities.

275
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,740
So if you wanted to know what
your assets are worth, because

276
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,090
your assets are equal
to your equity.

277
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,050
So what's your market value
of your equity?

278
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,490
Well, we figured that
out already.

279
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,760
We have 11 million shares now.

280
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,630
And let's say the stock plummets
to $10 a share for

281
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,620
some strange reason or for
a not-strange reason.

282
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,530
So what's the market cap? $10 a
share, 11 million shares, we

283
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,920
have a $110 million
market cap.

284
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,270
We're doing a market value.

285
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,980
And we'll talk more about the
difference between market and

286
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,430
book value.

287
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,460
But this is the market
value of your equity.

288
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,470
And then what is your
liabilities?

289
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:55,090
Well we owe $3 million,
so plus 3 million.

290
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,160
So we could say that for the
most part the market value of

291
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,340
our assets, the market thinks
that this entire left-hand

292
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:07,430
side is going to be worth the
value of our equity, the

293
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,490
market cap of the company, plus
the amount of debt, which

294
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,460
is equal to $113 million.

295
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,590
So the value of these assets are
$113 million, and that for

296
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,610
the most part is the enterprise

297
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,720
value of the company.

298
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,490
What is the company's
assets worth?

299
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,610
And we'll talk-- there's a
little bit of a tweak we'll do

300
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,550
in the future on enterprise
value.

301
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,520
But that's essentially how you
kind of can value what the

302
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,690
company's worth.

303
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,410
A lot of people when they do
a market capitalization

304
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,640
calculation they say
oh, that's what

305
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,490
the company's worth.

306
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,720
Well no, that's what the
equity is worth.

307
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,670
Market cap is what the
equity's worth.

If you want to know what the
company's worth, you have to

309
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:48,460
take the market cap and
then add the debt.

310
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,150
Another way-- well, I won't get
too complicated because I

311
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,270
just realized I've run
out of time again.

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,032
