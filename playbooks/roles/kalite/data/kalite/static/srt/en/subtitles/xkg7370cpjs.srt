1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,190
Write 5 and 1/4 as an
improper fraction.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,770
An improper fraction is just
a pure fraction where the

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,510
numerator is greater than
the denominator.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,270
This right here, it's
not a pure fraction.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,079
We have a whole number mixed
with a fraction, so we call

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,720
this a mixed number.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,720
So let's think about what 5 and
1/4 represents, and let me

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,400
rewrite it.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,780
So if we're talking about 5 and
1/4, and you can literally

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
think of this as 5 and 1/4 or 5
plus 1/4, that's what 5 and

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,760
1/4 represents.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,750
So let's think about 5.

14
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,250
Five is 5 wholes, or if you're
thinking of pie, we could draw

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,710
literally five pies.

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,250
Let me just cut up the pies
from the get go into four

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,330
pieces since we're dealing
with fourths.

18
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,750
So let me just cut up the
pies right over here.

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,050
So that's one pie right
over there.

20
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,090
Let me copy and paste this.

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,900
Copy and paste.

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,040
So I have two pies, and then I
have three pies, and then I

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,990
have four pies, and then
I have five pies.

24
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,230
So this is what the
5 represents.

25
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,570
5 literally represents--
so let me

26
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,780
circle all of this together.

27
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,110
That is the 5 part
right there.

28
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,680
That is what 5 literally
represents.

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,265
It represents five whole pies.

30
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:26,850
   

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,170
Now, I have cut up the pies into
four pieces, so you can

32
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,940
imagine each piece represents
a fourth.

33
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,700
Now, how many pieces do I
have in these five pies?

34
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,930
Well, I have four
pieces per pie.

35
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:50,970
   

36
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,790
Let me just right it here.

37
00:01:51,790 --> 00:02:05,380
4 pieces per pie times 5 pies
is equal to 20 pieces.

38
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,100
Or another way to think of it,
since each piece is a fourth,

39
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,580
this is also equal to 20 times
1/4, or you could just write

40
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,750
this as being equal to 20/4.

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,640
So we have 5 whole pies is
equal to 20 fourths.

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,830
Let me write it like that.

43
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,460
20 fourths.

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,230
Or we could write it as 20/4.

45
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,700
I've kind of done the
same thing twice.

46
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,020
So that's what the five
pies represent.

47
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,160
20/4 or 20 pieces, where
each piece is 1/4.

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,790
Now, the 1/4 right here
represents literally one more

49
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,270
fourth of a pie or one more
piece of a pie, so let me draw

50
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,520
another pie here.

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,410
   

52
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,090
So that is another pie.

53
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,670
Cut it into four pieces.

54
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,080
But this 1/4 only represents
one of these pieces, right?

55
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,750
This is one of the
four pieces.

56
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,080
The denominator tells
us how many pieces.

57
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,140
The 1 tells us how many of those
pieces we're dealing

58
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,180
with, so it's just this
one piece over here.

59
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,550
That right there is the 1/4.

60
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:26,100
Now, if we write 5 and 1/4,
we just saw that the 5

61
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,290
right here is 20/4.

62
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,690
So we could rewrite this.

63
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,440
Let me write it like this.

64
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:44,560
5 and 1/4 can be rewritten as
the same thing as 5 plus 1/4,

65
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,450
which is the same thing as--
we just saw that five whole

66
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,960
pies is the same
thing as 20/4.

67
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,650
And to see that these are the
same thing, you literally just

68
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,120
divide 4 into 20.

69
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,700
You get 5, and nothing
is left over.

70
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,300
So 5 is the same thing as 20/4,
and then this plus 1/4

71
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,050
is the same thing as plus 1/4.

72
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:10,350
So if I have 20 fourths and I
add one more fourth to it, how

73
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,380
many fourths do I have?

74
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,640
Well, I have 21.

75
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,120
I have 21 fourths.

76
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,740
Or another way of thinking about
it, this 5 is-- so this

77
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:27,990
right here is 20
pieces of pie.

78
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,770
You can even count it.

79
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,470
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

80
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,640
18, 19, 20.

81
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,570
But a quicker way is to say,
well, we have five pies.

82
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,960
Each of them have four pieces.

83
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,820
5 times 4 is 20.

84
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:46,020
This 1/4 right here represents
one piece plus one piece, so

85
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,060
total we're going to
have 21 pieces.

86
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,150
So we have 21 pieces, where each
piece is 1/4, so we could

87
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:02,030
say we have 21 times 1/4 or
21 fourths pieces of pie.

88
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,270
However you want to
think of it, but

89
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,490
we've solved the problem.

90
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,330
We're at an improper fraction.

91
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,850
We've written 5 and 1/4 as
an improper fraction.

92
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,490
Now, I've gone through great
pains to give you the

93
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,410
intuition of what 5 and 1/4
means, but there is a fairly

94
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,710
straightforward process for
getting straight to the

95
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,960
improper fraction.

96
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,510
   

97
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,970
Let me color code it.

98
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:35,150
So if you have 5 and 1 over 4,
to convert it into an improper

99
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,020
fraction, you're going to keep
the same denominator, so

100
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,680
you're going to have
the over 4 there.

101
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,220
But your numerator is going to
be your numerator of the

102
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,370
fraction part before.

103
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,510
So it's going to be 1 plus your
whole number times your

104
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,820
denominator.

105
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,620
So 1 plus-- or actually, let
me do it the way I tend to

106
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,290
think of it.

107
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,240
What I do is I take 4 times 5.

108
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,700
So let me write that down and
I want to color code it.

109
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:12,830
4 times 5, and then to that,
I add this numerator.

110
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,560
So I literally do 4 times 5 plus
1, which is-- so this is

111
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,530
equal to 4 times 5 is 20, plus
1 is 21, and then that's over

112
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,680
4, so it's 21/4.

113
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,410
And all of this is kind of
a fast way to do it.

114
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,910
We're literally doing the exact
same thing that we did

115
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,420
here in kind of a slower way.

116
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,550
We're saying, OK, 5 wholes is
the same thing as 20 fourths,

117
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,220
so you take 5, and I figure that
out, 5 times 4, and then

118
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,870
I have one more fourth there, so
4 times 5 plus 1 gives 21.

119
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,667
