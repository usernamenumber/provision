1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:04,733
We are asked how many inches are in four and a half yards.

2
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:06,600
We can do it in a couple of ways.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,733
One we could do is to see how many inches are in four yards and

4
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:09,667
how many inches are there in half a yard.

5
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:11,200
and this is really four plus one half yards.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,133
Or we could convert this into improper fraction first and then convert.

7
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,667
But before I even do that, let us just think about how many inches are there in a yard.

8
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:22,133
So, if I have one yard,

9
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:25,533
We know that there are 3 feet

10
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:30,867
for every one yard.

11
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:35,933
Why am I multiplying by three?

12
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,067
And the easiest way to think about is

13
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:40,200
you are going to have a larger value over here

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,000
and you are also going to want to have

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,200
these units right over here cancel out.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,867
So yard is cancelling out with yard.

17
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:53,267
So you have one yard is equal to three feet.

18
00:00:53,267 --> 00:01:01,733
Now how many inches are there in one foot?

19
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:05,933
We know that there are twelve inches for every one foot.

20
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,533
And same logic over here.

21
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,267
Inches is a smaller unit of measurement.

22
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,933
So it makes sense to multiply by twelve.

23
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:14,400
Three feet is going to be more inches; so we multiply by twelve

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,267
and also these units cancel out.

25
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,800
Foot in the numerator, foot in the denominator.

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,533
Three times twelve divided by one is thirty six inches

27
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:27,133
You might have already known it, but it is nice to have the dimensions cancel out

28
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,267
like this.

29
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:33,933
We now know that one yard is equal to thirty six inches

30
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:36,600
Or there are thirty six inches for every one yard.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,333
And now we can either break this down

32
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,800
or convert this into an improper fraction.

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,933
First I will break it down into four yards plus one half a yard.

34
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:57,600
Four yards is going to be equal to four multiplied by thirty six inches per yard.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,267
Yard and yard cancel out.

36
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:11,400
four times thirty six is a hundred and fourty four inches.

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,333
That is just the four yards.

38
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,133
And then if we do the half yard

39
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:25,000
One half yard times 36 inches per yard

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,067
yards cancel out.

41
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:33,800
One half of thirty six is going to be eighteen inches.

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,733
So four and half a yard is the same thing as four yards plus one half yard.

43
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,467
Which is the same thing as

44
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:43,400
One hundred and fourty four inches plus eighteen inches.

45
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:57,133
Which is going to give us one hundred and sixty two inches.

46
00:02:57,133 --> 00:03:01,733
The other way to do this is:

47
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:04,067
to convert this into an improper function

48
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:06,933
and then multipy.

49
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:10,533
If I have four and a half of anything

50
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:17,867
Four is the same thing as eight halves.

51
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:32,400
Four and a half is the same thing as four plus one half

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:50,600
Four is the same thing as four over one.

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,800
plus one half

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,733
The common denominator is two

55
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,800
So, four over one is the same thing as eight over two.

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
plus one over two.

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:11,267
This is equal to nine over two.

58
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:17,800
A simple way to do is four times two is eight, and eight plus one is nine.

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,267
So that gives the nine over two.

60
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:24,533
So, we have nine half yards that we want to convert to inches.

61
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:38,467
Nine half yards times thirty six inches per yard.

62
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:39,733
Yard in the numerator, yard in the denominator.

63
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:46,733
We are left with nine over two times thirty six over one inches.

64
00:04:46,733 --> 00:05:04,600
Divide both the numerator and the denominator by two.

65
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:13,867
nine times thirty six over two inches.

66
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:31,200
dividing gives nine times eighteen.

67
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Which is one hundred and sixty two inches.

68
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,333
So, all of this simplifies to one hundred and sixty two inches.

69
00:05:47,333 --> 99:59:59,999
and we are done!
