1
00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:06,544
Let's talk about blood vessels

2
00:00:06,544 --> 00:00:10,964
I'm going to talk to you about the different types of blood vessels that there are

3
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:13,616
and we're going to see if we can come up with some general patterns.

4
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:18,165
So let's start with the uh- let's say we take the blood vessel out of your body

5
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:21,182
and examine it under a microscope.

6
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:25,409
It would look something like this, where you have the middle: called the lumen.

7
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:28,984
and right outside of the lumen you have cells.

8
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:32,259
And these cells are going all the way around the lumen

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,664
and they're the first type of cell that any blood would interact with, right?

10
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:41,330
Because that's right immediately outside of the lumen.

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,780
And on the other side of the cells, on the back side of the cells-if you think of the lumen as the front side-

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:53,581
is a little line I'm gonna draw here to represent protein that sits there and

13
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:58,962
acts as a scaffold, kind of like keeping all of the cells in place.

14
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:05,660
So you have all of these endothelial cells.

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:13,617
And then you have that little basement membrane- like a thin line of membrane- called the basement membrane

16
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:17,731
And that keeps everything from falling out of place.

17
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:21,651
And the thing that's in the basement membrane is mostly protein.

18
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:24,215
So think about thinks like collagen which you can find

19
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:28,015
in bones and your gums. That same protein is actually

20
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:33,318
lining all of these blood vessels that are in your body.

21
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:38,212
And together the basement membrane and endothelial cells, they make up a layer

22
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:46,916
called the Tunica Intima.

23
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:52,227
And that's kind of the word we use because "tunica" comes from the word for coat or cloak.

24
00:01:52,227 --> 00:01:56,715
And "intima" is kind of the intimate layer, the intimate coating of the vessels

25
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:59,515
So Tunica Intima.

26
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:05,114
Now right outside of this is another layer- and I'm gonna draw that right out here in red.

27
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:08,529
And this will be a layer of muscle. Image these little lines

28
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:13,533
represent smooth muscle cells. So this would be muscle and

29
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:21,280
this would be the layer called tunica media, or middle.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,815
And the most important thing here is that there is smooth muscle in this layer.

31
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,148
And finally, on the very outside, you have another layer.

32
00:02:33,148 --> 00:02:36,232
And I'm gonna draw it as a yellow line.

33
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:41,482
And this yellow line represents more protein. This is another layer of protein,

34
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:45,964
just like the basement membrane, but different composition of proteins.

35
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:50,867
But again you see actually a lot of collagen, just as before, and some other proteins as well.

36
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:57,666
And this is called the tunica externa. For external layer.

37
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:05,422
Actually another word that they sometimes use for this is called "Adventitia." So you might see that word too.

38
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:13,055
And the really interesting thing about the tunica externa is that you actually, on the large vessels,

39
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:19,021
you find that they need blood to supply themselves, so some of these large vessels have little

40
00:03:19,021 --> 00:03:24,164
blood vessels on them. And you might think- well does this just go on endlessly?

41
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:30,531
Ya know, vessels that have vessels on them and those little vessels have vessels on them and so on and so forth.

42
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:38,972
Actually No. It's just the large vessels that have this. So you SOMETIMES, not always,

43
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:45,407
see what's called vasa vasorum. And this is kind of a fancy name for it.

44
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:49,665
But they're little blood vessels on blood vessels. Which I always thought was

45
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:53,654
kind of a cool thing. So the tunica externa has the blood vessels

46
00:03:53,654 --> 00:04:00,276
and it also has nerve endings. And I'm not going to actually draw that in because it'd be

47
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:11,786
kind of hard to show that. But nerve endings actually can be in that layer. In that tunica externa layer.

48
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:15,243
So you've got three layers, each of them has some pretty cool things in them.

49
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:21,749
And now what I thought we'd do is we'd go and think about each vessel type, and how this could look for that vessel.

50
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:27,038
So let's start with the veins. And I'll do the veins over here.

51
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:35,986
So let's say you have a vein. On the inside it has that tunica intima layer -and I'm not going to draw all of the

52
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:43,243
cells out because now you know what that represents. That purple line represents the endothelial cells AND the basement membrane.

53
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:51,076
And you also have a smooth muscle layer- so kind of a red line to represent tunica media.

54
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:56,777
And veins have a tunica externa- a third layer.

55
00:04:56,777 --> 00:05:01,476
So veins kind of follow this general pattern. They have three layers and they're pretty straight forward in

56
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:06,943
following exactly what I just talked about.

57
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:15,107
Now arteries. Let me do a different color for arteries. Let's say red.

58
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:34,101
I think of arteries in two different groups. So I think of large and middle sized arteries a little differently than I think about small arteries or arterioles.

59
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:38,993
And you'll see that the small arteries and arterioles actually look quite similar to one another.

60
00:05:38,993 --> 00:05:42,483
So let's start with the large and middle sized arteries.

61
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:52,157
So there you have, let's say, an inside. And then on the outside of that, on the tunica media layer-

62
00:05:52,157 --> 00:06:00,454
you start seeing a difference from the vein. You see that it's much larger, much larger.

63
00:06:00,454 --> 00:06:07,562
And in the vein you just had kind of a thin layer of smooth muscle, here you have a nice large layer of smooth muscle.

64
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:13,543
And in addition to having these smooth muscle cells in the large and middle arteries you have an interesting

65
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:24,023
new thing. You have something called elastin protein. And elastin is gonna be in here and this is a protein that

66
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:31,560
helps make these very elastic. Right because they're going to have such high pressures that

67
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,160
they have to be able to not break when these pressures are going through.

68
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:59,287
So this elastin (this green elastin protein) helps make the arteries more elastic. More elastic for high pressures.

69
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:01,029
And I'll write "P" for pressures.

70
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:06,558
So that's what the middle layer looks like. And of course you still have your outer layer as before.

71
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:14,077
So you've seen one key difference now with these large and middle sized arteries.

72
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:18,012
Okay so now let's go to the small arteries and the arterioles.

73
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:23,994
So here let's start out with the lumen, has that as before.

74
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:28,313
And you also have a large tunica media.

75
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:34,627
So unlike the vein, the tunica media in the arteries-in both types of arteries- is actually quite large.

76
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:45,060
Except here, instead of having elastin in this area, you have just tons and tons of muscle.

77
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:53,735
Lots of muscle. So they're very very strong in the sense that you can actually very easily squeeze down on the lumen

78
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:57,917
if you wanted to by having all of this muscle contract.

79
00:07:57,917 --> 00:08:03,565
And that makes sense because we know that the arterioles - look at all of that muscle- the arterioles are actually

80
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:17,043
going to be the ones that are going to create resistance. So here you have a lot of muscle.

81
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:22,579
And this is to help create lots of resistance. If you need it, to change your blood pressures.

82
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:29,465
So that's why the small arteries and arterioles are really helpful in squeezing down and changing blood pressures.

83
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:36,015
And on the outside, they as before, have that layer of tunica externa.

84
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:45,700
And this again is where the nerve endings go,and where the blood vessels, or the vasa vasorum go. So that's where that layer is.

85
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:53,869
Okay. And you might be thinking there's gotta be one more vessel type and there is-

86
00:08:53,869 --> 00:09:01,719
and that's the capillary. So let me draw the capillary, so I'll do that over here.

87
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:08,295
The capillary is actually going to look different from all of this other stuff that we've done because the capillaries

88
00:09:08,295 --> 00:09:22,950
are actually really really unique in the sense that-unlike what we had for the veins and arteries- this is down to the single cell level.

89
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,232
So you still have a lumen but on the outside, instead of having a lot of endothelial cells

90
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:38,697
you actually have, at times, one cell. One cell will actually form the entire wall of the tube.

91
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:44,000
So you actually a cell travelling within a cell. Almost like the cell is giving the little red blood cell

92
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,054
floating through it a big hug or something like that.

93
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:52,351
So that capillary looks actually quite different as you can see from the other things that we've drawn: the veins and arteries.

94
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:57,821
But I want you to just take a look at this again and see the key differences between the veins and arteries.

95
00:09:57,821 --> 00:10:04,530
The vein follows the general pattern. But the large and middle arteries have a lot of elastin in the tunica media.

96
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,530
And the small arteries and arterioles have a lot of muscle in that tunica media.
