1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,915
Let's say I've got me
a set of vectors.

3
00:00:02,915 --> 00:00:06,720
So let me call my set B.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,130
And let's say I have the vectors
v1, v2, all the way

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,380
through vk.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,960
Now let's say this isn't just
any set of vectors.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,160
There's some interesting things
about these vectors.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,080
The first thing is that all of
these guys have length of 1.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:36,080
So we could say the length of
vector vi is equal to 1 for i

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,890
is equal to-- well we could say
between 1 and k or i is

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,750
equal to 1, 2, all
the way to k.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,010
All of these guys have
length equal 1.

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,020
Or another way to say it is
that the square of their

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,360
lengths are 1.

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,240
The square of a vi whose
length is equal to 1.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,980
Or vi dot vi is equal to 1 for
i is any of these guys.

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,630
Any i can be 1, 2, 3,
all the way to k.

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,330
   

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,350
So that's the first interesting
thing about it.

20
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,950
Let me write it in
regular words.

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:19,940
All the vectors in
B have length 1.

22
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,680
Or another way to say is that
they've all been normalized.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,260
That's another way to say that
is that they have all been

24
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,030
normalized.

25
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,190
Or they're all unit vectors.

26
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,160
Normalized vectors are vectors
that you've made

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,880
their lengths 1.

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,400
You're turned them into
unit vectors.

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,776
They have all been normalized.

30
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:41,980
   

31
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,750
So that's the first
interesting thing

32
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,100
about my set, B.

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,320
And then the next interesting
thing about my set B is that

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,130
all of the vectors are
orthogonal to each other.

35
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,690
So if you dot it with itself,
if you dot a vector with

36
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,470
itself, you get length 1.

37
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,940
But if you take a vector and dot
it with any other vector--

38
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:06,150
if you take vi and you were
to dot it with vj.

39
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,539
So if you took v2 and dotted it
with v1, it's going to be

40
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:17,120
equal to 0 for i does
not equal j.

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,210
All of these guys
are orthogonal.

42
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,060
Let me write that down.

43
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:31,416
All of the vectors are
orthogonal to each other.

44
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:38,150
   

45
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,390
And of course they're not
orthogonal to themselves

46
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,160
because they all
have length 1.

47
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,260
So if you take the dot product
with itself, you get 1.

48
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,390
If you take a dot product with
some other guy in your set

49
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,400
you're going to get 0.

50
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,630
Maybe I can write it this way.

51
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,460
vi dot vj for all the members
of the set is going to be

52
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:03,330
equal to 0 for i does
not equal j.

53
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,750
And then if these guys are the
same vector-- I'm dotting with

54
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,760
myself-- I'm going
to have length 1.

55
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,430
So it would equal length
1 for i is equal to j.

56
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,530
So I've got a special set.

57
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,890
All of these guys have length
1 and they're all orthogonal

58
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,380
with each other.

59
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,660
They're normalized and they're
all orthogonal.

60
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,450
And we have a special
word for this.

61
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,900
This is called an
orthonormal set.

62
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:37,870
So B is an orthonormal set.

63
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,560
Normal for normalized.

64
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,130
Everything is orthogonal.

65
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,180
They're all orthogonal relative
to each other.

66
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,740
And everything has
been normalized.

67
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,610
Everything has length 1.

68
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,090
Now, the first interesting thing
about an orthonormal set

69
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,010
is that it's also going to be
a linearly independent set.

70
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:03,200
So if B is orthonormal, B is
also going to be linearly

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,450
independent.

72
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,280
   

73
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,990
And how can I show
that to you?

74
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,230
Well let's assume that it isn't
linearly independent.

75
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,650
   

76
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:23,960
Let me take vi, let me take vj
that are members of my set.

77
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,780
And let's assume that
i does not equal j.

78
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,250
Now, we already know that
it's an orthonormal set.

79
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:38,730
So vi dot vj is going
to be equal to 0.

80
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,500
They are orthogonal.

81
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
These are two vectors
in my set.

82
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,180
Now, let's assume that they
are linearly dependent.

83
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,570
I want to prove that they are
linearly independent and the

84
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,370
way I'm going to prove that is
by assuming they are linearly

85
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,060
dependent and then arriving
at a contradiction.

86
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,160
   

87
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:07,973
So let's assume that vi and
vj are linearly dependent.

88
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:10,730
   

89
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,870
Well then that means that I
can represent one of these

90
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,420
guys as a scalar multiple
the other.

91
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,790
And I can pick either way.

92
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,290
So let's just say, for the sake
of argument, that I can

93
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,030
represent vi-- let's say
that vi is equal to sum

94
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,100
scalar c times vj.

95
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,220
That's what linear
dependency means.

96
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,200
That one of them can be
represented as a scalar

97
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,520
multiple of the other.

98
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,560
Well if this is true, then
I can just substitute

99
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,880
this back in for vi.

100
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,250
And what do I get?

101
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,590
I get c times vj-- which is just
another way of writing vi

102
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,300
because I assumed linear
dependence.

103
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,050
That dot vj has got
to be equal to 0.

104
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,160
This guy was vi.

105
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,880
This is vj.

106
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,780
They are orthogonal
to each other.

107
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:01,200
But this right here is just
equal to c times vj dot vj

108
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:08,080
which is just equal to c times
the length of vj squared.

109
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,720
And that has to equal 0.

110
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,120
They are orthogonal so
that has to equal 0.

111
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,070
Which implies that the length
of vj has to be equal to 0.

112
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,150
If we assume that this is some
non-zero multiple, and this

113
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,175
has to be some non-zero
multiple-- I should have

114
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,200
written it there-- c
does not equal 0.

115
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,470
Why does this have to be
a non-zero multiple?

116
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,270
Because these were both
non-zero vectors.

117
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,640
This is a non-zero vector.

118
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,210
So this guy can't be 0.

119
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,840
This guy has length 1.

120
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,900
So if this is a non-zero vector,
there's no way that I

121
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,400
can just put a 0 here.

122
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,600
Because if I put a 0 then
I would get a 0 vector.

123
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,070
So c can't be 0.

124
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,400
So if c isn't 0, then this guy
right here has to be 0.

125
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,280
And so we get that the
length of vj is 0.

126
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,450
Which we know is false.

127
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,590
The length of vj is 1.

128
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,020
This is an orthonormal set.

129
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,035
The length of all of the
members of B are 1.

130
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:56,960
So we reach a contradiction.

131
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,960
This is our contradiction.

132
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,290
Vj is not the 0 vector.

133
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,290
It has length 1.

134
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,380
Contradiction.

135
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,560
So if you have a bunch of
vectors that are orthogonal

136
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,050
and they're non-zero, they
have to be linearly

137
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,160
independent.

138
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,680
Which is pretty interesting.

139
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,460
So if I have this set, this
orthonormal set right here,

140
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,140
it's also a set of linearly
independent vectors, so it can

141
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:25,790
be a basis for a subspace.

142
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:35,960
So let's say that B is the basis
for some subspace, v.

143
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:47,140
Or we could say that v is equal
to the span of v1, v2,

144
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,880
all the way to vk.

145
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,370
Then we called B-- if it was
just a set, we'd call it a

146
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,790
orthonormal set, but it can be
an orthonormal basis when it's

147
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,290
spans some subspace.

148
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,250
So we can write, we can
say that B is an

149
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:10,175
orthonormal basis for v.

150
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:12,890
Now everything I've done is very
abstract, but let me do

151
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,520
some quick examples for you.

152
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,600
Just so you understand what an
orthonormal basis looks like

153
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,140
with real numbers.

154
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,240
So let's say I have
two vectors.

155
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,520
Let's say I have the vector,
v1, that is-- say we're

156
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:33,700
dealing in R3 so it's 1/3,
2/3, 2/3 and 2/3.

157
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,260
   

158
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,450
And let's say I have another
vector, v2, that is equal to

159
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,740
2/3, 1/3, and minus 2/3.

160
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:58,480
And let's say that B is
the set of v1 and v2.

161
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,030
So the first question
is, is what are the

162
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,830
lengths of these guys?

163
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,816
So let's take the length.

164
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:09,580
The length of v1 squared
is just v1 dot v1.

165
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,600
Which is just 1/3 squared,
which is just 1 over 0.

166
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,190
Plus 2/3 squared,
which is 4/9.

167
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,370
Plus 2/3 squared,
which is 4/9.

168
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,770
Which is equal to 1.

169
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,230
So if the length squared is 1,
then that tells us that the

170
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,440
length of our first vector
is equal to 1.

171
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,640
If the square of the length is
1, you take the square root,

172
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,970
so the length is 1.

173
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,070
What about vector 2?

174
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:43,260
Well the length of vector 2
squared is equal to v2 dot v2.

175
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,690
Which is equal to-- let's see,
two 2/3 squared is 4/9-- plus

176
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,680
1/3 squared is 1/9.

177
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,470
Plus 2/3 squared is 4/9.

178
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,340
So that is 9/9, which
is equal to 1.

179
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,420
Which tells us that the length
of v2, the length of vector v2

180
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,680
is equal to 1.

181
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,200
So we know that these guys are
definitely normalized.

182
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,360
We can call this a
normalized set.

183
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
But is it an orthonormal set?

184
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,160
Are these guys orthogonal
to each other?

185
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,490
And to test that out we just
take their dot product.

186
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:22,210
So v1 dot v2 is equal to 1/3
times 2/3, which is 2/9.

187
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,390
Plus 2/3 times 1/3,
which is 2/9.

188
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,360
Plus 2/3 times the minus 2/3.

189
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,660
That's minus 4/9.

190
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,350
   

191
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,950
2 plus 2 minus 4 is 0.

192
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,860
So it equals 0.

193
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,900
So these guys are indeed
orthogonal.

194
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,140
So B is an orthonormal set.

195
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:48,600
   

196
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,790
And if I have some subspace,
let's say that B is equal to

197
00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:01,760
the span of v1 and v2, then we
can say that the basis for v,

198
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:10,400
or we could say that B is
an orthonormal basis.

199
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,570
   

200
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,430
for V.

201
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,675
