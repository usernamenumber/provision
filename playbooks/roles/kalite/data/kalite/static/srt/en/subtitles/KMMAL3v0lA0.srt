1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,930
One of the reasons that's most cited as to a cause or

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,180
the cause of why World War One turned
into a world war as opposed to just a

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,499
regional conflict in Southeast Europe

4
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:13,269
is the alliance system

5
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:17,390
that was developing in the decades
leading up to World War One.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,099
And to understand that, i've distilled a bunch
of the alliances that occurred in those

7
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:24,220
decades leading up to World War One. This is just a distilled version, there are

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,079
many other alliances that were tangentially related, but I'll try to distill down the ones

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,859
that were directly related to

10
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:31,500
all of the dominoes falling

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,460
in 1914, that led to all
of Europe being essentially at war with

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,550
each other.

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,750
So to understand that, we have to rewind
75 years. So World War One

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,209
it starts in 1914;

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,749
75 years before that, in 1839, you have the Treaty

16
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:47,220
of London,

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,120
and the Treaty of London did many things, but Article 7 is what's

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,570
relevant to the beginning of World War One,

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,500
where Britain agrees to protect the neutrality of the Belgium.

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,800
And, if you're skeptical you might say: "Hey, this
is a 75 year old treaty, why

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,990
does this matter anymore?" and that
actually would be a good question.

22
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,280
Really all of these alliances, it's a
very healthy debate you can have as to

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,630
whether these are the direct causes of why one of these powers declared war

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,819
on the other, or whether these were just
excuses, these were kind of a legal pretext

25
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:20,229
for saying "Oh i need to declare war" and in reality they really did want to

26
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:22,800
declare war for a whole set of reasons, to kind of

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,440
keep the other persons' empire and check,
to flex their military muscle, to go after

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,290
more territory in their empires,

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,200
who knows what it might be?

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,450
But needless to say

31
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,000
1839 was a legal basis

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,990
for the British Empire to protect

33
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,180
to protect

34
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,530
Belgium.

35
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,960
Now you fast forward forty years, you get to 1879.

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,829
You have a

37
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:49,259
newly born German Empire out of the
Franco Prussian War in 1871.

38
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,100
That newly born German Empire, they just had a...

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,400
essentially it's an extension of Prussia, fundamentally a

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,869
German kingdom,

41
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,630
they just had a war with France, they took
some very valuable territory from France,

42
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,869
they're paranoid that France wants to
get back at them, they're paranoid about

43
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,700
they're paranoid about the Russians,
and they have some connection with the

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,550
Austrians, or the austro-hungarians I should say,

45
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,310
and so in 1879, they sign the Dual Alliance Treaty

46
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,700
between Germany and Austria-Hungary to
protect each other if Russia attacks.

47
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,819
They have this common enemy right over
here: Russia.

48
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:30,569
So they're going to... let me do some different color...

49
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,740
They're going to protect each other.

50
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,110
So this makes the new German
empire feel a little bit better about

51
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,630
its position in Europe in case they
were to get into a war with either of

52
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,379
these characters.

53
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,290
Then in 1892,

54
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,360
you can imagine if you ever play a game of Risk,

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,020
or if you play the game of Diplomacy,
which is actually based on what happened

56
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,470
in World War One,

57
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,420
if you see some people that you might be at war with starting to become friends,

58
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,440
you want to look for other friends, other
alliances that you can form in case they

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,269
declare war on you.

60
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:02,249
So in 1892, you have an alliance between the French and the

61
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:07,329
Russians, the Franco-Russian Military Convention, so this is an alliance... let me do

62
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,589
this in the magenta colour again.

63
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:11,750
You have an alliance

64
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,409
between France

65
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:14,680
France

66
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,189
and Russia.

67
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:19,799
And then finally in the early nineteen
hundreds, 1904 to

68
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,530
1907,

69
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,240
you have a series of agreements, "ententes" essentially means "agreements",

70
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,180
agreements between the British Empire and
France, between the British Empire and

71
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,819
the Russian Empire,

72
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:33,849
to essentially get on good terms with each other. These weren't as formally

73
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,629
bonding that "Hey, if someone's going to
attack you, i'm going to attack them", but

74
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:41,439
they were essentially able to resolve a lot of
their issues on what's going on in

75
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,800
their other imperial conquest

76
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,049
and they formed what is called "The Triple Entente", the triple agreement

77
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,099
between

78
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,799
Britain, between the British Empire,

79
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,189
and right here i just circle the
United Kingdom, France

80
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:57,289
France and Russia.

81
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:00,759
And on the other side of that, you had the Triple Alliance: you have Germany,

82
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:06,039
you have Austria-Hungary, and you also have...
you also have Italy.

83
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,029
Now the reason why, even though entering into World War One, Italy was formerly

84
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:14,209
part of the Triple Alliance, and there were treaties between Italy and Germany to

85
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:16,090
become part of this triple alliance,

86
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,930
the reason i don't focus on those, is once the war started, Italy did not go on

87
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,300
the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary.

88
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,240
It went on the side of the allies, on the
side of the Triple Entente.

89
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,830
But this will give you a good background
for why

90
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,360
what would seem like a regional
skirmish in Southeast Europe

91
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,569
turns into a pan-Europe and eventually pan
global war.
