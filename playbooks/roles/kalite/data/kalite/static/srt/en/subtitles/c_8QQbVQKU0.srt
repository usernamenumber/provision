After going through many of these Indian Institute of Technology joint entrance exam problems, I realized that

2
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:11,307
there are a lot of problems where they really just expect you to know some things. So, that's what I am going to cover in this video.

3
00:00:11,307 --> 00:00:15,853
One of those things that they just expect you to know. And what we're going to do is come up with a relationship

4
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:22,509
between a conic section in the particular hyperbola is what we will focus on and a tangent line. We've done this in

5
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:28,213
a previous problem, but that wasn't in the general case. So let's just say that we have a left-right

6
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:36,873
opening hyperobla so we are going to have the equation X squared over A squared minus Y squared over

7
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:45,701
V squared equals one. So if I were to draw that hyperbola, it' going to look something like this. That's

8
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:55,031
the x-axis. That's the y-axis and then it opens to the right. I can draw a better bottom half that opens to the right.

9
00:00:55,031 --> 00:01:01,353
And it opens to the left. And in case you're curious, this point right here

10
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:10,483
if you said y is equal to zero, this point right here is (a,0), and this right here is (-a,0).

11
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:15,406
So what I wanna do is figure out a relationship about these a's and b's

12
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:18,094
and the equation of a tangent line.

13
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:22,186
So let's say I have a tangent line that looks something like this.
