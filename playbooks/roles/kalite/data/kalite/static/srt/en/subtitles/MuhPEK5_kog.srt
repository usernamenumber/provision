1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,990
I think I rushed the end of that
problem just to finish in

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,980
the 10-minute YouTube
time limit.

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,690
And I just want to make sure you
understand because I did

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,850
it all over the place.

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,460
We said, white to
brown is 2:3.

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:18,510
And then white is equal to
2/3 times the brown.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,420
And we also said, well the total
number of baskets is

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,770
white plus brown.

10
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,230
White is 2/3 of the
number of brown.

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,780
So 2/3 brown plus 3/3 brown,
or 1 brown, that equals 5/3

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,300
brown is equal to the total.

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,760
Or we can multiply both sides of
this times 3/5 and say that

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,490
the brown is equal to
the total times 3/5.

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,010
And since we can't have a
fractional number of brown

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,210
eggs, the total has to
be divisible by 5.

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,480
And if you look at the choices,
the only number

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,450
that's not divisible by
5, is choice B, is 12.

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,460
All the other choices are
divisible by 5, so they could

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,060
have been possible choices.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,849
Let's move on to the next.

22
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,390
   

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,080
And I will do it in green.

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,740
Seven.

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:24,850
If 18 root 18, 18 times the
square root of 18 is equal to

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:32,050
r times the square root of t,
where r and t are positive

27
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,230
integers-- and we also know
that r is greater than t--

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:44,150
which of the following can be
the value of r times t?

29
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,700
   

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,550
So this is is interesting.

31
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:55,020
r can't equal t, otherwise
they would both be 18.

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,850
But one interesting thing
that we can try doing.

33
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,460
Well actually I'm not going to
do it that way, because I

34
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,810
realize that might be a long
way of doing this problem.

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,949
Let's see, how can we think
about this problem?

36
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,320
Well, we know that r and t are
positive integers, so what

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,730
could r and t be?

38
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,330
18 root 18.

39
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,720
So we could factor this more.

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,360
We could say that this is
the same thing as 18

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,710
times 9 times 2.

42
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,370
In which case, this is
the same thing as 18.

43
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,770
The square root of 9 is 3
times 3 times root 2.

44
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,010
What's 3 times 18?

45
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,250
That's 54 root 2.

46
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,830
So this would satisfy
this format.

47
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:49,420
So we could say r is 54
and t is 2, in which

48
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,770
case rt would be 108.

49
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,640
Let's see if that's a choice.

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,710
And it's a choice, so we're
done, because that could be

51
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,510
the value of rt.

52
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,570
Maybe I just stumbled on it.

53
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,880
I don't know if there's
other choices.

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,370
I won't think too
hard about it.

55
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,190
But that's the answer.

56
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,750
I just simplified this a little
bit and I said 18 root

57
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,220
18 is the same thing
is 54 root 2.

58
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,060
And so r is 54, t is 2.

59
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,030
If you multiply them, you get
a 108 and that was choice C.

60
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:23,100
Problem number 8, which
I will do in yellow.

61
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,870
Problem number 8.

62
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,400
Fancy graph drawn there,
not a graph, a drawing.

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,440
See the triangle,
that's one side.

64
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,452
   

65
00:03:35,452 --> 00:03:36,702
That's one side.

66
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:39,800
   

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,290
One side.

68
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,250
Then we have another triangle
inside this triangle.

69
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,500
Just a triangle.

70
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,420
   

71
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,080
Another triangle inside that
triangle and see what they

72
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,760
wrote in addition to that.

73
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,520
So this angle is b.

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,990
This angle is c.

75
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,820
This angle is a.

76
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,230
This angle is b.

77
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,160
This is b, and this is a.

78
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,769
And they want to know, in the
figure above what is the value

79
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,579
of c in terms of a and b?

80
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,530
If you've watched my geometry
videos, this to me is the

81
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,450
angle game because we're just
going to try to figure out as

82
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,520
many angles as we can.

83
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,430
And then eventually we'll
hopefully be able to figure

84
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,260
out what c is.

85
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,080
So we know this is b, this is
b, and all of these combined

86
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,200
form this supplementary
angle 180.

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,890
So we know that this angle
right here is 180 minus b

88
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,420
minus b, so it's minus 2b.

89
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,300
   

90
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,980
That's this angle right there
and then what's this angle

91
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,600
right here?

92
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,990
What's this angle?

93
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,560
Well, this angle is 180.

94
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,530
Well now does that help us?

95
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,420
Is that going to help me
with this problem?

96
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,370
This is 180 minus a minus c.

97
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,500
I don't think that helps
us necessarily.

98
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,390
This angle right here,
is going to be 180

99
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,570
minus a minus b.

100
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,290
   

101
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,810
I should have drawn
this bigger.

102
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,120
This angle right here is also--
because we have this

103
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,280
inner triangle right here.

104
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:39,470
That also is going to be
180 minus a minus b.

105
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,240
This angle here is going to be
180 minus this angle minus

106
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,030
this angle.

107
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:54,190
So it's 180 minus this angle,
which we figured out was 180

108
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,460
minus a minus b.

109
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,160
And we just figured out
that because that was

110
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,620
part of this triangle.

111
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:11,770
So it's 180 minus 180 minus a
minus b minus this angle here,

112
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,710
which is also 180
minus a minus b.

113
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,820
I mean it's really minus 2 times
180 minus a minus b.

114
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,390
And if you simplify that, you'll
get 180 minus-- we have

115
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,020
this twice.

116
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,260
You could just simplify this.

117
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:34,780
It's 2 times 180 plus
2a plus 2b.

118
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,300
I skipped a couple of steps.

119
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,090
Because the negative
distributes, then you have two

120
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,530
a's and 2 b's.

121
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,330
Then if we simplify this, we get
180 minus 360, so you get

122
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,330
2a plus 2b minus 180.

123
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,970
I just simplified this--
is this angle.

124
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,120
And then we also know that
this angle that we just

125
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:07,640
figured out plus b plus
c is equal to 180.

126
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,170
So let me move up here, I'm
running out of space.

127
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,520
So if we want to solve for c--
and I don't like this, this

128
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,510
purple is too dark-- we just
subtract everything from the

129
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,760
other side.

130
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,560
   

131
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,610
So c is going to be equal
to 180 minus 2a

132
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:34,400
minus 2b plus 180.

133
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,220
Because I'm subtracting this
from the other side or that'll

134
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:44,650
make it plus 180
minus b again.

135
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:56,230
So if we simplify this, so c is
equal to 360 minus 2a and

136
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,470
then minus 3b.

137
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,440
Let's see if that's a choice.

138
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,340
Choice E is 360 minus
2a minus 3b.

139
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,020
So I haven't made a silly
error, which I

140
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,670
thought I had made.

141
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,210
So you figure out this angle
in terms of a and b.

142
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,140
You figure out this angle
in terms of a and b.

143
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,590
Then you figure out this angle
in terms of this angle and

144
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,650
this angle.

145
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,690
So you just keep using the
angles of a triangle add up to

146
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,620
180 property of triangles.

147
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,960
Go to the next page.

148
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,390
Oh, and now we're on the
free answer questions.

149
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:35,490
   

150
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,580
All right.

151
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,020
I think we have time
for this one.

152
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,289
9.

153
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:46,120
They say, t to the third
is equal to 351.

154
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,140
What is 4t to the third?

155
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,560
So the slow way of doing
this is to try to

156
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,890
figure out what t is.

157
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,090
The fast way is, well, 4t to the
third, if t to the third

158
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,650
is equal to 351, then 4t to the
third, you just multiply

159
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,290
both sides times 4.

160
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,380
And so 351 times 4,
4 times 1 is 4.

161
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,710
4 times 5 is 20.

162
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,030
3 times 4 is 12.

163
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,790
1404.

164
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,100
That's the answer.

165
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,090
And I have 40 seconds left, so
I'll wait for the next video.

166
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,340
See you soon.

167
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,590
