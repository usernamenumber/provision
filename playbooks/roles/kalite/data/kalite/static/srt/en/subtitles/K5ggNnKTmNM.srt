1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450
   

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,590
All right, we're
on problem 44.

3
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,740
And they said, which is the
factored form of 3a squared

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:15,130
minus 24ab plus 48b squared?

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,085
And if this confuses you with
a's and b's instead of an x

6
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:21,750
there, I just like to think of
in this case, this looks like

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,560
an x squared.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,130
So I like to think of it the
same way I would think of it

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,730
in terms of if this was an x
squared minus some number

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,740
times x plus some
other number.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,280
So let's put that in the
back of your head.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,250
If that's confuses you,
don't worry about it.

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,230
But the first thing I like to
do is try to get rid of the

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,810
coefficient on the, in this
case, the a squared term.

15
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,730
Let's see if we can factor
out a number.

16
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,250
Well, sure.

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,730
All of these are
divisible by 3.

18
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,590
3 is divisible by 3, 24 is
divisible by 3 and 48 is

19
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,230
divisible by 3.

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,810
So we should be able to factor
out a 3, so let's do that.

21
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:55,485
So that is equal to 3 times
a squared minus 8ab.

22
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:58,130
   

23
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,900
24 divided by 3 is
8 and there's a

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,170
minus in front of it.

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,800
Plus 48 divided by-- 3.

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,110
My brain was getting
ahead of me.

27
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,590
48 divided by 3 is
16b squared.

28
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,930
Now to factor this we have to
think about it as, are there

29
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,850
two numbers-- well,
think of it.

30
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,210
Let me rewrite this
a little bit.

31
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,180
If we view a as kind of the
independent variable-- you

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,350
wouldn't have to do it, but I
just wanted you to visualize

33
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,370
it properly.

34
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:32,960
3a squared minus 8b times
a plus 16b squared.

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,240
So if we viewed a squared as
kind of the independent

36
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,560
variable or the x term, so now
this kind of has the shape of

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,900
polynomials that hopefully
you're used to factoring a

38
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,490
little bit.

39
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,170
We just have to think, OK, are
there two numbers that add up

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,590
to minus 8b, and that when I
multiply the two numbers, I

41
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,150
get 16b squared?

42
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,330
So first all, the number
is going to be

43
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,470
in terms of b, obviously.

44
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,590
Because if I'm adding them and
I get a b and-- I get b's.

45
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,300
And if I square them
I get a b squared.

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,600
And it also makes me lead to
it's the same number, just

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,300
used twice.

48
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,729
Otherwise, it would be weird
to get a squared here.

49
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,680
So the number that should pop
out, you say, OK, what two

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,730
numbers add up to minus 8
and that when I square

51
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,890
it is equal to 16?

52
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,870
Minus 4, right?

53
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,250
Minus 4, minus 4 is minus 8.

54
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,430
Minus 4 squared is 16.

55
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,110
So the number we're talking
about is minus 4b, right?

56
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,910
Minus 4b.

57
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,090
b, that's a b.

58
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:35,040
Plus minus 4b is equal
to minus 8b.

59
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,130
And minus 4b squared is
equal to 16b squared.

60
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,310
So we can factor this out to be
3-- let me switch colors.

61
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,390
3 times.

62
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,920
We said minus 4b
is the number.

63
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,610
When you add it twice
you get minus 8b.

64
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,610
And you square it,
you get that.

65
00:02:51,610 --> 00:03:00,900
So it's a minus 4b
times a minus 4b.

66
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,230
And that is choice C.

67
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,340
Next problem, 40--
did I skip 45?

68
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:08,800
I did.

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,990
Let me copy and paste
45 in here.

70
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,290
Can't

71
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:18,320
skip problems. 45.

72
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,150
Copy and paste it in.

73
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,100
OK.

74
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,740
Maybe over do on top
of this one.

75
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,170
Let me see if I can
erase this.

76
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,280
Look at that.

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,080
All right, now I can paste
45 and we're ready to go.

78
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,670
Which is a factor of x squared
minus 11x plus 24?

79
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,710
So there's two ways to do it.

80
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,610
You could just factor this.

81
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,500
Well, that's the easiest way.

82
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,690
Or you could test for 0's.

83
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,560
But we'll just factor.

84
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,750
So if we wanted to say-- well,
let me just-- x squared minus

85
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,340
11x plus 24.

86
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,570
So just like the last problem
you have to say, what two

87
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,470
numbers when I add them equal
to minus 11, and when I

88
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,540
multiply them, is equal
to positive 24?

89
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,920
So first of all, if I'm
multiplying them and I get a

90
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,890
positive 24, they're either
both positive or

91
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,420
they're both negative.

92
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,250
Since this is a negative number
it tells me that they

93
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,010
both have-- I mean they both
can't be positive.

94
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,820
You can't add two positive
numbers and

95
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,890
end up with a negative.

96
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,019
So we're going to deal with
two negative numbers.

97
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,170
So essentially, what two
negative numbers when I add

98
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:22,470
them equals minus 11 and when I
multiplying them equals 24?

99
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,330
And hopefully, 8 and
3 pop out at you.

100
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,750
Because minus 8 plus minus
3 is equal to minus 11.

101
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,600
That's that.

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,300
And then minus 8 times minus
3 is positive 24.

103
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:41,980
So this can be factored as x
minus 8 times x minus 3.

104
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,570
And if we look at their
choices, they

105
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,910
had x minus 3 there.

106
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,590
And of course, don't
get this confused.

107
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,850
If they said, solve this
equation, right?

108
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,900
This is just an expression.

109
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,420
Now it becomes an equation
if we put an equal sign.

110
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,620
Then we would have this equaling
0 and then you could

111
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,597
say the roots of this polynomial
or the solutions to

112
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:02,530
the equation are what
makes this true.

113
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,750
And then the solutions
wouldn't be

114
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,580
minus 8 and minus 3.

115
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,340
The solutions would be
what makes this 0.

116
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,270
So it's be x is equal to 8 would
make this 0, or x is

117
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,540
equal to 3 would make that 0.

118
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,620
But anyway, I'm going off on a
tangent and that's not what

119
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,555
they asked you.

120
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:18,390
But I think that confuses
people sometimes.

121
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,950
OK, 46.

122
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,610
Which of the following shows
9t squared plus 12t plus 4

123
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,620
factored completely?

124
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,410
OK, now this is an interesting
one because immediately, when

125
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,980
I look at the numbers, there's
not one number that I can just

126
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,340
factor out of everything.

127
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,350
9, 12, and 4, they don't have
any common factors, so I can't

128
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,470
just do that simplification.

129
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,880
So we're going to do a little
bit more complexity.

130
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,870
But the best way to think about
is whatever's on the t

131
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:59,110
squared, this is probably kind
of-- this whole expression, if

132
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,800
we're trying to factor it into
two binomials or into one

133
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,870
binomial, this is going to
be the first term of that

134
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,310
binomial squared.

135
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:12,590
So we're going to be dealing
with something like 3t.

136
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,880
I'm just taking the square
root of 9t squared.

137
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,380
3t plus some number.

138
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,870
Let's say plus a.

139
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,150
Times 3t plus b.

140
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,200
And now we can actually
just multiply this out

141
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,520
and see what happens.

142
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,850
Well first of all, they gave
us a multiple choice.

143
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,030
We could just multiply these
out and see what happens.

144
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,280
But let's pretend like that they
didn't give us choices

145
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,810
and we had to do this
in a vacuum.

146
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,170
If we did this in a vacuum,
we would have

147
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,990
to factor it ourselves.

148
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,340
We wouldn't just be able
to test their choices.

149
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,350
Let's do that.

150
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,200
So if we multiply this
out, we have 3t

151
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,790
times 3t is 9t squared.

152
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,700
Then you 3t times b,
so it's plus 3bt.

153
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,320
   

154
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,650
Plus 3at plus ab.

155
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,780
   

156
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,630
So this simplifies to
9t squared plus.

157
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,400
Now what are we adding?

158
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:06,730
Let's see.

159
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,970
It says 3 times, a plus b, t.

160
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:16,380
So it'd be 3 times,
a plus b, t.

161
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,470
I just added these two terms and
I factored out the t and

162
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,410
the 3 plus ab.

163
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,270
Well now we can do a little
pattern matching, right?

164
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:34,840
We could say a plus b times
3 is equal to 12.

165
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,950
So a plus b is equal to what?
a plus b is equal to 12.

166
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,610
This whole coefficient right
here is a 12 up here.

167
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,880
So a plus b, it must
be equal to 4.

168
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,450
   

169
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,160
Because 4 times 3 is equal to
12. a plus b is equal to 4 and

170
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,095
we have a times b is
also equal to 4.

171
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:55,800
   

172
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,980
So the only number that I can
think of when I add them I get

173
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,650
4, when I multiply them
I get 4 is 2 and 2.

174
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,920
Both of these are 2.

175
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,950
So if I were to factor this
completely I get 3t plus 2

176
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,920
squared, essentially.

177
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,750
Because both of these terms
are the same thing, and

178
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,490
that's choice A.

179
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,840
A faster way frankly, to do this
might have just been to

180
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,380
multiply this out and say,
that's the same thing.

181
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,210
Anyway, next problem.

182
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,620
What is the complete
factorization

183
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,400
of 32 minus 8z squared?

184
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,100
So let's think about
this a little bit.

185
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,520
So the first thing that I like
to do once again is to try to

186
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,630
factor out any numbers that are
just common to all of the

187
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,280
terms. So let me do that.

188
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,470
So 32 minus 8z squared.

189
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,980
8 goes into both of
these, right?

190
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,090
So let's factor out an 8.

191
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,650
And actually, let's factor out
a negative 8, and I'll show

192
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,230
you why did that.

193
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,640
Because I like to put the
z squared, I like

194
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,970
that one to be positive.

195
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,710
So let's factor out
a negative 8.

196
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,130
And so you get a minus 8.

197
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,920
And you didn't have
to do that.

198
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,150
You could have just
factored an 8.

199
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,870
What's 32 divided by minus 8?

200
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,110
That's minus 4.

201
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,730
And then minus 8z squared
divided by minus 8 is just

202
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,330
plus z squared.

203
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,010
And so we can rearrange this, so
this becomes minus 8, times

204
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,690
z squared minus 4.

205
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,320
And now I'll review this because
this is an Algebra 1

206
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,360
test, so maybe this isn't
obvious to you.

207
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,870
But in general, if you see
something like this, a plus b

208
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,640
times a minus b-- and this might
be a good exercise for

209
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,990
you to multiply this out.

210
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,420
But this is equal to a squared
minus b squared, because the

211
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,640
middle terms cancel out.

212
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,730
And that's a good exercise
for you to do.

213
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,740
So this has that
same property.

214
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,930
This is a squared
minus b squared.

215
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,450
This is a perfect square.

216
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,720
So then this up here can be
factored as minus 8 times--

217
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,350
this is a squared
minus b squared.

218
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:01,860
So if we could say a
is z and b is 2.

219
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,940
Because then when we would
have z squared minus 2

220
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,520
squared, which is 4.

221
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:15,180
So if a is z, so it's z plus
2 times z minus 2.

222
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,250
This is probably the most common
thing you'll see in a

223
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,720
lot of factoring examples.

224
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,620
You'll see something that has
this pattern, a squared minus

225
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,410
b squared, and you should
easily be able

226
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,120
to recognize it.

227
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,660
You should be able to prove it
to yourself as well that this

228
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,850
is the same thing as a plus
b times a minus b.

229
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,250
Or in this case, z plus
2 times z minus 2.

230
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,630
And that is z minus 2.

231
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,040
So this is interesting.

232
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,900
So I don't see exactly
what we wrote.

233
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,830
I have a minus 8, but we want
a z plus 2 and z minus 2.

234
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,140
But they don't have that.

235
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,400
But what they do have is this--
let me rewrite it.

236
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,750
They don't have any of it, but
maybe they have-- they want

237
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,830
the minus to be multiplied by
one of these other terms. So

238
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,460
what we could do is we could
multiply the minus because

239
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,820
multiplication is associative.

240
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,270
It doesn't matter what
order you do it in.

241
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:08,270
So we could rewrite this as 8
times z plus 2 times minus 1

242
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,640
times z minus 2.

243
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,480
And then this becomes
8 times z plus 2.

244
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,960
This isn't minus 1, this
is times minus 1.

245
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,840
Times what?

246
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,820
Minus z plus 2.

247
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,900
And now I think that
choice is there.

248
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,350
Right.

249
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,790
So we can rewrite this as 8
times 2 plus z-- I'm just

250
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,980
rearranging it-- times
2 minus z.

251
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,410
And then that is choice B.

252
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,980
And so really, given the choices
they gave us, it

253
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,820
probably would have been faster
to just factor out an 8

254
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,600
from the beginning and
not a positive 8.

255
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,800
And you would have immediately
gotten to 2 plus z

256
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,140
times 2 minus z.

257
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,010
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
