99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want to do in this video is explain what parallax, what parallax actually is and then then

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
try to visualize what the parallax would be like in the context of observing relatively nearby stars, and then in the next video

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're going to think about how we can use the parallax of nearby stars to figure out how far they actually

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are away from us. So parallax really is just the apparent change in the position of something based on

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a different line of sight. So when you see that and you just look at, so while you are looking at a car

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you are going to see that depending on how far different things are from you it looks like they're moving

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
relative to each other. Right now I am looking at my computer monitor and if I move my head around

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or shake my head around it looks like the wall behind the computer monitor is moving relative to the

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
computer monitor. We've all experienced this. Let's think about what parallax means when looking at stars.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me draw, let me draw the sun here, and obviously none of this is drawn to scale. So let me draw

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the sun here and let me draw the earth at some point in its orbit around the sun, and we're going to

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pretend that we're looking from above the solar system. The earth will be rotating, the earth will be

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
rotating in this direction right over here; and let's say that the star we care about, the start that

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we care about is right over here. The star that we care about is right over here. Obviously, clearly not

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
drawn to scale. And what we're going to do is we're going to wait until the point in the year, so the

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
point in our orbit around the Earth, so that right at dawn, so we're sitting right here on the surface

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the earth and to simplify things we're on the equator and let's say that this is the stars roughly

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the plane of our solar system. So we're sitting right here, we're sitting right here, on the equator, and

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then right at dawn, right when the first light of the sun, right when the first light of the sun begins

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to reach me; remember that right now the sun is lighting up this side of the earth. So right when the

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
first light of the sun is reaching me, I'm looking, I'm looking straight up. So if I look straight up
