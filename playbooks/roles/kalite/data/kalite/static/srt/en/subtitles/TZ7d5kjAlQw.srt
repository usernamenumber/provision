1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,481
In the last video we saw however we wanted country A to get excited about investing in country B,

2
00:00:05,481 --> 00:00:09,967
they wanted to convert their currency into country B's currency.

3
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:14,433
And left to it's own devices, with this new demand for currency B,

4
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:17,755
it would have made currency B more expensive.

5
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:22,367
But instead of allowing that to happen, the central bank of country B said:

6
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:25,967
"No, no, no, no. I want to keep the exchange rates relatively stable,

7
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:30,404
so I'm going to print B's and use those to buy up A".

8
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:36,434
And so in the end of that video, the central bank of country B ended up with foreign currency reserves,

9
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:42,349
it ended up with some of A's currency in it's balance sheet.

10
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:46,501
What I wanna do in this video is think about what happens if demand goes the other way?

11
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:49,768
And how could the central bank use its foreign currency reserves

12
00:00:49,768 --> 00:00:53,088
to prevent its currency from devaluating.

13
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:58,542
So, let's go to the next stage in this little hypothetical story here.

14
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:03,222
Let's say people in A, so all this investment happened in country B, everyone was all excited,

15
00:01:03,222 --> 00:01:07,168
probably a bubble was forming of some kind.

16
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:10,270
And then, all of a sudden, people of the investors in country A start to get a little bit scared

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,878
they start to hear reports of the bubble forming,

18
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:17,869
they start to realise that conditions in country B weren't as good as

19
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,976
they thought it might have been...

20
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:24,769
Initially, they start to panic and they start going to unwind their investments

21
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:27,268
so whatever they had in country B they wanna sell it

22
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:31,772
they get B's currency for it, and they wanna convert that to their home currency

23
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:36,100
so now you have the reverse situation of what we saw on the last video.

24
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,592
Everyone wants so sell their B's, so they invested in country B,

25
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:44,019
maybe they bought some real state there, they're gonna sell their real state

26
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,476
and they're gonna get B for it.

27
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:47,643
And then they're going to get out of that country's currency.

28
00:01:47,643 --> 00:01:50,835
They're going to wanna convert that money back into A.

29
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:52,628
But this is the opposite situation.

30
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:54,471
Now everyone wants to run out of country B

31
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:59,967
and there isn't a lot of supply of A in return.

32
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:02,300
And no one's really looking to trade A for B now.

33
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,435
The market is going completely in the opposite direction.

34
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:12,430
Now, if, once again, foreign exchange markets were allowed to float freely,

35
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,165
what would happen?

36
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:16,233
Well, in this situation, all the demand is in for the A's

37
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:24,302
and all supplies on the B, so you would have either more (let me write this)

38
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:39,426
fewer A's per B, or you could have more B's per A.

39
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:43,501
In general, A has now become more expensive in terms of B

40
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:49,504
or B has become cheaper in terms of A.

41
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:52,028
But let's say you're the central bank and you're like "I don't like this either"

42
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:55,233
Now, all of a sudden, specially if usually in unwinding

43
00:02:55,233 --> 00:03:00,634
this panic happens as much faster and in more dramatic fashion than the initial face over here

44
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:05,433
You say: "Oh my God, people in our country, they might not be able to, if this were to happen,

45
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:10,769
foreign imports would become so expensive people might not be able to even affort food

46
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,205
that we have to import from other countries or essential suplies from other countries".

47
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:18,147
So they say: "No, we're going to intervene. We were able to accumulate

48
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:24,147
some of this foreign country reserves and so we can use those now to try to stabilize our currency".

49
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:26,901
So in this situation, what the central bank would to is say:

50
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:31,302
"Okay, I've got some reserves of A. What I'm going to do is I'm going to do to the open market

51
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:43,903
and also sell my reserves of A and try to equalize the supply and the demand".

52
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:46,627
And so once again if they're able to sell this reserves,

53
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:50,230
now, all of a sudden, their currency will not devalue

54
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,102
or maybe not devalue as much.

55
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:59,433
Now, the one kink in the system here is that they only have a finite amount of reserves.

56
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:02,368
This, right over here, is finite.

57
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:06,242
In the previous video, when we saw that they were printing their own currency to buy,

58
00:04:06,242 --> 00:04:08,894
to build reserves, they could do this all day all night,

59
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:12,501
because they have the right to print as much as their own currency as they want.

60
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:18,325
But now they're using reserves of someone else's currency to keep their own currency from being devalued.

61
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,967
But they can't print someone else's currency.

62
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:26,575
So they're hoping that what they have on hand is enough to fight this

63
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:29,340
(what they're probably percieving as a short imbalance)

64
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,992
but it could be scary. What happens if all of this currency runs out?

65
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:37,834
Then they blow all of their currency reserves and if this kind of panic keeps occuring,

66
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:43,502
then you're going to go back to the free market forces and their currency will have to devalue.

67
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:51,568
So that's how central banks attempt to keep their currencies relativaly stable.

68
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:57,658
In future videos we'll go through real cases of when this hapened and what exactly happened

69
00:04:57,658 --> 00:05:00,325
when the foreign currency reserves ran out

70
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:03,612
and how speculators could use their knowledge to essentially

71
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:07,612
make an easy speculative bug.
