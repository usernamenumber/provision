1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:09,985
If the distance between the plane Ax-2y+z = d and the plane containing the lines,

2
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:12,585
and they give us two lines here in three-dimensions,

3
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:18,084
if that distance is square-root of 6, then the absolute value of d is...

4
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:25,472
So let's think about it for a little bit. They're talking about the distance between this plane and some

5
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:28,625
plane that contains these two line.

6
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:33,331
So in order to talk realistically about the distance between the planes, those planes will have to be

7
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:37,928
parallel, because if they're not parallel - if they intersect with each other, the distance is clearly

8
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:41,821
zero, and they're telling us here that the distance is square-root of 6.

9
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:46,143
So we have a situation so that the planes can't intersect they must be parallel.

10
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:53,431
So you have this plane up here, you have this plane up here, you could call this the equation here

11
00:00:53,431 --> 00:01:01,510
is ax - 2y + z = d, and then you're going to have another plane, that's going to be parallel to it,

12
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,403
maybe it looks something like this. You have the other plane that is parallel, and it's going to contain

13
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:14,843
both of these lines. So maybe it has this line - so this line is in green, maybe this line looks something

14
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:23,045
like this, it's on that blue plane. And then this line, maybe in magenta, is also going to be on the

15
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:26,912
blue plane. So how can we figure out the distances?

16
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:33,996
Well a good starting point would be to try to figure out the equation for this blue plane here.

17
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:40,659
And since these planes are parallel, this equation should look very much like this orange equation -

18
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:44,597
at least on the left-hand-side, it might just have a different d-value, and that's because it has the

19
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:52,338
exact same inclination. And then once we figure out the equation for this plane over here, then we could

20
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:58,852
actually probably figure out what 'a' is, then we could find some point on the blue plane and then use

21
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:05,550
our knowledge of finding the distance points and planes to figure out the actual distance from any point

22
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,454
to this orange plane.

23
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:12,354
So let's figure out the equation of this blue plane first, and a good place to start is just to try to

24
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:19,624
figure out two vectors on this blue plane, then we can take the cross-product of those two vectors to

25
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:24,707
find out a normal to this blue plane, and then use that information to actually figure out the

26
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:26,982
equation for the blue plane.

27
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:31,047
So let's figure out some points that sit on the blue plane.

28
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:37,315
So on this green line right over here you have, see if I want all of these to be equal to zero, you'd

29
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:46,492
have the point x is equal to 1, y is equal to 2, z is equal to 3, so you have the point (1,2,3) - that definitely sits

30
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:52,199
on the blue plane. Let's come up with another point. let's see if I want all of these to be equal to

31
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:59,931
one, I could make this, if I want this to evaluate to two, I'd have the point three, I would have the point,

32
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:07,942
if I want this to evaluate to one, I would want five minus two over three, so 3, 5, and then I would want this

33
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:16,557
to be seven. Seven minus three over four is also 1, so that's another point, actually both of these points sit on this

34
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:24,508
line right over here. 1,2,3 and then 3,5,7. And then let's do the same thing for this - let's find two

35
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:29,723
points on this plane, and actually we just need to find one point on this plane, because if you have

36
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:35,677
three points that's enough to figure out two different vectors -vectors that aren't scalar multiples

37
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:39,638
of each other, which would be enough to figure out the normal to this plane.

38
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:44,215
So let's just figure out one more point over here and one more point would be, if we want all of these

39
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:47,556
three to be equal to zero, would be the point (2,3,4).

40
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,667
Because this would be zero, zero, zero. So that's also sitting the plane and that sits on the magenta

41
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,026
line right over there.

42
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:03,461
So let's use these three points to figure out two vectors on the plane that aren't multiples of each

43
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:11,333
other, then we can take their cross-product to actually figure out a normal vector to the blue plane.

44
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:16,788
So let's say the first vector, 'a', that sits on this plane, let's say it's the difference in the position

45
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:21,526
vectors that specify these two points, and then we know that will be on the plane.

46
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:37,362
And so that will be three minus one is 2i plus five minus two is 3j, plus seven minus three is 4k.

47
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:44,014
So vector 'a' is actually going to sit on this green line, because both of these points are on this line,

48
00:04:44,014 --> 00:04:48,554
so it's going to sit on that line. If we put it on the plane or if we were to start it at one of those

49
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,667
points it will sit on that line.

50
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:55,636
And then we can do another vector, and it's essentially going between a point on the green line and a

51
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:59,862
point on the purple line, but that's definitely going to be a vector on our blue plane.

52
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:04,718
Let's go between these two points - that looks pretty straight-forward, so let's call vector b,

53
00:05:07,902 --> 00:05:21,480
so let's call vector b, let's call that, let's see, two minus one is 'i', three minus two is 'j', and then four minus three, that's just 1k.

54
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:29,375
So this vector here is also sitting on the plane. So if I take the cross-product of 'a' and 'b' I am

55
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:34,656
going to get a vector that is perpendicular to the plane, or a normal vector to the plane.

56
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:43,493
So let's do that. So let's find what 'a' cross 'b' is. 'a' cross 'b' is equal to - and this is how I

57
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:49,223
find it easiest - I just write 'i', 'j', 'k', this is really the definition of the cross product, or

58
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:56,194
I guess one of them. And we write our first vector, we have 2, 3, 4, and then we have our second vector,

59
00:05:56,194 --> 00:06:02,968
which is just 1,1,1, and then this is going to be equal to, first we'll look at the 'i' component, so

60
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:04,941
cross that row, that column out.

61
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:13,029
three times one minus one times four, so that's just three minus four, so it's negative 'i', and then

62
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:19,089
minus, we're going to have the 'j', so let we write up minus here, minus , let me just swap signs, we

63
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:23,454
have positive, negative, positive, so 'j' , get rid of that column, that row,

64
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:28,725
two times one which is two, minus one times four, so that's minus four, is negative 2,

65
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:33,927
so we could have written negative 2 here, but the negatives cancel out, so it becomes plus 2j,

66
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:39,778
and finally for the 'k', get rid of that row that column, two times one is two, minus one times three,

67
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:44,352
is two minus three, which is negative one, so it's negative k.

68
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:52,270
So this right here is a normal vector to the plane.

69
00:06:52,270 --> 00:07:00,389
So if we want to find the equation for that plane, we've done it multiple times, we'd just have to take

70
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:13,609
the dot product of that normal vector and any arbitrary vector on that that specified that we can specify

71
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:17,859
with with an arbitrary x y and z, and we've done this multiple times in multiple videos.

72
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:29,097
If this is any point, x, y, z, that sits on the plane, then the vector - let me draw the vector, let's

73
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:34,740
say we go to this point right over here, so this vector right over here is going to be

74
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,639
- let me draw it the other way actually, so this vector right over here, let's say we're going between

75
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:53,014
this point and x,y,z, this vector right here is going to be x minus three i, plus y minus five j, plus

76
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,369
z minus 7 k.

77
00:07:56,385 --> 00:08:01,119
That's what this vector is, it sits on the plane, assuming x,y and z sit on the plane.

78
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:06,458
So if we take the dot product of this and the normal vector that has got to be equal to zero,

79
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,430
because it sits on the plane, and then we'll have our equation.

80
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:23,806
So let's take 'n' dot that over there, so n dot x minus three i, plus y minus five j, plus z minus seven k.

81
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:28,540
If any of this is confusing to you, I've gone into a little bit more depth in previous videos,

82
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,348
especially in the linear algebra playlist where I talk about constructing the equation of a plane given

83
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:38,177
a point on the plane and a normal vector, and even how you find that normal vector,

84
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:40,720
so you might want to watch those if you want some review there.

85
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,698
But these are going to be equal to zero, so when you take the dot product, n, our normal vector is this,

86
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:51,087
so we just take the x term, which is negative one, times this x term right over here,

87
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:58,749
so negative one times this is just three minus x, and then plus this y component times this y component,

88
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:05,785
so it's two times this, so it's plus two y minus ten, and then finally the z component -

89
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:15,979
negative one times this. So this is plus seven minus z is equal to zero, and what do we get?

90
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:27,496
So we have our negative x, plus two y, minus z, and then is equal to, let's subtract three from both sides

91
00:09:27,496 --> 00:09:35,251
So if we take it out there it will be minus three. If we add ten to both sides, so then you have

92
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:43,401
a plus ten over here, and then we subtract seven from both sides, this becomes a minus seven

93
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:50,689
So then on the right-hand-side, negative three plus ten minus seven, well that's just going to be zero!

94
00:09:50,689 --> 00:10:04,276
And just like that we have the equation for this blue plane over here - the plane that contains these two lines.

95
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:08,511
Now remember what we said at the beginning of the video - these two planes are parallel, so the ratio

96
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,655
of the coefficients on the 'x' terms, the 'y' term and the 'z' term has got to be the same.

97
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,739
So this one has a positive 2, that has a negative 2, this is just to simplify it, so it looks very similar

98
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:25,476
to each other. Let's multiple this equation right here, both sides, by negative one. And then we're going

99
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:34,698
to get x minus two y plus z is equal to zero; so this is a completely valid, another alternate way of

100
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:39,129
expressing the same plane. And what like about this about this is that it looks very similar to this -

101
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:46,304
at least the ratio of the x, y's and z's, negative two y, negative two y; one z, one z, and remember

102
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:47,860
the ratios have to be the same.

103
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,945
So here we have a one-to-one ratio between the z-coefficient and the z-coefficient, the y-coefficient

104
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:56,335
and the y-coefficient, so it's also going to be for the x coefficient.

105
00:10:56,335 --> 00:11:01,885
So here we know if this is going to be parallel to the blue plane we know that 'a' has got to be equal

106
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:03,301
to one.

107
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:18,342
So this is x minus two y plus z is equal to d. So now let's figure out the actual distance between these

108
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:24,942
two planes. So what we can do is we can take a point on this blue plane - and we have several examples

109
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:30,469
of points on the blue plane, and find the distance between that point and this plane over here.

110
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:35,600
And actually I just finished doing some videos on how to find the distance between a point and a plane,

111
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,780
so I'm just going to use that formula (if you want it to be proved go watch that video - it's actually

112
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:47,127
pretty interesting proof I think) but the distance between let's say this point, (1,2,3), and this plane

113
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:52,179
over here, so this distance right here is going to be in the direction of the normal,

114
00:11:52,179 --> 00:12:08,364
the distance is going to be, you literally just evaluate this, let me do it this way:

115
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:14,331
you literally just put in this point for the x, y and z, and then you subtract the d in the numerator,

116
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:20,229
and we saw that as the formula for finding the distance. So it's literally going to be one, one,

117
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:23,062
(I'm actually using this point right over here)

118
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:27,218
So it's going to be one, one, because we just have one x so it's just going to be one minus two times

119
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:39,432
two, one minus four (that's two times two), plus three, minus d, over here the d is just d, so we're

120
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:46,235
just going to write minus d, just like that, all of that over what is essentially the magnitude of the

121
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:50,601
normal vector, and we saw in several videos that's just the square of the coefficients on each of these

122
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:54,409
terms right here, and taking the sum of those, taking the square root,

123
00:12:54,409 --> 00:13:05,267
so it's going to be equal to: 1 squared, plus negative 2 squared which is four, plus one squared which is one.

124
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:13,008
So this is going to simplify to the distance is equal to one minus four plus three is zero.

125
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:21,200
So in the numerator we have negative d, all of that over the square root of one plus four plus one,

126
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:30,949
so all over the square root of six. So they say the distance

127
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:36,506
between this plane and this plane over here is square root of six. So they're saying the distance is

128
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:44,953
equal to the square root of six, that's what this information right over here is, maybe I should do that

129
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:47,466
in another colour.

130
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:55,431
The distance between the two planes is going to be the square root of six, and so then if we solve for d,

131
00:13:55,431 --> 00:14:01,352
multiple both sides of this equation times the square root of six, you get six is equal to negative d,

132
00:14:01,352 --> 00:14:07,203
or d is equal to negative six.

133
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:12,079
Now, what they care about is the absolute value of d, or the absolute distance, so this would be kinda

134
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,818
the signed distance - it specifies whether we're above or below the plane.

135
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:19,696
Since we're below the plane we got a negative number - I just happened to draw it right, if we above

136
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:22,366
the plane we would get a positive number.

137
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:27,730
So this distance is negative six, the absolute value of it, the absolute value of d which is the same

138
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,724
as the absolute value of negative six, is equal to six.

139
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:38,759
So take any point on this blue plane and you look for the closest point on the orange plane, and they

140
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:44,402
will be exactly six apart. Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.
