1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,520
So we have this rectangle right over here,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,870
we call it, the length of AB is equal to 1

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,690
So that's labeled right over there, AB is equal to 1

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,330
And they tell us that BE and BD trisect angle ABC

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:20,300
So BE and BD trisect angle ABC

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,930
So trisect means dividing it into 3 equal angles

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,960
So that means that this angel, is equal to this angle,

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,530
is equal to that angle

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,830
What they want us to figure out is,

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,650
what is the perimeter of triangle BED, triangle BED

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,260
So it's kinda this middle triangle and the rectangle right over here

12
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,870
So at first it seems like a pretty hard problem,

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,250
because you're like, what is the width of this rectangle

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,320
how can I start on this, they've given only one side here

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,220
They've actually given us a lot of information,

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,240
given that we do know that this is a rectangle

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,940
We have four sides and then we have four angles,

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,520
the sides are all parallel to each other

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,510
and the angels are all 90 degrees,

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,990
which is more than enough information

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,060
to know that this is definitely a rectangle

22
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,420
And so one thing we do know that,

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,890
the opposite sides of a rectangle are the same length

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,470
This side is 1, then this side over there is 1

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,610
The other thing we know is that this angle is trisected

26
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,570
Now we know what the measure of this angle is

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,110
It was a right angle, it was a 90 degrees angle

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,080
So this divide into 3 equal parts,

29
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,000
that tells us that this angle is 30 degrees

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,380
this angle right over is 30 degrees

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,940
and this angle right over here is 30 degrees

32
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,570
And now we see we're dealing with a couple of 30, 60, 90 triangles

33
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:40,320
So this is other side over here needs to be 60 degrees

34
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,240
So that side right over there needs to be 60 degrees

35
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,850
This triangle over here, you have 30, you have 90,

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,080
so this was one have to be 60 degrees, you have to add up to 180

37
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,870
30, 60, 90 triangle

38
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,590
30, 60, 90 triangle,

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,470
and you can also figure out the measure of this triangle

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,940
although its not gonna be a right triangle

41
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,720
But knowing what we know about 30, 60, 90 triangles,

42
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,300
if we just have one side of them

43
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,500
we can actually figure out the other sides

44
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,030
So for example, here, we have the shortest side,

45
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,660
we have the side opposite of 30 degree side,

46
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,450
now whatever, if the 30 degree side is 1

47
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,870
then the 60 degree side is gonna be squared 3 times that

48
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,780
So this length right over here is gonna be squared to 3

49
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,210
And that's pretty useful because now we've figured out

50
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,500
the length of the entire base of this rectangle right over there

51
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,950
Now we just used our knowledge of 30, 60, 90 triangles

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
if you see, if that was a little bit mysterious,

53
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,900
how I come up with that

54
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,450
I encourage you to watch that video

55
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:40,210
We know that 30, 60, 90 triangles,

56
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,360
there side are in the range of 1 to the square root of 3 to 2

57
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,950
So this is 1 this is a 30 degree side

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,990
this is gonna be square root of 3 times that

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,090
and the hypotenuse right over here is going to be 2 times that

60
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,790
So this length over here is going to be 2 times,

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,280
the side right over here, so 2 times 1 is just 2

62
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,290
So that's pretty interesting, let's see if we can do something

63
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,370
similar with this side right over here

64
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,570
Here the 1 is not the side opposite of the 30 degree side

65
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,390
Here the 1 is the side opposite of the 60 degree side

66
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,730
This is the 1 opposite the 60 degree side

67
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,540
So once again, if we multiply this side by square root of 3,

68
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,850
we should get this side right over here

69
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,570
This is the 60, remember this 1, so right over here, this 1,

70
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,500
this is the 60 degree side,

71
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,270
so this has to be 1 over square root of 3 of this side

72
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,200
Let me write this down 1 over the square root of 3

73
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,130
And the whole reason, why I was able to get this is well

74
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,130
whatever this side is I multiply it by the square root of 3

75
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,940
I should get this side right over here,

76
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,240
I should get the 60 degree side, the beside the 60 degree angle

77
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,180
or if I take the 60 degree side if I divide it by the square root of 3

78
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,320
I should get the shortest side, the 30 degree side

79
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,380
I start with the 60 degree side, divided by square root of 3,

80
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,370
I get that right over there

81
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,260
And then the hypotenuse is always gonna be twice

82
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,950
the length of the side opposite the 30 degree angle

83
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,880
So this is a side opposite the 30 degree angle,

84
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,110
the hypotenuse is always twice that

85
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,150
So this is a side opposite the 30 degree angle,

86
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,070
the hypotenuse is always twice that

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,780
It is gonna be 2 over the square root of 3

88
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,870
So we're doing pretty good,

89
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,200
we have to figure out the perimeter of this inner triangle

90
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:22,770
right over here

91
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,650
We already figured out one length is 2,

92
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,110
we figure out another length is 2 over square roots of 3

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,530
And then, all we have to really figure out is what ED is

94
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,760
And we can do that it's because AD

95
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,020
is gonna be the same thing as BC

96
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,180
We know that this entire length,

97
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,250
we're dealing with a rectangle is the square root of 3

98
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,490
This entire length, the entire length of the square root of 3

99
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,170
if this part, this AE is 1 over square root of 3,

100
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,160
then this length right over here, ED is gonna be square root of 3

101
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,630
minus 1 over the square root of 3

102
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,750
That length minus that length over there

103
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,810
And now to find the perimeter is pretty straight forward,

104
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,070
we just have to add these things up and simplify it

105
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,580
So it's gonna be two, so let me write this perimeter

106
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,670
of triangle BED is equal to, this is sort of, perimeter

107
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,890
I just didn't feel writing the whole word,

108
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,770
is equal to two over the square root of 3

109
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,030
plus square root of 3 minus 1 over the square root of 3,

110
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,830
minus 1 over the square root of 3 plus 2

111
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,320
And now this just boils down to simplifying radicals

112
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,490
you can take a calculator out

113
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,030
and get some type of decimal approximation for it

114
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,670
Let's see, we have two square root of 3 minus one square root of 3,

115
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,080
that'll leave us with one, one over the square root of 3

116
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,630
2 square of 1/3, I should say, 2 over square root of 3

117
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,200
minus 1 over square root of 3, 1 over square root of 3,

118
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,600
and then we have plus the square root of 3 plus 2

119
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,010
Now let's see I can rationalize this

120
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,280
if I multiply the numerator

121
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,040
and the denominator by the square root of 3

122
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,250
This would get me the square root of 3

123
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,300
over 3 plus the square root of 3

124
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,670
which is, I can rewrite that as, plus 3 square root of 3 over 3

125
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,420
Right I just multiplied this 3 over 3

126
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:16,090
Plus 2 and so this give us, this is the drum roll part now

127
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,160
so 1 square root of 3 plus 3 square root of 3

128
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:26,040
and all that over 3 gives us 4 square roots of 3 over 3 plus 2

129
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,160
Where you can put the 2 first,

130
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,010
some people like to write the non-irrational part

131
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,570
before the irrational part

132
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,110
But we're done we figured out the perimeter

133
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,380
of this inner triangle BED, right there
