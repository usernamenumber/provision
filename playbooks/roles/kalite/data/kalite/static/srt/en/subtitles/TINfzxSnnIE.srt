1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
99.9...% of mathematicians agree

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
0.9... equals 1.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If because I said so works for you you can go ahead and do something else now.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe you're like 0.9... equals one?

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's just 0.9...derful!

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Otherwise on to reason number 2,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or reason 1.9...

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
See, it's weird because when we think of the number 1 or 2

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in most contexts we mean it as a natural number like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In this sense that the next number after 1 is 2.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
9.9... may equal 10 but you wouldn't say you had 9.9... lords-a-leaping

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the same way you wouldn't say you had 9.75 plus a quarter lord-a-leaping.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lords, leaping or otherwise come in natural numbers.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what does this statement mean?

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
0.9... is the same as 1?

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It looks pretty different,

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it equals one in the same way that a half equals 0.5.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They have the same value.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can philosophize over wether, if 1 is the loneliest number,

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
0.78 plus 0.22 is just as lonely.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but there is no mathematical doubt that they have the same value.
