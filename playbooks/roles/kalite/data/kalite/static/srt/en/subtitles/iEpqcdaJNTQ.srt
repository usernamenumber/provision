1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
   

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,650
Now I introduce you to the
concept of exact equations.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,470
And it's just another method for
solving a certain type of

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,370
differential equations.

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,220
Let me write that down.

6
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,610
Exact equations.

7
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,620
   

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,710
Before I show you what an exact
equation is, I'm just

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,050
going to give you a little bit
of the building blocks, just

10
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,970
so that when I later prove it,
or at least give you the

11
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,260
intuition behind it, it doesn't
seem like it's coming

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,080
out of the blue.

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,500
So let's say I had some function
of x and y, and we'll

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,430
call it psi, just because that's
what people tend to use

15
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,080
for these exact equations.

16
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,220
So psi is a function
of x and y.

17
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,280
   

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,280
So you're probably not familiar
with taking the chain

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,870
rule onto partial derivatives,
but I'll show it to you now,

20
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,030
and I'll give you a little
intuition, although

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,950
I won't prove it.

22
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,210
So if I were to take the
derivative of this with

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,010
respect to x, where y is also
function of x, I could also

24
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,709
write this as y-- sorry,
it's not y, psi.

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,130
Undo.

26
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,890
So I could also write this as
psi, as x and y, which is a

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,760
function of x.

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,820
I could write it
just like that.

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,940
These are just two
different ways of

30
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,990
writing the same thing.

31
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,440
Now, if I were to take the
derivative of psi with respect

32
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,100
to x-- and these are just the
building blocks-- if I were to

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,020
take the derivative of psi with
respect to x, it is equal

34
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,410
to-- this is the chain rule
using partial derivatives.

35
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,820
And I won't prove it, but
I'll give you the

36
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,390
intuition right here.

37
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,410
So this is going to be equal to
the partial derivative of

38
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:45,980
psi with respect to x plus the
partial derivative of psi with

39
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,780
respect to y times dy dx.

40
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,300
   

41
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,720
And this is should make a
little bit of intuition.

42
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,470
I'm kind of taking the
derivative with respect to x,

43
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,410
and if you could say, and I know
you can't, because this

44
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,190
partial with respect to
y, and the dy, they're

45
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,860
two different things.

46
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,540
But if these canceled out,
then you'd kind of have

47
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,590
another partial with
respect to x.

48
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,030
And if you were to kind of add
them up, then you would get

49
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,040
the full derivative
with respect to x.

50
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,600
That's not even the intuition,
that's just to show you that

51
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,970
even this should make a little
bit of intuitive sense.

52
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,280
Now the intuition here, let's
just say psi, and psi doesn't

53
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,380
always have to take this form,
but you could use this same

54
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,600
methodology to take psi to
more complex notations.

55
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,560
But let's say that psi, and
I won't write that it's a

56
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,300
function of x and y.

57
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,320
We know that it's a function
of x and y.

58
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,190
Let's say it's equal to some
function of x, we'll call that

59
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,480
f1 of x, times some
function of y.

60
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,050
And let's say there's a bunch
of terms like this.

61
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,780
So there's n terms like this,
plus all the way to the nth

62
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:02,660
term is the nth function of x
times the nth function of y.

63
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,570
I just defined psi like this
just so I can give you the

64
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,380
intuition that when I use
implicit differentiation on

65
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,000
this, when I take the derivative
of this with

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,450
respect to x, I actually
get something that

67
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,850
looks just like that.

68
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,260
So what's the derivative of
psi with respect to x?

69
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,190
   

70
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,700
And this is just the implicit
differentiation that you

71
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,780
learned, or that you hopefully
learned, in your first

72
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,640
semester calculus course.

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,150
That's equal, and we just do
the product rule, right?

74
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,500
So the first expression, you
take the derivative of that

75
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,540
with respect to x.

76
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,970
Well, that's just going to be f1
prime of x times the second

77
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,650
function, well, that's
just g1 of y.

78
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,640
Now you add that to the
derivative of the second

79
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,690
function times the
first function.

80
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,500
So plus f1 of x, that's just the
first function, times the

81
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,690
derivative of the
second function.

82
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,280
Now the derivative of the second
function, it's going to

83
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,030
be this function with
respect to y.

84
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,015
So you could write that
as g1 prime of y.

85
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,050
But of course, we're doing
the chain rule.

86
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,930
So it's that times dy dx.

87
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,149
And you might want to review the
implicit differentiation

88
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,399
videos if that seems a
little bit foreign.

89
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,430
But this right here, what I
just did, this expression

90
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,070
right here, this is the
derivative with

91
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,570
respect to x of this.

92
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,040
And we have n terms like that.

93
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,170
So if we keep adding them, I'll
do them vertically down.

94
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,630
So plus, and then you have a
bunch of them, and the last

95
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,320
one's going to look the
same, it's just the

96
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,660
nth function of x.

97
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:49,400
So fn prime of x times the
second function, g n of y,

98
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,930
plus the first function, fn of
x, times the derivative of the

99
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,580
second function.

100
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,350
The derivative of the second
function with respect to y is

101
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,980
just g prime of y times dy dx.

102
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,650
It's just a chain rule.

103
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,620
dy dx.

104
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,440
Now, we have two n terms. We
have n terms here, right,

105
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,260
where each term was a f of x
times a g of y, or f1 of x

106
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,040
times g1 of y, and then
all the way to fn of

107
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,590
x times gn of y.

108
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,150
Now for each of those, we got
two of them when we did the

109
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,220
product rule.

110
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,850
If we group the terms, so if
we group all the terms that

111
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,500
don't have a dy dx on them,
what do we get?

112
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,430
If we add all of these, I guess
you could call them on

113
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:42,010
the left hand side, I'm just
rearranging, it all equals f1

114
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:54,660
prime of x times g1 of y, plus
f2, g2, all the way to fn

115
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,770
prime, I'm sorry, fn prime
of x, gn of y.

116
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,900
That's just all of these
added up, plus all

117
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,890
of these added up.

118
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:13,080
All the terms that have
the dy dx in them.

119
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,640
And I'll do them in
a different color.

120
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,080
So all of these terms
are going to be

121
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,092
in a different color.

122
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:21,880
I'll do it in a different
parentheses.

123
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:30,990
Plus f1 of x g1 prime of y, and
I'll do the dy dx later,

124
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,100
I'll distribute it out.

125
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:41,370
Plus, and we have n terms, plus
fn of x gn prime of y,

126
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:47,200
and then all of these terms
are multiplied by dy dx.

127
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,080
Now, something looks
interesting here.

128
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,240
We originally defined our psi,
up here, as this right here,

129
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,090
but what is this green term?

130
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,470
Well, what we did is we took all
of these individual terms,

131
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,800
and these green terms here are
just taking the derivative

132
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,400
with respect to just x on each
of these terms. Because if you

133
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,340
take the derivative just with
respect to x of this, then the

134
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,890
function of y is just
a constant, right?

135
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,900
If you were to take just a
partial derivative with

136
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,310
respect to x.

137
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,220
So if you took the partial
derivative with respect to x

138
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,740
of this term, you treat a
function of y as a constant.

139
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,360
So the derivative of this would
just be f prime of x, g1

140
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,080
of y, because g1 of y
is just a constant.

141
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,060
And so forth and so on.

142
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,410
All of these green terms you
can view as a partial

143
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,430
derivative of psi with
respect to x.

144
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,090
We just pretended like
y is a constant.

145
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,600
And that same logic, if you
ignore this, if you just look

146
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,890
at this part right here,
what is this?

147
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:52,000
We took psi, up here, we treated
the functions of x as

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,880
a constant, and we just took
the partial derivative with

149
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,870
respect to y.

150
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,055
And that's why the primes
are on all the g's.

151
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:03,060
And then we multiply
that times dy dx.

152
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,360
So you could write this, this
is equal to-- I'll do this

153
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,730
green-- this green is the same
thing as the partial of psi

154
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,830
with respect to x.

155
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:21,140
Plus, what's this purple,
this part of the purple?

156
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,850
Let me do it in a different
color, in magenta.

157
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:32,409
This, right here, is the partial
of psi with respect to

158
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,799
y, and then times dy dx.

159
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,890
   

160
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,624
So that's essentially all I
wanted to show you right now

161
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,150
in this video, because
I realize I'm almost

162
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,700
running out of time.

163
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,530
That the chain rule, with
respect to one of the

164
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:53,620
variables, but the second
variable in the function is

165
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,140
also a function of x, the
chain rule is this.

166
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,590
If psi is a function of x and
y, and I would take not a

167
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,380
partial derivative, I would take
the full derivative of

168
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,620
psi with respect to x, it's
equal to the partial of psi

169
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,830
with respect to x, plus the
partial of psi with respect to

170
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,180
y, times dy dx.

171
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,250
If y wasn't a function of x, or
if y if it was independent

172
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,740
of x, than dy dx would be 0.

173
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,220
And this term would be 0, and
then the derivative of psi

174
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,460
with respect to x would be just
the partial of psi with

175
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,170
respect to x.

176
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,140
But anyway, I want you to
just keep this in mind.

177
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,770
And in this video I didn't prove
it, but I hopefully gave

178
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,630
you a little intuition if
I didn't confuse you.

179
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,020
And we're going to use this
property in the next series of

180
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,190
videos to understand exact
equations a little bit more.

181
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,710
I realize that in this video I
just got as far as kind of

182
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,610
giving you an intuition here.

183
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,810
I haven't told you yet what
an exact equation is.

184
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,400
I will see you in
the next video.

185
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,500
