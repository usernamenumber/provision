1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:07,310
We need to factor negative 4t
squared minus 12t minus 9.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,290
And a good place to start is
to say, well, are there any

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,460
common factors for all
of these terms?

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,270
When you look at them, well
these first two are divisible

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,980
by 4, these last 2 are divisible
by 3, but not all of

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,920
them are divisible
any one number.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,270
Will, but you could factor out
a negative 1, but even if you

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,550
factor out a negative 1-- so you
say this is the same thing

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,990
as negative 1, times positive
4t squared plus 12t plus 9--

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,050
you still end up with a non-one
coefficient out here

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,120
and on the second degree term,
on the t squared term.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,200
So you might want
to immediately

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,110
start grouping this.

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,830
And if you did factor it by
grouping, it would work, you

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,500
would get the right answer.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,550
But there is something about
this equation that might pop

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,080
out at you that might make it a
little bit simpler to solve.

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,540
And to understand that, let's
take a little bit of a break

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,680
here on the right hand side,
and just think about what

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,690
happens if you take a plus b
times a plus b, if you just

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,060
have a binomial squared.

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,060
Well you have a times a,
which is a squared.

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,070
Then you have a times that
b, which is plus ab.

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,310
Then you have b times a, which
is the same thing is ab.

26
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,815
And then you have b times b,
or you have b squared.

27
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:28,360
And so if you add these middle
two terms, right here, you're

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,850
left with a squared plus
2ab plus b squared.

29
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,150
This is the square
of a binomial.

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,990
Now, does this right here, does
4t squared plus 12t plus

31
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,400
9 fit this pattern?

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,020
Well the 4t squared
is a squared.

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,080
So this right here
is a squared.

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,180
If that is a squared right
there, then what

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,345
does a have to be?

36
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,450
If this is a squared, then a
would be equal to the square

37
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,150
root of this.

38
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,940
It would be 2t.

39
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,100
And if this is b squared,
let me do that

40
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,940
in a different color.

41
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:07,670
If this right here is b
squared, if the 9 is b

42
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,110
squared, right there,
then that means that

43
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,170
b is equal to 3.

44
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,400
It's equal to the positive
square root of the 9.

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,430
Now, this number, right here--
and actually it doesn't have

46
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,150
to just be equal to 3,
it might have been

47
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,430
negative 3 as well.

48
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,240
It could be plus or minus 3.

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,000
But this number here,
is it 2 times ab?

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,330
Right?

51
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,650
That's the middle term
that we care about.

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,010
Is it 2 times ab?

53
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,890
Well if we multiply 2t
times 3, we get 6t.

54
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,260
And then if we multiply that
times 2, you get 12t.

55
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:48,600
This right here, 12t, is equal
to 2 times 2t times 3.

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,960
It is 2 times ab.

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,060
And if this was a negative 3,
we would look to see if this

58
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,010
was a negative 12, but this
does work for positive 3.

59
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,030
So this it does fit the pattern
of a perfect square.

60
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:05,060
This is a square
of a binomial.

61
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,590
So if you wanted to factor
this-- the stuff on the

62
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,940
inside, you still have that
negative 1 out there, the 4t

63
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,490
squared plus 12t plus 9-- you
could immediately say, well

64
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,880
that's going to be a plus
b times a plus b.

65
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:29,570
Or 2t plus 3 times 2t plus 3, or
you could just say, it's 2t

66
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,330
plus 3 squared.

67
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,350
It fits this pattern.

68
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,270
And, of course, you can't
forget about this

69
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,450
negative 1 out here.

70
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,750
You could have also solved it by
grouping, but this might be

71
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,460
a quicker thing to recognize.

72
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,820
This is a number squared.

73
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,260
That's another number squared.

74
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,600
If you take each of those
numbers that you're squaring,

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,910
take their product and multiply
it by 2, you have

76
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,650
that right there.

77
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,330
So this is a perfect square.

78
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:51,933
