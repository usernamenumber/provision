1
00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:04,867
Add: 5x squared plus 8x minus 3

2
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:08,847
Plus 2x squared minus 7x plus 13x

3
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:11,933
So we can really view this as just adding two polynomials.

4
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:15,534
The second polynomial can be simplified right off of the bat.

5
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:21,800
We have two like terms here. It's not the 2x squared. There's no other 2x squared term here in this

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,732
polynomial.

7
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:25,952
but you have a -7x term and then you have a +13x.

8
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:28,398
So we can actually add these two terms.

9
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:32,133
What is -7 of something plus 13 of that something?

10
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:40,617
Or another way to view it. What is 13x minus 7x? 13 of that something minus 6 of that something?

11
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:50,281
It's just going to be 6x. And then you have your 2x squared right over here.

12
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:54,962
So this polynomial here simplifies to 2x squared plus 6x.

13
00:00:54,962 --> 00:00:57,702
And then we want to add it to this polynomial right over here.

14
00:00:57,702 --> 00:01:02,531
And what we can do is rewrite this polynomial under this polynomial.

15
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:06,525
And I'm going to align the similar terms or the like terms.

16
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,451
The terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.

17
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:13,863
So we have x raised to the 2nd power, x raised to the 2nd power. So let's put the 5x squared over

18
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:14,466
here

19
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:22,872
We have an x raised to the 1st power, an x raised to the 1st power. So let's put the 8x over here.

20
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:26,587
And then we don't have a constant term in the first, this yellow, polynomial.

21
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:31,333
We don't have anything raised to the 0th power.

22
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,114
Or an constant terms but we do here. So let's just put a minus 3.

23
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:37,036
And then we can add these two things up. We have 2x squared plus 5x squared.

24
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:42,841
That is 2 of something plus 5 of something is 7 of that something.

25
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:45,442
So it's going to be 7x squared.

26
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:49,200
And then to that if I have 6 of something and I add 8 of that something to it.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,943
I'm gonna have 14 of that something.

28
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:55,519
If I have 6 x's and I give you 8 more x's, you're gonna have 14 x's.

29
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:03,368
And then we have nothing here. So if we add nothing to -3, you're just going to have a -3.

30
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:07,860
So this simplifies to 7x squared plus 14 x minus 3.
