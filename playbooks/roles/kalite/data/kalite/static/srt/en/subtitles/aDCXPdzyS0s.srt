1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,970
So we have this larger triangle here,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,320
and inside of that we have these other triangles

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,810
And we're given this information right over here

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:14,510
that triangle BCD is congruent to triangle BCA,

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,260
which is congruent to triangle ECD

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,940
And given just this information, what I wanna do in this drawing,

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,710
I wanna figure out what every angle on this drawing is

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,020
What's the measure of every angle

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,300
So let's see what we can do here

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,100
So let's just start with the information

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,590
that they've actually given us

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,870
So we know, we know that triangle BCD is congruent

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,680
so BCD is congruent to, well we know it's congruent

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,720
all of these triangles are congruent to each other

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,720
So for example, BCD is congruent to ECD

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,300
And so their corresponding sides and corresponding

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,690
angles will also be congruent

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,630
So just looking at the word written,

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,540
B, vertex B corresponds,

20
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,430
in this triangle, in BCD ,

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,710
corresponds to vertex B in BCA, BCA

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,300
So this is the B vertex in BCA

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,870
which corresponds to the E vertex in ECD

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,880
So all everything that I've done magenta

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,110
all of these angles are congruent

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,870
And then we also know,

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,190
we also know that the C angle, so in BCA sorry, BCD

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,070
This angle, this angle right over here

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,040
is congruent to the C angle in BCA, BCA

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,770
The C angle is right over here,

31
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,060
or C is the vertex for that angle in BCA

32
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,280
And that is also the, the,

33
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,790
the C angle I guess you could call it, in ECD

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,280
But in ECD, we're talking about this angle right over here

35
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,270
So these three angles are going to be congruent

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,740
I think you could already guess a way

37
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,480
to come up with the values of those three angles

38
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:53,820
But let's just

39
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,110
let's keep looking at everything else that they're telling us

40
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,440
Finally, we have vertex D over here

41
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,850
So angle so, angle

42
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,300
so this is the last one in, where we lifted,

43
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,880
B so in triangle BCD, this angle,

44
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,660
this angle right over here corresponds to the A vertex angle in BCA

45
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,980
So BCA, that corresponds to this angle right over here

46
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,010
It's really the only one that we haven't labelled yet

47
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,140
And that corresponds to this angle, this vertex right over here

48
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,310
That angle right over there , and just to make it consistent,

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,090
this C should also be circled in yellow

50
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,920
And so we have all these congruencies

51
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,820
and now we can come up with some interesting things about them

52
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,800
First of all, here

53
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,840
Angle BCA, angle BCD, and angle DCE, they're all congruent

54
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,380
And when you add them up together, you get to 180 degrees

55
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,710
If you put them all adjacent, cause they all are right here,

56
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,740
they'd end up with a straight angle,

57
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,850
if you look at their outer sides

58
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,440
So you have if these are each x, you have

59
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,230
three of them added together have to be 180 degrees

60
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,340
which tells us that each of these have to be 60 degrees

61
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,100
That's the only way you have three of the same thing

62
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,780
adding up to 180 degrees

63
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,980
Fair enough

64
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,720
What else can we do?

65
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,160
Well, we have these two characters up here

66
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,540
They are both equal and they add up to 180 degrees,

67
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,730
they are supplementary

68
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,410
And the only way we can have two equal things that add up to 180

69
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,950
is that if they're both 90 degrees

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,270
So, these two characters are both 90 degrees,

71
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,450
or we could say this is a right angle, that's a right angle

72
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,160
And this is congruent to both of those, so that is also,

73
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,560
that is also 90 degrees

74
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,300
And then we're left with these magenta parts of the angle

75
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,950
And here we can just say,

76
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,810
well 90 + 60 + something is going to add up to 180

77
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,050
90 + 60 is 150,

78
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,760
so this has to be 30 degrees to add up to 180

79
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,180
If that's 30 degrees, then this is 30 degrees,

80
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,560
and then this thing right over here is 30 degrees

81
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,260
And then the last thing,

82
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,990
we've actually done what we said we would do

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,510
We've found out all of the angles

84
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,670
We can also think about these outer angles,

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,350
so this or not outer angles, or just combined angles

86
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,230
So angles, say AC, oh sorry angle ABE

87
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,340
So this whole angle we see is that whole angle is 60 degrees

88
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,750
This angle is 90 degrees

89
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,640
And this angle, here, is 30

90
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,870
So what's interesting is, these smaller triangles are all

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,460
they all have the exact same angles: 30, 60, 90,

92
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,140
and the exact same side lengths

93
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,860
We know that because they're congruent

94
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,380
But what's interesting is when you put them together this way,

95
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,300
they construct this larger triangle, triangle ABE,

96
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,000
that's clearly not congruent

97
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,550
It's a larger triangle that has different measures for its lengths,

98
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,670
but has the same angles: 30, 60, and then 90

99
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,010
So it's actually similar to all of the triangles that it's made up of
