1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
   

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,370
So we were doing part c of the
first problem on the Calculus

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,210
BC exam, the free response
part, and so what, I'll re-read

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,420
it, it says the region
r, this is the region r,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,610
is the base of a solid.

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,190
I redrew the region r here, but
with a little perspective, so

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,930
we can hopefully visualize
it in three dimensions.

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,590
So it says for this solid, each
cross section perpendicular

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,000
to the x-axis, right?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,750
There's two ways you can do a
cross-section, you could do

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,870
them, you could cut this
way, but that would be

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,040
parallel to the x-axis.

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,210
We wanted to cut perpendicular
to the x-axis, or parallel

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,420
to the y-axis, right?

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,740
So if we cut it along
the line like that.

16
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,500
So they say, each cross-section
perpendicular to the

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,810
x-axis is a square.

18
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,120
So I drew a couple
of squares here.

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,250
That's one.

20
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,270
So here, this would be the
base, and since we know the

21
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,290
cross-section is the square,
the height has to be the

22
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,710
same length as the base.

23
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,660
Same thing here.

24
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,790
So here, the height will be
really high, because this is

25
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,150
kind of maybe our maximum point
in terms of the base width.

26
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,090
But it's still pretty wide,
then it gets narrow again.

27
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,320
So how do we figure out
the volume of this solid?

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,140
Which is kind of
hard to visualize.

29
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,816
And it's in some ways you
easier to visualize it than

30
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:12,680
it is to draw, so you have
to give me some credit.

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,830
But anyway, what we do is, we
take the area of each of these

32
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,960
squares, and I drew
one of them here.

33
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,520
You take you each of the area
of each of these squares,

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,600
multiply them by a super small
change in x, and that we know,

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,770
from everything we've learned
in calculus hopefully, that

36
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,180
that super small change in x,
I'm trying to draw a little

37
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,830
perspective, is dx.

38
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,960
So if we multiply dx times the
area of this square, that is

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,190
the volume of this kind of
part the entire solid.

40
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,900
And if we were to sum up all of
these infinitely thin solids,

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,830
we would get the volume
for the whole thing.

42
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,540
So how do we do that?

43
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,850
Well let's write our
integral expression.

44
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,350
So what is the area of
each of these squares?

45
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,020
Each of these cross-sections,
what is the area?

46
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,090
Well the base is going to
be the difference between

47
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,520
our two functions, right?

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,210
This top function right
here, that was sin of pi x.

49
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,560
And this bottom function, right
here, that is y is equal to

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,010
x to the third minus 4x.

51
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:27,040
So the base of the functions,
the base of this distance right

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,560
here is going to be the
difference between the top

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,820
function and the
bottom function.

54
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:42,540
So each base is going to be sin
of pi x, minus this function,

55
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,580
so minus x to the third, plus
4x, right switch the sign.

56
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,590
Minus x to the third, plus 4x.

57
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,110
So far this might look pretty
similar to part a, but

58
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,280
what's the twist here?

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,980
We want the area.

60
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,350
The area of each of
the squares, not

61
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,200
just this distance.

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,940
So what's the area?

63
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,260
It's going to be this distance
squared, so we have to

64
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,360
square this entire thing.

65
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,090
So that's the area of each
of these squares, and then

66
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,740
we have to multiply them
times a little bit of dx.

67
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,950
And that gives us the volume
for each of these, I guess,

68
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,690
parts of the entire solid.

69
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,360
And then what are our
boundaries of integration?

70
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,340
Well it's the same
thing as in part a.

71
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,240
This is 0, this is 2.

72
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,090
So the boundaries are
pretty straightforward.

73
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,970
So we essentially just have
to evaluate this now.

74
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,730
And just like in part b, I've
first tried to evaluate this

75
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,620
analytically, and you end up
getting a very, very,

76
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,000
very hairy integral.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,220
Which you can do analytically,
you but you have to know some

78
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,010
power reduction formulas in
trigonometry, you have to do

79
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,160
some integration by parts, it
would probably use up all of

80
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,220
the time on the AP Exam.

81
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,080
So since they said that a
graphing calculator is required

82
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,700
for some parts of the problem,
I say why not use our

83
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,110
graphing calculator?

84
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,360
Because the graphing calculator
is very good at numerically

85
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,450
evaluating definite
integrals like this.

86
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,100
So let's get out my
TI-85 emulator again.

87
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,950
Here we go.

88
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,210
I want you see the key strokes
so that you, ok turned

89
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,640
on, exit out of this.

90
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,920
So we're going to use the
calculus function here,

91
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,070
so second, calculus.

92
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,580
And this function right here,
this is definite integral, a

93
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,490
very useful function to use.

94
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,490
Press F5, definite integral.

95
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,450
And then we just type
in the expression.

96
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,050
So the expression, let me
move it down a little bit.

97
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:50,040
So it's open parentheses
sin of where is pi?

98
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,470
Pi is -- I haven't used one of
these calculators in a long,

99
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,160
long time -- oh there it is.

100
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:13,210
Second pi x sin of pi x minus x
to the third power, plus 4x.

101
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,380
   

102
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,010
All of that squared.

103
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,180
And then this definite integral
function, you have to tell it

104
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,750
which is the independent
variable, or kind of, you

105
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,930
know, what variable are we
integrating across, and

106
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,360
that's the variable x.

107
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,510
And then you just tell it the
boundaries of integration,

108
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,450
and we're done.

109
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,420
So integrate from 0, from x is
equal to 0, to x is equal to 2.

110
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,740
If I haven't made a mistake,
I can hit enter, and let

111
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,100
the calculator do the
rest of the work.

112
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,780
Let's see what it ends up with.

113
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,460
OK, 9. -- that's the answer,
that is the volume of this

114
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:00,110
solid -- it's 9.9783 So you
could write that this

115
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,130
is equal to 9.9783.

116
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,630
And I'm pretty sure they want
you to use a calculator,

117
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,580
because frankly, computing the
integral, that's kind of just

118
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,870
chug math, you know, very
mechanical math, although it's

119
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,220
pretty sophisticated, but
it would take you forever.

120
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,860
But this is kind of, I think,
what they wanted you to do, set

121
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,810
up the integral, recognize that
each of the squares, the area

122
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,790
of each of the squares is just
going to be this distance, the

123
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,060
distance between the
functions squared.

124
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,470
And then you integrate
that from 0 to 2.

125
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,830
Let's see how much
time I have left.

126
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,760
I have a couple of minutes.

127
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,920
So let's do part d.

128
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:45,360
   

129
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,620
The region r models, let me,
paste, oh, I didn't want to

130
00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:02,030
do that, edit, undo, edit,
paste, there you go.

131
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,510
OK, so I wanted to make
this a little smaller.

132
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,610
So what does part d say?

133
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,760
The region r models the
surface of a small pond,

134
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,420
so that's the surface now.

135
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,880
At all points r at a distance x
from the y-axis, the depth of

136
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,460
the water is given by h
of x is equal to 3-x.

137
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,710
So essentially 3-x is
the depth, right?

138
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:33,890
So at this point of this pond,
the depth is just 3, right 3-0.

139
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:39,260
And at this point, the
depth is 3-2 which is 1.

140
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,650
So essentially the pond is
going to get shallower and

141
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,750
shallower or as we go
further to the right.

142
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,640
You could almost imagine
it, let me see if I

143
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,900
can draw it again.

144
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,980
So this is the sin function
with some perspective.

145
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,700
This is the polynomial
function below it.

146
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,610
This is, it's probably drawn
in, that's the x-axis.

147
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,110
   

148
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,480
This is the y-axis.

149
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,980
   

150
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:24,460
And so here, the depth of the
pond is given by the function

151
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,580
h of x is equal to 3-x.

152
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:34,826
So over here, the depth is 3,
so if I were to draw, so if I

153
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:36,790
were to go straight down the
depth is, you know

154
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,110
maybe it's 3.

155
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,140
And the pond essentially gets
shallower and shallower

156
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,070
as we go to the right.

157
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,110
So how do we figure out
the volume of this?

158
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,880
Over here, what is the depth?

159
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,100
It's going to be 1, right, 3-2.

160
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,370
This is x is equal to 2.

161
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,580
So here the depth
is going to be 1.

162
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,890
So if we take the cross-section
just along the x-axis, the

163
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,290
depth is going to look
something like this, but then

164
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,190
this is the top of it.

165
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,100
I know that's kind of
hard to visualize.

166
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,680
But anyway, how do we
figure out what the

167
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,500
volume of this lake is?

168
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,840
But actually, I realize I'm
pushing nine minutes, so I

169
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,750
will continue this
in the next video.

170
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,252
See you soon.

171
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:19,761
