1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,690
Deirdre is working with a
function that contains the

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,060
following points.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,350
These are the x values,
these are y values.

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,460
They ask us, is this function
linear or non-linear?

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,379
So linear functions, the way to
tell them is for any given

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,610
change in x, is the change
in y always going

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,760
to be the same value.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,180
For example, for any one-step
change in x, is the change in

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,460
y always going to be 3?

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,940
Is it always going to be 5?

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,450
If it's always going to be the
same value, you're dealing

13
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,670
with a linear function.

14
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,570
If for each change in x--so over
here x is always changing

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,380
by 1, so since x is always
changing by 1, the change in

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,800
y's have to always
be the same.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,920
If they're not, then
we're dealing with

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,200
a non-linear function.

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,280
We can actually show
that plotting out.

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,150
If the changes in x-- we're
going by different values, if

21
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,190
this went from 1 to 2 and then
2 to 4-- what you'd want to

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,310
do, then, is divide the change
in y by the change in x, and

23
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,030
that should always
be a constant.

24
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,280
In fact, let me write
that down.

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,580
   

26
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:11,660
If something is linear, then
the change in y over the

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,240
change in x always constant.

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,760
   

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,960
Now, in this example,
the change in x's

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,480
are always 1, right?

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,890
We go from 1 to 2, 2 to
3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5.

32
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,060
So in this example, the change
in x is always going to be 1.

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,030
So in order for this function to
be linear, our change in y

34
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,180
needs to be constant because
we're just going to take that

35
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,310
and divide it by 1.

36
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,910
So let's see if our change
in y is constant.

37
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,480
When we go from 11 to
14, we go up by 3.

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,500
When we go from 14 to 19, we go
up by 5, so I already see

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,980
that it is not constant.

40
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,190
We didn't go up by 3 this
time, we went up by 5.

41
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,100
And here, we go up by 7.

42
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,230
And here, we're going up by 9.

43
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,780
So we're actually going up by
increasing amounts, so we're

44
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,380
definitely dealing with
a non-linear function.

45
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,780
And we can see that if
we graph it out.

46
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,390
So let me draw-- I'll do
a rough graph here.

47
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,410
So let me make that my vertical
axis, my y-axis.

48
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,510
And we go all the
way up to 35.

49
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:26,040
So I'll just do 10, 20, 30.

50
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,470
Actually, I can it do a little
bit more granularly than that.

51
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:44,650
I could do 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, and then 35.

52
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,690
And then our values
go 1 through 5.

53
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,970
I'll do it on this
axis right here.

54
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,010
They're not obviously the exact
same scale, so I'll do

55
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,030
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

56
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,610
So let's plot these points.

57
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,800
So the first point is 1, 11,
when x is 1, y is 11.

58
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,760
This is our x-axis.

59
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,600
When x is 1, y is 11, that's
right about there.

60
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:15,160
When x is 2, y is 14, that's
right about there.

61
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:23,570
When x is 3, y is 19,
right about there.

62
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:32,200
When x is 4, y is 26,
right about there.

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:40,080
And then finally, when x is 5,
y is 35, right up there.

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,810
So you can immediately
see that this is not

65
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,480
tracing out a line.

66
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,110
If this was a linear function,
then all the points would be

67
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,250
on a line that looks something
like that.

68
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,530
That's why it's called
a linear function.

69
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,150
In this case, it's not,
it's non-linear.

70
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,320
The rate of increase as
x changes is going up.

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,733
