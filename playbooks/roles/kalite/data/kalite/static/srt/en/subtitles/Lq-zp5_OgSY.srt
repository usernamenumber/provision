1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Problem 94.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,270
In Jefferson School,

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,620
300 students study French or Spanish or both. OK.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,900
And they have to do one of those two.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,970
If 100 of these students do not study French--

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,010
so this sounds like a Venn Diagram. Let's see.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,910
So let's say that's French.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,020
And I'll do Spanish in a different color.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,600
Let's say that is Spanish. And we have 300 students,

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,030
and they study either French or Spanish.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,100
If 100 of these students do not study French--

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,430
so what did I say? This was French and this is Spanish.

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,690
So 100 of these students do not study French.

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:46,480
So this area right here is 100. Right?

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,070
Those are people who study Spanish but no French at all.

16
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,590
How many of these students study both French and Spanish?

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,190
So what they want to know is the intersection of who

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,810
studies French and Spanish.

19
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,370
So that's this blue area right here.

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,510
So statement number one tells us, of the 300 students,

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,340
60 do not study Spanish.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,390
So people who study French but no Spanish--

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,520
and I didn't mean they know Spanish.

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,310
People who study French and do not study Spanish,

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,850
that's this right here. And that's 60. Right?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,060
And let's see if we can use this information to figure out

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,680
what the intersection is.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,550
So if you think about it,

29
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,550
what we want to do is the whole universe.

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,600
So the whole universe is going to be equal to the people who

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:49,010
study-- so this 60 people plus--we'll call that the

32
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,560
intersection, or we could call that French and Spanish--

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,230
plus this blue area, plus this tan area. Right?

34
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,070
That's the whole universe. And that is equal to 300.

35
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,540
So people who study French and Spanish plus 160

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,020
is equal to 300.

37
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,800
Subtract 160 from both sides and you get the people who

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,030
study just French and Spanish. That's what? That's 240.

39
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,390
That's 140 people who study both French and Spanish.

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,610
So statement one is sufficient.

41
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,050
Let's see what statement two gets us.

42
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,190
Statement two tells us,

43
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:32,020
a total of 240 of the students study Spanish.

44
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,010
So in statement two, we don't know this.

45
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,050
But we know that a total of 240 students study Spanish,right?

46
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,530
So we know that this whole circle is 240.

47
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,910
And if we're just trying to figure out this blue part,

48
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,000
we just have to subtract out the tan part.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,060
So if we want to know French and Spanish, French and Spanish

50
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,330
is going to be equal to the whole amount that study Spanish--

51
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,470
which they just told us, 240-- minus just the people

52
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,630
who study only Spanish. Right?

53
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,030
Because you could study Spanish and French.

54
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,320
So 240 people who study Spanish minus the people who

55
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,030
just study Spanish. So that's 100.

56
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,010
That's that tan area. That also equals 140.

57
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,760
So both statements individually are sufficient to

58
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,640
answer this question.

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,020
So the answer is D.
