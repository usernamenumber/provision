1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,130
In the last video on the
nephron, we talked about the

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:08,690
different parts of the nephron
and what, I guess, molecules

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,750
are reabsorbed by the body
and the different parts.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,890
If you remember, in the proximal
convoluted tubule, we

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,250
talked about maybe glucose and
amino acids and sodium being

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,230
reabsorbed.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,500
We talked about the ascending
part of the loop of Henle.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,110
We talked about salts, so that
sodium, potassium, chlorine

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,460
being reabsorbed.

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,300
In the distal convoluted
tubule, it was

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,220
calcium, other things.

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,860
But at least in my mind, when I
first learned it, I said how

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,580
does that happen?

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,760
How do we actively pump out
these things, especially

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,370
against their own concentration
gradients?

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,170
What I want to do in this video
is get a little bit more

18
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,770
depth on exactly what's
happening on the borders of

19
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,000
these tubules to actually
allow these ions to be

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,520
selectively transported out of
the lumen or the inside of

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,760
these tubes or to be

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,410
reabsorbed out of the filtrate.

23
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,570
The mechanism's actually
reasonably similar in the

24
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,500
different parts of the nephron,
but let's look at

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,930
each of the parts, because
they're each reabsorbing

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,170
different types of molecules.

27
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,790
And I won't go through all of
the molecules, but I'll just

28
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,890
give you a sense of things.

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,320
Let's start with the proximal
tubule right here.

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,520
So let's say if we were to zoom
in right over on that

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,260
part-- so let me draw the
inside of the nephron.

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,780
The inside of the nephron
maybe looks

33
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,370
something like this.

34
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,460
So this the inside.

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,400
This is where our filtrate
is right here.

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,680
Actually, let me draw
it a little bit

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,890
different than that.

38
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,105
So the inside, I'm going to draw
it like this because the

39
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:49,840
proximal tubule has these little
things that stick out,

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,340
sometimes referred to
as a brush border.

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,300
So this inside right here,
this is our lumen.

42
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,620
   

43
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,090
That is where the filtrate is.

44
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,400
The glomerular filtrate is
coming in this direction.

45
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,820
   

46
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,810
This is, you can imagine, the
inside of the nephron.

47
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,280
And then the border of
the tubule is made up

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,330
by a bunch of cells.

49
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,790
So maybe this is one cell right
here, this is another

50
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,750
cell right here, that's
another cell.

51
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,866
Obviously, this is
a cross-section.

52
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:28,160
It would be actually
more of a cylinder.

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,410
It would go around like that.

54
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,870
This is to give an idea.

55
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,410
That's another cell
right there.

56
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,810
And maybe this is their basal
side right there.

57
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,920
And when we say basal, we can
imagine that's kind of the

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,110
base of the cell.

59
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,910
Those are good words to
know, fancy words.

60
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,960
So the side of the cells that
are facing the lumen, or kind

61
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,930
of facing the inside of our
tubule, this is called the

62
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,180
apical side.

63
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,040
   

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,420
And then this side is normally
referred to the basal lateral

65
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,620
side, or this membrane, if you
view this as a membrane, this

66
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,450
would be the basolateral
membrane.

67
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,800
This is true regardless of what
part of the nephron we're

68
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,030
in, whether the proximal,
whether the loop of Henle, or

69
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,020
whether we're in the
distal part.

70
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,040
What we have here, and on the
other sides of these cells,

71
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,900
we'll have our peritubular
capillaries.

72
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,850
That's another fancy word.

73
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,630
So our peritubular capillaries
will look something like this.

74
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,230
They're actually
cells as well.

75
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,370
   

76
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,020
Actually, instead of drawing the
cells, I'll just draw it

77
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,350
as kind of the tube of-- I'll
just draw it like this.

78
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,940
They're porous.

79
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,740
So this is actually blood
flow right here.

80
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,915
This is blood right here.

81
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:44,290
This is blood right here.

82
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,870
I'm not going to do too much
detail on the actual cells of

83
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,930
the capillary walls.

84
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,790
I really want to give you the
idea of how things are

85
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,400
transported out of the lumen,
how they're selectively

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,650
reabsorbed.

87
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,420
   

88
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,450
So this is the peritubular
capillary.

89
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,980
And once again, fancy
word, but peri means

90
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,460
around, like perimeter.

91
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,940
So it's around the tubes.

92
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,480
These capillaries go
around the tubes.

93
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,430
If I were overlay it on this
picture, we have these

94
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,140
capillaries that are going
all around the tubes.

95
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,810
So when things get secreted
or reabsorbed out of the

96
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,089
nephrons, they're going into
those capillaries.

97
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,630
So this is our proximal
convoluted

98
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,970
membrane right here.

99
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,540
Let's think about what happens
with the glucose.

100
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,750
So what happens is we actually
have sodium-potassium pumps on

101
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,520
the basolateral side
of these cells.

102
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,040
So this is sodium-potassium
pumps.

103
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,370
I'll just draw one right here.

104
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,730
You might want to watch
the video on

105
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,600
sodium-potassium pumps.

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,250
I have a whole video on it.

107
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,890
But the idea here is that
sodium, maybe I'll draw as

108
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,810
plus particles right there,
they'll attach on the inside

109
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,240
right here, ATP will
come along.

110
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,150
When ATP attaches to the right
part of this protein, it'll

111
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,880
change its shape, its
conformation, and then the

112
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,310
protein will essentially close
on this side and open on that

113
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,680
side, and then when it's in that
conformation, the sodium

114
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,010
doesn't want to bond as much to
the protein and it will go

115
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,090
outside or it'll cross the
basolateral membrane and

116
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,140
eventually make its way
into the blood.

117
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,360
And then on the other side, it's
a sodium-potassium pump.

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,810
When it's in this kind of open
configuration-- I'll draw it

119
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,780
over here; I have a whole video
on this-- at that point,

120
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,320
potassium likes to bond to it.

121
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,080
So potassium likes
to bond to it.

122
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,710
Maybe it bonds to
it over here.

123
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,580
This is a gross
oversimplification.

124
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,000
That causes the protein to
change its conformation.

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,600
It doesn't require ATP at that
point, and it goes back to

126
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,620
this conformation, and then the
potassium doesn't want to

127
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,870
bond anymore, and then it gets
released, because the protein

128
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,860
is now a different shape.

129
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,860
So the general idea:
Sodium bonds.

130
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,090
ATP bonds.

131
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,490
The ATP gets its phosphate
popped off of it.

132
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,830
That changes the shape of
the protein to this.

133
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,910
Now the sodium wants to get
released, and now potassium

134
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,870
wants to join.

135
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,380
When potassium joins, we get
to our original one.

136
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,310
The end product of this is
we're having sodium being

137
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,580
pumped out of the cell and we're
having potassium being

138
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,100
pumped into the cell, and this
is active transport.

139
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,390
   

140
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,200
Why is it active transport?

141
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,160
Because we're using ATP to
drive sodium against its

142
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,990
concentration gradient to keep
pumping the sodium out of the

143
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,030
cell, and then potassium kind of
comes in, you could almost

144
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:40,920
imagine, passively.

145
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,950
It doesn't require ATP.

146
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,850
And that's why this is often
called a sodium-potassium

147
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,630
ATPase, which means it's a
protein or an enzyme that

148
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,520
breaks ATP.

149
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,080
But it breaks ATP, it uses
that energy to change its

150
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,320
shape to pump sodium out
and potassium in.

151
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,520
Well, anyway, this is all a
review of what we learned in

152
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,560
those videos, but how does that
help us, for example, get

153
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,020
glucose out of our lumen?

154
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,370
Well, what we have over here
is we have other proteins.

155
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,250
I'll just do the example
of glucose.

156
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,760
Let's say we have
a protein here.

157
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,280
There's a very general
term for this.

158
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,620
It's a cotransporter
or a symporter.

159
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:26,530
   

160
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,110
Symporter means it transfers two
types of molecules in the

161
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,790
same direction.

162
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,580
Cotransporter means one molecule
wants to go through

163
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,850
because of its concentration
gradient and the other

164
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,710
molecule kind of goes
along for the ride.

165
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,270
So you can imagine, we're
actively pumping out sodium.

166
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,460
So if we're actively pumping
out sodium over here on the

167
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,890
basolateral side, then we're
going to have a low sodium

168
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,140
concentration here.

169
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,550
   

170
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,925
The more we pump out, the lower
this is, and eventually

171
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:58,490
it's going to be lower
than the sodium

172
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,130
concentration in the lumen.

173
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,150
So the sodium concentration
gradient, if there was no

174
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,950
membrane here, sodium would want
to go across this to kind

175
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,600
of make up for all of the
lost sodiums over here.

176
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,190
Sodium would want to cross that
if there was no barrier.

177
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,990
These cells here take advantage
of sodium wanting to

178
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,430
move down its concentration
gradient, which is happening

179
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,990
because of this active transport
over here, but it

180
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,930
uses that energy of sodium going
down its concentration

181
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:30,560
gradient to actually also
transport, in this case, maybe

182
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,140
some glucose.

183
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,059
So if you had to visualize it,
you could imagine a protein

184
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,160
that's on this apical
membrane right here.

185
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,900
   

186
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,250
Maybe it looks something
like this.

187
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,780
This is to get some type
of visualization.

188
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,090
Maybe you have more sodium on
this side than you have on

189
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,350
this side, so sodium is more
likely to bond here.

190
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,130
Maybe glucose will bond here.

191
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,950
This is just a simplification,
but when they bond, this

192
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,220
protein is going to change its
shape to look something more

193
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,200
like this when they bond, and
now the sodium is going to be

194
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,620
here and the glucose is
going to be here.

195
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,685
We're essentially on the inside
of the cell now, and in

196
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:18,190
this conformation, they don't
want to bond as much to the

197
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,990
amino acids or whatever else
is in the protein, and then

198
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,020
they get released.

199
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,360
And when they get released, then
the protein will change

200
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,190
its shape back to this right
here and we can do this cycle

201
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,970
over again.

202
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,940
But this is all stipulated on
the idea that there's more

203
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,250
sodium over here to bump into
this point to make this

204
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,190
reaction happen.

205
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,260
So sodium's going to go down in
its concentration gradient.

206
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,670
It's taking glucose
for the ride.

207
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,020
And so essentially glucose
concentration will go up high

208
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,500
here, and then if we make this
porous to glucose so glucose

209
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,310
can go through, then glucose
will eventually, if this gets

210
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,250
high enough, it'll just go
down its concentration

211
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,000
gradient eventually
into the blood.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,520
And this same exact process is
happening, maybe not exactly

213
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,240
with glucose, but throughout
the entire nephron.

214
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,390
If we go to the loop of Henle,
if we go to the ascending part

215
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,180
right here, where we're trying
to get the salts out of the

216
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,875
picture, same idea.

217
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,480
   

218
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,660
So let's say that that right
there is the lumen.

219
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,510
This is a cell that makes up
the wall of the lumen.

220
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,500
We're in the loop of Henle
now and you have a

221
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,330
sodium-potassium
pump out here.

222
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,230
You have sodium being
pumped out.

223
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,120
You have potassium gets pumped
in, but actually, potassium

224
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,900
channels are leaky, so potassium
can often make its

225
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,560
way back out in either
direction.

226
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,840
So what's happening to

227
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,390
potassium isn't that important.

228
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,730
But so sodium concentration
becomes low here.

229
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:51,520
So what we have are symporters
over here, just like we had

230
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,210
with glucose, but in this case,
sodium wants to enter

231
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,240
just as the case with glucose,
but here we're trying to

232
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,950
transport chlorine and
potassium ions.

233
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,680
So that's what we're
going to join.

234
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,520
That's what's going to take
advantage of sodium's

235
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,790
concentration gradient.

236
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,240
We're going to have potassium
and we're going to have

237
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,670
chlorine ions.

238
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,930
And actually, this symporter
right here, it's called the

239
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,160
sodium-potassium-chlorine
cotransporter, and it's

240
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,020
actually the second variation
that you actually get in the

241
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,250
ascending loop of Henle.

242
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,380
So eventually, you're going to
end up with a lot of chlorine

243
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,270
here-- actually, potassium from
both directions-- but as

244
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,410
long as this is porous
to chlorine, if this

245
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,300
concentration gets high enough,
the chlorine is going

246
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,590
to make its way out and help
make the medulla that much

247
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,460
saltier along with the sodium.

248
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,240
Same thing in the distal
convoluted tubule.

249
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
There, calcium.

250
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,750
It's a little bit different.

251
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,320
So if we're in the distal
convoluted tubule, these kind

252
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,690
of villi, these things that
stick out-- this is only in

253
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,590
the proximal convoluted tubule,
those brush borders.

254
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,250
But over there-- and just so
you know, this idea where

255
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,910
we're using a concentration
gradient that's driven by some

256
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,120
type of active transport to
transport other things, this

257
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,220
is called secondary
active transport.

258
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:11,280
   

259
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,190
That's nice to know.

260
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,870
And then just finishing up at
the distal convoluted tubule.

261
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,560
So this was the lumen.

262
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,130
Let's say that this is the lumen
right here, so we have

263
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,860
cells on either side of that.

264
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,340
I think you get the
general idea.

265
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,330
The distal's a little bit
different so let's say this is

266
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,570
a cell, and let's say that
this is a peritubular

267
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,400
capillary right here.

268
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,430
This is our blood.

269
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,070
What we have here is
once again, we're

270
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,400
pumping sodium out.

271
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,920
Sodium-potassium pumps.

272
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,860
I have a whole video on that,
and that pumps potassium in,

273
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,880
so you end up with a lot
of sodiums over here.

274
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,650
The apical membrane that
faces the lumen,

275
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,880
it's porous to calcium.

276
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,340
Whatever the concentration
of calcium here,

277
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,590
it's going to be here.

278
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,910
So maybe you have calcium.

279
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,040
These are calcium ions just
like that floating around.

280
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,020
And right here, what you
have is an antiporter.

281
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,640
So our concentration in the
blood of sodium is going to be

282
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,150
higher because we keep
pumping it out.

283
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,390
And so sodium, if you let it
go down its concentration

284
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,070
gradient, it would go back in.

285
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,490
And so maybe right here you have
some sodium going down,

286
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,830
its concentration gradient going
back in, and then when

287
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,120
that goes in, that you can
almost imagine it's some type

288
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,540
of a rotating door, it makes
the calcium go out.

289
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,760
You can try to visualize it
yourself how a protein would

290
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,250
actually do that.

291
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,700
I kind of imagine a
revolving door.

292
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,400
The sodium makes the
door revolve.

293
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,960
The calcium is at the other
part of the door and

294
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,330
it gets spit out.

295
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,110
So this is called an antiporter
because they're

296
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,850
going in different directions,
but once again, it's secondary

297
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,400
active transport, because the
only way that this could work

298
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,360
is if we have active transport
using ATP of the sodium out of

299
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,660
the basolateral membrane in
every one of these cases.

300
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,590
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that useful.

301
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,370
It's more detailed than you
normally get on how the

302
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,990
nephron is actually pumping
things out of the lumen into

303
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,940
the peritubular capillaries, but
for me, it made things a

304
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,020
lot more concrete.

305
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,950
It helps me really kind of
internalize what the

306
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,200
nephron is up to.

307
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,333
