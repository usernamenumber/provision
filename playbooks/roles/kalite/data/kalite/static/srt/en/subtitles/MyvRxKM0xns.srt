1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,850
We're on problem 61.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,170
It says the point minus 3,
2 lies on a circle whose

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,990
equation is x plus 3 squared
plus y plus 1 squared is equal

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,270
to r squared.

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:18,080
Which of the following must be
the radius of the circle?

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,100
So the way to think about it
is, is that this point

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,770
satisfies this equation.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,270
   

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,800
Any point on the equation will
satisfy both sides of this

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,500
equality sign.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,290
So all we have to do is
substitute the x and the y

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,850
here and see what r squared
has to be equal to.

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,110
So let's do that.

15
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,080
If we substitute the
minus 3 in for x.

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,310
   

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,100
You get minus 3, I just
substituted for the x.

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:55,280
Plus 3 squared plus,
now y, y is 2.

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,370
2 plus 1 squared is equal
to r squared.

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,120
Minus 3 plus 3, that's just 0.

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,410
0 squared is 0.

22
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,180
And then 2 plus 1 squared.

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,040
So 3 squared is equal
to r squared.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,080
You could say r squared is equal
to 9 and then r is equal

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,060
to 3 because you can't have
a negative radius.

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,925
We see immediately that
r is equal to 3.

27
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:19,020
So all you have to
do is substitute

28
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,920
the x and the y values.

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,410
Because any point that satisfies
this equality is on

30
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,490
the circle, defined
by this equation.

31
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,460
They say this point is on the
circle, so you just have to

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,620
substitute them in and
just solve for r.

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,390
Problem 62.

34
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,380
Looks like we're going to
do some trigonometry.

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,860
In the figure, below if sine
of x is equal to 5 over 13

36
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,570
what are the cosine of x
and the tangent of x?

37
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,370
And I don't know if you've seen
the basic trigonometry

38
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,190
videos, you might want to.

39
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,450
But a good mnemonic for
memorizing sine, cosine and

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,700
tangent is SOHCAHTOA.

41
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:59,380
   

42
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,630
And that means SOH is sine is
equal to to opposite over

43
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,970
hypotenuse.

44
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,770
Cosine is equal to adjacent
over hypotenuse.

45
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,750
And I'll tell you what these
mean in a second.

46
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,760
And tangent, you might have
guessed, is equal to opposite

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,250
over adjacent.

48
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,270
So what does that mean?

49
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,590
What is all of this mnemonic?

50
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,810
So just you might want to
remember SOHCAHTOA.

51
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,550
Then you could break
it down like that.

52
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,550
So if I took the sine
of this angle.

53
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,350
That means the opposite side
of this angle over the

54
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,860
hypotenuse is equal to the
sine of this angle.

55
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,920
   

56
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,170
Let's call this the opposite.

57
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,740
   

58
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,530
This is the hypotenuse.

59
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,310
This is the adjacent side.

60
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,650
Because it's adjacent
to the angle.

61
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,660
This one is opposite,
hypotenuse, adjacent.

62
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:56,080
So the sine of x is equal to,
we know from our mnemonic

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,760
SOHCAHTOA, opposite
over hypotenuse.

64
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:10,300
And they tell us that that
is equal to 5/13.

65
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,610
So opposite over hypotenuse
is equal to 5/13.

66
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,970
Now we know that that's just
the ratio between the two.

67
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,700
So we don't know.

68
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,990
This could be 10, this
could be 26.

69
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,010
This could be 1 and this
could be 13/5.

70
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,730
Who knows.

71
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,040
That actually doesn't matter.

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,670
That's what's neat about
trigonometry.

73
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,585
It's all about the ratio.

74
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,160
So let's just assume
that this is 5.

75
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,050
That the opposite
is equal to 5.

76
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,430
And the hypotenuse
is equal to 13.

77
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,960
Let me pick a different color.

78
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,390
This is a little nauseating.

79
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,860
All right.

80
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,120
So if the opposite soon. is 5
and the hypotenuse is 13, what

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,590
would the adjacent
be equal to?

82
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,910
We could use the Pythagorean
theorem.

83
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,700
So we could say the
adjacent squared.

84
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,620
A squared plus the
opposite squared.

85
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,850
So plus 5 squared, plus 25.

86
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,940
Is equal to 13 squared.

87
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,090
13 squared is 169.

88
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,870
If you subtract 25 from both
sides of this equation, you

89
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,900
get a squared is equal to 144.

90
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,320
A is equal to 12.

91
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,040
We don't know that a is
definitely equal to 12.

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,920
But we know that the ratio
of the opposite to

93
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,579
adjacent is 5 to 12.

94
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,710
Because we just assumed that
the opposite is 5.

95
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,890
Anyway, so they want to know
what are cosine of x and

96
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,040
tangent of x.

97
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,960
So CAH.

98
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,520
SOHCAHTOA.

99
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:38,770
Cosine of x is equal to the
adjacent over the hypotenuse.

100
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,500
The adjacent is 12.

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,710
Hypotenuse is 13.

102
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,720
So it's equal to 12/13.

103
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,460
That's the cosine of x.

104
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,140
And the tangent of x is equal
to opposite over adjacent.

105
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,590
TOA, opposite over adjacent.

106
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,430
So opposite is 4,
adjacent is 12.

107
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,080
Equal to 5/12.

108
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,290
And let's see what
choice that is.

109
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,110
That's choice A, cosine
of x is 12/13.

110
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,550
Tangent of x is 5/12.

111
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,530
Next question.

112
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,140
Looks like they want us to learn
a lot of trigonometry

113
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,760
and geometry.

114
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,540
Which is good.

115
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,040
This is getting you warmed
up for the trig.

116
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,810
In the figure below, sine
of A is equal to 0.7.

117
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,520
So let's call this angle a.

118
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,750
   

119
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,680
They say what is the
length of AC?

120
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,480
So we want to know that.

121
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,970
Let's call that x.

122
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,330
So SOHCAHTOA.

123
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:39,410
SOH tells us that sine of some
angle, let's call that theta,

124
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,220
is equal to the opposite
over the hypotenuse.

125
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:52,090
So sine of A, in this example,
is going to be equal to the

126
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:59,930
opposite, 21, over the
hypotenuse, over x.

127
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,710
And they tell us that the sine
of A is equal to 0.7.

128
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,500
   

129
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,080
So now we can just solve this
equation for x and we're done.

130
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,410
Let's see.

131
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,980
So if you multiply x times
both sides, you get 21 is

132
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,670
equal to 0.7x.

133
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,240
And you divide both
sides by 0.7.

134
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,000
You get 21/0.7 is equal to x.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,510
21 divided by 7 is 3.

136
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,740
So 21 divided by 0.7 is 30.

137
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:36,730
So x is equal to 30.

138
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,540
And that's length AC.

139
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,060
   

140
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,170
That's choice C.

141
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,030
Next question.

142
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,360
64.

143
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,910
Approximately how many feet
tall is the street light?

144
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,580
OK, so we can use some
trigonometry here.

145
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,440
So if we know this angle, and
they give us the all of the

146
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,940
trig ratios for that angle,
we're trying to

147
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,130
figure out the height.

148
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:10,700
So if I write SOHCAHTOA, what
are we trying to figure?

149
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,360
So they gave us the adjacent.

150
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,110
This is adjacent to the angle,
it's right beside it.

151
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,250
The height that we're
trying to figure

152
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,500
out, this is the opposite.

153
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,810
   

154
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,620
So if we can have a trig you
function that deals with the

155
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,470
opposite and the adjacent.

156
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,310
Well that's tangent.

157
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,120
TOA.

158
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,020
Tangent of any angle
is equal to the

159
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,660
opposite over the adjacnet.

160
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:42,030
In this case, tangent of 40
degrees is going to be equal

161
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,940
to the opposite, the opposite is
h, that's what we're trying

162
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,080
to solve for, over
the adjacent.

163
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,780
The adjacent is 20 feet.

164
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,120
OK, tangent of 40 degrees isn't
something that most

165
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,330
people have memorized, that's OK
because they gave it to us.

166
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,140
Tangent of 40 degrees is 0.84.

167
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,850
So we get 0.84 is
equal to h/20.

168
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:15,760
So we can multiply both sides of
that by 20 and we get h is

169
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,710
equal to 20 times 0.84.

170
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:39,490
And that is equal to 16.8.

171
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,740
And that is choice C.

172
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,970
   

173
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,900
Problem 65.

174
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,570
Right triangle ABC is
pictured below.

175
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:56,320
Which equation gives the
correct value for BC?

176
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,200
So this is what they want
us to figure out.

177
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,100
This is BC right there.

178
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,970
OK, let's read them.

179
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,710
Let me write SOHCAHTOA, I
actually do this a lot.

180
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,300
   

181
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,070
OK, so they're saying that the
sine of 32 degrees is equal to

182
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,230
BC over 8.2.

183
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,970
Is that right?

184
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,290
Sine is opposite over
hypotenuse.

185
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,550
BC is definitely the opposite.

186
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,760
8.2 is not the hypotenuse,
10.6 is the hypotenuse.

187
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,780
So they're doing, this
is the adjacent.

188
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,030
So this is wrong.

189
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,230
   

190
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,890
So this should be a tangent.

191
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,590
Tangent of 32 is equal
to BC over 8.2.

192
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,740
This is the adjacent side,
adjacent to 32 degrees.

193
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,580
That's the opposite, and
that's the hypotenuse.

194
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,750
So that's not right.

195
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,190
Choice B, cosine of 32.

196
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,160
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

197
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,210
So cosine of 32 should
be 8.2/10.6.

198
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,870
So this should be an 8.2 here.

199
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,980
So this isn't right.

200
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,550
OK, so the next one, tangent
of 58 degrees.

201
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,050
Where are they getting
that 58?

202
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,940
Well, they know that this is
32, this is 90, so this is

203
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,600
going to be 180 minus
32 minus 90.

204
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,300
Because the angles in a triangle
add up to 180.

205
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,670
So this angle right
here is 58.

206
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,390
And now if we use that angle,
we have to relabel opposite

207
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,190
and adjacent and all that.

208
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,770
So from this angle's point
of view, tangent is

209
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,420
opposite over adjacent.

210
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,040
So if we write the tangent of
58 is equal to the opposite

211
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,820
side, should be equal
to 8.2 over its

212
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,800
adjacent side, over BC.

213
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,190
This is adjacent
to this angle.

214
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,080
It was opposite this
angle, but BC is

215
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,760
adjacent to this angle.

216
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,040
So that's what they wrote.

217
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,770
So choice C is correct.

218
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,630
And we're done.

219
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,850
I'll see you in the
next video.

220
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,180
Well we're not done with
the whole thing.

221
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,180
I'm done with this video.

222
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,430
See

223
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,500
