1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,560
I touched on this a little bit
in the video on how variation

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,970
can be introduced into a
population, but I think it's

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,750
fairly common knowledge that all
of us-- when I talk about

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,360
us I'm talking about human
beings, and frankly, most

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,150
eukaryotic organisms-- we're
the product of sexual

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,360
reproduction.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,440
So if this is the first cell
that had the potential to

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,260
become Sal, we know that this
first cell-- let me say this

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,190
is the nucleus of that first
cell so I can draw the whole

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,350
cell and all that, but let's
just focus on the nucleus.

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,820
It has 23 chromosomes.

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,040
Well, let me put it this way.

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,290
It has 46 chromosomes, 23 from
my father and 23 from my

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,010
mother, so that's 1, 2 3, 4, 3
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,040
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23 from my father.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,000
And then let's say that last
one actually helps to

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,460
determine my gender, or it fully
determines my gender.

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,090
That's my Y chromosome.

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,080
And let's say I had 23
homologous chromosomes, or one

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,120
chromosome that kind of was
the homologue for each of

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,730
these, but I have 23 of them
from my mother, so 1, 2, 3, 4,

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,820
5-- oh, you get the idea.

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,900
I can just draw a bunch of
them, and then have the X

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,480
chromosome that is essentially
one of the gender-determining

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,450
chromosomes from my mother.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,550
And we learned before that
each of these pairs are

27
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,820
homologous chromosomes, that
they essentially code for the

28
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,260
same gene, one from my father
and one from my mother.

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,980
Now, that first cell that had
the potential to become me, it

30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,030
was a product of fertilization,
of an egg from

31
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,070
my mother-- so an egg
from my mother.

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,240
I'll just draw the whole
egg like that.

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,290
I'll just focus on the DNA from
now, so my mother's DNA,

34
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,820
it had 23 chromosomes.

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,650
So it didn't have pairs,
and this is key.

36
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:58,040
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,910
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, and then 23 was the X

38
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,320
chromosome.

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,800
And so it's a combination from
my mother, so this is from my

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,830
mother, and a sperm
from my father.

41
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,920
Let me do that here.

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,320
And I'll draw the sperm much
larger than it is normally

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,830
relatively to the egg.

44
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,840
This is kind of the nucleus of
the egg, but let's say that

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,030
this is the sperm, and it has a
tail that helps it swim, and

46
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,670
it has 23 chromosomes.

47
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,670
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

48
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,375
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and then
it has that Y chromosome.

49
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,750
Let me do that Y chromosome
in a separate color.

50
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,010
Just as an aside, this
unification, this

51
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,230
fertilization that occurred from
this sperm cell to this

52
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,120
egg cell, so it essentially
penetrates into this egg cell

53
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,700
and it creates this zygote,
which is a fertilized egg cell

54
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,240
from my mother, and this
contains all DNA from both my

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,070
father and my mother.

56
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,940
So this very first cell that
was created from this

57
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,700
fertilized egg, this
is called a zygote.

58
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,690
It's a product of

59
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,630
fertilization between two gametes.

60
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,540
So that's a gamete and
this is a gamete.

61
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,820
Both a sperm cell or an
egg cell, they're

62
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,450
both examples of gametes.

63
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,340
Now, the whole reason why I'm
doing this is I want to

64
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,150
introduce you-- and I already
introduced this notion to you

65
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,700
when we talked about the
variation of population, that,

66
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,370
look, this has my full
chromosome complement.

67
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:49,990
It has 23 pairs, and each pair
is a pair of homologous

68
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,550
chromosomes.

69
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,040
They essentially code for the
same things, one from my

70
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,310
mother, one from my father,
and that is 46 individual

71
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,810
chromosomes, 23 from my mother,
23 from my father.

72
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:11,370
These gametes, they each have
only 23 chromosomes, or half

73
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,760
the number of a full
complement.

74
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,709
Now, everything that I'm talking
about here, the number

75
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,310
46, or 23 pairs, or 23
individual chromosomes, this

76
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,220
is unique to human beings.

77
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,980
If I talked about other species,
they might have 10

78
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,270
chromosomes or they might
have 5 chromosomes.

79
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,270
But one thing that is universal
for all sexually

80
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,340
reproducing organisms is that
gametes have half the number

81
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,860
of chromosomes as the zygote, or
you can kind of view it as

82
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,690
the organism itself, the way we

83
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,270
conventionally think about it.

84
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,740
So when people talk about half
the number of chromosomees,

85
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,095
they say it has a
haploid number.

86
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:49,850
And that literally just means
half the number of

87
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,420
chromosomes.

88
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,700
It's very easy to memorize,
because haploid starts with

89
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,420
the same two letters as half.

90
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:04,010
Haploid number for humans
is 23 chromosomes.

91
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,640
And so, you say, oh, if you say
this is a haploid number,

92
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,970
what do you call it when you
have the full complement of

93
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,840
chromosomes?

94
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,290
Well, that's called the
diploid number.

95
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,270
And I remember that because
di- often is a prefix

96
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,230
associated with having two of
something, and so you have

97
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,480
twice the number
of chromosomes.

98
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,820
So this is haploid, this is
diploid number, and this is

99
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,310
for humans, right?

100
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,360
For an organism where the
diploid number is N, and

101
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,840
you'll sometimes see this
notation, so I want to make

102
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,890
sure you're comfortable with it,
there's some organism, or

103
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,800
actually any organism.

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,190
If the diploid number is 2N,
then the haploid number is

105
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,870
going to be half of
that, or just N.

106
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,740
Now, in the case of humans, the
diploid number is 46, so N

107
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,410
is equal to 23.

108
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,080
So a fertilized egg or even just
a regular somatic cell or

109
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,890
a body cell will have a diploid
number of chromosome,

110
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,400
while a sex cell, and I'll be
a little bit clearer about

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,540
that in a second, will have a
haploid number of chromosomes.

112
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,600
So gametes, which are either a
sperm or an egg, those are

113
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,000
both examples of gametes, they
have half the number, they

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,610
merge, and then you get a
zygote, which is that very

115
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,740
first cell that had the
potential to turn into me,

116
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,800
that has a diploid number
of chromosomes.

117
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,830
And I actually want to do a
little bit of a side here,

118
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,450
because it's fascinating.

119
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,590
We talk about natural selection,
and we even wonder

120
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,060
today to what degree is it
occurring, because our

121
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,860
society, it's not as tough of an
environment as the natural

122
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,100
world would be where we're being
stalked by predators and

123
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,160
we have to live out in
the wild and find

124
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,330
food and all of that.

125
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,360
But even this process of
fertilization is an incredibly

126
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,780
competitive process, because
this sperm that happened to be

127
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,090
the one that kind of won the
race from my father to

128
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,480
fertilize my mother's egg, it
was actually the first of

129
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,540
roughly 200 million other
sperms. There were 200

130
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,740
million, roughly.

131
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,650
There could've been 200
to 300 million other

132
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,390
sperms in that race.

133
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,800
From the moment we're born,
we're already the product of

134
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,730
an intense competition amongst
these male-- I guess we could

135
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,550
call them male gametes, or
amongst these sperm cells.

136
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,480
Some of them might have had
weird mutations, that they

137
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,630
didn't know which direction to
swim, they happened to go in

138
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,380
the wrong direction, maybe some
of them had weird tails

139
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,080
that didn't allow them to swim
as fast, so you're already on

140
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,950
some level selecting for
fitness within this

141
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,540
environment.

142
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,600
So if you had some weird
mutations from the get go in

143
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,680
some of these sperm cells, it
would have been less likely,

144
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,310
especially if they affected
their ability to kind of swim,

145
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,080
it would've been less likely
that they would have been the

146
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,610
ones to win this race.

147
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,720
So already, you are the product
of a race of 280

148
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,600
million organisms, if you
consider each of these sperm

149
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,180
cells an organism, and you are
the product of that winning

150
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,940
combination.

151
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,460
So, you know, sometimes we
feel lost on this planet.

152
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,610
We're one of 6 billion people
and all that, or just a

153
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:17,080
number, but we already are the
product of a pretty intense

154
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,260
accomplishment.

155
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,560
But now with some of this
vocabulary thrown out of the

156
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,450
way, let's talk a little bit
about zygotes and how do

157
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,870
zygotes turn into people, and
then how do those people

158
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,020
essentially produce gametes,
which then can fertilize other

159
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,929
people's gametes to
form more zygotes.

160
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,440
So the general idea: So that
very first cell that was

161
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,410
essentially my mom's egg
fertilized by a sperm cell

162
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,500
from my father, that was a
zygote, and as soon as it's

163
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,400
successfully fertilized, it has
2N, or it has the diploid

164
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,430
number of chromosomes in the
case of humans, which I

165
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,000
believe I am one of them.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,030
I have 46 chromosomes.

167
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,920
And then this cell right here
begins to split and divide

168
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,300
over and over and over again.

169
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,610
We'll do a whole series of
videos on the actual mechanics

170
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:16,260
of that, but it splits by a
mechanism called mitosis.

171
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,730
And mitosis literally is just
a cell splitting to form

172
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,370
copies of itself.

173
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,710
So it just starts splitting into
two more cells that are--

174
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,910
and actually, let me do it this
way, just because the

175
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,450
actual way it works is right
when a cell is split, the

176
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,650
cells that it splits into aren't
that much larger than

177
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,670
the original one.

178
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,375
But now each of these have 2N
chromosomes, or 46 in the case

179
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,850
of humans, and you keep
splitting, and it happens over

180
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,020
and over and over again.

181
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,810
So eventually-- well, let
me just do it this way.

182
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,150
This keeps splitting, and then
you have-- and I'll go into

183
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,430
the words for some of these
initial collections of cell,

184
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,440
but I won't go into
that right now.

185
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,350
2N, all of these are original
copies from a genetic point of

186
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,220
view of that original cell.

187
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,860
And then eventually, they start
to really-- I start to

188
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,270
have tons of them.

189
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,670
There's just a gazillion of them
that are all duplicates

190
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,240
of the cell, and they all
contain the 2N number of

191
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,900
chromosomes, the diploid
number of chromosomes.

192
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,900
They all contain all of my
genetic material, but based on

193
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,320
how they relate to each other
and what they see around them,

194
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,200
they start differentiating.

195
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,110
So all of these have 2N number,

196
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,900
so they're all diploid.

197
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,830
And mitosis-- this is the
process the whole time-- is

198
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,200
these divide one cell into two
cells and those two cells into

199
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,610
four cells and keep going.

200
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,610
And then these begin
to differentiate.

201
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,840
Maybe these cells eventually
differentiate into things

202
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,660
that'll turn to my brain.

203
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,430
These cells right here
differentiate into things

204
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,440
that'll turn into my heart.

205
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,410
These cells here differentiate
into things that will turn

206
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,570
into my lungs and so
forth and so on.

207
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,540
And eventually, you
get a human being.

208
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,690
But it doesn't have to
be a human being.

209
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,450
It could be whatever species we
happen to be talking about.

210
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,630
So let me draw the
human being.

211
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,820
So I'll draw my best shot at an
outline of a human being.

212
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,660
Now, we're talking about
gazillions of cells.

213
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,670
You have your human being, and
I'll just draw a very simple

214
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,170
diagram, outline of
a human being.

215
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,120
When I was in high school, I was
a class artist, so I don't

216
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,020
want to make this representative
of my true

217
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,220
artistic ability.

218
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,210
I'm doing this here just to
kind of give you an idea.

219
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,595
But anyway, eventually, you keep
dividing these cells and

220
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:48,040
you end up with a human being,
and this human being, you

221
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,570
know, you wouldn't even notice
the cells on this scale.

222
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,380
Now, most of these cells of this
human being, if this is

223
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,430
me or you, these are all the
product of mitosis that

224
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,170
started off with that zygote,
and it just kept dividing and

225
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,020
dividing and dividing
into mitosis.

226
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,450
But it differentiated.

227
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,470
I said some of them will
turn into brain cells.

228
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,750
Some of them will turn
into heart cells.

229
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,650
The whole process of
differentiation is actually

230
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,710
fascinating, and we'll talk a
lot more about that when we

231
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,230
talk about stem cells, embryonic
stem cells, and

232
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,960
maybe we'll even talk about
the debate of it.

233
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,170
But the question is,
well, how do I then

234
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,460
produce those gametes?

235
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,240
How do I produce those things
that eventually, if I'm going

236
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,710
to reproduce, turn into
these kind of

237
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,350
haploid number of cells?

238
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,690
And that's what happens
in your sexual organs.

239
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,310
So in a male, you have some germ
cells, so some of these

240
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,980
cells turn into germ cells.

241
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,640
And the germ cells exist
as part of your

242
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,210
reproductive organs.

243
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,990
So let's say those are
the germ cells.

244
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,450
In a male, they would be
part of the gonads, so

245
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,040
they would be there.

246
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,840
In a female, they would be
involved in the ovaries.

247
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,270
And these germ cells, they're
the product of mitosis.

248
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,720
So let me draw a germ cell.

249
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:16,690
So a germ cell is the product of
mitosis, so it still has 2N

250
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:22,980
number of chromosomes, so it
still is a diploid cell or has

251
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,990
a diploid number.

252
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,960
But what's special about a
germ cell is it has the

253
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,300
potential, one, it can either
continue to do mitosis and

254
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,690
produce more germ cells that
are identical to it, so it

255
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,880
could produce two germ cells
that are identical to it, or

256
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,400
it can undergo meiosis.

257
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,330
And meiosis is essentially what
a germ cell undergoes to

258
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,940
produce gametes.

259
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,840
And so if this germ cell
undergoes meiosis, and I'll do

260
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,470
a whole video on the mechanics
of it, instead of two cells,

261
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,810
it'll actually produce four
cells that each have half the

262
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:12,460
number of chromosomes in them,
so these cells are haploid.

263
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,930
In the case of a male, these
would be sperm cells.

264
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,690
This would be sperm.

265
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:24,560
In the case of a female, these
would be ova, sperm or ova,

266
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,030
and these are the gametes.

267
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,160
So it's an interesting thing to
talk about, because in the

268
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,090
last several videos, I talked a
lot about mutations and what

269
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,250
does that do to a species, but
think about what happens.

270
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,010
If I have a mutation in some
cell here, some somatic cell,

271
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:45,290
some body cell, somatic cell,
will that mutation or can that

272
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,490
mutation in any way affect
what's going to

273
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,750
happen to my kids?

274
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,160
Will that mutation be carried
on to my kids?

275
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, no.

276
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,760
Because in no way will what goes
on in this cell affect

277
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,660
what I actually pass on
eventually in the sperm cells.

278
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,850
It'll just be a random
mutation.

279
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,570
It could affect my ability
to reproduce.

280
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,760
For example, it could be-- God
forbid, it could be some type

281
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,990
of cancer or something that,
especially if you contract it

282
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,080
at a young age, it might be some
type of terminal form so

283
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,960
that might affect your ability
to reproduce, but it will not

284
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,120
affect the actual DNA that you
pass on to your offspring.

285
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,720
So if you have some really bad
mutation here, it could affect

286
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,310
how you live or it could turn
cancerous and start

287
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,040
reproducing, but it will not
affect what you pass on to

288
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,280
your children.

289
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,640
The traits that will be passed
on or the changes that will be

290
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,200
passed on are those that occur
in the germ cells.

291
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,000
So if you have mutations in your
germ cells, or during the

292
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,270
process of meiosis, you have
essentially recombination of

293
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,130
DNA because of crossovers, and
we saw that in the variation

294
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,510
video, then that will introduce
new forms or new

295
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,350
variants inside that could be
passed on to your children.

296
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,970
And I really want to make that
point there, because we talk

297
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,520
about mutations, but there's
different types of mutations.

298
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,580
There's some mutations that
won't be passed on to your

299
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,030
children, and those are the
ones that occur in your

300
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,120
somatic cells.

301
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,170
Maybe some of them do nothing
so then it really doesn't

302
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,180
affect your overall function,
but in the mutations that

303
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:24,350
either occur in your germ cells
or the recombination or

304
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,830
the variation that is introduced
during meiosis,

305
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,880
that will be passed on
to your children.

306
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,290
But even there I want
to be careful.

307
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,700
Because remember, this is
a severe competition.

308
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,270
So out of all of the-- let's say
there's 280 million sperm

309
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:42,520
cells that at one time are being
competitive for an egg,

310
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,710
it's possible that some of
them have mutations.

311
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,360
In order for one of those
mutations-- let me do the

312
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,140
mutations in different colors.

313
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,120
That's a purple mutation.

314
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,340
That's a blue mutation.

315
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,400
But in order for that mutation
to truly be passed on to my

316
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,530
offspring, the sperm containing
the mutation is the

317
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,430
one that has to win the race.

318
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,540
So already you have a selection
going on at kind of

319
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:11,240
this sexual reproduction level
where you're selecting for

320
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,810
things that are at least good
enough-- I mean, to some

321
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,910
degree, the sperm has to be
good enough to win this is

322
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,930
incredibly, incredibly
competitive race.

323
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,810
So that mutation that somehow
made the sperm deformed or

324
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,200
didn't allow it to swim or made
it behave in some weird

325
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,670
way, it's very unlikely that
that mutation would go on to

326
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,820
be the one or that cell would go
on to be the one that would

327
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,120
successfully fertilize an egg.

328
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,820
So anyway, I wanted to introduce
you to these ideas.

329
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,580
The main idea is really
some of the

330
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,090
vocabulary: haploid, diploid.

331
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,105
It's very confusing when you
first learn it, but it

332
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:48,950
literally just means half the
normal group of chromosomes.

333
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,050
And in the case of humans,
that would be 23.

334
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:55,360
And the cells that have a
haploid number of chromosomes

335
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,130
are our gametes, which are sperm
cells for men, and ova,

336
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,840
or egg cells for women.

337
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,490
But everything else in our
body, all of our somatic

338
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,510
cells, are diploid, which means
that the full complement

339
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,300
of chromosomes, they all
have a copy of our DNA.

340
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,460
And that's why DNA testing is so
interesting because you can

341
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,850
get any cell from someone
anywhere, and you have their

342
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,410
full complement of DNA.

343
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,120
You have all of the information
that describes

344
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,860
them genetically.

345
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,530
Anyway, see you in
