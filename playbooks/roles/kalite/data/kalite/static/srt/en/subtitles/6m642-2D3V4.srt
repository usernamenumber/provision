99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Identify the X and Y intercepts of the line "Y is equal to 3x-9", then graph the line.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the X intercept (I'll just abbreviate it as "X int.") that is where the line intersects the X axis, so where it intersects the X axis remember this horizontal axis is the X axis.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So when something intersects the X axis what do we known about its coordinate?

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Its X value could be anything, but we know that its Y value is zero.
