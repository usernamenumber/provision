1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,850
Multiply and express as
a simplified rational.

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,270
State the domain.

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,500
We'll start with the domain.

5
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,240
The only numbers that will make
this expression undefined

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,560
are the ones that would make
the denominator equal to 0,

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,500
and those are the situation, or
that situation would occur,

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,750
when either a, b, x,
or y is equal to 0.

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,750
If any of those are equal to 0,
then we have an undefined

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,930
expression.

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:34,200
We could say the domain is
all real a's, b's, x,

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,740
and y's, except 0.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:45,080
Or we could be specific: except
a, b, x, and y can't

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,840
equal to 0.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:55,410
Or you could write this: given
that a, b, x, and y does not

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,210
equal 0, that none of them
can be equal to 0.

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,310
These are just multiple ways
of stating the same thing.

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,550
With that stated, let's actually
multiply and simplify

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,660
this rational expression.

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,610
So when we multiply, you just
multiply the numerator and

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,190
multiply the denominator, so
you have 3x squared y times

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:20,380
14a squared b in
the numerator.

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:31,550
Then in the denominator, we have
2ab times 18xy squared.

24
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,780
Let's see where we can
simplify this thing.

25
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,220
We can divide the 14 by 2, and
the 2 by 2, and we get 14

26
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,280
divided by 2 is 7, and
2 divided by 2 is 1.

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,880
We could divide the 3 by 3 and
get 1, and divide the 18

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,180
by 3, and get 6.

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,890
Every time we divided the
numerator and the denominator

30
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,640
by 2, now the numerator and the
denominator by 3, so we're

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,650
not changing the expression.

32
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:02,960
Then we can divide a squared
divided by a, so you're just

33
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,940
left with an a in the numerator,
and a divided

34
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,620
by a is just 1.

35
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,810
You have a b over a b.

36
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,060
Those guys cancel
each other out.

37
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,020
You have an x squared divided by
an x, so x squared divided

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,920
by x is x, and x divided by x
is just a 1, so this becomes

39
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,100
an x over 1, or just an x.

40
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,040
Finally, you have a y
over a y squared.

41
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,220
if.

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,945
You divide the numerator
by y, you get 1.

43
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:27,990
If you divide the denominator by
y, you just get a y, and so

44
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,430
what are we left with?

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,410
We're left with in
the numerator,

46
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,645
these 1's we can ignore.

47
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:34,700
That doesn't really
change the number.

48
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,200
We have a 7 times a times x.

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
That's what we have
in the numerator.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,600
In the denominator,
we just have a 6y.

51
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,350
And we have to add the
constraint that a, b, x, and y

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,290
cannot equal 0.

53
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,380
When you just look at this
expression right here, you're

54
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,690
like, hey, what's
wrong with x?

55
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,810
There isn't even any b here,
so it's a little bit of a

56
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,340
bizarre statement, but you say,
hey, why can't x or a be

57
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,200
equal to 0 over here?

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,450
It doesn't make it undefined.

59
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,790
But in order for these
to really be the same

60
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,570
expressions, they have to
have the same domains.

61
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,750
Or actually, if these were
functions that equal them, in

62
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,875
order for that f of x to be
equal to this f of x right

63
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,320
over here, you'd have to
constrain the domain in a

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,040
similar way.

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,220
This is a fundamentally
different expression if you

66
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,280
allow x's and a's.

67
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,070
In this one, you can't
allow x's and a's.

68
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,510
For them to be really the same,
you have to put the same

69
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,500
constraints on it.
