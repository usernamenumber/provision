1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,827
With all the talk of the
deficits that we're entering, and the stimulus bill,

2
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:11,698
and all
the money that's being spent on the bank bailouts, and
potentially the auto bailouts,

3
00:00:11,698 --> 00:00:15,565
the question that everyone's
asking: Is this going to lead to inflation?

4
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:17,880
And that is what I hope to
address in this video.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,387
And I guess a good starting
point is, well, what is inflation?

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,610
It's a general increase in the
prices of goods and services.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,270
So they actually measure it
by-- they take a basket of goods and services

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,918
and they see
how those prices compare to a reference year.

9
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:37,294
And if those prices go up by 3%,
they might use a consumer price index.

10
00:00:37,294 --> 00:00:41,321
They'll say inflation
increased by 3%. So that's what's inflation.

11
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:47,601
And the opposite of inflation,
if things actually get cheaper, is deflation.

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:55,460
If one year 10 megabytes of RAM
costs x dollars, and then the next year, it costs a little
bit less,

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,391
it's actually a deflationary process, at
least in that market.

14
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:03,645
So without the those definitions
out of the way, let's talk a little bit
about what causes it.

15
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,881
A couple of days ago, I made
these videos on cupcake economics, where I talked about
what happens

16
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:13,873
when the cupcake factories have high
utilization or low utilization.

17
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,950
What might happen with prices?

18
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,893
And the reason why I did that
is because I really want to make it very clear

19
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:26,407
that it
really is utilization of factories or of people
that drive prices.

20
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:29,720
Let's say this is all the
capacity that I have.

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,113
When I talk about capacity in this
video, I'm speaking in very general terms.

22
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:35,317
It's all of the
goods and services that we could produce.

23
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:38,090
We could just talk about labor
capacity,

24
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,322
and then unemployment rate is a measure
of what is essentially not being utilized.

25
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:49,180
But this is just our capacity,
our productive capacity.

26
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:55,432
And in those cupcake economics
videos, I showed that if the demand is pushing up against
capacity.

27
00:01:55,432 --> 00:02:00,152
let me do demand in a different color. If demand is really close
to capacity--

28
00:02:00,152 --> 00:02:02,090
and I know everything I draw kind of looks
like balance sheets,

29
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,150
but this isn't intended to
be a balance sheet.

30
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,132
This is intended just to show
you that demand is pushing up against capacity.

31
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:09,789
So in this situation, let's
say, this is capacity.

32
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:15,133
If demand is at 90% of capacity,
then the people with the capacity might say, gee,

33
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:21,186
instead of trying to just try to sell that extra unit-- this
is demand-- instead of just trying to sell that extra unit

34
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:24,929
and have to worry about all the raw materials and have to
work for that extra unit,

35
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:29,245
why don't I just raise
prices, right?

36
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:40,938
So high utilization of capacity,
it leads to prices increasing.

37
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:44,050
And this isn't some kind of
fancy macroeconomic principal;

38
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,370
it's true if you're running
a lemonade stand.

39
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,410
If all of a sudden, you're
starting to sell 95% of your lemonade,

40
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,437
you'll probably say,
hey, maybe it's worth it if I raise the price.

41
00:02:54,437 --> 00:03:08,491
On the other hand, low
utilization-- let me pick another color --will lead
the prices dropping.

42
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,770
And you go back to your lemonade
stand, and you say,

43
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,990
wow, if I'm only selling 20% of
the lemonade that I make,

44
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,810
maybe my problem is that my
lemonade's too expensive.

45
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,774
And frankly, if there was a
bunch of lemonade stands, everyone is trying to
sell their capacity.

46
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:27,718
So just to compete
with each other, they'll all lower prices.

47
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,480
Actually, I'll throw another
thing in here that's a little unrelated to inflation,

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,337
but high
utilization makes prices go up and it also makes
people want to add more capacity, right?

49
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:37,820
So also investment goes up.

50
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,476
Both of those things do add more
capacity, but we won't worry about that right now.

51
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:43,670
So if you accept that-- and
I think it's a reasonable argument,

52
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:50,229
because it's really
based on common sense things --then I think you'll buy the
argument that,

53
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:56,166
if you have very low utilization, it's
difficult to have inflation.

54
00:03:56,166 --> 00:04:01,531
And, likewise, if you have very
high utilization, it's hard to avoid inflation. And to kind of hit the point
home,

55
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:09,020
actually, I took our company's Bloomberg terminal
and copied and pasted these charts here.

56
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:14,273
And the orange-- and I know you
can't see it that well on YouTube , so I'll try to make
it clear in my drawing,

57
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:19,583
But this orange I'll do it the same color, --this
orange shows capacity utilization,

58
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,223
and the starting
date right here, I think it was 1967.

59
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:31,872
This is 1969, actually December
31, 1969, so this is 1970, beginning of 1970,

60
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:38,034
this
is beginning of 1980, beginning of 1990,
this is 2000.

61
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:40,910
This orange line represents
capacity utilization.

62
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:49,950
So up here this is 90%
utilization and then down here this is 70% utilization.

63
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,718
So if we look here, in the late
60's, we have very high utilization.

64
00:04:56,718 --> 00:05:03,161
Arguably because of the Vietnam
War, we had factories running at capacity to build
bombs

65
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:07,222
and Agent Orange and God knows what else. And then utilization
went down.

66
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:10,825
We could talk a lot about the
history, but, in general, the interesting thing-- well,
actually,

67
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:14,912
before I go into what happened, let's think about
what this white line is.

68
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:18,404
So the orange line
is utilization. Up here we had like
90% utilization.

69
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:25,330
Very recently, this was like
2007, we had 80%, and very recently, utilization has
dropped off,

70
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,554
which essentially just means we're not running
our factories at full tilt.

71
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:36,544
This white line is
year-over-year inflation growth, and let me
do that in white.

72
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,190
This is year-over-year
inflation growth.

73
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,512
Actually, let me draw a zero
line, so you can separate inflation from deflation.

74
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:52,388
Let me see, zero inflation
is right over here. That's zero inflation.

75
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,419
And you see, in the time series
that I've done, we've never had zero inflation,

76
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,469
although we have had periods of a very high inflation.

77
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:03,825
But the interesting thing, just
falling into the cupcake economics

78
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:12,135
and this whole
notion of capacity utilization, is that
inflationary periods are always preceded,

79
00:06:12,135 --> 00:06:16,588
at least all
the data I have, by increases in capacity utilization.

80
00:06:16,588 --> 00:06:26,022
So you could view this as the
beginning of a pretty significant uptick
in prices, right?

81
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:30,563
And notice, it was preceded
by an uptick in capacity utilization.

82
00:06:30,563 --> 00:06:35,361
So, if you saw right here, wow,
capacity utilization is starting to go up-- and
actually,

83
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:40,138
another interesting thing is to see what threshold
of utilization starts to trigger inflation.

84
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:43,458
So over here, you say, OK, when
inflation really started turning around,

85
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:50,611
we were at
a capacity utilization of roughly 83%, 84% right there.

86
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:54,089
And then, if you look at the
next period where inflation really started to hit--

87
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:57,831
you can
either pick that point or that point --where was
capacity utilization?

88
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:00,888
It was around that same level
that was right there. It was above 80.

89
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:05,296
This was about 82%. And we could pick every
period before that.

90
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:11,593
Well, since then, inflation
really hasn't been a major problem.

91
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:17,802
These are our two major bouts
of inflation, in the early 70's and in the early 80's,

92
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:23,803
and those were when we had extremely high capacity
utilization.

93
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,682
So the point I want to make here
is capacity utilization really is the driver
of inflation.

94
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,260
You actually could find it
the other way around.

95
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,576
So this white line here, you
don't see it because the orange line--

96
00:07:33,576 --> 00:07:38,194
actually, I
realize that I'm showing you off the screen.

97
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,420
Let me actually reduce my
window, so I can show you.

98
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,915
So this is more recent, where
we see that capacity utilization started
falling off.

99
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:50,490
I think this is in the
summer of 2007. And you don't see it there

100
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,314
because it's overwritten, but the inflation line has also dropped considerably.

101
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,324
It comes down to here. But notice once again, although
here it's pretty close,

102
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:06,365
but utilization dropped
off a couple of quarters before inflation dropped off.

103
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:09,832
And that's why I always wonder
why the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,

104
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:13,148
they always talk
about different inflation indicators and what to do about
interest rates,

105
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:17,187
when you do have a pretty good indicator,
and that's capacity utilization.

106
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:19,680
The next question that everyone
has is, OK fine, Sal.

107
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,372
Capacity utilization
drives inflation. We can all buy that.

108
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:28,722
But clearly, what's going on
right now is just a wholesale printing of money.

109
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,227
And won't the wholesale printing
of money drive demand to go up,

110
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:36,511
and then we'll
have very high capacity utilization,

111
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:40,304
and then we'll
have inflation or even hyper-inflation?

112
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:44,321
And my argument there is that's
normally the case. Normally,

113
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:52,698
if you increase the
money supply, if the money supply goes up, that should
increase demand.

114
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,990
But there's a subtle, and it's
almost a philosophical point,

115
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:01,381
but it's an important one, to
realize: Money just allows you to express demand.

116
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:05,935
Let's say I really, really want
to buy a Rolls Royce, I just don't have the money.

117
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:13,529
If someone gave me $200,000 into
my pocket, then I could express that demand to
buy the Rolls Royce.

118
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:15,850
On the other hand, let's say,
I have everything I need.

119
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:23,499
I'm happy with my Honda and my
two-bedroom apartment, and someone gave me $200,000.

120
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:26,050
So they've increased, at
least, my money supply.

121
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,211
Will that increase the demand
for the Rolls Royce? No.

122
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:33,548
I have money to express the
demand, but I won't do it, because I don't think
it's necessary.

123
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,857
So you can make that same
analogy in the economy as a whole,

124
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:40,790
where you can imagine
an island where, let's say,

125
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,779
there's five of us or three of
us, because I don't want to draw five people.

126
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,642
And between us, we use seashells
as a currency. And we're very confident.

127
00:09:50,642 --> 00:09:59,468
And maybe I'm the builder, and
this guy's the fisherman, and she's the farmer.

128
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:03,440
Let's say in one year I use a
seashell to get some fish.

129
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,500
And then he uses that seashell
to buy some crops.

130
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,200
Then she uses that seashell
to buy a house.

131
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,647
And I use that seashell again
to buy more fish. You can see that one seashell,

132
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:19,613
even though my money supply on that island is one seashell,
it can transact many times in that year.

133
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:23,550
So the velocity in this
example is very high.

134
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:29,784
So you notice that my expression
of demand happens in these actual transactions.

135
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:33,230
I'll do a classical money
supply equation soon.

136
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:39,169
But you could imagine another
reality, where, for some reason, I stop trusting
this guy.

137
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:41,290
I've become very cautious, and
I say, well, you know what?

138
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,910
I don't want to give him my
seashell, because I'm not sure

139
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,242
if I'm going to get that
seashell back again to do something else.

140
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:51,800
So you can imagine a reality
where the central bank of our island,

141
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,560
all of a sudden, they
find hundreds of seashells.

142
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,478
And they put seashells in
everyone's pockets so we're all full of seashells.

143
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,296
But all of us have lost so
much confidence in the economy,

144
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:07,802
or are so unsure over
whether other people are going to use my goods and services,

145
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:12,132
that I don't want to use their goods and services. So we all just start
hoarding seashells.

146
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:16,987
So this is a situation where
the money supply could actually increase pretty
substantially,

147
00:11:16,987 --> 00:11:21,987
but since no one wants to express it through
demand, it's not going to increase utilization.

148
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:25,870
And so in the situation that
we're in right now, if you're wondering about

149
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,648
whether you're
going to see inflation or deflation, my argument is look
at capacity utilization.

150
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:38,873
People can point to
the money supply. This is a classic money
supply equation.

151
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:47,321
The money supply times the
velocity of money-- that's how often the actual dollars switch
hands --

152
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:53,408
is equal to the price of the average price of
goods times the total quantity of goods and services we have.

153
00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:00,517
So most people say, wow, if the
money supply increases, then won't prices increase?

154
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:04,900
Well, that would be true if you
assume that velocity and quantity are constant.

155
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,015
But we're saying that whenever
you have major shocks and people lose confidence,

156
00:12:09,015 --> 00:12:13,152
this
velocity can slow down considerably, especially when 
things like financial intermediaries

157
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:16,190
start hoarding
money and people start putting money into their mattresses.

158
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,166
In fact, often times, people
don't even consider things that aren't being transacted
money.

159
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,557
For example, those commemorative
coins that they sell on TV.

160
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:27,618
They're not considered part of
the money supply, because people don't use
them as money.

161
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:31,366
Anyway, I'm all out of time. I'll continue this discussion
in the next video.
