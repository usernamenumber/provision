1
00:00:00,706 --> 00:00:02,098
Let's do a few more examples

2
00:00:02,098 --> 00:00:04,247
with the ideal gas equation.

3
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:07,856
So we have pressure times volume is equal to

4
00:00:07,856 --> 00:00:10,766
the number of molecules we have in moles

5
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:13,264
times the ideal gas constant

6
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,759
times temperature in Kelvin.

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,406
And I just got a comment on one of the videos

8
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:19,217
saying it made sense

9
00:00:19,217 --> 00:00:20,274
except for the fact that

10
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:24,797
R seems kind of like this mysterious thing in here.

11
00:00:24,797 --> 00:00:25,680
And the way you think about R--

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,222
let me rearrange this a little bit.

13
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:27,596
Let me write it as

14
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:33,544
pressure times volume is equal to R times nT.

15
00:00:33,544 --> 00:00:34,473
So we've established,

16
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:36,182
or hopefully we've established, the intuition

17
00:00:36,182 --> 00:00:37,823
that the pressure times the volume

18
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:39,392
should be proportional to

19
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:42,808
essentially the total energy we have in the system.

20
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:45,363
Temperature is average energy,

21
00:00:45,363 --> 00:00:47,710
or energy per molecule,

22
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,677
and this is the total number molecules we had.

23
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:52,206
What R is, the ideal gas constant is,

24
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:53,941
essentially it takes us to a world

25
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:56,106
this is when you multiply moles times Kelvin,

26
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:58,776
you get mole Kelvin.

27
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:00,277
And with pressure times volume,

28
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:02,993
it's force per area times the volume.

29
00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:05,036
You get force times distance,

30
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:07,651
or force times one dimension of distance,

31
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,657
which is joules,

32
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:10,909
so this is in joules.

33
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,787
So what the ideal gas constant essentially does

34
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:14,940
is it converts--

35
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,466
we know that this is proportional to this,

36
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:20,880
but it sets the exact constant of proportionality

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,415
and it also makes sure we get the units right,

38
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:24,580
so that's all it is.

39
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,478
It just helps us translate from

40
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,050
a world dealing with moles and Kelvins

41
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,713
to a world dealing with,

42
00:01:30,713 --> 00:01:33,502
well, in this case, atmospheres and liters,

43
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:37,545
or bars and meters cubed,

44
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:39,168
or kilopascals and meters cubed.

45
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:40,344
But no matter

46
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:41,800
what the units of the pressure and the volume are,

47
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,802
the whole unit of pressure times volume

48
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:45,074
is going to be joules.

49
00:01:45,074 --> 00:01:46,558
So it's just a translation between the two

50
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:48,476
and we know that they're proportional.

51
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,869
Now, with that said, let's do some more problems.

52
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:54,901
So let's say we want to know

53
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:56,497
how many grams of oxygen.

54
00:01:56,497 --> 00:02:00,228
So we want to know grams of O2.

55
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:04,632
So how many grams of O2

56
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:10,237
are in a 300-milliliter container

57
00:02:10,237 --> 00:02:14,205
that has a pressure of 12 atmospheres

58
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:20,311
and the temperature is 10 degrees Celsius?

59
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,044
So let's just break out

60
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:23,655
Well, we've already broken out

61
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:25,277
our ideal gas equation.

62
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:28,299
So let's see, pressure is 12 atmospheres.

63
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:31,387
So we can say 12.

64
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:32,902
I'll keep the units there.

65
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,879
12 atmospheres times the volume.

66
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,273
The volume should be in liters,

67
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:39,785
so this is 300 milliliters,

68
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,385
or 300 thousandths or 3 tenths.

69
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:48,176
So that's 0.3 liters.

70
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:53,242
300 one thousandths of a liter is 0.3 liters.

71
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:54,810
And that is equal to

72
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,234
the number of moles we have of this,

73
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,120
and that's what we need to figure out.

74
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,429
If we know the number of moles,

75
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,745
we know the number of grams.

76
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:04,405
So this is equal to n times R.

77
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:05,944
Now which R should we use?

78
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:08,668
We're dealing with liters and atmospheres.

79
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:10,265
We'll deal with this one.

80
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:14,243
Liters, atmospheres, mole-Kelvin, 0.082.

81
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:16,437
Times 0.082.

82
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:17,422
And what's our temperature?

83
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:19,090
It's 10 degrees Celsius.

84
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,758
We always have to do everything in Kelvin.

85
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:25,221
So it's 283 degrees Kelvin.

86
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:28,441
So all we have to solve for is n.

87
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,322
We just have to divide both sides of this equation

88
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:31,881
by this right here,

89
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:37,573
and so we have n is equal to 12 atmospheres--

90
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:39,215
I'm just swapping the sides--

91
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:41,236
times 0.3 liters

92
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:47,490
divided by 0.082 times 283 degrees.

93
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,235
That is equal to---

94
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:50,980
Our answer will be in moles.

95
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,586
And if you want to verify that,

96
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:54,586
you can plug in all the units

97
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:58,444
and use units for the ideal gas constant.

98
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:01,303
The number of moles we're dealing with,

99
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:11,698
so it's 12 times 0.3 divided by 0.082 divided by 283

100
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:22,622
is equal to 0.155 moles.

101
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:24,666
Now how many grams

102
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:31,444
are in one mole of an oxygen molecule?

103
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:35,902
So one mole of O2,

104
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:39,635
well, we know oxygen's atomic mass.

105
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:40,980
It's 16.

106
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,914
One molecule of oxygen, of gaseous oxygen,

107
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:46,327
has two atoms in it,

108
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:50,378
so it has an atomic mass of 32.

109
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:52,885
32 atomic mass units.

110
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:56,024
So it's molar mass, it's mass per mole,

111
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:58,666
is going to be 32 grams.

112
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,660
Now we don't have one mole.

113
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,121
We have 0.155 moles.

114
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:04,001
So to figure out how many grams we have,

115
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:21,219
we multiply 32 grams per mole times 0.155 moles,

116
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:23,341
and we'll get our answer.

117
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:24,612
So let's do that.

118
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:35,839
So we have 32 times 0.155 is equal to 4.96 grams,

119
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,184
or roughly 5 grams.

120
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:39,851
So we have approximately

121
00:05:39,851 --> 99:59:59,999
5 grams of molecular oxygen.
