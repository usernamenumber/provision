00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:06,400
As someone who's married to a doctor. In the medical field, it's pretty important to have a precise

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,054
understanding of what the words mean, just so you can understand what people

3
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:15,906
are talking about. If either you are a health care professional, or if one is talking to you

4
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:20,317
as my wife does... well, sometimes does, when she comes home from work.

5
00:00:20,317 --> 00:00:25,333
So let's get a little more precise with the words we've been talking about, especially with

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:29,373
heart disease and heart failure and all of the rest. So let's say this is an artery

7
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:38,137
and the blood is flowing in that direction... and let's say this right here is an artery.

8
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:47,369
Now, let me draw a plaque there. and we've been studying plaque since the video on heart attacks.

9
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:56,517
So let's say this is a clump of white blood cells and lipid materials and all the rest

10
00:00:56,517 --> 00:01:05,202
Now, a word that you might hear in a medical context is "stenosis", and the word

11
00:01:05,202 --> 00:01:17,508
just refers to the narrowing, usually of a blood vessel. So, this right here, this blood vessel has been narrowed.

12
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:21,874
It can also refer to the narrowing of any type of tubular structure, so if you have

13
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:28,189
any type of pipe in a biological system, you can use stenosis there, but usually they're

14
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:38,267
talking about a blood vessel. In this example here, it's an artery.

15
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:44,933
Now, once the blood vessel is narrowed, that restricts the blood supply

16
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:50,852
so you aren't able to get as much blood through it, so the blood supply

17
00:01:50,852 --> 00:02:06,502
is restricted. This restriction of blood supply that usually leads to some loss of function

18
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:20,202
is called 'ischemia', another fancy word, that literally just means 'restricted blood supply'.

19
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:28,097
Now if you have stenosis in one of your blood vessels, and it leads to ischemia

20
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:37,710
then the muscles, and let's just say this a coronary artery here...

21
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,749
the muscle cells over here are going to get less oxygen.

22
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:49,736
So this muscle cell over here is not going to get enough oxygen -- and this is an oversimplified diagram

23
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:54,751
And, this is not what an actual muscle cell looks like. But I don't want to get into detail here...

24
00:02:54,795 --> 00:03:08,639
But, this guy is not going to get enough oxygen. So, you can imagine that if we're really zoomed in on the surface of the heart

25
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,400
and we're looking at the cardiac muscle tissue, if this person with this heart needed to go jogging

26
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,038
and this cardiac muscle cell needed oxygen, they probably wouldn't be able to get the needed oxygen

27
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:24,800
because of the stenosis which caused ischemia.

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:34,097
And because of that, this cell won't be able to help the heart pump properly

29
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:39,867
So this is going to lead to heart failure, and once again the word heart failure

30
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:45,698
sounds more dramatic than it really is. It sounds like the heart stops (cardiac arrest)

31
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:53,893
but it's really just saying that the heart is failing to PROPERLY do it's function -- not entirely shutting down.

32
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:58,330
So when this guy is jogging, because he has restricted blood supply

33
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,577
because the heart is experiencing ischemia downstream from

34
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:08,733
this stenosis, that's why there's heart failure -- so not able to deliver

35
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:14,398
Now, this heart failure which is due to the ischemia and the stenosis

36
00:04:14,398 --> 00:04:27,600
you would call this heart failure due to 'Coronary Artery Disease'

37
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,321
which is really just kind of an impairing of the heart's function

38
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:40,172
because of reduced blood supply, because of narrowing of the blood vessels

39
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:45,327
that is Coronary Artery Disease, and because of this disease

40
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:49,414
when this muscle cell in the heart really needs to pump hard

41
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,500
maybe because someone's going up a hill or climbing stairs

42
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,800
it won't be able to do it because it's not getting enough oxygen.

43
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:06,411
Now, that inability to properly pump -- not just the cell, but the whole heart -- that is heart failure.

44
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:15,002
Now you've probably the heard the term 'Coronary Heart Disease'

45
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:25,683
or maybe just 'Heart Disease'... these three things are all the SAME thing.

46
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:30,420
They all imply some sort of narrowing, or stenosis, of arteries that leads

47
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,800
to ischemia, reduced blood flow, so that the heart can't function

48
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,894
as well as it otherwise could. Now the last thing I want to focus on

49
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:44,923
and I talked a little bit in the last video, is the idea of an infarct or infarction.

50
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,925
These are kind of... funny words to say, so I'll right it over here

51
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:56,333
So, an infarct or infarction... now, in the example I've drawn so far

52
00:05:56,333 --> 00:06:02,928
this cell maybe doesn't get enough oxygen, especially when the person is going up stairs and all of that,

53
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:09,569
to properly contract the heart and pump blood. But this cell is not dead.

54
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:14,770
It's still getting some base level oxygen -- less because of the stenosis and ischemia

55
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,971
but it still gets some oxygen. Now we saw on the video on myocardial infarctions

56
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:24,383
or heart attacks that sometimes, one of these plaques might become

57
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:29,445
unstable and they break off and then you have a complete blocking

58
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:34,205
of a vessel, and we called this -- if it's an embolus...

59
00:06:34,205 --> 00:06:42,843
and remember that an embolus is something that is just floating around

60
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:47,580
and eventually blocks a vessel, and if it was a due to a ruptured

61
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,899
plaque that also had clotting factors around it when it was released,

62
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,010
then we would call this a thromboembolism.

63
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:04,000
And this would reduce the blood flow so much, that the cells downstream

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,311
from this location actually die

65
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:18,602
because it's not even getting enough blood, not enough oxygen, to survive

66
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:27,912
and when you have dead tissue that's due to a loss of oxygen, this is an infarct.

67
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:33,184
The process of it becoming dead tissue due to a loss of oxygen

68
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:47,400
is an infarction. When this infarction occurs in the muscle tissue of the heart, this is a heart attack

69
00:07:47,400 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a myocardial infarction... so hopefully that clarifies things a little bit.
