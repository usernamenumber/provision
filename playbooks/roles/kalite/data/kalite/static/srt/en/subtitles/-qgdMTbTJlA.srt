4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,830
What I want to do in this video
is talk a little bit

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,490
about compounding interest. And
then, have a little bit of

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,050
a discussion of a way to
quickly, kind of an

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,530
approximate way to
figure out how

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,890
quickly something compounds.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,340
And then we'll actually see how
good of an approximation

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,490
this really is.

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,940
So just as a review, let's say
I'm running some type of a

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,730
bank and I tell you that I am
offering 10% interest that

13
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,980
compounds annually.

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,860
   

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,830
That's usually not the
case in a real bank.

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,080
You would probably compound
continuously.

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,620
But I'm just going to
keep it a simple

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,040
example, compounding annually.

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,430
There are other videos on
compounding continuously.

20
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,110
This makes the math
a little simpler.

21
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,780
And all that means is that,
let's say today you deposit

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,540
$100 in that bank account.

23
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,129
If we wait one year and you
just keep that in the bank

24
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,280
account, then you'll have
your $100 plus 10%

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,190
on your $100 deposit.

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,330
10% of 100 is going
to be another $10.

27
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:23,200
So after a year, you're
going to have $110.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,550
You can just say I added
10% to the 100.

29
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,930
And after two years, or a year
after that first year, after

30
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,900
two years, you're going to get
10% not just on the $100.

31
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,500
You're going to get
10% on the $110.

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,890
So you get 10% on $110.

33
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,040
You're going to get
another $11.

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,870
So 10% of $110 is $11.

35
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,490
So you're going to get $110--
that was, you can imagine,

36
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,960
your deposit entering
your second year.

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,950
And then you get plus
10% on that.

38
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,980
Not 10% on your initial
deposit.

39
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,880
That's why we say
it compounds.

40
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,970
You get interest on the interest
from previous years.

41
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,290
So $110 plus now $11.

42
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,380
So every year, the amount of
interest we're getting-- if we

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,639
don't withdraw anything--
goes up.

44
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,950
So now we have $121.

45
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,570
And I could just keep
doing that.

46
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,400
And the general way to figure
out how much you have after

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,170
let's say, n years, is
you multiply it.

48
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,960
   

49
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,860
I'll use a little bit
of algebra here.

50
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,790
So let's say this
is my original

51
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,240
deposit, or my principal.

52
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,840
However you want to view it.

53
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,090
After x years, so after 1 year,
you would just multiply

54
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,570
it to get-- to this number
right here, you

55
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,260
multiply it by 1.1.

56
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,090
Actually, let me
do it this way.

57
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,040
I don't want to be
too abstract.

58
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,570
So just to get the math here, so
to get to this number right

59
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,340
here, we just multiplied.

60
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,510
That number right there is
100 times 1 plus 10%.

61
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,780
Or you could say 1.1.

62
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,780
Now this number right here
is going to be this

63
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,130
110 times 1.1 again.

64
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,370
So it's this.

65
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,170
It's the 100 times 1.1, which
was this number right there.

66
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,400
And now we're going to multiply
that times 1.1 again.

67
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,830
And remember, where does
the 1.1 come from?

68
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:21,340
1.1 is the same thing as
100% plus another 10%.

69
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,040
Right?

70
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,780
That's what we're getting.

71
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,800
We have 100% of our original
deposit plus another 10%.

72
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,170
So we're multiplying by 1.1.

73
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,170
Here we're doing that twice.

74
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,620
We multiply by 1.1 twice.

75
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,410
So after three years, how
much money do we have?

76
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:44,030
So after three years, we're
going to have 100 times 1.1 to

77
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,390
the third power.

78
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,320
After n years-- now we're
getting a little abstract

79
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,430
here-- we're going to have 100
times 1.1 to the nth power.

80
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,100
And now you could imagine, this
is not easy to calculate.

81
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,790
This was all the situation where
we're dealing with 10%.

82
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,280
If we're dealing in a world
where let's say it's 7%.

83
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,700
So let's say this is a different
reality here, where

84
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:16,019
we have 7% compounding annual
interest. Then after 1 year,

85
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,589
we would have 100 times--
instead of 1.1, it'd be 100%

86
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,940
plus 7% or 1.07.

87
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,380
Let's go to three years.

88
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,390
After three years, I could
do two in between.

89
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:35,450
It'd be 100 times 1.07
to the third power.

90
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,230
Or 1.07 times itself
three times.

91
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,290
After n years, it'd be 1.07
to the nth power.

92
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,860
So I think you get the sense
here that, although the idea

93
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,020
is reasonably simple, to
actually calculate compounding

94
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,950
interest is actually
pretty difficult.

95
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,240
And even more, let's say I were
to ask you, how long does

96
00:04:51,240 --> 00:05:04,790
it take to double your money?

97
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,110
So if you were to just use this
math right here, you'd

98
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,660
have to say gee, to double my
money, I would have to start

99
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,300
with $100 and I'm going to
multiply that times-- let's

100
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,790
say, whatever.

101
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,880
Let's say it's a 10% interest.
1.1 or 1.10-- depending on how

102
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,540
you want to view it-- to the x
is equal to-- well I'm going

103
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,700
to double my money
so it's going to

104
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,900
have to equal to $200.

105
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,390
And now I'm going to have to
solve for x and I'm going to

106
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,060
have to do some logarithms
here.

107
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,770
You can divide both
sides by 100.

108
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,490
You get 1.1 to the
x is equal to 2.

109
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,010
I just divided both
sides by 100.

110
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,890
And then you could take the
logarithm of both sides base

111
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,980
1.1, and you get x.

112
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,060
And I'm showing you that this
is complicated on purpose.

113
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,880
And if any of this is confusing,
there's multiple

114
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,840
videos on how to solve these.

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,780
You get x is equal to
log base 1.1 of 2.

116
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,120
And most of us cannot do
this in our heads.

117
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,360
So although the idea is simple,
how long will it take

118
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,295
for me to double my money?

119
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:06,280
To actually solve it, to get
the exact answer, is not an

120
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,950
easy thing to do.

121
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,730
If you have a simple calculator,
you can kind of

122
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,370
keep incrementing the number
of years until you get a

123
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,950
number that's close.

124
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,280
But no straightforward
way to do it.

125
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,500
And this is with 10%.

126
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,050
If we're doing it with
9.3% it just

127
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,090
becomes even more difficult.

128
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,100
So what I'm going to do in the
next video is I'm going to

129
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,840
explain something called the
rule of 72, which is an

130
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,670
approximate way to figure
out how long

131
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,700
to answer this question.

132
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,650
How long does it take to double
your-- I forgot the

133
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,340
word, the most important word.

134
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,730
How long does it take to
double your money?

135
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,540
And we'll see how good of an
approximation it is in that

136
