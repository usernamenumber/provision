1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,640
Let's say we have a circle,
and then we have a

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,280
diameter of the circle.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,080
Let me draw my best diameter.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,760
That's pretty good.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,580
This right here is the diameter
of the circle or it's a

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,700
diameter of the circle.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,110
That's a diameter.

9
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,220
Let's say I have a triangle
where the diameter is one side

10
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:26,040
of the triangle, and the angle
opposite that side, it's

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,960
vertex, sits some place
on the circumference.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,200
So, let's say, the angle or the
angle opposite of this diameter

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,260
sits on that circumference.

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,020
So the triangle
looks like this.

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,160
The triangle looks like that.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,170
What I'm going to show you
in this video is that

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,700
this triangle is going
to be a right triangle.

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,290
   

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,040
The 90 degree side is going
to be the side that is

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,550
opposite this diameter.

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,340
I don't want to label it
just yet because that would

22
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,140
ruin the fun of the proof.

23
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,070
Now let's see what we
can do to show this.

24
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,910
Well, we have in our tool kit
the notion of an inscribed

25
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,970
angle, it's relation to
a central angle that

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,830
subtends the same arc.

27
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,720
So let's look at that.

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,950
So let's say that this is an
inscribed angle right here.

29
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,760
Let's call this theta.

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,070
Now let's say that
that's the center of

31
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,370
my circle right there.

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,190
Then this angle right here
would be a central angle.

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,620
Let me draw another triangle
right here, another

34
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,460
line right there.

35
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,130
This is a central
angle right here.

36
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,190
This is a radius.

37
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,070
This is the same radius
-- actually this

38
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,230
distance is the same.

39
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,480
But we've learned several
videos ago that look, this

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,710
angle, this inscribed angle,
it subtends this arc up here.

41
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,420
   

42
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,850
The central angle that subtends
that same arc is going

43
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,400
to be twice this angle.

44
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,040
We proved that
several videos ago.

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,150
So this is going to be 2theta.

46
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,260
It's the central angle
subtending the same arc.

47
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:10,120
Now, this triangle right here,
this one right here, this

48
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,620
is an isosceles triangle.

49
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,800
I could rotate it and
draw it like this.

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,480
   

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,163
If I flipped it over it would
look like that, that, and then

52
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:25,000
the green side would
be down like that.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,980
And both of these sides
are of length r.

54
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,160
This top angle is 2theta.

55
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,530
So all I did is I took it
and I rotated it around to

56
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,060
draw it for you this way.

57
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,050
This side is that
side right there.

58
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,660
Since its two sides are equal,
this is isosceles, so these to

59
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,980
base angles must be the same.

60
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,580
   

61
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,820
That and that must be the same,
or if I were to draw it up

62
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,150
here, that and that must be
the exact same base angle.

63
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,150
Now let me see, I already
used theta, maybe I'll

64
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,800
use x for these angles.

65
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,230
So this has to be x,
and that has to be x.

66
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,000
So what is x going
to be equal to?

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,120
Well, x plus x plus 2theta
have to equal 180 degrees.

68
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,970
They're all in the
same triangle.

69
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,770
So let me write that down.

70
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:23,010
We get x plus x plus 2theta,
all have to be equal to 180

71
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:30,880
degrees, or we get 2x plus
2theta is equal to 180 degrees,

72
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,970
or we get 2x is equal
to 180 minus 2theta.

73
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,980
Divide both sides by 2, you get
x is equal to 90 minus theta.

74
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:50,590
So x is equal to
90 minus theta.

75
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,890
Now let's see what else
we could do with this.

76
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,130
Well we could look at this
triangle right here.

77
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,160
This triangle, this side over
here also has this distance

78
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,930
right here is also a
radius of the circle.

79
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,080
This distance over here we've
already labeled it, is

80
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,060
a radius of a circle.

81
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,870
So once again, this is also
an isosceles triangle.

82
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,770
These two sides are equal,
so these two base angles

83
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,500
have to be equal.

84
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,160
So if this is theta,
this is also going to

85
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,895
be equal to theta.

86
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:20,770
And actually, we use that
information, we use to actually

87
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:25,100
show that first result about
inscribed angles and the

88
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,340
relation between them and
central angles subtending

89
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,980
the same arc.

90
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,670
So if this is theta, that's
theta because this is

91
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,120
an isosceles triangle.

92
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,150
So what is this whole
angle over here?

93
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,850
Well it's going to be theta
plus 90 minus theta.

94
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,650
That angle right there's
going to be theta

95
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,690
plus 90 minus theta.

96
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,270
Well, the thetas cancel out.

97
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,690
So no matter what, as long as
one side of my triangle is the

98
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,070
diameter, and then the angle or
the vertex of the angle

99
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,620
opposite sits opposite of
that side, sits on the

100
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,780
circumference, then this angle
right here is going to be a

101
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:08,750
right angle, and this is going
to be a right triangle.

102
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,640
So if I just were to draw
something random like this --

103
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,010
if I were to just take a point
right there, like that, and

104
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,750
draw it just like that,
this is a right angle.

105
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,220
If I were to draw something
like that and go out like

106
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,240
that, this is a right angle.

107
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,860
For any of these I could
do this exact same proof.

108
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,090
And in fact, the way I drew it
right here, I kept it very

109
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,810
general so it would apply
to any of these triangles.

110
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,132
