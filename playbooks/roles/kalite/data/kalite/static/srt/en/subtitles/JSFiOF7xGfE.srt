1
00:00:00,249 --> 00:00:06,388
Let's go little bit into how we can tell whether our body is processing glucose properly

2
00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:10,143
And whether or maybe we have diabetes

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:13,050
And I want you all to take all of this with a huge grain of salt

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,975
because I am not a doctor, this is not medical advice

5
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:19,040
My goal here is to kind of just explore this subject with you

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,400
and try for all of us to get a better understanding of things

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,913
So let's think about what might happen after we have a meal

8
00:00:25,913 --> 00:00:27,910
So we draw a little chart over here

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,947
So let's call this "hours"

10
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:39,142
And then on the vertical axis, I'm going to talk about our concentration of sugar in the blood

11
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:44,847
--so "blood sugar concentration"

12
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:48,139
sugar--actually you can call it "glucose concentration"

13
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:53,938
"blood sugar", we are talking about glucose

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,677
So let me draw a couple of points on this chart

15
00:00:58,677 --> 00:01:06,038
So maybe this is 50, and our unit is going to be milligrams per decilitre (mg/dL)

16
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:14,211
Actually let me just do it this way, let me just say that everything is in milligram per decilitre

17
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:20,527
and we will talk in future videos about how we can relate this unit to everyday terms

18
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:25,867
But let's say that this right here is 50, this right here is 100

19
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:32,601
this right here is 150, and let's mark it right here at 200

20
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:35,202
So let's think about what will happen for a normal person

21
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:37,663
Let me mark some hours over here

22
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:48,019
so hour 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; that's probably good enough

23
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:54,242
So the normal person, when they haven't eaten anything for a long time, let's say greater than 8 hours

24
00:01:54,242 --> 00:02:00,001
So their fasting blood sugar, will be right around 80 mg/dL, give or take a little bit

25
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:04,691
There's a range around that, but I just want to show you what would happen to a normal person

26
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:12,261
So 80 mg/dL, their blood sugar should hopefully be right around there

27
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:16,600
And sometimes this fasting blood sugar, maybe we are assuming this is in the morning

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,067
maybe this hour 1 is 7am, so they haven't eaten for a while

29
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:21,944
that's fasting blood sugar

30
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:25,806
This is also, you'll hear in, sometimes your doctor

31
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:28,106
I heard my wife say this word without knowing what it meant

32
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:33,110
they sometimes say "preprandial"

33
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:36,531
Which is a very fancy word, which just means "before a meal"

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,846
"preprandial" is literally "before eating"

35
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:42,586
After the meal, you'll talking "postprandial"

36
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:46,348
A very fancy word, for a very simple idea, eating

37
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:51,335
So let's say at hour 2, this individual eats breakfast

38
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:56,982
So this is when the individual is going to eat breakfast

39
00:02:56,982 --> 00:03:03,438
Now a normal person, when the person eats breakfast there'll be some carbohydrates in that breakfast

40
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:09,196
And it will be broken down into glucose, and glucose will enter the blood stream

41
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:15,280
And so their blood glucose will go up

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,534
it will slowly go up

43
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:21,596
And I was reading some studies, they say it kind of spikes 45 minutes into a meal

44
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,267
So let's see, 45 min is over there

45
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,868
so maybe it will go up to about there

46
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:32,695
And in a normal individual, the blood glucose level really shouldn't go above 120 mg/dL

47
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:34,970
And you know, there's obviously exceptions to all of these

48
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,664
we're just kind of saying that the normal breakfast, the normal person

49
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:41,936
not, you know, they're not eating a pint of honey, doing something crazy

50
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:46,673
Let's say 120 would be right around there

51
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:50,533
A normal person, you wouldn't, someone who does not have diabetes

52
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,989
it'll be unlikely that it'll go above that

53
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:57,169
And actually about after 2 hours, they're getting pretty close to normal

54
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:00,001
they're getting back under 100 mg/dL

55
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:06,271
And then you go beyond 2 hours, they just kind of get close back to their baseline

56
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,454
to the 80 mg/dL

57
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:12,262
So once again, this is normal

58
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:18,200
and of course, don't freak out if you were to take a blood test one morning and you're like 85 mg/dL

59
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,800
you're still not far off from normal, so obviously there's some variation from person to person

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,509
Now, if someone has diabetes, if either they have Type I, they don't have enough insulin

61
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:34,924
to actually process the glucose

62
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:39,290
or, if they have enough insulin, but their body is desensitised

63
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,259
the insulin is not being processed, so they can't process the glucose

64
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,253
We'll see that the glucose concentration will go up

65
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:53,593
And so in general, if you were to wake up one morning after not having eaten for more than 8 hours

66
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:58,934
and you were to prick your finger with little glucose monitors you can get at the drug store

67
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:03,600
And in your finger, the blood sugar levels, if you're to find them to be

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:16,209
let's say you're to find them to be at 140 mg/dL

69
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,599
it's a good indication, you shouldn't freak out, you should do multiple tests

70
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:23,268
and make sure that it wasn't a false reading or any of that

71
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:24,695
And you should definitely see a doctor

72
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:27,378
Once again, don't take this as any type of medical advice

73
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:32,394
that is not the purpose of this. The purpose of this is to understand a little bit of what's going on

74
00:05:32,394 --> 00:05:36,480
Don't change your lifestyle based on any thing I tell you

75
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,796
Alright, but if you do experience that, it looks like, at least just from that one data point

76
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:45,133
that your body is not processing sugar properly

77
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:48,044
because you had over 8 hours to process the sugar

78
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:51,759
for insulin to go into your blood steam, and allow glucose to be taken up

79
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,384
and get back down to normal level

80
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:55,149
but it still hasn't gone there

81
00:05:55,149 --> 00:06:00,118
So if you were to test a value like that, you should be concerned.

82
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:03,416
In general, the threshold--I've seen multiple thresholds here--

83
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:09,035
are between--I've seen high, and kind of middle one--120-130 mg/dL

84
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:17,092
So you're fasting, blood sugar is around this line right here

85
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:19,267
remember, the fasting blood sugar, not after you've eaten

86
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:22,247
Preprendial, before meal

87
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:28,609
if it is above that threshold right over there, then you should definitely at least see a doctor

88
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:32,231
and make sure they can see if you have diabetes

89
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:34,925
but this will be cause for concern

90
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:38,267
Another thing is that after a meal it spikes well beyond that

91
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,312
if we're talking it gets above 180

92
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:44,352
you know, once again, these are just thresholds that, you know, doctors have come up with

93
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:45,978
and researchers have come up with

94
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:50,343
and say, "hey this is a good indication that somehow you're not processing glucose properly"

95
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:56,566
so 180, 180 is up here, I'm drawing this is a squiggly line 'cause it's kind of a range

96
00:06:56,566 --> 00:07:01,674
you know, it's not like if your blood glucose is 124 you're safe

97
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:03,671
and all of a sudden 125 you have diabetes

98
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:07,990
you know they're not that different from each other, but they have to set up some thesholds

99
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,473
so that, just to kind of have a threshold I guess

100
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:17,464
so if your blood sugar, after eating a meal, were to spike up to 200

101
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:20,157
once again, that would be cause for concern

102
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:25,730
In general, if someone has diabetes because they're not processing the glucose properly

103
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,188
their blood glucose might look something like this

104
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:35,808
So maybe their fasting glucose is right around 125-130, they can move around

105
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:39,476
then they have a meal, that it might spike up

106
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:44,863
obviously they can process some of the glucose, otherwise they would die

107
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:47,185
but it's not being processed properly

108
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:50,204
so the glucose levels don't go down to where they should

109
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:55,359
And maybe some glucose gets taken up from the blood

110
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:58,795
obviously they're living, so the cells are metabolising something

111
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:03,114
but it never gets to the normal 80 mg/dL

112
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:08,501
it might settle down back to something in the 120 range, to something like that

113
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,870
which would be cause for concern

114
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:18,207
And in general if you're some place, I've seen the threshold if you're above 100 on a fasting basis

115
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,783
that's cause for concern, you should maybe adjust your lifestyle

116
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:30,133
And if you're above 120-130 after a meal, once again, you should also be slightly worried

117
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:34,322
that you might be prediabetic, or you might have some risk of developing diabetes

118
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:41,484
So if someone has blood sugar like this, they're probably diabetic

119
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:46,867
and if someone has blood sugar like this, they should be worried

120
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:50,158
Once again, I'm not a doctor, don't take any of this as an advice

121
00:08:50,158 --> 99:59:59,999
This is really just our attempt to understand things a little bit better
