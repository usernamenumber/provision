1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,507
Let's see if we can take the integral of cosine of 5x over e to the sine of 5x dx.

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:12,440
And there's a crow squawking outside of my window so I'll try to stay focused.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,591
So let's think about whether u-substitution might be appropriate. Your first temptation might to said,

4
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:24,427
"Hey, maybe we let u equal sine of 5x, and if u is equal to sine of 5x,

5
00:00:24,427 --> 00:00:28,204
we have something that is pretty close to du up here." Let's verify that.

6
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:33,967
So du could be equal to -- so du/dx (derivative of u with respect to x),

7
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,957
well we just use the chain rule. Derivative of 5x is 5,

8
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:43,880
times the derivative of sine of 5x with respect to 5x, that's just going to be cosine of 5x.

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,257
If we want to write this in differential form, which is useful when we do our u-substitution,

10
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:54,404
we could say that du is equal to 5 cosine 5x.

11
00:00:54,404 --> 00:01:00,616
Now when you look over here, we don't have quite du there. We have just cosine of 5x dx--

12
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:05,420
sorry, I need cosine of 5x dx, just like that. So when you look over here,

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,032
you have a cosine of 5x dx, but we don't have a 5 cosine of 5x dx,

14
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:17,634
but we know how to solve that. We can multiply by 5 and divide by 5.

15
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:22,741
1/5 times 5 is just going to be 1. So we haven't changed the value of the expression.

16
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:31,679
But when we do it this way, we see pretty clearly, we have our u and we have our du.

17
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:36,209
Our du is 5 -- let me circle that and let me do that in that blue color --

18
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:45,374
is 5 cosine of 5x dx. So we can rewrite this entire expression as --

19
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:49,548
I'll do that 1/5 in purple -- this is going to be equal to 1/5 --

20
00:01:49,548 --> 00:01:52,370
I hope you don't hear that crow outside; he's getting quite obnoxious --

21
00:01:52,370 --> 00:02:03,735
1/5 times the integral of, well all this stuff in blue is my du,

22
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:15,546
and then that is over e to the u. So how do we take the anti-derivative of this?

23
00:02:15,546 --> 00:02:20,391
Well, you might be tempted to -- well, what would you do here?

24
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:24,821
Well, we're still not quite ready to simply take the anti-derivative here.

25
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:28,490
If I were to rewrite this, I could rewrite this as (this is equal to)

26
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:42,577
1/5 times the integral of e to the negative u du.

27
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:45,926
And so, what might jump out of you is maybe we do another substitution,

28
00:02:45,926 --> 00:02:51,198
and we already use the letter u, so maybe we might use w. We'll do some "w-substitution."

29
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:56,657
And you might be able to do this in your head, but we'll do w-substitution just to make it a little bit clearer.

30
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:59,753
So let's -- this would've been really useful if this was just e to the u,

31
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:02,362
because we know the anti-derivative of e to the u. It's just e to the u.

32
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:07,263
So let's just try to get it in terms of the form of e to the negative something.

33
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:16,355
So let's set -- and I'm running out of colors here -- w equal to negative u.

34
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:23,094
And in that case, then dw (derivative of w with respect to u) is negative 1,

35
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:26,080
or if we were to write that statement in differential form,

36
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,172
dw is equal to du times negative 1 is negative du.

37
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:39,273
So this right over here would be our w, and do we have a dw here?

38
00:03:39,273 --> 00:03:42,301
Well we just have du; we don't have a negative du there.

39
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:47,034
But we can create a negative du by multiplying this inside by negative 1,

40
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:49,608
but then also multiplying the outside by negative 1.

41
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:52,843
Negative 1 times negative 1 is positive 1; we haven't changed the value.

42
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:55,731
We have to do both of these in order for it to make sense.

43
00:03:55,731 --> 00:04:01,918
Or I could do it like this. So negative 1 over here, and a negative 1 right over there.

44
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:07,062
And if we do it in that form, then this negative 1 times du --

45
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:15,019
that's the same thing as negative du -- this is this right over here.

46
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,981
And so we can rewrite our integral -- it's going to be equal to --

47
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:28,478
now it's going to be negative 1/5 -- trying to use the colors as best as I can --

48
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:34,954
times the indefinite integral of e to the -- well instead of negative u, we could right w.

49
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:47,040
E to the w. And instead of du times negative 1 or negative du, we can write "dw."

50
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,421
Now this simplifies things a good bit. We know what the anti-derivative of this in terms of w.

51
00:04:52,421 --> 00:05:08,358
This is going to be equal to negative 1/5 e to the w, and then we might have some constant there,

52
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:15,113
so I just do a plus C. And now we just have to all of our un-substituting.

53
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:19,968
So we know that w is equal to negative u, so we could write that --

54
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:33,613
so this is equal to negative 1/5 -- I want to stay true to my colors -- e to the negative u,

55
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:38,694
that's what w is equal to, plus C. But we're still not done un-substituting.

56
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:46,646
We know that u is equal to sine of 5x. So we can write this as being equal to

57
00:05:46,646 --> 00:06:05,192
negative 1/5 times e to the negative u, which is negative u is sine of 5x,

58
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:13,463
and then finally, we have our plus C. Now, there was a simpler way that we could've done this

59
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:17,118
by just doing one substitution. But then you kind of have to look ahead a little bit

60
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:24,033
and realize that it was not trivial to take -- not to bad to take your anti-derivative of e to the negative u.

61
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:27,921
The inside that you might of have although you shouldn't really hold yourself

62
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,184
when you feel too bad when you didn't see that inside.

63
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:35,242
We could've rewritten that original integral -- let me rewrite it --

64
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:49,579
it's cosine of 5x over e to the sine of 5x dx. We could've written this entire integral as being equal to

65
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:59,816
cosine of 5x times e to the negative sine of 5x dx. And in this situation, we could've said

66
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:05,192
u to be equal to negative of 5x, and say well, if u is equal to --

67
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:16,250
or negative sine of 5x, then du is going to be equal to negative 5 cosine of 5x,

68
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,831
and we don't have a negative 5 -- oh, dx, we don't have a negative 5 here,

69
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,843
but we can construct one by putting negative 5 there, then multiplying by negative 1/5,

70
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:31,238
and then that would've immediately simplified this integral right over here to be equal to

71
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:45,065
negative 1/5 times the integral of -- well, we have our du -- let me do this in a different color --

72
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:52,751
that's the negative 5 -- let me do it this way -- negative 5 cosine of 5x dx.

73
00:07:52,751 --> 00:08:00,732
So that is our du -- I'm just changing the order of multiplication -- times e to the u.

74
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:06,366
This whole thing now is u this second time around. So if we did it this way, with just one substitution,

75
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:11,162
we could've immediately gotten to the result that we wanted. You take the anti-derivative of this --

76
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:14,736
I'll do it in one color now, just 'cause I think you get the idea -- this is equal to

77
00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:24,883
negative 1/5 e to the u plus C. u is equal to negative sine of 5x,

78
00:08:24,883 --> 00:08:34,898
so this is equal to negative 1/5 e to the negative sine of 5x plus C. And we're done.

79
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:40,024
So this one is faster; it's simpler, and over time, you might even start being able to do this in your head.

80
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:44,557
This top one, you still didn't mess up by just setting u equal to sine of 5x;

81
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:49,247
we just have to do an extra substitution in order to work it through all the way.

82
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:53,247
And I was able to do this video despite the crowing crow outside -- or squawking crow.
