1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830
   

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,600
Let's say we have some
ammonia gas.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,720
That's NH3 and it's a gas,
that's why the g is in

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,770
parentheses.

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:15,150
And we combine that with some
oxygen, molecular oxygen, it's

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,360
also a gas.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:24,380
And that reaction produces
some nitrogen monoxide.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,320
NO, monoxide, there's only
one oxygen there.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,950
That's also a gas, it's also
called nitric oxide, not to be

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,690
confused with nitrous oxide.

11
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,230
I'll write nitrous oxide, it's
N2O, this is laughing gas.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,450
Anyway, I don't want to divert
you too much, we have to focus

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,640
on the problem.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,272
So this is nitric oxide
or nitrogen monoxide.

15
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:49,890
It's a pollutant, I think
it comes out of

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,930
some cigarette smokes.

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,450
I think it's used in
the body, as well.

18
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,670
You could we could look
it up on the internet.

19
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,670
There's your oxide.

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,860
Ammonia is an important
fertilizer.

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,910
You know all about oxygen.

22
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,130
And this also yields
some water.

23
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,390
So, plus some H2O.

24
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:14,270
And we're told that we're given
34 grams of ammonia.

25
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,585
And we're given 32
grams of oxygen.

26
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:21,120
   

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,132
This is going to be the
oxygen molecule, O2.

28
00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:31,320
So the question is, how many
grams of nitrogen monoxide, or

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,930
the nitric oxide, are going
to be produced?

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:41,560
So how much of just the NO is
going to be produced in grams?

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,650
So this is a stoichiometry
problem.

32
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,120
And so the important thing first
is to just make sure we

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,580
have a balanced equation before
we even start anything.

34
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,200
And lo and behold, we don't
have a balanced equation.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,740
Let's confirm that it's
not balanced.

36
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,530
Let's see, we have one nitrogen
here, we have one

37
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,320
nitrogen there.

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,710
That looks balanced so far.

39
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,610
And remember, the pattern is
start with the complicated

40
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,810
stuff, leave the single atom
molecules for last. Because

41
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,889
those you can fix at the
end without missing

42
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,060
anything else up.

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,570
Hydrogen, we have three
hydrogens on

44
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,190
the left-hand side.

45
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,120
On the right-hand side we
have two hydrogens.

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,790
   

47
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,030
So let's see, how can we have
three hydrogens on the

48
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,610
right-hand side?

49
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:28,360
If we multiply this times one
and a half, 1.5, now we have

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,250
three hydrogens on this side.

51
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,750
1.5 times 2, we have
three hydrogens on

52
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,030
the right-hand side.

53
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,280
Things are looking good.

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,990
   

55
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,760
We have two oxygen on
the left-hand side.

56
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,300
How many oxygens do we have
on the right-hand side?

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,900
We have one oxygen here, and
we have one oxygen in this

58
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,540
molecule, but we have one and a
half of the whole molecule.

59
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,330
So we have one and a half
oxygens and then we have one

60
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,040
more oxygen.

61
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,800
So we have two and a half
oxygens on the right-hand

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,740
side, we only have two
in this molecule.

63
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,190
So what do we have to do?

64
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,810
How can we get two and
a half oxygens here?

65
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:10,810
Well if we multiply it
by 5/4, or 1.25.

66
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,400
5/4 times 2 is 5/2,
which is 2.5.

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,050
So now we have 2.5 oxygens.

68
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,070
5/4 times 2 is 2.5.

69
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,810
1 plus 1.5 is also 2.5.

70
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,270
Well, we're not balanced yet.

71
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,850
We can't leave this equation
with just these weird decimal

72
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,980
numbers over there.

73
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,230
So let's rewrite it.

74
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,350
   

75
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,440
If we wanted to get rid of all
of these, we can multiply the

76
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,970
entire equation by 2.

77
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,010
No, not 2.

78
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,640
We have to multiply the entire
equation by 4 to get rid of

79
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,670
this 4 in the denominator.

80
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:55,170
So we multiply the entire
equation by 4, we have 4

81
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,170
molecules of ammonia.

82
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,270
We can even think of it
in terms of moles.

83
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,120
Right now I'm thinking of
individual molecules.

84
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,200
But we could say we have
4 moles of ammonia.

85
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,620
4 times 6 times 10 to the
23 molecules of ammonia.

86
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,640
Either way it all works out.

87
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,940
Hopefully, you're starting to
see the value of moles.

88
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,010
Plus 5 molecules, I'll just
think of it in terms of

89
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,780
individual molecules for
now, plus 5 molecules

90
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,316
of molecular oxygen.

91
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:35,080
   

92
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,260
We're just multiplying
everything by 4, that's what

93
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,990
we're doing.

94
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:45,550
Yields 4 moles of nitrogen
monoxide.

95
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,690
So 4NO plus, we multiplied
both sides by

96
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,630
4, so plus 6 waters.

97
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,940
6 H2O.

98
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,500
So there you go, we
got some good

99
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,200
practice balancing equations.

100
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,780
So let's go back to the
original problem.

101
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,716
We're given 34 grams
of ammonia.

102
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:08,040
   

103
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,020
So what we need to figure out
is how many moles of ammonia

104
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,750
were we given?

105
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,000
So what's the atomic
mass of ammonia?

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,300
Not the atomic mass, what's the
molecular mass of ammonia?

107
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,510
   

108
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,790
We're dealing with nitrogen
14, so it has a

109
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,340
mass number of 14.

110
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,560
Hydrogen has a mass
number of 1.

111
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,650
So each nitrogen has
a mass of 14.

112
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,290
And then the hydrogens each
have a mass of 1.

113
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,820
Remember, hydrogen is
kind of strange.

114
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,890
It doesn't have neutrons,
or at least in its most

115
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,780
traditional form.

116
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,130
So it has just a mass
number of 1.

117
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,790
It's just a proton and an
electron if it's neutral.

118
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,110
So this is 3 times 1.

119
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,570
We have three hydrogen atoms. So
the mass, the atomic mass,

120
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,720
of one molecule of ammonia
is 14 plus 3 is

121
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,770
17 atomic mass units.

122
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,670
Or, another way to write that,
if one molecule of ammonia is

123
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:14,990
17 atomic mass units,
then 1 mole of

124
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,300
ammonia is how many grams?

125
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,590
It's going to be 17 grams.

126
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,440
So how many moles of ammonia
are we given?

127
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,990
We're given 34 grams of ammonia,
1 mole is 17 grams.

128
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,470
So we're given 2 moles.

129
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,020
34 is 2 times 17.

130
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,070
So this is 2 moles.

131
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,480
We're given 2 moles
of ammonia.

132
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,400
Let's see how much oxygen
we're given.

133
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,490
Or how much of the molecular
oxygen we've been

134
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,160
given in this case.

135
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,660
So let's see, the mass of just
oxygen by itself is 16.

136
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,590
The mass of just the atomic
oxygen, you have to be a

137
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,050
little bit careful here because
sometimes people say

138
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,340
we have 32 grams of oxygen when
they're really talking

139
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,010
about the molecular oxygen.

140
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,540
Well, I guess it doesn't
matter either way.

141
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,640
But, sometimes when they talk
about oxygen you have to make

142
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,890
sure whether it is molecular
or atomic oxygen.

143
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,585
But the atomic mass number
of oxygen is 16.

144
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:17,160
I can confirm that
by looking at the

145
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,670
periodic table down here.

146
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,420
   

147
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,710
So what's the molecular mass of
the diatomic molecule O2?

148
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,110
Well it has 2 oxygen, so it's
going to be 2 times 16 equals

149
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,880
32 atomic mass units.

150
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,130
One molecule of O2 is 32
atomic mass units.

151
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:44,730
Or 1 mole of O2 is
how many grams?

152
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,690
Well if one molecule is 32
atomic mass units, then 6

153
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,450
times 10 to the 23 of that
molecule are going to be that

154
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,970
many grams. 32 grams. So how
many moles of oxygen have we

155
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,070
been given?

156
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,990
We've been given exactly 32
grams of oxygen, which is

157
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,500
exactly 1 mole.

158
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,140
So we've been given 34 grams of
ammonia, which is 2 moles.

159
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,880
Let me write that in a
nice vibrant color.

160
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,760
   

161
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,750
And we've been given 1 mole
of the oxygen molecule.

162
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,780
Now, when we look at this
reaction, for every 4 moles of

163
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,179
ammonia, we need 5
moles of oxygen.

164
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,159
Or for every 5 moles of oxygen
we need 4 moles of ammonia.

165
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,080
So something doesn't gel here.

166
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,020
Normally, we need more
moles of oxygen

167
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,350
than we have ammonia.

168
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,930
In the example that we're
working through, we've been

169
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,350
given less moles of oxygen
than ammonia.

170
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,290
We've been given less
oxygen than we need

171
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,000
for all of this ammonia.

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,850
In an ideal world, if we had 2
moles of ammonia, we would

173
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,260
need 2.5 moles of oxygen.

174
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,820
The ratio of ammonia
to oxygen, let

175
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,170
me write that down.

176
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,440
In a different color, this
is getting boring.

177
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:12,000
The ratio of ammonia, NH3 to
oxygen in our balanced

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,780
equation, let me put that in a
square so you know this is the

179
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,260
most important part of
what I'm writing.

180
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,680
The ratio in this
reaction is 4:5.

181
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,210
   

182
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:29,680
So if I'm given 2 moles
of ammonia,

183
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,150
this is equal to what?

184
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,040
If I'm given 2 moles of ammonia,
how many moles of

185
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,970
oxygen do I need?

186
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,550
I need 2.5 moles of oxygen.

187
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,240
Whatever this is,
is that right?

188
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,750
Yeah, 4/5.

189
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,810
1.25.

190
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,240
If you doubled both of these
numbers, you get 4/5.

191
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,530
So I need 2.5 moles.

192
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,490
But I don't have 2.5
moles of oxygen.

193
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,460
I only have 1 mole of oxygen.

194
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,580
So oxygen is going to
be the limiting

195
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,860
reagent in this reaction.

196
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,410
I don't have enough oxygen.

197
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,060
I have plenty of ammonia, but I
don't have enough oxygen to

198
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,680
react with it.

199
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,930
So this is the limiting
reagent.

200
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,670
   

201
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,080
And I said before, the word
reagent and reactant are used

202
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,435
interchangeably.

203
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:14,620
But when people talk about the
limiting ones, they tend to

204
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,190
call it the reagent.

205
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,800
So oxygen is the limiting
reagent.

206
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,190
So we have extra ammonia.

207
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,280
So given that we have 1 mole of
oxygen, how many moles of

208
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,260
ammonia can I react with that?

209
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,830
   

210
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:33,260
So this reaction is going to
look something like this.

211
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,170
I only have 1 mole of oxygen.

212
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,150
So instead of 5O2, I
have to write 1O2.

213
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,905
Let me make sure that's
not of 10.

214
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:46,560
Let me do it in a
different color.

215
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,120
I only have 1O2 instead
of 5O2.

216
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,040
So how many ammonia are going
to react with that?

217
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,760
Well the ratio is 4:5.

218
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,890
So I'm going to have
0.8 ammonia.

219
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,050
4 is to 5 as 0.8 is to 1.

220
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,240
And so essentially, if I take
this whole equation up here

221
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,740
and divide it by 5,
I'll get what's

222
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,230
actually going to happen.

223
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,640
So this divided by
5 is 0.8, nitric

224
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,430
oxide or nitrogen monoxide.

225
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,080
Plus 6/5 moles of H2O.

226
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,960
And so the original question in
the beginning is, how many

227
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,870
grams of nitric oxide
are we going to

228
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,400
produce, or nitrogen monoxide?

229
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:36,890
So we have 1 mole of oxygen,
0.8 moles of ammonia, and

230
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:45,500
we're going to produce 0.8 moles
of nitrogen monoxide.

231
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,000
Because we only have
one oxygen.

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,010
So 0.8 moles of nitric oxide
or nitrogen monoxide.

233
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,055
So what's the atomic
mass, the molecular

234
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,250
mass, of nitrogen monoxide?

235
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,040
Nitrogen has 14 atomic
mass units.

236
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,880
Oxygen is 16.

237
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,690
We've done that before.

238
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,260
But you can confirm, your oxygen
is 16, nitrogen is 14.

239
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:26,460
So one molecule of nitrogen
monoxide is equal to 30 atomic

240
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,150
mass units.

241
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:37,360
1 mole or 6.02 times 10 to the
23 molecules of nitrogen

242
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,285
monoxide, therefore, will be 30
grams. And how many moles

243
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:44,070
are we producing in
this reaction?

244
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,100
Because oxygen was the limiting
reagent, we only had

245
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,250
1 mole of oxygen here.

246
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,270
Because of that, we can
only produce 0.8

247
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,710
moles of nitrogen monoxide.

248
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,190
So 0.8 moles of nitrogen
monoxide, 1 mole is 30 grams.

249
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:07,050
So 0.8 moles of NO is going to
be equal to 0.8 times 30,

250
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:16,140
which is equal to 24 grams. So
we're going to be able to

251
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,240
produce 24 grams of
nitrogen monoxide.

252
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,720
And so you might ask a question,
we're only using 0.8

253
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,950
moles of ammonia.

254
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:33,210
We were given, in the original
problem, 2 moles of ammonia,

255
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,790
so what happens with all
the leftover ammonia?

256
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,740
Assuming we mix it really good,
we're going to literally

257
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,250
end up with 1.2 moles of
ammonia just doing

258
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,370
nothing at the end.

259
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,570
So we're going to have 24
grams of nitric oxide.

260
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:55,370
And then we used 0.8
moles of ammonia.

261
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:02,430
And we're going to have left
1.2 moles of ammonia.

262
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,780
And if you want, you can figure
out how many of the

263
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,670
original grams of
ammonia that is.

264
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,760
You just figure out how many
grams 1 mole of ammonia is,

265
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,680
it's 17 grams. And then just
multiply that times 1.2.

266
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,260
Anyway, I hope you found
that interesting.

267
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,750
If you found this a little bit
confusing, just watch the

268
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,960
video again and pause it and
try to solve it yourself.

269
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,810
But I think it should start
making a little bit of

270
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,810
intuitive sense.

271
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,125
I think the hard part is just
the conversions between moles

272
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,020
and grams and getting
that part right.

273
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,510
And then making sure that you
understand the ratios.

274
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,550
You understand this is a 4:5
ratio, there's always going to

275
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,070
be less ammonia than oxygen.

276
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,030
And if I only have 1 mole of
oxygen, I'm going to have to

277
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,320
have less than 1 mole
of ammonia, even

278
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,760
though I was given 2.

279
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,120
So oxygen, in this example, was
the rate limiting factor.

280
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,520
Let's say I had 10 moles of
oxygen and 2 moles of ammonia.

281
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,350
In that case, ammonia
would have been the

282
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,230
rate limiting factor.

283
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,110
Because then I would have had
more than enough oxygen.

284
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,810
Because for 2 moles of
ammonia, I only need

285
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,690
2.5 moles of oxygen.

286
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,510
So 10 moles would have
been overkill.

287
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,800
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

288
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,050
