1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,883
So recently, I went into my doctor's office,

2
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:05,598
and I was told that my blood pressure

3
00:00:05,598 --> 00:00:08,563
was 115 over 75.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,627
So I thought we would talk about exactly what this means

5
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:12,998
and trying to figure out

6
00:00:12,998 --> 00:00:15,068
how to think about blood pressure in general,

7
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:17,824
using these numbers and this experience

8
00:00:17,824 --> 00:00:20,066
as kind of a launching point.

9
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,667
So, the way I think about blood pressure is,

10
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:25,880
I always imagine a kind of tube,

11
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:28,140
and I imagine blood going through that tube.

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,399
And this tube is like a blood vessel.

13
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,681
So, there is blood trying to get its way

14
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:34,432
from one side to the other.

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,564
And on its way, the kind of neat thing that it's doing

16
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:42,702
is, as it flows, it's pushing out.

17
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:47,072
So it's forcing against these walls.

18
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:50,444
And, specifically what I mean by that,

19
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:53,100
there's cells and there's plasma,

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,030
and all that stuff is pushing out against the walls

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,281
of the blood vessel.

22
00:00:57,281 --> 00:00:59,909
So you've got a force,

23
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:03,303
and that force is being exerted

24
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:06,728
on the surface area of the blood vessel.

25
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:09,252
So it's force over a surface area,

26
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:12,511
and anytime you see a force over an area,

27
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:14,613
you know that equals a pressure.

28
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:16,142
And in this case it's a blood pressure,

29
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,795
because it's the blood that's doing that work.

30
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:21,997
So, this is how I think of blood pressure,

31
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:24,401
specifically those little blue arrows.

32
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:27,041
And the two questions that pop into my mind

33
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,521
any time I'm thinking about blood pressure,

34
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:35,412
are where is the blood pressure being taken,

35
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:37,216
and when are you taking it?

36
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:40,110
So, let's start with the first question: where?

37
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,071
And by that I mean, where in the circulatory system?

38
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,993
So you've got the heart.

39
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:47,985
And it's my Valentine's Day heart.

40
00:01:47,985 --> 00:01:51,085
And you got the aorta coming of off the heart,

41
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:52,991
and it's got lots of branches,

42
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:55,486
but I'm going to just draw one branch,

43
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:58,659
which is the artery leading off to my arms.

44
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:01,478
This is called the brachial artery.

45
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:03,275
Going off to my arm.

46
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:05,931
And usually, let's say 90% of the time,

47
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:07,555
maybe even more,

48
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:09,183
the blood pressure that you're getting recorded,

49
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:10,926
or the number that is being told to you,

50
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:13,915
is being checked at this point.

51
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:15,582
I marked it with a little x

52
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:17,602
because that's kind of the upper arm.

53
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:19,759
So that's usually where they're checking the blood pressure.

54
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,003
And again, they're checking the force

55
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:24,922
that the blood is putting on the vessel walls.

56
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:27,239
These little blue arrows.

57
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,326
So that answers the 'where' question.

58
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:30,732
And certainly you can imagine,

59
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:33,349
if I'd check blood pressure at some other spot,

60
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:36,999
let's say over here, or over here,

61
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:40,051
you know, you might get a different blood pressure reading

62
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:41,876
than if I check it at the yellow x.

63
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:45,492
So really, we're just talking about that one spot.

64
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:48,000
Now the other question is, when are you checking it?

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,543
So for this, let me show you a little table,

66
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:53,053
or a figure of it.

67
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:55,827
So imagine that over time,

68
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,686
time is this way,

69
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,770
you have different recordings for blood pressure.

70
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,295
So this will be blood pressure.

71
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:05,165
And blood pressure is usually measured

72
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:07,196
in millimeters of mercury.

73
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:09,962
So I'll write mm of mercury here.

74
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:12,400
And let's go from 200

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,837
all the way down to 0.

76
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,511
And I'll use my numbers,

77
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:19,825
that I got from the doctor the other day,

78
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,546
to illustrate what I'm trying to say.

79
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:25,286
So, right at that x, that yellow x,

80
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:29,146
at the bottom, let's say, of my reading, I got 75.

81
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:32,536
So let's start at 75, which is about here.

82
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,554
As the heart is pumping,

83
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:37,348
the pressure starts building up.

84
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:40,837
And it gets up to about 115.

85
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:42,836
So really, what is happening is,

86
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:45,242
blood is making its way from the heart,

87
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:48,368
as it squeezes, towards that x.

88
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:51,013
And as it gets there, the force

89
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,699
that it's putting on the walls is going up, up, up.

90
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,237
And it goes from 75 all the way to 115.

91
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:01,856
So that all happens during the squeezing part

92
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:03,345
of the heart cycle.

93
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:04,957
We call that systole.

94
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:07,277
So this is all happening during systole,

95
00:04:07,277 --> 00:04:09,061
which is when the heart is squeezing down.

96
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:11,288
And we know the heart is a pump.

97
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,922
Now from that point forward,

98
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,856
the heart begins to relax.

99
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,644
So at this point, at 115, the heart is now relaxing slowly.

100
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:23,903
And as it relaxes, the pressure begins to fall.

101
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:27,765
And it continues to fall all the way up here.

102
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:31,368
And the pressure gets down to about 75 again.

103
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,989
And this is diastole.

104
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,099
So this is when the heart is actually

105
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:38,670
taking a break from squeezing, and is now refilling.

106
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,618
And we call that diastole.

107
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:42,795
So I'll call that refilling.

108
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:51,126
And so during systole, you spend about 1/3 of the time.

109
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,530
And in diastole you spend about 2/3 of the time.

110
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,006
And I'm talking about 1 heartbeat here.

111
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,630
So this would be 1 heartbeat.

112
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,782
So it's not 50-50.

113
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:04,715
And the easy way to remember this is

114
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:08,290
in a given day, I spend about 8 hours working,

115
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,287
and about 16 hours relaxing, or not working.

116
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:14,180
So I think of the heart doing its squeezing, its work,

117
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,987
for 8 out of 24, or about a third.

118
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:20,792
About the same as me. About a third of the time,

119
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:23,342
the heart is squeezing.

120
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:26,103
So that's how the heart is spending its time

121
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:28,058
in systole and diastole.

122
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:31,071
And the pressure is ranging between 115 and 75.

123
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:34,590
So really, it never just 115 of just 75.

124
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,640
It's somewhere between the two.

125
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,113
For example, if I check right here in time,

126
00:05:39,113 --> 00:05:44,879
it might be 85, or here it might be 102, or here it might be 87.

127
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,884
So it's somewhere between 115 and 75.

128
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:53,294
So this number then, this number I wrote up here,

129
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:54,435
becomes a range.

130
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:58,795
This is the range of blood pressure.

131
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:00,635
So when I talk about 'when', it really depends on

132
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:02,549
where in the cycle you're at.

133
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:04,552
And you're somewhere in that range.

134
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:06,363
And when I talk about the 'where', you know we're talking

135
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:08,925
about a reading that's taken in the upper arm.

136
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:11,584
So those are the two thoughts that should cross your mind

137
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,590
every time you hear a blood pressure recording.

138
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,178
And of course, the top number, 115,

139
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:18,081
is the systolic blood pressure.

140
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:21,156
And 75 is the diastolic blood pressure.
