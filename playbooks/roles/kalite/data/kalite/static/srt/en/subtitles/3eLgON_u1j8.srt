00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:09,500
Now what are the signs of sine of negative 210 degrees and cosecante of -210 degrees and I encourage you to pause this and try this on your own.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:22,867
So let's draw ourselves a unit circle because we're going to have to use the unit circle defnition of trig functions to come up with what the sine and cosecante of -210 degree are .

3
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:24,823
So let's draw a unit circle

4
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:37,886
There's my unit circle, a circle of radius one, so for example this right here is point (1,0)

5
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:40,525
and you've seen this many many times

6
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:48,032
Now let's draw our angle, this angle of negative 210 degrees,

7
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:54,043
well as always the convention is draw the initial side of the angle along the postive x-axis

8
00:00:54,043 --> 00:01:01,525
so just like that and now to think about which direction we rotate in to place our terminal side we look at the sign,

9
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:06,602
if this was a positive sign we'd go counter clock-wise , so this is a negative sign ,

10
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:09,367
the convention is we're going to go clock-wise

11
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:14,940
and we have to ask ourselves how far are we are going to rotate clockwise

12
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,300
so we rotate this far,

13
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,631
that would be negative 90 degrees, and if we do that much again , that's negative 180 degrees.

14
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:26,906
so to get to negative 210, we'll have to another negative 30 degrees,

15
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:30,705
so we have to go about that far into, what is this ,

16
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:39,993
this is the second quadrant, and so we end up with our angle looking something like this

17
00:01:39,993 --> 00:01:46,142
now how do we figure out the value of sine of an angle using the unit-cricle definition

18
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:48,973
well the unit circle definition of trig funtctions tells us that

19
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:53,164
where the terminal side of our angle intersects the unit circle,

20
00:01:53,164 --> 00:01:57,680
the coordonate of this point gives us both the cosine of that angle and

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,731
the sine of that angle

22
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:05,466
So the coordonates of this point is cosine -210, that's the x-coordinate and

23
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:09,506
sine of negative -210 degrees

24
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:16,228
the sine of this angle is just the y-coordinate of where the terminal side intersects the unit-circle

25
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:19,416
well is that going to be a positive or a negative y-coordinate

26
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:24,550
well you see that point is above the x-axis, this is a positive value of y.

27
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:36,472
So that tells us that that the sine of negative 210 degrees is going to be positive

28
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:43,160
Now given that, can we think about what the sign of the cosecante of negative 210 degrees is going to be?

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,811
well by defnition , by definition ,

30
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:58,313
cosecante of negative 210 degrees, is just the reciprocal of sine of negative 210 degrees,

31
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:02,039
and if I take the reciprocal of a positive number,

32
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,436
If I take one and I divide that by a positive number what am I going to get?

33
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,872
Well I'm going to get another positive number.

34
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:14,872
So the signs of both sine of negative 210 degrees and cosecant of negative 210 degrees are both positive.
