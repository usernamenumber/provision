00:00:00,565 --> 00:00:03,573
We're asked to find the conjugate of the complex number

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:05,457
seven minus five i.

3
00:00:05,457 --> 00:00:07,341
And what you're going to find in this video is

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,891
finding the conjugate of a complex number is

5
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:11,119
shockingly easy.

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,680
It's really the same as this number, I should say

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,161
- be a little bit more particular-

8
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:18,027
It has the same real parts, so the conjugate of this

9
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:19,843
is going to have the exact same real part,

10
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:22,382
but its imaginary part is going to have the opposite sign.

11
00:00:22,382 --> 00:00:25,188
So, instead of having a negative five i, it will have

12
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:28,279
a positive - a positive- 5 i.

13
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,677
So that right there is the complex conjugate of

14
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:33,202
seven minus five i.

15
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:36,128
And some times the notation for doing it that is

16
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:37,871
-you'll take seven minus five i-

17
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:43,182
If you have seven minus five i,

18
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:45,307
and you put a line over it like that,

19
00:00:45,307 --> 00:00:47,523
that means you want the conjugate

20
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:49,001
of seven minus five i.

21
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:51,003
And that will equal seven plus five i.

22
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:53,081
Or sometimes someone will write,

23
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:57,207
-you'll see z is the variable people often use for complex numbers-

24
00:00:57,207 --> 00:01:02,886
if z is seven minus five i,

25
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:05,268
then they'll say complex conjugate of z,

26
00:01:05,268 --> 00:01:07,066
-you put that line over the z-

27
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,618
is going to be seven plus five i.

28
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:13,214
Now you're probably saying ok, fairly straightforward

29
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:15,476
to find a conjugate of a complex number,

30
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:17,784
but what is it good for?

31
00:01:17,784 --> 00:01:20,557
And the simplest reason, or the most basic place

32
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:24,161
where this is useful is when you multiply any imaginary,

33
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:29,011
any complex number times its conjugate, you're going to get a real number.

34
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:30,144
And I want to emphasize,

35
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:33,631
this right here is the conjugate seven plus five,

36
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:35,882
is the conjugate of seven minus five i.

37
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:38,763
But seven minus five i is also the conjugate

38
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:41,005
of seven plus five i, for obvious reasons.

39
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:42,817
If you started with this, and changed the sign

40
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:46,119
of the imaginary part, you would get seven minus five i.

41
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:47,759
They're conjugates of each other.

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,973
But let me show you when I multiply complex conjugates,

43
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:52,430
that I get a real number.

44
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,025
So lets multiply seven minus five i times seven plus five i.

45
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,392
And I will do that in blue.

46
00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:03,609
Seven minus five i times seven plus five i.

47
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:06,484
And remember, whenever you multiply these expressions,

48
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:08,893
you really just have to multiply every term times each other.

49
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:10,267
You could do the distributive property twice.

50
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:13,137
You could do something like foil, to remind yourself

51
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:16,715
every part of this complex number times

52
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:18,524
every part of this complex number.

53
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:20,248
So let's just do it any which way.

54
00:02:20,248 --> 00:02:23,751
So you have seven times seven, which is forty-nine.

55
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:31,044
Seven times five i, which is thirty-five i.

56
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:33,628
Then you have negative five i times seven,

57
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:35,420
which is negative thirty-five i.

58
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,518
You can see the imaginary part is canceling out.

59
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:40,950
Then you have negative five i time positive five i.

60
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,076
Well that's negative twenty-five i-squared.

61
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:46,622
And negative twenty-five i-squared,

62
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:48,172
-remember i-squared is negative one-

63
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:50,768
So negative twenty five i-squared,

64
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:51,570
-let me write this down-

65
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:58,464
negative five i, times five i, is negative twenty-five times i-squared.

66
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:01,707
i-squared is negative one, so negative twenty-five times negative one

67
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:03,710
is positive twenty-five.

68
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,375
And these two guys over here cancel out,

69
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,789
and we're just left with forty-nine plus twenty-five.

70
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,433
Let's see, fifty plus twenty-five is seventy-five.

71
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:12,916
So, this is just seventy-four.

72
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,999
So, we are just left with the real number seventy-four.

73
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,327
Another way to do it,

74
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,263
-you don't even have to do all this distributive property-

75
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:20,983
You might just recognize this looks like.

76
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:24,349
This is something plus something times

77
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:25,856
-or something minus something-

78
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:27,594
times that same thing plus something.

79
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:30,060
And we know this pattern from our early algebra.

80
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,148
That a plus b -a plus b- times a minus b

81
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:38,047
is equal to a-squared minus b-squared.

82
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:39,761
Is equal to a diference of squares.

83
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,931
And so in this case a is seven, a-squared is forty-nine.

84
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:47,407
And b, b in this case is five i.

85
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:51,770
b-squared is five i-squared, which twenty-five i-squared,

86
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,988
which is negative twenty-five, and we're subtracting that.

87
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:57,215
So it's going to be positive plus-twenty-five.

88
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:59,553
You add 'em together, you get seventy-four.
