1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
   

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,310
Let's say we have a
path in the xy plane.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,780
That's my y-axis, that is
my x-axis, in my path

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,760
will look like this.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,280
Let's say it looks like that;
trying to draw a bit of an

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,480
arbitrary path, and let's say
we go in a counter clockwise

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,450
direction like that
along our path.

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,180
And we could call this path--
so we're going in a counter

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,180
clockwise direction --we
could call that path c.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,730
And let's say we also
have a vector field.

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,335
And our vector field is going
to be a little unusual;

12
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,190
I'll call it p.

13
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,270
p of xy.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,870
It only has an i component, or
all of its vectors are only

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,240
multiples of the i-unit vector.

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,410
So it's capital P of xy
times the unit vector i.

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,920
There is no j component, so if
you have to visualize this

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,880
vector field, all of the
vectors, they're all multiples

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,980
of the i-unit vector.

20
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,040
Or they could be negative
multiples, so they could

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,960
also go in that direction.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,780
But they don't go diagonal
or they don't go up.

23
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,630
They all go left to
right or right to left.

24
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,660
That's what this vector
field would look like.

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,870
Now what I'm interested in
doing is figuring out the line

26
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,170
integral over a closed loop--
the closed loop c, or the

27
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:27,710
closed path c --of p dot dr,
which is just our standard

28
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,775
kind of way of solving
for a line integral.

29
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:32,140
And we've seen what
dr is in the past.

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:40,760
dr is equal to dx times i plus
dy times the j-unit vector.

31
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,250
And you might say, isn't
it dx, dt times dt?

32
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:51,530
Let me write that: can't dr
be written as dx, dt times

33
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,780
dti plus dy, dt times dtj?

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,280
And it could, but if you
imagine these differentials

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,820
could cancel out, and you're
just left with the dx and

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,490
a dy, and we've seen
that multiple times.

37
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,360
And I'm going to leave it in
this form because hopefully, if

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,390
we're careful, we won't have to
deal with the third

39
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,540
parameter, t.

40
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,240
So let's just look at it in
this form right here with

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,120
just the dx's and the dy's.

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,580
So this integral can be
rewritten as the line integral,

43
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,040
the curve c-- actually let
me do it over down here.

44
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,600
The line integral over the path
of the curve c of p dot dr. So

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,750
we take the product of each of
the coefficients, let's say the

46
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,610
coefficient of the i component,
so we get p-- I'll do that in

47
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:47,450
green, actually do that purple
color --so we get p of xy times

48
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:54,770
dx plus-- well there's no 0
times j times dy; 0 times dy id

49
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,290
just going to be 0 --so this
our line integral simplified

50
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,330
to this right here.

51
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,890
This is equal to this original
integral up here, so we're

52
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,110
literally just taking the line
integral around this path.

53
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,890
Now I said that we play our
cards right, we're not going to

54
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,090
have to deal with the third
variable, t; that we might be

55
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,230
able just solve this integral
only in terms of x.

56
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,700
And so let's see if
we can do that.

57
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,640
So let's look at our minimum
and maximum x points.

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,410
That looks like our
minimum x point.

59
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,250
Let's call that a.

60
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,940
Let's call that our maximum
x point; let's call that b.

61
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,260
What we could do is we can
break up this curve into

62
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,500
two functions of x.
y is functions of x.

63
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,750
So this bottom one right here
we could call as y1 of x.

64
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,570
This is just a standard curve;
you know when we were just

65
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,940
dealing with standard calculus,
this is just you can

66
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,570
imagine this is f of x and
it's a function of x.

67
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,900
And this is y2 of x.

68
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,160
   

69
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,090
Just like that.

70
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,470
So you can imagine two paths;
one path defined by y1 of x--

71
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,800
let me do that in a different
color; magenta --one path

72
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,340
defined by y1 of x as we go
from x is equal to a to x is

73
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,110
equal to b, and then another
path defined by y2 of x as we

74
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,230
go from x is equal to
b to x is equal to a.

75
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,330
That is our curve.

76
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,550
So what we could do is, we
could rewrite this integral--

77
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,820
which is the same thing as that
integral --as this is equal to

78
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,790
the integral-- we'll first do
this first path --of x going

79
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:40,130
from a to b of p of x.

80
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,670
And I could to say p of x and
y, but we know along this

81
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,440
path y is a function of x.

82
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,290
So we say x and y1 of x.

83
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,220
Wherever we see a y we
substitute it with

84
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,910
a y1 of x, dx.

85
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,030
So that covers that first path;
I'll do it in the same color.

86
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,430
We could imagine this is c1.

87
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,180
This is kind of the first half
of our curve-- well it's not

88
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,820
exactly the half --but that
takes us right from that

89
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,990
point to that point.

90
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,430
And then we want to
complete the circle.

91
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,960
Maybe I'll do that, and
I'll do that in yellow.

92
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,390
That's going to be equal to--
sorry we're going to have to

93
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:25,920
add these two --plus the
integral from x is equal to b

94
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:37,290
to x is equal to a of-- do it
in that same color --of p of x.

95
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,230
And now y is going
to be y2 of x.

96
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,180
Wherever you see a y, you
can substitute with y2

97
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,890
of x along this curve.

98
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,350
y2 of x, dx.

99
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,650
This is already getting
interesting and you

100
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,090
might already see where
I'm going with this.

101
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,130
So this is the curve c2.

102
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,030
too I think you appreciate if
you take the union of c1 and

103
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,440
c2, we've got our whole curve.

104
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,690
So let's see if we can simplify
this integral a little bit.

105
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,710
Well one thing we want to
do, we might want to make

106
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,130
their end points the same.

107
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,150
So if you swap a and b
here, it just turns

108
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,180
the integral negative.

109
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,810
So you make this into a b, that
into an a, and then make that

110
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,290
plus sign into a minus sign.

111
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,000
And now we can rewrite this
whole thing as being equal to

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,810
the integral from a to b of
this thing, of p of x and y1 of

113
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:44,290
x minus this thing, minus p of
x and y2 of x, and then

114
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,840
all of that times dx.

115
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,310
I'll write it in a third color.

116
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,480
   

117
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,740
Now, I'm going to do something
a little bit arbitrary, but I

118
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,190
think you'll appreciate why I
did this by the end of this

119
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,000
video, and it's just a
very simple operation.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,580
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to swap these two.

121
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,490
So I'm essentially going to
multiply this whole thing by

122
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,020
negative 1, or essentially
multiply and divide

123
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,910
by negative 1.

124
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,310
So I can multiply this by
negative 1 and then multiply

125
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,705
the outside by negative 1, and
I will not have changed the

126
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:13,290
integral; I'm multiplying
by negative 1 twice.

127
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,810
So if I swap these two things,
if I multiply the inside times

128
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,250
negative 1, so this is going to
be equal to-- do the outside

129
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,770
of the integral, a to b.

130
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,460
If I multiply the inside--
I'll do a dx out here --if I

131
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,790
multiply the inside of the
integral by negative 1,

132
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,510
these two guys switch.

133
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:36,230
So it becomes p
of x of y2 of x.

134
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:46,310
And then you're going to have
minus p of x and y1 of x.

135
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,920
My handwriting's getting
a little messy.

136
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,420
But I can't just multiply
just the inside by minus 1.

137
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,250
I don't want to change the
integral, so I multiplied the

138
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,480
inside by minus 1, let me
multiply the outside

139
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,140
by minus 1.

140
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,160
And since I multiplied by
minus 1 twice, these two

141
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,120
things are equivalent.

142
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,840
Or you could say this is
the negative of that.

143
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,400
Either way, I think you
appreciate that I haven't

144
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,430
changed the integral
at all, numerically.

145
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,790
I multiplied the inside and
the outside by minus 1.

146
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,130
And now the next step I'm going
to do, it might look a little

147
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,780
bit foreign to you, but I
think you'll appreciate it.

148
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,660
   

149
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,460
It might be obvious to you
if you've recently done

150
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,320
some double integrals.

151
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,270
So this thing can be rewritten
as minus the integral from a to

152
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:38,660
b of-- and let me do a new
color --of the function p of x,

153
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:49,460
y evaluated at y2 of x minus--
and let me make it very clear;

154
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,970
this is y is equal to y2 of x
--minus this function evaluated

155
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,520
at y is equal to y1 of x.

156
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,820
And of course all
of that times dx.

157
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,380
This statement and what we
saw right here-- this

158
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:14,090
statement right here --are
completely identical.

159
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:20,000
And then if we assume that a
partial derivative of capital P

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,590
with respect to y exists,
hopefully you'll realize-- and

161
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,870
I'll focus on this a little
bit because I don't want to

162
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,700
confuse you on this step.

163
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,880
Let me write the outside
of this integral.

164
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,180
So this is going to be equal
to-- and this is kind of a neat

165
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,150
outcome, and we're starting
to build up to a very neat

166
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,490
outcome, which will probably
have to take the next video to

167
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,210
do --so we do the outside dx.

168
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,860
   

169
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,830
If we assume that capital P has
a partial derivative, this

170
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,410
right here is the
exact same thing.

171
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,550
This right here is the exact
same thing as the partial

172
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:01,860
derivative of P with respect to
y, dy, the antiderivative of

173
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:10,010
that from y1 of x to y2 of x.

174
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,040
I want to make you feel
comfortable that these two

175
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,740
things are equivalent.

176
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,800
And to realize they're
equivalent, you'll probably

177
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,310
just have to start here
and then go to that.

178
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,540
We're used to seeing this;
we're used to seeing a double

179
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,100
integral like this, and then
the very first step we say, OK

180
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,500
to solve this double integral
we start on the inside integral

181
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,210
right there, and we say, OK
let's take the antiderivative

182
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,870
of this with respect to y.

183
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,420
So if you take the
antiderivative of the partial

184
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,830
of p with respect to y, you're
going to end up with p.

185
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,330
And since this is a definite
integral, the boundaries are

186
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,420
going to be in terms of x,
you're going to evaluate that

187
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,020
from y is equal to y2 of x, and
you're going to subtract from

188
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,210
that y is equal to y1 of x.

189
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,200
Normally we start with
something like this, and we

190
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,610
go to something like this.

191
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,620
This is kind of unusual that we
started, we kind of solved, we

192
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,030
started with the solution of
the definite integral, and then

193
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,150
we slowly built back to
the definite integral.

194
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,400
So hopefully you realize that
this is true, that this is

195
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,110
just we're kind of going
in a reverse direction

196
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,020
than we normally do.

197
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,750
And if you do realize that,
then we've just established

198
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,850
a pretty neat outcome.

199
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,880
Because what is
this right here?

200
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,570
Let me go back, let me see
if I can fit everything.

201
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,745
I have some function-- and I'm
assuming that the partial of

202
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:29,790
P with respect to y exists
--but I have some function

203
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,510
defined over the xy plane.

204
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,490
You know, you could
imagine we're dealing in

205
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,390
three dimensions now.

206
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,980
We'll draw a little bit neater.

207
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:46,110
So that's y, that's x, that's
z, so this, you could imagine,

208
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,560
is some surface; it just
happens to be the partial

209
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,350
of P with respect to x.

210
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,790
So it's some surface on
the xy plane like that.

211
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,170
And what are we doing?

212
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,310
We're taking the double
integral under that surface,

213
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,250
around this region.

214
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,580
The region's boundaries in
terms of y are defined

215
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,180
by y2 and y1 of x.

216
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,970
   

217
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,160
So you literally
have that curve.

218
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,500
That's y2 on top,
y1 on the bottom.

219
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,590
And so we're essentially
taking the volume above.

220
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,780
   

221
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,190
So if you imagine with the base
is-- the whole floor of this is

222
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:32,060
going to be the area inside of
this curve, and then the height

223
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,070
is going to be the function
partial of P with respect to y.

224
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,490
   

225
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,700
It's going to be a little hard
for me to draw, but this is

226
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,670
essentially some type of a
volume, if you want to

227
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,610
visualize it that way.

228
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:52,780
But the really neat outcome
here is if you call this region

229
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,600
r, we've just simplified
this line integral.

230
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,580
And this was a special one.

231
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,270
It only had an x-component, the
vector field, but we've just

232
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,310
simplified this line integral
to being equivalent to-- maybe

233
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,080
I should write this line
integral because that's what's

234
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,830
the really neat outcome.

235
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,130
We've just established that
this thing right here, which

236
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,970
is the same as our original
one, so let me write that.

237
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,570
The closed line integral around
the curve c of p of xy, dx,

238
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,300
we've just established that
that's the same thing as the

239
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,980
double integral over the region
r-- this is the region

240
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:40,333
r --of the partial of
P with respect to y.

241
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:47,990
   

242
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,120
And we could write dy, dx, or
we could write da, whatever you

243
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,810
want to write, but this is
the double integral

244
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,310
over that region.

245
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,560
The neat thing here is using a
vector field that only had an

246
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,850
x-component, we were able to
connect its line integral to

247
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,730
the double integral over
region-- oh, and I forgot

248
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,000
something very important.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,420
We had a negative
sign out here.

250
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,700
So this was a minus
sign out here.

251
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,390
Or we could even put the minus
in here, but I think you

252
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,940
get the general idea.

253
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,450
In the next video, I'm going to
do the same exact thing with

254
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,710
the vector field that only has
vectors in the y-direction.

255
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,240
And then we'll connect
the two and we'll end up

256
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,560
with Green's theorem.

257
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,066
