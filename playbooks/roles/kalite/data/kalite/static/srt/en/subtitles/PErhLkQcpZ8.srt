1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,620
Let's say I have an n-by-n
matrix that looks like this.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,870
So let me just see if I can
do it in general terms.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,010
In the first row and first
column, that entry has a 1,

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,630
and then everything else, the
rest of the n minus 1 rows in

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,465
that first column are all
going to be zeroes.

7
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:20,990
So it's going to be zeroes all
the way down to the nth term.

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,630
And then the second column,
we have a 0 in the first

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,060
component, but then a 1 in
the second component.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,440
And then it goes zeroes
all the way down.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,460
And you keep doing this.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,635
In the third row, or let me say
third column, although it

13
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:39,060
would've applied to the third
row as well, the 1 shows up in

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,950
the third component, and then
it's zeroes all the way down.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,100
Essentially, you have the ones
filling up the diagonal of

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,210
this matrix right here.

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,860
So if you go all the way to
the nth column or the nth

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,680
column vector, you have a bunch
of zeroes until you

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,330
get-- you have n minus 1 zeroes,
and then the very last

20
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,300
component, the nth component
there will be a 1.

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,640
So you have essentially,
a matrix with

22
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,580
ones down the diagonal.

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,610
Now, this matrix has a bunch of
neat properties and we'll

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,070
explore it more in the future.

25
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,180
But I'm just exposing you to
this because it has one very

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,410
neat property relative to
linear transformations.

27
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,950
But I'm going to call this the
identity matrix and I'll call

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,550
this I sub n, and I called that
sub n because it's an

29
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,690
n-by-n identity matrix.

30
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,690
I sub 2 would be equal to a
2-by-2 identity matrix, so it

31
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,700
would look like that.

32
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:36,340
And I sub 3 would look like
this: 1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1.

33
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,690
I think you get the point.

34
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,390
Now, the neat thing about this
identity matrix becomes

35
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,650
evident when you multiply
it times any vector.

36
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,660
We can multiply this guy times
the n-component vector, a

37
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,910
member of Rn.

38
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,430
So let's do that.

39
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,720
So if we multiply this
matrix times-- let's

40
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,840
call this vector x.

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,460
This is x1, x2, all the way down
to xn, what is this going

42
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,290
to be equal to?

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,130
So this is vector
x right here.

44
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:12,430
So if I multiply matrix I, my
identity matrix, I sub n, and

45
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,410
I multiply it times my vector x,
where x is a member of Rn,

46
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,840
has n components, what
am I going to get?

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,035
Well, I'm going to get 1 times
x1 plus 0 times x2 plus 0

48
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:26,940
times x3 plus 0 times
x4, all of that.

49
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,730
So essentially, I'm going to
have-- you can kind of view it

50
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,340
as this row dotted
with the vector.

51
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,980
So the only nonzero term
is going to be

52
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,200
the 1 times the x1.

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,330
So it's going to be x1-- sorry,
let me do it like this.

54
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:45,190
So you're going to get another
vector in Rn like that.

55
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,350
And so the first term is that
row essentially being dotted

56
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,440
with that column, and
so you just get x1.

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,130
And then the next entry is going
to be this row, or you

58
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,620
could view it as the transpose
of this row dotted with that

59
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,090
column, so 0 times x1 plus
1 times x2 plus 0 times

60
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:04,710
everything else.

61
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,380
So the only nonzero term
is the 1 times x2, so

62
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,680
you get an x2 there.

63
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,660
And then you keep doing thatt,
and what are you going to get?

64
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,470
You're going to get an x3
because the only nonzero term

65
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,070
here is the third one and you're
going to go all the way

66
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,370
down until you get an xn.

67
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,520
But what is this
thing equal to?

68
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,690
This is just equal to x.

69
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,050
So the neat thing about this
identity matrix that we've

70
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,780
created is that when you
multiply it times any vector,

71
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,850
you got the vector again.

72
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,910
The identity matrix times any
vector in Rn-- it's only

73
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:37,130
defined for vectors in Rn-- is
equal to that vector again.

74
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,810
And actually, the columns of
the identity matrix have a

75
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:49,240
special-- I guess the set of
columns has a special name.

76
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,610
So if we call this first column
e1 and this second

77
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:05,050
column e2 and the third column
e3 and we go all the way to

78
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,670
en, these vectors, these column
vectors here, the set

79
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:15,410
of these-- so let's say e1, e2,
all the way to en-- this

80
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:24,390
is called the standard
basis for Rn.

81
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,410
So why is it called that?

82
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, the word basis is there,
so two things must be true.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,120
These things must span Rn and
they must be linearly

84
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,940
independent.

85
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,060
It's pretty obvious from
inspection they're linearly

86
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,530
independent.

87
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,340
If this guy has a 1 here and
no one else has a 1 there,

88
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,400
there's no way you can construct
that 1 with some

89
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
combination of the
rest of the guys.

90
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,060
And you can make that same
argument for each of the ones

91
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,805
in each of the components.

92
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:47,220
So it's clearly linearly
independent.

93
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,620
And then to see that you can
span, that you can construct

94
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,420
any vector with a linear
combination of these guys, you

95
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,650
just really have to-- you know,
whatever vector you want

96
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,900
to construct, if you want
to construct x1-- let

97
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,460
me put it this way.

98
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,380
If you want to construct
this vector-- let me

99
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:04,980
write it this way.

100
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,480
Let me pick a different one.

101
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,560
Let's say you want to construct
the vector a1, a2,

102
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,880
a3 all the way down to an.

103
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,610
So this is some member
of Rn, you want to

104
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,060
construct this vector.

105
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,060
Well, the linear combination
that would get you this is

106
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:28,370
literally a1 times e1 plus a2
times e2 plus all the way to

107
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,620
an times en.

108
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,240
   

109
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,140
This scalar times this first
column vector will essentially

110
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,200
just get you-- what will
this look like?

111
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,510
This will look like
a1 and then you'd

112
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,850
have a bunch of zeroes.

113
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,060
You'd have n minus 1 zeroes plus
0 and you'd have an a2

114
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,690
and then you'd have
a bunch of zeroes.

115
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,320
And then you'd keep doing that,
and then you would have

116
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,370
a bunch of zeroes, and then
you would have an an.

117
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,370
Obviously, by our definition
of vector addition, you add

118
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,880
all these things up, you get
this guy right here.

119
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,430
And it's kind of obvious,
because this right here is the

120
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,880
same thing as our identity
matrix times a1.

121
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,930
I just wanted to expose
you to that idea.

122
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,670
Now, let's apply what we already
know about linear

123
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,450
transformations to what we've
just learned about this

124
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,090
identity matrix.

125
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,980
I just told you that
I can represent

126
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,210
any vector like this.

127
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,180
Let me rewrite it in
maybe terms of x.

128
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:32,940
I can write any vector x as a
linear combination of the

129
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,210
standard basis, which are really
just the columns of the

130
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,310
identity matrix.

131
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:43,060
I can write that as x1 times e1
plus x2 times e2, all the

132
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,430
way to xn times en.

133
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,430
And remember, each of these
column vectors right here,

134
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,820
like for e1, is just 1 in the
first entry and then all the

135
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,020
rest are zeroes. e2 is a 1
in the second entry and

136
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,410
everything else is 0.

137
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,050
e5 is a 1 in the fifth entry
and everything else is 0.

138
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,270
And this I just showed you, and
this is a bit obvious from

139
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,290
this right here.

140
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,520
Now, we know that by definition,
a linear

141
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:20,680
transformation of x-- let
me put it this way.

142
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,350
A linear transformation of x,
of our vector x, is the same

143
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,440
thing as taking the linear
transformation of this whole

144
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,550
thing-- let me do it in another
color-- is equal to

145
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:38,050
the linear transformation of--
actually, instead of using L,

146
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,740
let me use T.

147
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,290
I used L by accident because
I was thinking linear.

148
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,930
But if I were take the linear
transformation of x, because

149
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,540
that's the notation we're used
to, that's the same thing as

150
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,830
taking a linear transformation
of this thing.

151
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,840
They're equivalent.

152
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,510
So x1 times e1 plus x2 times
e2, all the way to

153
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,800
plus xn times en.

154
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,340
It's equivalent statements.

155
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,750
Now, from the definition of
linear transformations, we

156
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,330
know that this is the same
thing, that the transformation

157
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,230
of the sum is equal to the sum
of the transformation.

158
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:18,800
So this is equal to the
transformation of x1 e1 plus

159
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,850
the transformation of x2 e2
where this is just any linear

160
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,510
transformation.

161
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,670
Let me make that very clear.

162
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,660
This is any linear
transformation.

163
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,860
   

164
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,230
By definition, linear
transformations have to

165
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,850
satisfy these properties.

166
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,289
So the transformation times
x2 e2, all the way to this

167
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,940
transformation times this last
entry, the scalar xn times my

168
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,320
standard basis vector en.

169
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,190
And we know from the other
property of linear

170
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,220
transformations that the
transformation of a vector

171
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,690
multiplied by the scalar is the
same thing as the scalar

172
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:04,390
multiplied by the transformation
of the vector.

173
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,950
That's just from our definition
of linear

174
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,630
transformations.

175
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:12,580
Plus x2 two times the
transformation of e2 plus all

176
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:19,560
the way to xn times the
transformation of en.

177
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,730
Now, what is this?

178
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,860
I could rewrite this, so
everything I've done so far,

179
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,280
so the transformation of x is
equal to that, which just

180
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,170
using our properties of linear
transformations, all linear

181
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,780
transformations, this has
to be true for them.

182
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,410
I get to this and this
is equivalent.

183
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,600
This is equal to-- if we view
each of these as a column

184
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,350
vector, this is equal to what?

185
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,140
This is equal to the matrix
where this is the first

186
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,300
column, T e1.

187
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,960
And then the second
column is T e2.

188
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:03,970
And then we go all the way to
T en times-- let me put it

189
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,640
this way-- x1, x2, all
the way to xn.

190
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,090
We've seen this multiple,
multiple times.

191
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,290
Now what's really, really,
really neat about this is I

192
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,270
just started with an arbitrary
transformation.

193
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,520
And I just showed that
an arbitrary linear

194
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,350
transformation of x can be
rewritten as a product of a

195
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,460
matrix where I'm taking that
same linear transformation of

196
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,320
each of our standard basis
vectors, and I can construct

197
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,480
that matrix, and multiplying
that matrix times my x vector

198
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,770
is the same thing as this
transformation.

199
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:42,000
So this is essentially showing
you that all transformations--

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,940
let me be careful.

201
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:53,500
All linear transformations can
be a matrix vector product.

202
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,540
Not only did I show you that
you can do it, but it's

203
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,430
actually a fairly
straightforward thing to do.

204
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,340
This is actually a pretty
simple operation to do.

205
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,960
Let me show you an example.

206
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,700
I don't know, I think
this is super neat.

207
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,810
Let's say that I just-- I'm
just going to make up some

208
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,610
transformation.

209
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,650
Let's say I have a
transformation and it's a

210
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,720
mapping between-- let's make
it extra interesting--

211
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,580
between R2 and R3.

212
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,090
And let's say my transformation,
let's say that

213
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:30,030
T of x1 x2 is equal to-- let's
say the first entry is x1 plus

214
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:37,620
3x2, the second entry is 5x2
minus x1, and let's say the

215
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,390
third entry is 4x1 plus x2.

216
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,190
This is a mapping.

217
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,150
I could have written
it like this.

218
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:52,620
I could write T of any vector
in R2, x1, x2, is equal to--

219
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,560
and maybe this is just
redundant, but I

220
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,500
think you get the idea.

221
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:02,520
I like this notation better. x1
plus 3x2, 5x2 minus x1, and

222
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,080
then 4x1 plus x2.

223
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,650
This statement and this
statement I just wrote are

224
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:07,830
equivalent.

225
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,060
And I like to visualize this
a little bit more.

226
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,030
Now, I just told you that
I can represent this

227
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,330
transformation as a matrix
vector product.

228
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,360
How do I do it?

229
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,530
Well, what I do is I take the
transformation of this guy.

230
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,260
My domain right here is R2, and
I produce a vector that's

231
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,610
going to be in Rn.

232
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,330
So what I do is, let's see.

233
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,320
So I'm concerned with
multiplying things times

234
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,840
vectors in R2.

235
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,940
So what we're going to do is
we're going to start with the

236
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,350
identity matrix, identity 2
because that's my domain and

237
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,300
it just looks like
this: 1, 0, 0, 1.

238
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,770
I'm just going to
start with that.

239
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,940
And all I do is I apply my
transformation to each of the

240
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,340
columns, each of my
standard bases.

241
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,095
These are the standard
bases for R2.

242
00:12:56,095 --> 00:13:00,150
   

243
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,960
I showed you that they're bases,
how do I know that

244
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,110
they're standard?

245
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,080
Why are they called the
standard bases?

246
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,560
And I haven't covered this in a
lot of detail right yet, but

247
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,210
you could take the dot product
of any of these guys with any

248
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,620
of the other guys, and you'll
see that they're all

249
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,660
orthogonal to each other.

250
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,510
The dot product of any one of
these columns with the other

251
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,000
is always zero, so that's
a nice clue.

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,230
And they all have length of 1,
so that's a nice reason why

253
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,530
they're called the
standard bases.

254
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,240
But anyway, back to our attempt
to represent this

255
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,190
transformation as a matrix
vector product.

256
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,000
So we say look, our domain is in
R2, so let's start with I2,

257
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,450
or we could call it our 2-by-2
identity matrix.

258
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,280
And let's apply the
transformation to each of its

259
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,850
column vectors where each of
its column vectors are a

260
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,750
vector in the standard
basis for R2.

261
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,630
   

262
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,900
So I'm going to write
it like this.

263
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,790
The first column is T of this
column, and then the second

264
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:05,910
column is going to
be T of 0, 1.

265
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,860
And I know I'm getting messier
with my handwriting.

266
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:15,160
What is T of the vector 1, 0?

267
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,670
Well, we just go here.

268
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,690
We construct another vector.

269
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,540
So we get 1 plus
3 times 0 is 1.

270
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,930
Then we get 5 times 0 minus
1, so that's minus 1.

271
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,740
x2 is zero in this case.

272
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,820
And then we get 4 times 1 plus
0, so that's just 4.

273
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,850
So that's T of 1, 0.

274
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:46,500
And then what is T of 0, 1?

275
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:53,410
T of 0, 1 is equal to-- so we
have 0 plus 3 times 1 is 3.

276
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,260
Then we have 0 minus
1 is minus 1.

277
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,930
Let me make sure I did
this one right.

278
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,540
What was this?

279
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,860
This was 5 times 1 minus 1.

280
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,400
   

281
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,750
Yeah, 5 times 0 minus
x1, which is 1.

282
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,280
Now, this case, it's 5 times--
oh, I have to be careful.

283
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,960
This is 5 times x2.

284
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,510
x2 is 1.

285
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,970
So 5 times 1 minus
0, so it's 5.

286
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:28,490
And then I have 4 times
0 plus x2, plus 1.

287
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,820
And I just showed you if I
replace each of these standard

288
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,910
basis vectors with the
transformation of

289
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,550
them, what do I get?

290
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,860
I get this vector right here.

291
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,410
So I already figured
out what they are.

292
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,690
   

293
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,280
If I take this guy and evaluate
it, it's the vector

294
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,250
1, minus 1, 4.

295
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:54,620
And then this guy is the
vector 3, 5, and 1.

296
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,410
So what we just did and this
is-- I don't know.

297
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,790
For some reason, I find this
to be pretty amazing.

298
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,800
We can now rewrite this
transformation here as the

299
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,720
product of any vector.

300
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,770
So if we define this to be equal
to a, or we could write

301
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,290
it this way.

302
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,210
We can now write our
transformation.

303
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:17,950
Our transformation of x1, x2
can now be rewritten as the

304
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,430
product of this vector.

305
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,070
I'll write it in green.

306
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:31,720
The vector 1, 3, minus 1, 5, 4,
1 times our input vector,

307
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,200
x1, x2, which is super cool
because now we just have to do

308
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,660
a matrix multiplication.

309
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,770
Instead of this, and if we have
some processor that does

310
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,920
this super fast, we
can then use that.

311
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,050
I don't know, I think this is
especially elegant, because

312
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,310
what happens here is we applied
the transformations to

313
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,090
each of the columns of a 2-by-2
matrix, and we got a

314
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,620
3-by-2 matrix.

315
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,380
And we know what happens when
you multiply a 3-by-2 matrix

316
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,550
times a vector that's in R2.

317
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,420
Or you can almost view this
as a 2-by-1 matrix.

318
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,579
You're going to get a vector
that is in R3.

319
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,790
Because you're going to have
these guys times that guy's

320
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,609
going to be the first term.

321
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,846
These guys times these
guys are going to

322
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:14,800
be the second term.

323
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,230
These guys times those
guys are going to

324
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,569
be the third term.

325
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,040
So by kind of creating this
3-by-2 matrix, we have

326
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,510
actually created a mapping
from R2 to R3.

327
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,470
Anyway, for some reason I find
this to be especially neat.

328
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,470
Hopefully, at least you find
this somewhat instructive.
