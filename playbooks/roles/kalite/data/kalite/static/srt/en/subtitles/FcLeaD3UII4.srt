1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:11,368
Let's say that we have capital f(x) is being equal to the definite integral from pi to x of cot^2t dt.

2
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:15,864
and what we're curious about finding is the derivative of this business

3
00:00:15,864 --> 00:00:20,902
we want to figure out what f prime of x is equal to

4
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:24,569
well this is a direct application of the fundamental theorem of calculus

5
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:28,453
this is going to be the derivative with respect to x of all of this craziness

6
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:31,452
so let me just copy and paste that

7
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:33,772
so copy and paste

8
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:36,370
so this is going to be the derivative with respect to that

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:45,034
and the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that this is going to be equal to -this is going to be equal to just this function

10
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:48,036
but it's not going to be a function of t anymore

11
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:51,243
its going to be a function of x

12
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:56,370
so it's going to be equal to cot^2x

13
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,036
and you'll often see problems like this is if you go to calculus competitions or things like that or maybe certain exams

14
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:09,250
and it's like "Oh my God I have to take the antiderivative of all of this business, evaluate it at the different boundaries

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,303
and then I've got to take the derivative." No! You just have to apply the fundamental theorem of calculus.

16
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:15,910
And it's actually very straightforward and a very fast thing to do.

17
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,788
Now, let's mix it up a little bit.

18
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:29,169
Let's say that you had the expression -the definite integral from pi -instead of from pi to x, let's say it's from pi to x^2.

19
00:01:29,169 --> 00:01:32,168
Let me write that x^2 in a different color just to make it clear what I'm doing.

20
00:01:32,168 --> 00:01:46,780
From pi to x^2 of cot^2t dt, and you wanted to take the derivative of this business.

21
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:53,863
So you wanted to take the derivative with respect to x -you want to take the derivative with respect to x of this business.

22
00:01:53,863 --> 00:02:01,309
How would you do it? Well the recognition here is is that this is -capital f(x) was defined as this.

23
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:12,372
Now instead of an x you have an x^2, so this is the exact same thing as taking the derivative with respect to x of F of not x

24
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:18,968
that would be this, instead we have F(x^2) where we had an x here before we now have an x^2

25
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:27,452
you can verify, if you had F(x^2) every place you saw the x here would be an x^2, so it would look exactly like this.

26
00:02:27,452 --> 00:02:31,569
And so we just have to apply the chain rule.

27
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:41,787
So this is going to be equal to -and this is going to be equal to the derivative of F with respect to x^2

28
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:58,970
so this is going to be -and this is straight out of the chain rule -it's going to be F prime of x^2 times the derivative of with respect to x of x^2.

29
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,969
This is the derivative of F with respect to x^2

30
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:05,168
and then times the derivative of x^2 with respect to x

31
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:08,451
This is just the chain rule right over here

32
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:13,116
So what's F prime of x^2 -the derivative with respect to x^2?

33
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:21,175
Well, if you evaluate F prime at x^2, instead of just being cot^2x, it's going to be cot^2x^2.

34
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:35,972
So this part right over here -this business right over here is going to be cot^2x^2, so this is the derivative of all this business with respect to x^2

35
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:43,499
And then you have to multiply that times the derivative of x^2 with respect to x, which is just 2x

36
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:47,499
So there you have it, the derivative of this, all this craziness, is equal to 2x cot^2x^2.
