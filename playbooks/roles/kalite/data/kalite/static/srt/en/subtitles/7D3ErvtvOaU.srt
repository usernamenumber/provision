1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940
   

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,570
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:06,680
I'm on problem number 10.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,980
Phillip used 4 pieces of masking
tape, each 6 inches

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:25,020
long, to put up each
of his posters.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,650
   

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,150
So this is per poster.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,080
   

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,060
Good enough.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,610
Phillip had a 300-foot roll of
masking tape when he started.

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,130
So he starts at 300 feet.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,760
I can already tell you that
some unit conversion will

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,180
happen, because they're talking
about 6 inches here

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,940
and they're talking about
300 feet here.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,850
If no tape was wasted, which
of the following represents

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,330
the number of feet--and they
underline it-- of masking tape

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,080
that was left on the roll after
he put up the n posters?

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,330
And they actually tell us that
12 inches are equal to a foot

19
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,140
in case you aren't
from this planet.

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,715
So how do we do this?

21
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:12,520
   

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,460
So he's going to put
up n posters.

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,630
So he's going to start
off-- well, how much

24
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,830
tape will he use?

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,390
So for each of those n posters,
how much will he use?

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,980
He uses 4 pieces
times 6 inches.

27
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,300
But we want to go into feet.

28
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,230
We want to know how many
feet are left.

29
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,170
So let's just convert
immediately to feet.

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,070
6 inches is equal to
how many feet?

31
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,980
Well, it's half a foot.

32
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,160
6/12 inches.

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,000
So it equals 1/2 foot.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,790
So he does 4 pieces for each
poster, and each of those

35
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,640
pieces is 1/2 foot.

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,800
And now we're immediately
in feet length.

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,290
So this is how much he uses.

38
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,790
So he will use-- so 4
times 1/2 is just 2.

39
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,640
So he uses 2n feet.

40
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,400
   

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,210
So if he starts with 300, the
amount that he has left is

42
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,485
what he started with
minus what he used.

43
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:10,900
He used 2n.

44
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,360
So he starts with 300 feet minus
2n feet, so that's the

45
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,350
expression.

46
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,600
That's choice B.

47
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,680
Next problem.

48
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,990
Problem 11.

49
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,870
I'll switch to magenta.

50
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,450
In the x, y coordinate plane,
line m is the reflection of

51
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,320
line l about the x-axis.

52
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:42,650
If the slope of m-- so m slope--
is equal to minus 4/5,

53
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,300
what is the slope of l?

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,000
So you should hopefully be able
to do this on the real

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,980
exam without having
to draw it.

56
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,330
Or you could actually just draw
a really quick and dirty

57
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,740
one, and that actually
probably would

58
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,990
do the job for you.

59
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,020
   

60
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,450
So minus 4/5.

61
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,460
That means for every
5-- and it's a

62
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,510
reflection about the x-axis.

63
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,805
So let's draw a line m.

64
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:12,870
   

65
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,510
Now let's just assume that
the origin's here.

66
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,350
They don't tell us that,
but they don't

67
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,150
tell us it's not that.

68
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,860
So that's zero, one, two,
three, four, five.

69
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,900
And this is one, two,
three, four.

70
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,850
Let me do it here.

71
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,330
One, two, three, four.

72
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,490
I just want to draw it
so you understand.

73
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,410
So 4, minus 4, this is 5.

74
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,120
So we know line m.

75
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,530
For every line m, for every
5 it goes to the right,

76
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,450
it goes down 4.

77
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,590
So this could be a legitimate
line m right here.

78
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,670
It could be like this.

79
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,840
Line m could look like that.

80
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,170
   

81
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,367
So a reflection about the
x-axis, if I were to reflect

82
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,520
it about the x-axis.

83
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,160
This is the x-axis right here,
so I just want to take its

84
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,190
mirror image, or flip
it over the x-axis.

85
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,440
It would look like this.

86
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,900
   

87
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,960
Oh, I thought I was using
the line tool.

88
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,210
It would look like this.

89
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,829
   

90
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,950
I'm still not using
the line tool.

91
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,430
Now, I'm using the line tool.

92
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,440
It would look like
that, right?

93
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,270
So what's the slope here?

94
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:35,230
Well, for every 5 I go to
the right, I move up 4.

95
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,940
So change in y.

96
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,790
Let me make sure this is
line m, this is line l.

97
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:47,350
Change in y over change in
x for line l is equal to

98
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,600
positive 4/5.

99
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,260
   

100
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,000
It shouldn't take you
that long to do it.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,720
One thing that you could just
do as well, you could just

102
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,530
draw a quick and dirty one.

103
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,160
It's like, well, if I have
something with a negative

104
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,640
slope-- let's say I have
a negative, really

105
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,590
shallow slope like that.

106
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,040
If I flip it, it's going to have
the same slope, but it's

107
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,620
going to be a positive slope,
but it's still going to be

108
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,260
shallow, so it's going to
be the same magnitude.

109
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,290
You'll flip the sign.

110
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,100
So the answer is B, 4/5.

111
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,920
But I did this just to give
you the intuition.

112
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,940
The next problem.

113
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,550
Or to let you know why you got
it wrong, if you got it wrong.

114
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,960
Anyway.

115
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,090
Problem number 12.

116
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:37,900
If n is equal to 3p, for what
value of p is n equal to p?

117
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:51,630
   

118
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,380
This is kind of crazy.

119
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,240
And at first, I was like,
what are they saying?

120
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,890
And then I read one
of the choices.

121
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,810
Because no matter what,
n is equal to 3p.

122
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:08,100
There's no circumstance--
well, oh, sorry.

123
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,820
I was incorrect.

124
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,350
There is a circumstance in
which n is equal to 3p.

125
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,850
   

126
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,070
Well, what's the circumstance?

127
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:25,290
Well, you might initially say,
well, as long as p is not 0, n

128
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,580
is going to be exactly
3 times p.

129
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,890
But then in our statement, I
just told you the answer.

130
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,750
They both can be 0.

131
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,680
If p is 0, then 3
times 0 is 0.

132
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,540
So there's no real
algebra there.

133
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,310
It's just kind of to realize
that 0 is a choice.

134
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,970
And if you looked at the
choices, you'd immediately see

135
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,160
choice A is 0.

136
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,870
Try it out.

137
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,180
You say, oh, well, if p is
0, then n is also 0.

138
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,930
So then n would equal p.

139
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,140
So next problem.

140
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,310
Problem 13.

141
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,920
That was one of those problems
that in some ways are so easy

142
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,700
that you waste time
on it, making sure

143
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,300
you didn't miss something.

144
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,265
Let's draw what they drew.

145
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:09,350
So we have a line like that.

146
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,385
I have a line like that.

147
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:15,030
Then I have a line like that.

148
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,250
And this is line l.

149
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,580
This is y degrees.

150
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,430
This is line m.

151
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,520
This is x degrees, and this
is line n right here.

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,440
In the figure above, if z--
oh, they tell us this is z

153
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,670
right here.

154
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:42,155
In the figure above, if z is
equal to 30, what is the value

155
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:44,670
of x plus y?

156
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,720
x plus y is what?

157
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,800
Well, what can we figure out?

158
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,050
What do we know about this
angle right here?

159
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,130
It's supplementary
to y, right?

160
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,760
So this is kind of the angle
game, but we're going to have

161
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,260
a little bit more variables
than normal.

162
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,810
It's supplementary to y, so this
is going to be 180 minus

163
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,880
y because y plus this
angle are going to

164
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,610
have to equal 180.

165
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,980
And for the exact same reason,
this angle right here

166
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,870
is 180 minus x.

167
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,530
And what do we know?

168
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,115
We know this angle plus this
angle plus z is equal to 180.

169
00:08:17,115 --> 00:08:18,730
So let's write that down.

170
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:29,230
This angle, 180 minus y, plus
this angle, plus 180 minus x,

171
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,419
plus z is equal to 180
because they're

172
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,390
all in the same triangle.

173
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,380
So let's try our best
to simplify this.

174
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:44,540
Well, we could immediately get
rid of one of the 180's on

175
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,610
that side, and that becomes 0.

176
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,100
z is 30, right?

177
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,490
So let's simplify it.

178
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:58,990
We get minus y minus x, and
then you have 180 plus 30,

179
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,660
plus 210, is equal to 0.

180
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,160
Now let's add x and
y to both sides.

181
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,100
I'm kind of skipping a step.

182
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,440
You could add x to both sides
and then add y to both sides.

183
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,410
But if you add x and y to both
sides, you get 210 is

184
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,190
equal to x plus y.

185
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,680
And that's the answer.

186
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,710
They want to know what
x plus y is.

187
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,440
And that is choice D.

188
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,060
And so the trick here is really
saying, well, they

189
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,370
only give us z.

190
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,440
The only thing I know is that
z is in a triangle with this

191
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,220
angle and this angle.

192
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,800
And let me express those two
angles in terms of x and y,

193
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
because they are supplementary
to x and y.

194
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,610
