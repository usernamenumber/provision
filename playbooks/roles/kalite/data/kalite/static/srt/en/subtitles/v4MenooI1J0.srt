1
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:04,699
As another hint, I will take the same matrix, matrix A

2
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:10,215
and take its determinant again but I will do it using a different technique, either technique is valid

3
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:12,132
so here we saying what is the determinant of

4
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:17,431
the 3X3 Matrix A and we can is we can rewrite first two column

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:25,264
so first column right over here we could rewrite it as 4 4 -2 and then the second column right over here

6
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:27,282
we could rewrite it

7
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:31,682
-1 5 0

8
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:35,049
and we could do is we could take the sum of the products

9
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:38,099
of the first three top left bottom left diagonal,

10
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:39,299
let me show you

11
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:40,881
so the product of that

12
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:42,299
that

13
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:43,514
plus

14
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:45,196
that

15
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:46,732
plus

16
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:48,090
that

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,223
trying my best to draw this neatly

18
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:51,881
and then from that subtract

19
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:54,632
top right to bottom left diagonal

20
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:56,131
so from that subtract

21
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:57,690
let get a color

22
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,291
I havent used

23
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,075
subtract that

24
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:03,998
and that

25
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,964
and that

26
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:08,490
sounds really confusing with all the diagonals

27
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,343
i have drawn

28
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:10,876
lets look at the blue ones first

29
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:13,149
4 times 5 times 0

30
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:15,548
4 times 5 times 0

31
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:17,581
plus -1 times 3 times -2

32
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:22,132
plus -1 times 3 times -2

33
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:24,866
let me put these in parenthesis

34
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:29,708
plus 1 times 4 times 0

35
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,151
and then we gonna subtract all of these orange

36
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:34,950
diagonal, we go from the top right to the bottom left

37
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,361
so we gonna subtract

38
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:38,682
we could do 1 times 5 times -2

39
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:43,567
1 times 5 times -2 and then we can subtract

40
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:47,949
subtract 4 times 3 times 0

41
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:50,564
4 times 3 times 0

42
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:52,665
and then we can subtract

43
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:54,649
-1 times 4 times 0

44
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,798
-1 times 4 times 0

45
00:01:56,798 --> 00:01:59,382
and now we just evaluate this over here

46
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:01,348
4 times 5 times 0

47
00:02:01,348 --> 00:02:03,182
is just 0

48
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:05,533
-1 times 3 times -2

49
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:10,565
is +6 so this is +6

50
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:13,082
1 times 4 times 0 is 0 once again

51
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:16,182
and then we have

52
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:18,348
1 times 5 times -2

53
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:23,631
is -10 but we have this negative out here so it becomes a +10

54
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:27,181
then 4 times 3 times , well thats just going to be 0.

55
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:31,283
and then we have -1 times 4 times 0, which is just 0

56
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:34,555
so we are left with +6 + 10

57
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:38,555
which is equal to +16
