1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,270
   

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,740
In the very first immunology
video, where we talked about

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,580
nonspecific defense mechanisms,
we said if we had

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,400
some type of a pathogen-- let's
say it's a bacteria--

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,040
that our phagocytes can
recognize either proteins on

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,770
the bacteria or maybe it was
some other type of pathogen--

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,095
some other marker
on the pathogen.

8
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:20,780
It doesn't know what type of
pathogen it is, but that's

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,820
enough for the phagocyte.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,170
It'll engulf the pathogen.

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,220
So let's say this is
the phagocyte.

12
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,060
Somehow one of their receptors
touches one of the proteins

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,560
that's on the surface of this
bacteria in this case and

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,800
says, gee, that's not a good
thing to have around and so

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,520
it'll engulf it.

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,830
So the membrane is just going to
surround the pathogen-- and

17
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,060
this part is going to go in.

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,440
It's going to kind of pinch in
and the pathogen is going to

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,290
get surrounded and
get engulfed--

20
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,570
phagocytozed by the phagocyte.

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,910
So the end product-- we saw this
on the first video where

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,520
I talked about phagocytes-- is
we're going to end up-- so

23
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,160
then the membrane's going
to be completely around.

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,349
This is going to pinch in and
bubble around this thing and

25
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,970
so we're going to have
the pathogen sitting

26
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,100
inside of the phagocyte.

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,680
It's going to be surrounded
by a membrane.

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,220
That membrane's called
a phagosome.

29
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,560
And we learned there's
different types of

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,380
phagocytes-- could be a
macrophage, could be a

31
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,280
neutrophil, could be a dendritic
cell-- and we have

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,250
it like this and then we also
saw in that video, it's not

33
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,460
just done-- the macrophage
doesn't

34
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,390
just digest this thing.

35
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,970
That by itself is very useful.

36
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,160
It got this bacteria
out of the way.

37
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,850
If this was a virus, it got
that virus out of the way.

38
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,560
But it does even
more than that.

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,850
It takes that and then it lyses
it-- or it breaks it up.

40
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,700
It doesn't have to actually
use-- well, it breaks it up.

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,430
There's several ways it can do
it, but the bottom line is, it

42
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,680
processes it.

43
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,010
   

44
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,930
It'll break up the pathogen--
and we saw that first video on

45
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,810
phagocytes that we'll actually
have a lysosome bond to it and

46
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,009
dump all sorts of particles that
are going to break up and

47
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,810
cut up this bacteria,
in this case, into

48
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,060
its constituent molecules.

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,000
   

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,250
And then some subset of the
leftovers, particular chains

51
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,060
of the peptides-- and remember,
proteins are long

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,580
chains of amino acids.

53
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,610
Polypeptides are short chains.

54
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,930
So you take short chains of
those and they're going to

55
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,565
bond to special proteins.

56
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:37,320
   

57
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,800
And this is essentially the
topic of this video.

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,350
So let's say they bond to that
special protein, bond to that

59
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,410
special protein.

60
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,200
And then those proteins get
transported or get to the

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,920
membrane or the outer surface
of the cell and they present

62
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,750
themselves along with the
piece of the pathogen.

63
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,420
So the end product after
phagocytozed this pathogen is

64
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,800
that the phagocyte will look
something like this and it

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,320
will have these antigen
presenting proteins, I guess

66
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,080
we can call them, that had
bound to parts of that

67
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,870
original pathogen.

68
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,800
Let me do it right here.

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,060
So it has a little bit of the
original pathogen on it that I

70
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,010
drew in green right here.

71
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,820
And these proteins right here,
these are called-- it's a

72
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,120
fancy word and I talked about
it in the previous video--

73
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:47,140
these are called major
histocompatibility complexes,

74
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:53,170
or MHC for short.

75
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:58,170
And when we're talking about
phagocytes or macrophages or

76
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,270
dendritic cells that are
particular cases of

77
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,600
phagocytes, the major
histocompatibility complexes

78
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,700
that they present after
they've digested this

79
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,380
molecule-- this is
an MHC class II.

80
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,630
Let me write this down.

81
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,250
This is an MHC class
II protein.

82
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,899
It might seem like I'm really
going into the minutiae of

83
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,880
what these proteins are, but
we're going to see this is key

84
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,190
for activating other parts of
the immune system, especially

85
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,450
the cell mediated parts
of the immune system.

86
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,630
So this was the case with a
macrophage or a dendrite.

87
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,250
They engulf something, they chew
it all up, and then parts

88
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,860
of the chewed up thing that they
ate, they attach to these

89
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,700
MHC II proteins and these
MHC proteins go to the

90
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,740
surface of the cell.

91
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,015
The same thing-- or actually not
the quite the same thing--

92
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:49,030
a very similar thing happens
with B cells.

93
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,820
So if we have a B cell--
that's a good color.

94
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,900
B for blue.

95
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,590
We know B stands for bursa, but
it could stand for bone

96
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,940
marrow just as well.

97
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,560
Let's say we have a B cell and
it's got its membrane bound

98
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,910
antibody on it.

99
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,450
Remember, it's very specific
to that B cells.

100
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,910
So all of the membrane bound
antibodies, all 10,000 or so

101
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,500
of them on this B cell, they
all expressed the same

102
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,920
variable part.

103
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,720
So this is a particular
B cell.

104
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,690
So remember, this
was nonspecific.

105
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,450
When we talked about
phagocytosis, these guys just

106
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,440
say, you're a bacteria.

107
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,980
You're a virus.

108
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,940
I don't know what
kind you are.

109
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,830
I'm just going to eat you up.

110
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,430
You look shady.

111
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,140
I'm going to eat you up.

112
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,435
I don't know what type
you are or whether

113
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:30,410
I've seen you before.

114
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,540
When we're talking about B
cells, we're talking about the

115
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,080
adaptive or the specific
immune system.

116
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,190
And so these-- the variable ends
of these membrane bound

117
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,060
antibodies are specific to
certain parts of certain

118
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,650
pathogens, to certain
epitopes.

119
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,030
Remember, epitopes were the
parts of certain pathogens

120
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,010
that these specific chains can
recognize and bond to.

121
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,660
So let's say that we're
dealing with a

122
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,370
virus in this situation.

123
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,400
And let's say the virus
just happens to

124
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,110
bond to this B cell.

125
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,760
Remember, there might be
other-- in fact, there

126
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,910
definitely are tons of other
B cells around, but their

127
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:17,130
variable portions are
all different.

128
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,940
And that's what I always find
amazing about B cells is that

129
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,610
they come from the same genetic
line, their genes have

130
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,580
been shuffled around in their
development so that they can

131
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,830
produce billions of combinations
of these

132
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,380
proteins, or the variable ends
of their antibodies.

133
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,400
So let's say we have
some virus.

134
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,300
Let me say it's a bacteria.

135
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,850
When I did the other B cell
example, I said we're dealing

136
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,460
with viruses.

137
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,860
But let's say some new bacteria
and just some part of

138
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,550
its surface just happens to
bind to only this B cell--

139
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,740
because this B cell has just
the right combination.

140
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,010
So some part of his surface
binds just to that B cell

141
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,600
right there.

142
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,760
That part of the surface that
binds, remember, that was

143
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,000
called the epitope.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,920
That's that part of the pathogen
that binds to our

145
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,780
variable sequencer.

146
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,030
It won't bind to this B cell
or this B cell because they

147
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,540
have different sequences here,
but it binds to this B cell

148
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,180
and then that starts the
activation process.

149
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,830
We'll go into-- sometimes this
by itself can get the B cell

150
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,660
activated, but you normally
need help from helper T

151
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,830
cells-- and we'll talk
more about that.

152
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,130
And we said, once this
happens, once you get

153
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,620
activated or the activation
process starts, this guy

154
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,850
actually gets engulfed-- and I
didn't talk about that in the

155
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,740
last video just because I didn't
want to go into too

156
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,400
much detail.

157
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:42,230
So this whole thing gets
engulfed by the B cell.

158
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,870
And then when it gets activated,
it proliferates

159
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,960
itself and you normally need
the T cells there and some

160
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,245
part of them become plasma B
cells, some part of them

161
00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:53,495
become memory B cells.

162
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:58,590
   

163
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,350
Remember, the plasma B cells
say, gee, I've been activated.

164
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,180
I'm just going to produce a
ton of these antibodies.

165
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,850
So the plasma B cell will just
produce tons of these

166
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,720
antibodies and start spitting
them out so that they can

167
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,020
attach to more and more of that
pathogen and just mess

168
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,650
them up in different ways,
either tag them so that other

169
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:23,070
macrophages or phagocytes eat
them up-- or tag two of them

170
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,380
so you bundle them up so that
they can't operate properly.

171
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:25,700
Whatever.

172
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,120
I'm not going to go into
detail on that.

173
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,390
That's when it gets activated.

174
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,860
But the interesting thing is
that the B cell will also do

175
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,909
what the phagocytes do.

176
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:41,840
The B cell will also take
this guy into the cell.

177
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,100
Maybe he's initially attached
to the antibody-- and break

178
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:55,140
him up, take pieces of this
pathogen and attach it to MHC

179
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,790
II proteins and then present
them on the surface.

180
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,495
So a B cell will also
present the antigen.

181
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:06,970
   

182
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,220
So this is also an MHC
II complex-- a major

183
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,790
histocompatibility complex--
and just so you know, histo

184
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,700
means tissue.

185
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,050
So this is related to whether
something is compatible with

186
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,260
the tissue in your body and
we'll talk more about that and

187
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,380
how it relates to transplants
and all of that.

188
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,750
So this is also an
MHC class II.

189
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,250
In both cases, whether we're
talking about B cells that

190
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,950
recognize a very specific
pathogen-- and it could be a

191
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:37,090
specific virus, a specific
protein, a specific bacteria,

192
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,350
or in the cases of phagocytes,
they'll just say,

193
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,210
oh, you look shady.

194
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,050
Let me take you in.

195
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,300
I don't know what type of
bacteria or virus or protein

196
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,940
you are, but in either case,
they both engulf them, take

197
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,190
pieces of them, cut them up,
and present them on their

198
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,580
surface in a complex
with the major

199
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,040
histocompatibility complexes.

200
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,450
So cells that do this are called
professional antigen

201
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,700
presenting cells.

202
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,080
   

203
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,770
This is what they do for a
living, although they do other

204
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,430
things, as we've seen.

205
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,750
The phagocytes eat things.

206
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,640
The B cells generate antibodies
or memories so that

207
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,355
they can later be activated to
generate antibodies, but these

208
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:25,730
are called professional antigen
presenting cell.

209
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,630
And the antigen in question is
this little piece of the

210
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,420
actual thing that you're trying
to track, that little

211
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,720
piece-- the actual part of the
pathogen, that's what the

212
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,520
antigen-- so it's presenting
the antigen.

213
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:48,630
It's professional because it
takes pathogens from in the

214
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,940
fluid of our system and then
engulfs them, breaks them up,

215
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,510
and then presents them.

216
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,810
Now there are also
nonprofessional antigen

217
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,530
presenting cells.

218
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,910
And in fact, most
cells are this.

219
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,600
In fact, even these guys.

220
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,770
Actually, I'm going to wait
for the next video.

221
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,960
I realize all of my videos
are getting long.

222
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,280
So you're probably thinking,
these guys in either case

223
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,030
engulf them, cut them
up, present them,

224
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,320
what is it good for?

225
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,690
You'll see these MHC II, these
are what are recognized by

226
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,290
helper T cells.

227
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,830
It'll all form part of the
puzzle of how our immune

228
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,420
system works.

229
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,160
So in the next video, I'll talk
about MHC I presenting

230
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,450
cells, which is pretty
much all body cells.

231
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,091
