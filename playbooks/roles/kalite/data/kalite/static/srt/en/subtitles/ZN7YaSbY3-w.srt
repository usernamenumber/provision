1
00:00:00,321 --> 00:00:10,075
Let's say that I have the vector a, and let's say that it's equal to (2,1)

2
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:12,603
So we could draw it right over here,

3
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:16,475
So it's equal to (2,1), so if we were to start at the origin

4
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:20,974
and we would move 2 in the horizontal direction, and 1 in the vertical direction

5
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:24,572
so we would end up right over here.

6
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:27,408
Now what I want to do is think about, how we can define

7
00:00:27,408 --> 00:00:31,270
multiplying this vector by a scalar

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:39,496
for example, if I were to say 3 times the vector a.

9
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:47,780
which is the same thing as saying 3 times (2,1)

10
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:50,937
So 3 is just a number. One way to think about a scalar quantity,

11
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:56,176
it is just a number, versus a vector is giving you how much you're moving

12
00:00:56,176 --> 00:01:01,935
in the various directions. It's giving you both the magnitude and a direction.

13
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:04,870
while this is just a plain number right over here.

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:10,181
But how do we define multiplying 3 times this vector?

15
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,075
Well one reasonable thing that might jump out at you is,

16
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:16,483
why don't we just multiply the 3 times each of these components?

17
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:21,005
So this could be equal to.. we have 2 and 1..

18
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:24,011
And we're going to multiply each of these with 3.

19
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:27,675
So 3 times 2 and 3 times 1.

20
00:01:27,675 --> 00:01:32,906
And then the resulting vector is still going to be a 2-dimensional vector.

21
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:37,134
And it's going to be the 2-dimensional vector (6,3).

22
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:40,735
Now I encourage you to get some graph paper out and to actually plot this vector,

23
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:46,100
and think about how it relates to this vector right over here.

24
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,739
So let me do that..

25
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:50,741
So the vector (6,3), if we started at the origin..

26
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:56,337
We would move 6 in the horizontal direction.. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6..

27
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:59,536
And 3 in the vertical.. 1, 2, 3..

28
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:04,936
So it gets us right over there, so it would look like this.

29
00:02:05,536 --> 00:02:08,434
So what just happened to this vector?

30
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:11,269
Well notice, one way to think about it is what has changed,

31
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:14,405
and what has not changed about this vector?

32
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:17,725
Well what's not changed is still pointing in the same direction.

33
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:21,336
So this right over here has the same direction.

34
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:24,669
Multiplying by the scalar, at least the way we defined it..

35
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:28,539
did not change the direction that my vector is going in.

36
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:32,072
Or at least in this case it didn't.. But it did change its magnitude.

37
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:35,202
Its magnitude is now 3 times longer, which makes sense!

38
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:36,935
Because we multiplied it by 3.

39
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:39,601
One way to think about it is we scaled it up by 3.

40
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:43,404
The scalar scaled up the vector. That might make sense.

41
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:46,737
Or it might make an intuition of where that word scalar came from.

42
00:02:46,737 --> 00:02:52,484
The scalar, when you multiply it, it scales up a vector.

43
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:57,145
It Increased its magnitude by 3 without changing its direction.

44
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:59,149
Well let's do something interesting..

45
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:04,501
Let's multiply our vector a by a negative number.

46
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:08,148
Let's just multiply it by -1 for simplicity.

47
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:13,351
So let's just multiply -1 times a.

48
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,338
Well using the convention that we just came up with..

49
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:20,148
We would multiply each of the components by -1.

50
00:03:20,148 --> 00:03:26,364
So 2 times -1 is -2, and 1 times -1 is -1.

51
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:32,602
So now -1 times a is going to be (-2,-1)

52
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:34,321
So if we started at the origin,

53
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:39,737
we would move in the horizontal direction -2, and in the vertical -1

54
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:47,859
So now what happened to the vector? When I did that?

55
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,671
Well now it flipped its direction!

56
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:54,070
Multiplying it by this -1, it flipped it's direction.

57
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,333
Its magnitude actually has not changed,

58
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,901
but its direction is now in the exact opposite direction.

59
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:04,522
Which makes sense, that multiplying by a negative number would do that.

60
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:08,274
In fact when we dealt with the traditional number line, that's what happened

61
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:11,643
If you took 5 times -1, well now you're going in the other direction

62
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:14,069
you're at -5, you're 5 to the left of zero.

63
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,936
So it makes sense that this would flip its direction.

64
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:24,394
So you could imagine, if you were to take something like -2 times your vector a,

65
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:26,151
-2 times your vector a..

66
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:29,474
And I encourage you to pause this video and try this on your own..

67
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:33,940
What would this give? And what would be the resulting visualization of the vector?

68
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,816
Well let's see, this would be equal to -2 times 2 is -4,

69
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:43,738
-2 times 1 is -2, so this vector..

70
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:46,669
if you were to start at the origin! remember you don't have to start at the origin..

71
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:52,898
but if you were.. it would go 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.. 1, 2..

72
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:56,742
It looks just like this..

73
00:04:57,358 --> 00:05:04,957
And so just to remind ourselves.. our original vector a looked like this..

74
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:08,564
(2, 1) looks like this..

75
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:15,934
And then when you multiply it by -2.. you get a vector that looks like this..

76
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,068
Let me draw it like this..

77
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:19,870
I'm purposely not having them all start at the origin,

78
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,069
because they don't HAVE to all start at the origin..

79
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:26,552
But you get a vector that looks like this..

80
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:31,610
So what's the difference between a and -2 times a?

81
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,973
well the negative flipped it over,

82
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:37,526
and then the two flipped it over and now it has twice the magnitude

83
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:41,526
but because of the negative it has twice the magnitude in the other direction.
