1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
   

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,990
Welcome.

3
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,930
So I've done this series of
presentations about housing.

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,670
And at least, my thesis on why
housing prices might have gone

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,260
up, and how you should maybe,
in simple terms, think about

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,220
the rent-versus-buy decision.

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,420
But one thing that's happened, a
lot of people said, oh, Sal,

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,200
you're making oversimplifying
assumptions.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,870
You're assuming interest-only
loans.

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,490
You're not factoring in the tax
deductions of mortgages,

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,300
et cetera, of interest
on your mortgage.

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,850
Which I did, but I did make some
simplifying assumptions.

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,900
So that we could kind of do back
of the envelope math, and

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,670
just think about what the main
drivers are when you think

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,210
about renting versus buying.

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,810
But it is fair.

17
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,930
That's just kind
of a first cut.

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,950
You really should do a
multi-line model, trying to

19
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,920
figure out what could
happen to you.

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,460
And then tweak your
assumptions.

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,080
And really figure out what's
going to happen to you if

22
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,770
housing appreciates,
depreciates.

23
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,170
If interest rates change.

24
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,850
If you put 10% down, or
20% down, or whatever.

25
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,250
So with that in mind, I've
constructed this model.

26
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,350
What I called, this is the
home purchase model.

27
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,570
And you can download it yourself
and play with it.

28
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,390
I think this will prove
to be useful for you.

29
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,765
You can download it at
khanacademy.org/

30
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:12,015
downloads/buyrent.xls.

31
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:15,930
   

32
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,280
It's an Excel spreadsheet.

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,060
So if you have Excel, you should
be able to access it.

34
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,480
And maybe you want to
follow along while

35
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,730
you watch this video.

36
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,980
So just khanacademy.org/
downloads/buyrent.xls.

37
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:33,630
   

38
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,860
So once you download it,
let me explain what I

39
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,390
assumed in the model.

40
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,030
So what I did in yellow, both
this bright yellow and this

41
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,330
less bright yellow, these
are our assumptions.

42
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,090
These are the things that are
going to drive the model, and

43
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,050
tell us whether over -- and I
calculated over 10 years --

44
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,630
whether we will do better
renting versus buying.

45
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,120
And so if you download this
model and want to play with it

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,470
yourself, unless you are fairly
sophisticated with

47
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,250
Excel, the only things
you should change are

48
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,270
the things in yellow.

49
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,639
Everything else is calculated.

50
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,509
And it's driven by
these inputs.

51
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,660
So of course, what matters
in a home?

52
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,540
Well the purchase
price matters.

53
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,810
So you just in put it there.

54
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,250
The down payment matters.

55
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,480
You could, if you want, you can
just write like I wrote,

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,560
20% of whatever the
purchase price is.

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,370
So you can write the exact
number, or you can just leave

58
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,995
it the way I did.

59
00:02:23,995 --> 00:02:26,370
And whatever the down payment
percentage is,

60
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,690
it'll calculate it.

61
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,510
This is the interest
rate you assume.

62
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,140
This is the principal
amortization.

63
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,110
So principal amortization just
means, well, if I just keep

64
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,370
paying this mortgage, after
how long is the entire

65
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,510
principal amount -- not just
interest, how long is the

66
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,430
entire principal amount going
to be paid off in?

67
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,410
So essentially, a 30-year fixed
rate loan has a 30 year

68
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,780
principal amortization.

69
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,200
If you have a 10-year loan,
you'd put 10 here.

70
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,350
This is the property tax rate.

71
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,030
This is what I assume because
I live in California, and in

72
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,500
most areas of California,
that's the property tax.

73
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,140
This is what I assume about
annual maintenance.

74
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,390
That's just an assumption.

75
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,010
Some houses might be less,
might be more.

76
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,660
That's up to you to decide.

77
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,280
This is housing association
dues.

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,900
Maybe if you live in a community
that has a shared

79
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,500
golf course, or a shared
pool or something.

80
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Put it at 0 if you don't.

81
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,360
This is annual insurance, for
things like hazard insurance,

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,600
and flood insurance, earthquake
insurance, or

83
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,530
whatever insurance you
need where you live.

84
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,770
And in this bright yellow, I
say, what is the assumed

85
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,620
annual appreciation of
the house itself?

86
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,650
And this is a huge assumption.

87
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,290
And that's why I put it into
this bold yellow color.

88
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,540
Because we'll see later in
this video that to some

89
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,245
degree, that assumption is one
of the biggest drivers of

90
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:41,600
assumption.

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,880
Or you could say the model is
very, very, very sensitive to

92
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,390
that assumption.

93
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,650
Here, this is your assumed
marginal income tax rate.

94
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,190
And why does that matter?

95
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,140
Well because you can deduct the
interest that you spend on

96
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,520
your mortgage.

97
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,380
And also you can deduct,
actually, the property tax.

98
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,690
So if you can deduct $100 in
interest and property tax, if

99
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,850
your marginal tax rate is 30% --
so that means at what rate

100
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,720
are you being taxed on every
incremental dollar.

101
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,540
If it's 30%, that means a $100
deduction will save you $30.

102
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,740
If your marginal tax rate is
20%, a $100 deduction will

103
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,579
save you $20.

104
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,060
So that's where that
comes into play.

105
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,360
The 2%, that's general
inflation.

106
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,890
And what this assumption drives
is, well, there's going

107
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,540
to be some inflation on things
like housing association dues,

108
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,610
annual maintenance, insurance.

109
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,890
And so this, what you assume
about, well, what is just the

110
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,460
general rate of inflation, in
our model that's actually

111
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,360
going to drive how these grow
over the life of your loan.

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,580
And then once you type in all
of these things, the monthly

113
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,650
mortgage payment
is calculated.

114
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,140
I assumed that the interest
compounds once a month.

115
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,570
You can, if you know your
geometric series, you can go

116
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,730
in there and you can tweak it
around so it compounds more

117
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,920
frequently or less frequently.

118
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,070
But my understanding
is that most

119
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,470
mortgages compound monthly.

120
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,560
And then this right here, so
this is everything that's

121
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,480
driving the buying
a home decision.

122
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,260
Now these assumptions are so
that we can make a comparison

123
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,010
to, well, what if instead of
using that down payment to buy

124
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,210
a house, what if we actually
just save that down payment,

125
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,050
put it in the bank, and
rent a house instead.

126
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,460
So this is cost of renting
a similar home.

127
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,580
This is the annual rental
price inflation.

128
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,060
And I would argue, to some
degree, that rental price

129
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,140
inflation over the long term
should not be that different

130
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,640
than housing price inflation.

131
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,350
Because to some degree,
rental is kind of the

132
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,120
earnings on a home.

133
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,090
And if earnings increase and
the overall asset doesn't

134
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,470
increase, your return
increases.

135
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,440
Or the other way around.

136
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,480
Your return decreases.

137
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,800
But anyway, don't want to
get too complicated.

138
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,710
And then this is the 6%, or
I just assume it's 6%.

139
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,320
You can change it.

140
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,690
This is what you assume that
you can get on your cash.

141
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,870
So if I don't put the $150,000
down deposit on the home, and

142
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,690
I put it in, I don't know, maybe
I'm a good investor.

143
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,700
I could put in the
stock market.

144
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,160
Maybe I can get 20% a year.

145
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,920
Or maybe I'm really risk
averse, and I put it in

146
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,720
government bonds, and
I get 4% a year.

147
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,990
So this is the assumption
that you get in on that.

148
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,260
And it actually should be an
after-tax return on that cash.

149
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:33,350
So if my tax rate is 30% and I
think I can get 10% percent on

150
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,460
the stock market, I should
actually put a 7% here.

151
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,840
So we want to make sure
that we're completely

152
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,950
accurate for taxes.

153
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,800
So now let me explain the rest
of the model to you.

154
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,380
I want to make sure that I can
fit it all within this window.

155
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,290
Let me just squeeze
this a little bit.

156
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,690
   

157
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,830
Excel on YouTube is a
new thing for me.

158
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,150
That's not what I
wanted to do.

159
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,060
So let me unfreeze the window.

160
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,100
OK.

161
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,430
So now I can show you
the rest of model.

162
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,610
So all those assumptions
that we did,

163
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,290
that drives this model.

164
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,940
Let me freeze the window
right here.

165
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,580
   

166
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:21,790
OK.

167
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,220
That should make things
a little bit easier.

168
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,540
So this is the buying scenario,
up to line 40.

169
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,950
This says, OK, at period zero,
what is the home value?

170
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,210
And don't type in
anything here.

171
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,170
It's all automatically
calculated.

172
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,340
So at period zero, what
is your home value?

173
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,580
And then it uses essentially
the appreciation numbers.

174
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,050
And each period is essentially
a month.

175
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,680
I actually wrote
that down here.

176
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,050
And then it figures out,
what is the market

177
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:46,500
value of your home?

178
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,420
And it's completely driven by
that appreciation number.

179
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,420
This right here is the debt, or
essentially the principal

180
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,210
payment on your mortgage,
or how much do

181
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,410
you owe to the bank.

182
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,710
And as you see, as months go by,
when you pay the mortgage

183
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,510
note -- and I show that right
here, this mortgage payment.

184
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,870
Some amount of that, which is
line 33, the principal paid.

185
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,480
Some of that goes to decrease
the amount you owe.

186
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,230
And then a lot of it, especially
initially, goes to

187
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,700
be actually the interest
on the amount you owe.

188
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,590
And then obviously, if you
watch the video on

189
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,480
introduction to balance sheets,
your equity in the

190
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,170
home is the value of the home
minus the debt, or minus what

191
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,880
you owe the bank.

192
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,660
So this actually calculates
your equity.

193
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,450
Or essentially, one way to view
it, is actually to say,

194
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,900
well, what am I worth?

195
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,539
Or what is this investment worth
to me at that point?

196
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,730
So these are kind of the
important numbers in the home

197
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,190
buying scenario.

198
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,780
It is driven by-- This interest
on debt, it's

199
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,910
calculated by what interest
rate you assume, times the

200
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,930
debt you owe and the
period before.

201
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,440
The mortgage payment, we
calculated that before, using

202
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,820
our mathematical knowledge
of geometric series.

203
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,440
The paid principal, that's
going to be the mortgage

204
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,070
payment minus your interest.
Insurance payment, it's on a

205
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,300
monthly basis, right?

206
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,270
So we essentially took whatever
our annual insurance

207
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,940
payment was and we
divide it by 12.

208
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,720
But then we grow it by
the rate of inflation

209
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,760
on a monthly basis.

210
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,580
So we took the inflation rate,
divided by 12, and we

211
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,340
multiplied by each
of these months.

212
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,440
The housing association dues,
once again, this is on a

213
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,050
monthly basis.

214
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,230
So we just took your assumption,
divided by 12.

215
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,510
Maintenance, same thing.

216
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,660
Property tax, same thing.

217
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,910
Although I assumed that your
house gets reassessed.

218
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,610
So you're in a state where every
year, or every several

219
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,310
years, the assessor comes, says,
oh, your house is worth

220
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,510
more now, so I'm going
to raise your taxes.

221
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,460
That's not the case in a lot
of parts of California.

222
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,970
But it's the case in many parts
of the U.S. So actually

223
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,950
to some degree, this, the dollar
value, the property tax

224
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,410
is driven by this home value
assumption up here.

225
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,230
This income tax saving from
interest deduction, this is

226
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,710
assuming that at that marginal
tax rate, you can deduct the

227
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,700
property tax and the interest
on the debt.

228
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,810
And then this is the total cash
outflow after adding back

229
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,860
the income tax savings.

230
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,880
So this is essentially how much
cash goes out the door,

231
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,740
even after the tax savings,
every month,

232
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,240
in the buying scenario.

233
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,830
That's what that is.

234
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,270
So hopefully that makes
a little bit of sense.

235
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,780
So what we want to do is, we
want to figure out, OK, you

236
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,520
could do that.

237
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,830
You could buy the house,
put $150,000 down.

238
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,400
And every month put this much
out, and as you see that

239
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,270
number grows.

240
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,755
The mortgage is the same, but
a lot of these expenses grow

241
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:26,890
with inflation.

242
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,980
But I want to compare that to
what happens if I take that

243
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,730
exact amount of cash, after
adjusting for how much money I

244
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,170
get back from taxes.

245
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,490
And if I said, well, I'm going
to use that cash to pay my

246
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,440
rent and any other expenses
associated with renting--

247
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,810
which really aren't much-- to
pay my rent, and then put the

248
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,470
rest in the bank.

249
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,430
So what we're saying is, well,
that assumption was, that you

250
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,950
can rent a similar
house for $2,500.

251
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,690
It may be right, it
may be wrong.

252
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,860
It's up for you to play with.

253
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,440
And of course it grows with
inflation slowly.

254
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,140
Obviously your rent doesn't
increase every month, but I

255
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,830
assume it does fairly
continuously.

256
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,260
It's a reasonable assumption
I think.

257
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,110
Although you can change it.

258
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,880
You can make it only
step up every year.

259
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,700
And then this line down
here tells us the

260
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,100
savings while renting.

261
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,810
And I'm not saying the savings
from, you know, something's on

262
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,920
sale so I save money.

263
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,660
But your savings in terms of how
much you have in the bank.

264
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,370
So if you rented instead of
putting that $150,000 as a

265
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,170
down payment, you could have
put it in the bank.

266
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,590
So that would be your savings
account at period zero.

267
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,660
And then your savings account
at period one would be this

268
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,820
amount of money and whatever
return you got it, plus the

269
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,730
difference between your
cash out from buying a

270
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,860
home and your rent.

271
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,670
So this is your savings.

272
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,650
So what I do in this model --
and I could show you, I could

273
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,670
scroll through multiple
periods.

274
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,710
Yeah, this model actually goes
as far as Excel would let me.

275
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,160
But the average house -- anyone
who's traded mortgage

276
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,540
bonds will tell you-- the
average mortgage loan has a 10

277
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,260
year expected life.

278
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,135
Because that's when, on average,
people tend to move

279
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:05,000
or refinance.

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,957
So what I do is I figure out,
well, given your assumptions

281
00:12:08,957 --> 00:12:11,720
-- you can make your own
assumptions -- given your

282
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,880
assumptions, what is
your home value?

283
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,890
So let me make sure
I can get to that.

284
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,680
   

285
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,360
So given your assumptions, what
this calculates is, well,

286
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,250
it tells you what the home value
is after 10 years, your

287
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,150
debt after 10 years, your home
equity after 10 years.

288
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,980
And it assumes you were
to sell your house.

289
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,630
Because that's what the
average American

290
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,710
does after 10 years.

291
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,370
And so what is the
transaction cost?

292
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,770
You pay 6% to a broker.

293
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,290
Hopefully that won't be the
case in 10 years and the

294
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,050
internet will dis-intermediate
real estate

295
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,190
brokers, but who knows.

296
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,780
I apologize to if
you are broker.

297
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:52,410
And then this line, line 54,
that tells you what the net

298
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,470
cash is if you sell your
house at a market

299
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,800
price, you pay the broker.

300
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,380
This number right here is much
simpler to some degree.

301
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,410
It just tells you, well
let's say you decided

302
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,270
not to buy the house.

303
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,160
Given all your assumptions, how
much would you have saved

304
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,360
in the bank at that time?

305
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,110
And so this number right here,
this number is the difference

306
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,030
between those two numbers
in 10 years,

307
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,276
discounted back to today.

308
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:19,670
   

309
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,390
Actually I meant to
present value it.

310
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,860
But did I present value
these numbers?

311
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,790
Oh no, I didn't.

312
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,120
So actually this was meant
to be the present value.

313
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,040
I'm going to correct that
before you actually

314
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,560
play with the model.

315
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,990
Right now I just took the 10
year value, so this is the

316
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,980
value in year 10.

317
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,450
This is the difference
between the two.

318
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,230
The present value would be if
you discount this by some

319
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,900
discount rate.

320
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,080
Whatever you think, probably
the inflation rate.

321
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,240
And it would tell you in today's
money, what is the

322
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,480
benefit or the advantage of
buying versus renting?

323
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,600
Anyway I've spent 14 minutes
of your time.

324
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,610
I encourage you to download this
model, play with it, and

325
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,640
then work out the assumptions.

326
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,690
Because I think that's
the important thing.

327
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,150
Some people, they'll
make some set of

328
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,810
assumptions and say, ah-ha!

329
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,670
I should rent.

330
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,730
Or they say, ah-ha!

331
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,360
I should buy.

332
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,220
But they don't realize that they
made some assumptions.

333
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,630
That although it looks really
reasonable, let's say I make

334
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,870
this 3% annual appreciation
assumption.

335
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,410
That doesn't seem crazy.

336
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,060
But it's amazing how much it'll
change the model if you

337
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,750
make that 3% into a 1%, or if
you make it into even a

338
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,280
negative 1% or negative 2%.

339
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,180
It's completely possible.

340
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,660
It's happened before in the past
that you have flat real

341
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,360
estate prices for a significant
period of time,

342
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,880
even 10 years.

343
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,410
And actually most of the studies
show that real estate,

344
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,350
over the last 100 years, has
actually roughly grown, in

345
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,000
real terms, maybe 1% or 2%.

346
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,910
So actually 1% or 2% percent
here isn't that conservative.

347
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,560
And actually especially after
a big real estate

348
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,470
boom, may be prudent.

349
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,950
So play with these
assumptions.

350
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,870
And I think it'll give you
an intuition of what

351
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,790
are the real drivers.

352
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,250
Another big thing -- sometimes
you don't rent a similar home.

353
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,210
You'd rent a smaller home.

354
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,590
So that would be a different
type of savings.

355
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,770
And there are trade-offs
there.

356
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,380
But anyway, hopefully you'll
find this model useful.

357
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,240
I think it should be.

358
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,020
People, this is the biggest
investment of their life.

359
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,290
They should do serious analysis
when they think about

360
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,270
how they want approach it.

361
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,810
And I'd like to think
that this is

362
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,180
fairly serious analysis.

363
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,540
This is about as serious
as you can get.

364
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,450
So enjoy!

365
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,250
See you in the next video.
