1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,890
We're on problem 73.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,700
How much did a certain telephone call cost? All right.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,380
Well, we know nothing so far. Statement one.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,030
The call lasted 53 minutes.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,120
Well, unless they tell us how much it costs per minute,

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,060
that still doesn't tell us how much the call costs.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,790
Statement two tells us the cost for the first 3 minutes

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,790
was 5 times the cost for each additional minute.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,000
But that still doesn't help us.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,620
The cost for the first 3 minutes might have been $0.05 a

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,080
minute,and then we might have been $0.01 a minute after that.

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,670
Or it could have been $0.10 a minute,and then--or let me make

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,070
it a multiple of 3--$0.12 a minute,and then $0.04 after that.

14
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,010
Both of these satisfy that statement. And actually,

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,240
if I have to be honest, this statement is slightly ambiguous.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,690
Because they're saying the cost for the first 3 minutes.

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,830
Do they mean that the total cost for the first 3 minutes

18
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,920
was 5 times each additional minute?

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,870
Or was it the cost per minute of the first 3 minutes was 5

20
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,870
times additional minutes?

21
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,710
Well, either way, both statements combined don't help us,

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,120
because we're not able to figure out the cost per minute,

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,050
so that we could apply it to this. So they are both useless.

24
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:36,800
74. In a certain office, 50% of the employees are

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,520
college graduates. So let's say 50% college. I'll call it C.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,920
Or I could say 50% of the employees are college graduate,

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,950
right? 60% of the employees are over 40 years old.

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,710
So it says 60% of the employees equal,

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,020
we'll call it O for over 40.

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,010
I don't know where this is going, I'm just making up numbers.

31
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:14,030
And it said if 30% of those over 40 have Master's degrees,

32
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:20,260
how many of the employees over 40 have Master's degrees? OK.

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:30,020
So 30% of the over 40 have Master's degrees.

34
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,470
I don't know, I'm just trying to make up some notation.

35
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,100
How many of the employees over 40 have Master's degrees?

36
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,020
So we're actually trying to come up with this number.

37
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,030
So if we knew how many employees over 40 there were,

38
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,230
we would be set, because we'd just multiply 30% times that.

39
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,870
If we knew how many employees there were,we would be all set,

40
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,510
because we could figure out the number over 40 and

41
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,000
then multiply 30% times that.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,020
So let's see what they give us. Statement one.

43
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,310
Exactly 100 of the employees are college graduates.

44
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,430
So essentially, C is equal to 100, right?

45
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,580
And they told us that 50% of the employees

46
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,740
are college graduates.

47
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,020
So that means how many total employees are there?

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,020
That means that there are 200 employees. 100 is 50% of 200.

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,360
So that told us there are 200 employees.

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,080
If there are 200 employees,

51
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,470
how many employees over 40 are there? Well, that's O, right?

52
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,790
O for over 40. Well, that's just 60% of 200. That's 120.

53
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,760
And then how many over 40 with Master's degrees?

54
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,830
Let's call that OMD.

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,190
How many of these are there? Over 40 with Master's degrees.

56
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,010
Well, that's 30% of over 40, so that's 30%-- this is an O--

57
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,340
this is 30% of this, which is equal to-- so over 40 with

58
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,550
Master's degrees is equal to 36. And we would be done.

59
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,070
So statement one alone is sufficient.

60
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,660
I should call it over 40 instead of a 0.

61
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,720
Don't want to get confused. Over 40 with Mater's degrees.

62
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:11,000
So statement two. Of the employees 40 years old or less,

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,640
25% have Master's degrees.

64
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,020
So that doesn't tell us anything, really.

65
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,530
It doesn't tell us how many employees there are over 40,

66
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,880
which was one of the things

67
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,020
that we realized we have to figure out.

68
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,390
It doesn't help us figure out how many total employees there

69
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,310
are, so we really can't do this type of logic.

70
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,070
So it seems fairly useless.

71
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,440
So yeah, employees 40 years old or less. 25% of-- no.

72
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,020
This is a useless piece of information.

73
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,820
So the answer is--what is that? I always forget. A.

74
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:53,080
Statement alone is sufficient and statement 2 is useless. 75.

75
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,900
They ask is rst equal to 1?

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,010
Statement one tells us that rs is equal to 1.

77
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,200
This by itself doesn't help us, right?

78
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,680
If rs is equal to 1, the only way that this whole thing is

79
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,620
going to be equal to 1 is if t is also equal 1.

80
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,370
But we don't know that, so-- I mean, t could be equal to 10.

81
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,760
So statement one alone doesn't help us.

82
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,030
Statement two tells us,st is equal to 1.

83
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,860
Well, I can show that even if we have both of these

84
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,750
statements, that we still can't prove this.

85
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,360
For example, I can come up with a scenario that meets

86
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,640
both statements where this is true.

87
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,240
Because I can say what if r is equal to 1, s is equal to 1,

88
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,060
and t is equal to 1?

89
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,740
Then we can make both of these statements true.

90
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,780
So then, definitely, rst is equal to 1.

91
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,060
But let me see if I can construct something where this

92
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:04,000
doesn't hold up. So what if r is equal to 6.

93
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,080
s is equal to 1/6, and then t is equal to 6.

94
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,640
So then r times s would still be equal to 1, right?

95
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,540
s times t would still be equal to 1. But what is rst now?

96
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,380
It's 6 times 1/6, times 6, which is equal to 6.

97
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,170
So I can satisfy both of these, but still end up not

98
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,390
knowing whether it equals 1 or something different.

99
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,390
I just picked this arbitrarily.

100
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,470
You can actually kind of pick an arbitrary number here and

101
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,980
set this up. So anyway, this is E. I think that's E, right?

102
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,000
Both statements combined are useless. Right.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,440
They're not sufficient. Next problem.

104
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,430
Turn the page. It's problem 76.

105
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,240
And they've drawn a nice pie chart for us,

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,100
which I'll reproduce.

107
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,010
76. Total expenses for the 5 divisions of company h.

108
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,870
Let me draw this pie chart.

109
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,160
OK. And then they have a bunch of-- let's see,

110
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,850
how many pies are there? There are 5 pies.

111
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,790
I'll try to draw it the way they do it. So that's one.

112
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,060
Two.

113
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,000
Three. And they have one more. There we go.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So that looks pretty close to what they've drawn.

115
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:40,030
And then they write, this is Q, R, S, T, and P.

116
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,820
O is the center. They call this angle, x. Fair enough.

117
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,200
So this is the total expenses for the 5 divisions.

118
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,560
So each of these are divisions for company h.

119
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,800
76. The figure above represents a circle graph of company h's

120
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,260
totally expenses broken down by the expenses for each of

121
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,170
it's 5 divisions.

122
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,100
If O is the center of the circle-- fair enough,

123
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,240
so this is the center, although I didn't draw it quite at the

124
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,830
center-- if O is the center of the circle, and if company h's

125
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,250
total expenses are $5.4 million, what are the expenses

126
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,240
for division R?

127
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,000
So the whole thing is $5.4 million.

128
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,740
So the whole pie is $5.4 million.

129
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,490
And we need to figure out what R is equal to.

130
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,430
So the whole expenses are 360 degrees.

131
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,510
So whatever fraction x is of 360 degrees, that's going to

132
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,020
be the fraction that R is of the total expenses.

133
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,950
So let's see if they give us that.

134
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,770
If we can figure out what angle x is. One, x is equal to 94.

135
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,560
Well, we're done.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,020
Because x over the total degrees in the circle--

137
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,140
so 94 over 360 degrees-- that's going to be equal to the

138
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,620
expenses of division R divided by the total expenses,

139
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,460
$5.4 million. And this is a trivial equation to solve.

140
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,030
So one alone is sufficient.

141
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,010
Let's see what they give us for statement number two.

142
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,170
The total expenses for divisions S and T are twice

143
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,010
as much as the expenses for division R.

144
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:23,300
So they're saying that this right here is twice as much as

145
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,070
what we're trying to figure out. It's this right here.

146
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,650
Well, that doesn't help us much, because P and Q could be

147
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,230
arbitrarily small or large.

148
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,560
These two combined could be $2 and this could be $1, right?

149
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,190
In which case,

150
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,410
P and Q are the bulk of the expenses for the company.

151
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,100
Or maybe these two are $4 and R is $2,which are all possible.

152
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,530
And these would represent the rest of the-- whatever.
