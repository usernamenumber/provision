1
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:06,102
The Parthenon is a Doric temple --

2
00:00:06,102 --> 00:00:08,804
that's its architectural style.

3
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:11,492
And one of the things that defines a Doric temple

4
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:14,180
is that it has triglyphs.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,792
And in between the triglyphs, are metopes.

6
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:20,371
I love those words, triglyphs and metopes.

7
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:22,672
So, triglyphs just mean sort of a mark of three

8
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:25,245
and it's a little three lines. -- A kind of ridges.

9
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:26,899
Mhm, exactly. And in between,

10
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,408
these squares with really deep relief carving,

11
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:32,271
they're about five feet square.

12
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:36,344
These would have been in an area right above where the capitals are.

13
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:38,141
That's right, and below the pediment.

14
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,683
And the metopes that we're looking at

15
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:44,220
depict a battle between the Lapiths and the Centaurs.

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,921
And I think we'd better talk about

17
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,499
who they were and why they were fighting.

18
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:51,108
This is a story that would have been a kind of mythic story

19
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:54,188
even for the fifth century Greeks, who were depicting them.

20
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:58,211
And the story tells of a wedding, a Lapith wedding.

21
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:01,038
Now the Lapiths were a tribe of Ancient Greeks

22
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:03,762
and they lived near the forest.

23
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:06,871
Now, in the forest, were these creatures

24
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,629
that were only sort of half human--

25
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:11,220
the Centaurs, half human half horse.

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,979
And the Greeks would have looked at them as kind of monstrous creatures.

27
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:18,772
You know, for the Greeks, there was a whole hierarchy of kinds of beings.

28
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:21,546
The gods at the top, then there were heroes,

29
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:25,611
and heroes were the result of a union between a god and a human,

30
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:27,791
and then, of course, there were humans themselves.

31
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:30,602
And then, below that, there were these sub-humans or monsters, and the centaurs were certainly that.

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,427
So, they were not quite human, still part of the animal world.

33
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:38,929
And not entirely to be trusted.

34
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:42,254
Nevertheless, the Lapiths were feeling extremely generous

35
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:44,199
and really wanted to celebrate this wedding.

36
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:47,491
And so, they invited the Centaurs to the wedding.

37
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:49,660
That was a big mistake. It was a big mistake.

38
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,580
They had a little bit too much to drink, didn't they?

39
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,591
They did, and they (the centaurs) took advantage.

40
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,900
In fact, what they did is[was], all at once,

41
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,882
they began to abduct the Lapith women.

42
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:02,909
So, what's being depicted is the Lapith women being made off with,

43
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,239
and the Lapith males fighting with the Centaurs,

44
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,107
who are really quite formidable --

45
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:11,203
not only do they have six limbs,

46
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:14,868
but you know they have all of the brute strength of a wild animal.

47
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:20,243
The one we are looking at is of a lapith struggling against a centaur.

48
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:23,452
It looks like he's grabbing him by the neck and pulling him.

49
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:27,049
You can just see his fingers wrapping around behind that neck,

50
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,570
even though the neck and the head itself are gone.

51
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,741
He's pulling him back, though.

52
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:33,457
Look at that -- it's almost like a bow, a spring...

53
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:36,142
You can feel the tension of that body as it's being pulled back,

54
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:37,680
and the strength of the Centaur--

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,062
that's really trying to pull away and free himself.

56
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:44,076
It looks, actually, like the Centaur is holding on with his right hand onto something,

57
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:47,208
and struggling against being pulled by the Lapith.

58
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,278
Look at the kind of composition-- it's so complicated.

59
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:52,707
You have a couple of opposing arcs:

60
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:54,461
the arc of the Lapith's body,

61
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:57,215
and then the arc of the Centaur's as well.

62
00:02:57,215 --> 00:03:00,372
Yeah, so it's almost a circular composition, in a way.

63
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:01,973
And look how deep that carving is!

64
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:02,946
It's amazing.

65
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:04,375
It's really almost freestanding.

66
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:08,811
It's actually remarkable to me that more of this did not break off than did,

67
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:11,580
because it's in such high relief it's almost freestanding.

68
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,010
And marble is really soft stone.

69
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,189
I also love the fact that those broad plains of the body

70
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:22,854
are played against the more complex sort of backdrop of the cloth.

71
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:25,789
I mean this is, in some ways, incredibly naturalistic.

72
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,784
So naturalistic that we almost believe...

73
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:29,220
-You don't notice the artifice.

74
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,634
Well, not only the artifice of the perfectly draped cloth in the background,

75
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:35,990
but, how about, the artifice of the fact

76
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,182
that we almost believe that a Centaur could exist.

77
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:43,281
In other words, it is almost a believable union of a human and a horse's body.

78
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:47,029
That's true. What's really striking to me is the way

79
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:51,538
our eye is drawn to the anatomical structure of the Lapith's body.

80
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:53,446
In the chest, in the ribcage,

81
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:56,958
and the abdominal muscles, the pectoral muscles.

82
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:02,471
And those same structures in the body of the Centaur,

83
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:05,262
you can see its ribcage and veins.

84
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:09,116
So, there's a kind of mirroring of these figures.

85
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,132
There is a kind of mirroring. I think that is exactly right.

86
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:13,015
But there's also a kind of subtle distinction,

87
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:17,859
which is that the tension that the artist has constructed

88
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:20,205
because of the bowing of the Centaur's body

89
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:24,850
is not seen in the exertion of the Lapith.

90
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,342
In other words, look at the Lapith,

91
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:30,222
even though he is exerting tremendous power to pull back this horse,

92
00:04:30,222 --> 00:04:32,363
the Centaur. -- He's in control.

93
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:34,519
He is in total control, total balance.

94
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,047
And in fact, the body is almost relaxed,

95
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:41,265
remains almost completely sort of perfectly noble and perfectly balanced,

96
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:43,334
even within this battle.

97
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:44,956
Look at the difference in the way

98
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:48,988
that the Centaur and the Lapith's heads, their faces, are represented.

99
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,942
First of all, you've got the sense of age.

100
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:56,037
You've got the beautiful noble face of the Greek, of the Lapith.

101
00:04:56,037 --> 00:04:58,927
And even as his neck is being crushed,

102
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:00,986
even as he is being choked,

103
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:03,617
there is a sense of rest and nobility,

104
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:06,340
there is no anguish in that face whatsoever.

105
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:12,571
In contrast, we have this gnarled, bearded, long-haired, older figure,

106
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:16,908
with a kind of knit brow, a kind of wild open eye,

107
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:19,312
and with a kind of broken nose,

108
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:21,897
all of which is looking rough and pretty much

109
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:26,934
not the kind of noble mien that the Greeks give themselves.

110
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:30,756
It's almost as though the human has superhuman strength,

111
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:34,050
and doesn't need to draw on the brute physicality

112
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,113
that the Centaur has to draw on.

113
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:37,453
Well, I think that the Greeks were making a real distinction.

114
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:41,275
They were noble and they were distinguishing themselves

115
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,729
from the brutish barbarians beyond their borders.

116
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:47,722
In fact, a lot of our historians look at this

117
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,401
and say that the Lapiths are, in fact, the Greeks. Of course.

118
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:54,095
But the Centaurs are those that are not Greek.

119
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:56,409
And the Greeks themselves were looking towards

120
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,706
for instance, the Persians, their great enemy,

121
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:00,772
with real fear as barbarians,

122
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:03,452
as kind of almost animals, as almost centaurs.

123
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:05,543
Representing a kind of chaos.

124
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:08,517
And, in fact, this art really represents, through its balance,

125
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:10,939
through its perfections, through this kind of idealism,

126
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:13,562
that sense of control that was so important to the Greeks.

127
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:17,712
It's no wonder that for so many hundreds of years after this, thousands of years,

128
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,729
we have looked back to this moment as this

129
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,391
sort of extraordinary, and precious, and rare moment.

130
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,283
Not only because it was a moment of limited democracy,

131
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:27,859
but of the first democracy,

132
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:30,939
but it was a moment when the mind and the body

133
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,042
were both cherished and seen as extraordinary and beautiful.
