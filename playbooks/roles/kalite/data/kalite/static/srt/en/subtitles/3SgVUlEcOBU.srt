1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
Start

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,520
In the last video, we figured
out what is the present value

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,380
of these three different
payment timing choices.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,650
If we had a 5% risk-free rate,
and if these payments were

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,080
risk-free, instead of coming
from -- you can almost view

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,440
them as some type of government
program, where

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,000
they're asking you to choose
which of these three payment

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,060
streams from the government
do you want?

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,860
And so we'll use the same rate
that the government would pay

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,190
you, if you lent them money.

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,680
And that's given by
the treasury rate.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,760
And in the first case we assumed
a 5% treasury rate.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,430
And if you watched the first
present value video, I think

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,470
you understand why compounding
going forward is the same

15
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,100
thing as discounting that
rate by going backwards.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,350
If you want to know how much
$100 is a year from now, you

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:54,220
multiply that times one plus
the interest rate, right?

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,060
So if it's 5%, you multiply
that times 1.05.

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,770
If you're taking $110 and
going a year back,

20
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,350
you divide by 1.05.

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,520
So it's just the
same operation.

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,920
You're just going
forward or back.

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,240
Forward is multiplication,
backwards is division.

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,420
But anyway, the result that we
got in the last video is that

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,730
the present value -- let me do
this in a different color.

26
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,200
And I'll introduce
my notation.

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,240
The present value, if we assume
a 5% rate, no matter

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,110
how long-- how far away the
money is given to you.

29
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,610
And you'll see what I mean
because I'll change that

30
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,720
assumption in a second.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,230
But if we assume that the
risk-free rate is 5%, then the

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,490
present value of $100 today,
well that was just $100.

33
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:48,360
$110 in two years, we got that
by doing 110 divided by 1.05

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,230
squared, right?

35
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,710
You divide by 1.05 there, and
then you divide by 1.05 again.

36
00:01:53,710 --> 00:02:01,340
And then you get $99.77.

37
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,640
I don't want to run out
of too much space.

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,840
I could have probably done
this whole thing

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,470
a little bit bigger.

40
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,060
And then choice number three.

41
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,860
How did we get that?

42
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,320
Well, we said -- let me do that
in a different color.

43
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,850
That was the present value of
the $20 today, plus $50 in one

44
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,240
year, divided by that,
discounted to the present day.

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:31,460
So divided by 1.05 plus $35
divided by 1.05 squared.

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,380
And we had gotten $99.36.

47
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,100
And that's what that should be
worth to you today, if you

48
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,910
assume that these payments are
risk-free, and you use a 5%

49
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,480
discount rate.

50
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,380
Fair enough.

51
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,050
And based on these calculations,
choice number

52
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,390
one was the best, choice number
two was second best,

53
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,230
choice number three was third
best. Fair enough.

54
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,020
Now what happens -- after I pose
the question, you might

55
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,790
want to think about it before I
show you the answer -- what

56
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,720
happens if I don't assume
a 5% discount rate?

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,670
What happens if I assume
a 2% discount rate?

58
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,600
This is just my notation.

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,490
What is the present value of
these if I assume a 2%

60
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,020
risk-free rate, or a
2% discount rate?

61
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,180
Well $100, I'm getting
that today, so

62
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,620
that's still worth $100.

63
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,200
You could even do that as --
let me do that in a more

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,110
vibrant color -- as 100 divided
by 1.02 to the 0

65
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,170
power, because we're
getting it today.

66
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,080
But that's just 1.02 divided
by 1, which is just $100.

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,740
$100 today.

68
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,490
What's the present value?

69
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,140
It's $100.

70
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,100
Now what's the $110 two years
out going to be worth?

71
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
So this is interesting.

72
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,260
When the interest rate goes
down, from 5% to 2%, I'm going

73
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,450
to be dividing by a
smaller number.

74
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,630
1.02 squared is a smaller number
than 1.05 squared.

75
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,020
So the present value of this
payment should go up.

76
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,610
Interesting.

77
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,680
This is something to keep in
mind for later, when we start

78
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,140
thinking about bonds.

79
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,750
When you lower the interest
rate, the present value of

80
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,490
this future payment goes up.

81
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,840
And it just falls
out of the math.

82
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,190
You're discounting by
a smaller number.

83
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,720
Let's figure out what that is.

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,600
So if I take $110 and I divide
it by 1.02 squared, right?

85
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,580
Discounted twice.

86
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:32,390
I get $105.72.

87
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,380
Oh, and how did I get that?

88
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,780
That was equal to -- I'm doing
it in reverse here -- that was

89
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,390
equal to 110 divided
by 1.02 squared.

90
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,470
And our intuition was correct.

91
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,160
Just by the interest rate
going from 5% to 2%, the

92
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,350
present value of this payment
two years out -- it's in year

93
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,330
three, but it's two years out.

94
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,460
Actually I should
re-label this.

95
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,610
I should call this
now, the present.

96
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,550
I should call this year one.

97
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,250
I was calling this year
two, one year out.

98
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,250
But I think that makes
it confusing.

99
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,720
I called this year two,
so this is now.

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,260
So you could call
this year zero.

101
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,530
This is year one.

102
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,820
And this is year two.

103
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,410
Anyway.

104
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,940
The present value of this is --
it increased by $6 just by

105
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,430
the discount rate going
down by 3%.

106
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,050
Fascinating.

107
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,370
Now let's see what happens
to choice number three.

108
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,640
Choice number three, the $20
today, the $20 now, well

109
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,892
that's just worth $20.

110
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:38,520
Its present value is 20 plus 50
divided by 1.02, plus the

111
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,840
35 divided by 1.02 squared.

112
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,090
Let's see what this adds up.

113
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,100
   

114
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:58,130
20 plus 50 divided
by 1.02 plus 35

115
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,800
divided by 1.02 squared.

116
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:11,200
$102.66.

117
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,010
Now there's a couple of really
interesting things.

118
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,920
And this is a really good time
to kind of let it all sink in.

119
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,760
All of a sudden we lowered
the interest rate.

120
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,880
And now choice number two is the
best, followed by choice

121
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,580
number three, followed
by choice number one.

122
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,110
So it almost -- choice number
one was the best when we had a

123
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,730
5% discount rate.

124
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,850
Now at a 2% discount rate,
choice number two is all of a

125
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,840
sudden the best.

126
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,730
And there's something else
interesting here.

127
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,710
Choice number two improved by a
lot more when we lowered the

128
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,500
interest rate, than choice
number three did.

129
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,130
Its present value went from
$99.77 to $105.70,

130
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,770
so it's almost $6.

131
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,320
While here it only improved
by less than $3, right?

132
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,160
So why is that?

133
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,130
Well, when you lower the
interest rate, the terms that

134
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,150
are using that discount rate the
most, benefit the most. So

135
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,340
all of this payment was
two years out, right?

136
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,760
So it benefited the most by
decreasing the discount rate,

137
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,100
the 1.02 squared.

138
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,130
It changed this value
the most.

139
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,770
These payments are spread out.

140
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,850
Only some of its payment
is two years out.

141
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,040
Then some of its payment is one
year out, and that's going

142
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,820
to benefit less.

143
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,460
And then some of its
payment is today.

144
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,600
So it will benefit, because you
are discounting some of

145
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,610
the cash payments.

146
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,520
But it's going to
benefit by less.

147
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,690
Anyway, I'll leave you
there in this video.

148
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,700
And in the next video, we're
going to see what happens when

149
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,450
we have different discount
rates for

150
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,560
different amounts of time.

151
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,540
See you in the next video.

152
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,520
End

153
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,500
