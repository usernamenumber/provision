1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170
   

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,160
In this video, we're going to
learn how to rationalize the

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,410
denominator.

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,440
   

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,610
What we mean by that is, let's
say we have a fraction that

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,570
has a non-rational denominator,
the simplest one

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,400
I can think of is 1 over
the square root of 2.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,440
So to rationalize this
denominator, we're going to

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,910
just re-represent this number in
some way that does not have

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,630
an irrational number
in the denominator.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,350
Now the first question
you might ask is,

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,710
Sal, why do we care?

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,160
Why must we rationalize
denominators?

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,030
And you don't have to
rationalize them.

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,260
But I think the reason why
this is in many algebra

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,230
classes and why many teachers
want you to, is it gets the

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,270
numbers into a common format.

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,150
And I also think, I've been
told that back in the day

19
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,360
before we had calculators that
some forms of computation,

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,170
people found it easier to have
a rational number in the

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,600
denominator.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,200
I don't know if that's
true or not.

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,070
And then, the other reason
is just for aesthetics.

24
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,430
Some people say, I don't
like saying what 1

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,640
square root of 2 is.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,180
I don't even know.

27
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,900
You know, I want to how
big the pie is.

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,330
I want a denominator to
be a rational number.

29
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,420
So with that said, let's learn
how to rationalize it.

30
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,260
So the simple way, if you just
have a simple irrational

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,030
number in the denominator just
like that, you can just

32
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,490
multiply the numerator and the
denominator by that irrational

33
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,100
number over that irrational
number.

34
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,670
Now this is clearly just 1.

35
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,610
Anything over anything or
anything over that same thing

36
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,410
is going to be 1.

37
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,480
So we're not fundamentally
changing the number.

38
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,610
We're just changing how
we represent it.

39
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,470
So what's this going
to be equal to?

40
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,170
The numerator is going to be 1
times the square root of 2,

41
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,620
which is the square root of 2.

42
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,230
The denominator is going to be
the square root of 2 times the

43
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,640
square root of 2.

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,180
Well the square root of
2 times the square

45
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,130
root of 2 is 2.

46
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,460
That is 2.

47
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,180
By definition, this squared
must be equal to 2.

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,030
And we are squaring it.

49
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,400
We're multiplying
it by itself.

50
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,630
So that is equal to 2.

51
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,690
We have rationalized
the denominator.

52
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,950
We haven't gotten rid of the
radical sign, but we've

53
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,680
brought it to the numerator.

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,120
And now in the denominator we
have a rational number.

55
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,610
And you could say, hey, now I
have square root of 2 halves.

56
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,860
It's easier to say even,
so maybe that's another

57
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,370
justification for rationalizing
this

58
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,840
denominator.

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,040
Let's do a couple
more examples.

60
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,750
Let's say I had 7 over the
square root of 15.

61
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,320
So the first thing I'd want to
do is just simplify this

62
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,930
radical right here.

63
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,250
Let's see.

64
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:32,920
Square root of 15.

65
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,530
15 is 3 times 5.

66
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,570
Neither of those are
perfect squares.

67
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,310
So actually, this is about as
simple as I'm going to get.

68
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,770
So just like we did here, let's
multiply this times the

69
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,490
square root of 15 over the
square root of 15.

70
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,720
And so this is going to be equal
to 7 times the square

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
root of 15.

72
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,590
Just multiply the numerators.

73
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,690
Over square root of 15 times
the square root of 15.

74
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,590
That's 15.

75
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,020
So once again, we have
rationalized the denominator.

76
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,350
This is now a rational number.

77
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,840
We essentially got the radical
up on the top or we got the

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,510
irrational number up
on the numerator.

79
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,190
We haven't changed the number,
we just changed how we are

80
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,700
representing it.

81
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,920
Now, let's take it up
one more level.

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,900
What happens if we have
something like 12 over 2 minus

83
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,080
the square root of 5?

84
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,940
So in this situation, we
actually have a binomial in

85
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,460
the denominator.

86
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,950
And this binomial contains
an irrational number.

87
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,000
I can't do the trick here.

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,230
If I multiplied this by square
root of 5 over square root of

89
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,380
5, I'm still going to have an
irrational denominator.

90
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,460
Let me just show you.

91
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,210
Just to show you
it won't work.

92
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,720
If I multiplied this square root
of 5 over square root of

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,730
5, the numerator is going
to be 12 times the

94
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,300
square root of 5.

95
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,170
The denominator, we have
to distribute this.

96
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,670
It's going to be 2 times the
square root of 5 minus the

97
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,820
square root of 5 times the
square root of 5, which is 5.

98
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,180
So you see, in this situation,
it didn't help us.

99
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,570
Because the square root of 5,
although this part became

100
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,110
rational,it became a 5, this
part became irrational.

101
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,900
2 times the square root of 5.

102
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,370
So this is not what you want
to do where you have a

103
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,120
binomial that contains an
irrational number in the

104
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,780
denominator.

105
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,019
What you do here is use our
skills when it comes to

106
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,170
difference of squares.

107
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,209
So let's just take a
little side here.

108
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,470
We learned a long time ago--
well, not that long ago.

109
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,570
If you had 2 minus the square
root of 5 and you multiply

110
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,900
that by 2 plus the square root
of 5, what will this get you?

111
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,670
Now you might remember.

112
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,630
And if you don't recognize this
immediately, this is the

113
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,790
exact same pattern as a minus
b times a plus b.

114
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,290
   

115
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,040
Which we've seen several
videos ago is a

116
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,770
squared minus b squared.

117
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,470
Little bit of review.

118
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,900
This is a times a, which
is a squared. a

119
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,430
times b, which is ab.

120
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,630
Minus b times a, which
is minus ab.

121
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,840
And then, negative b
times a positive

122
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,150
b, negative b squared.

123
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,070
These cancel out and you're
just left with a

124
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,980
squared minus b squared.

125
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,710
So 2 minus the square root of 5
times 2 plus the square root

126
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:22,480
of 5 is going to be equal to
2 squared, which is 4.

127
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,260
Let me write it that way.

128
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,920
It's going to be equal to 2
squared minus the square root

129
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,690
of 5 squared, which is just 5.

130
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,345
So this would just be equal to
4 minus 5 or negative 1.

131
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:36,920
   

132
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,520
If you take advantage of the
difference of squares of

133
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,080
binomials, or the factoring
difference of squares, however

134
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,920
you want to view it, then
you can rationalize this

135
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,240
denominator.

136
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,840
So let's do that.

137
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,750
Let me rewrite the problem.

138
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,280
12 over 2 minus the
square root of 5.

139
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,810
In this situation, I just
multiply the numerator and the

140
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:02,270
denominator by 2 plus the square
root of 5 over 2 plus

141
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,600
the square root of 5.

142
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,580
Once again, I'm just multiplying
the number by 1.

143
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,960
So I'm not changing the
fundamental number.

144
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,020
I'm just changing how
we represent it.

145
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,780
So the numerator is
going to become 12

146
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,010
times 2, which is 24.

147
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,125
Plus 12 times the square
root of 5.

148
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:22,640
   

149
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,470
Once again, this is
like a factored

150
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,560
difference of squares.

151
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,200
This is going to be equal to 2
squared, which is going to be

152
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,450
exactly equal to that.

153
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,330
Which is 4 minus 1, or we
could just-- sorry.

154
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,040
4 minus 5.

155
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,750
It's 2 squared minus square
root of 5 squared.

156
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,610
So it's 4 minus 5.

157
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,720
Or we could just write that
as minus 1, or negative 1.

158
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,900
Or we could put a 1
there and put a

159
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,590
negative sign out in front.

160
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,720
And then, no point in even
putting a 1 in the

161
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,170
denominator.

162
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:57,120
We could just say that this is
equal to negative 24 minus 12

163
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,140
square roots of 5.

164
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,250
So this case, it kind of did
simplify it as well.

165
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,930
It wasn't just for the sake
of rationalizing it.

166
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,770
It actually made it look
a little bit better.

167
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,490
And you know, I don't if I
mentioned in the beginning,

168
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,540
this is good because
it's not obvious.

169
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,190
If you and I are both trying to
build a rocket and you get

170
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,200
this as your answer and I get
this as my answer, this isn't

171
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,260
obvious, at least to me just by
looking at it, that they're

172
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,500
the same number.

173
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,450
But if we agree to always
rationalize our denominators,

174
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,380
we're like, oh great.

175
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,450
We got the same number.

176
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,320
Now we're ready to send
our rocket to Mars.

177
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,910
Let's do one more of this, one
more of these right here.

178
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:39,780
   

179
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,900
Let's do one with
variables in it.

180
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:48,060
So let's say we have 5y over
2 times the square

181
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,700
root of y minus 5.

182
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,530
So we're going to do this
exact same process.

183
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,640
We have a binomial with an
irrational denominator.

184
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,690
It might be a rational.

185
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,920
We don't know what y is.

186
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,020
But y can take on any value, so
at points it's going to be

187
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,570
irrational.

188
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,270
So we really just don't want a
radical in the denominator.

189
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,050
So what is this going
to be equal to?

190
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,180
Well, let's just multiply the
numerator and the denominator

191
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,780
by 2 square roots of y
plus 5 over 2 square

192
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,100
roots of y plus 5.

193
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,150
This is just 1.

194
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,690
We are not changing the
number, we're just

195
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,860
multiplying it by 1.

196
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,260
So let's start with
the denominator.

197
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,570
What is the denominator
going to be equal to?

198
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,940
The denominator is going to
be equal to this squared.

199
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,409
Once again, just a difference
of squares.

200
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,880
It's going to be 2 times
the square root of y

201
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,830
squared minus 5 squared.

202
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,630
If you factor this, you would
get 2 square roots of y plus 5

203
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,630
times 2 square roots
of y minus 5.

204
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,440
This is a difference
of squares.

205
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,770
And then our numerator is 5y
times 2 square roots of y.

206
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,360
So it would be 10.

207
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,330
And this is y to the first
power, this is

208
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,080
y to the half power.

209
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,370
We could write y square
roots of y.

210
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,430
10y square roots of y.

211
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,380
Or we could write this as y to
the 3/2 power or 1 and 1/2

212
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,300
power, however you
want to view it.

213
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,820
And then finally, 5y times
5 is plus 25y.

214
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,550
And we can simplify
this further.

215
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,250
So what is our denominator
going to be equal to?

216
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,490
We're going to have 2
squared, which is 4.

217
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,410
Square root of y squared is y.

218
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,800
4y.

219
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,870
And then minus 25.

220
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:40,140
And our numerator over here is--
We could even write this.

221
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,690
We could keep it exactly the
way we've written it here.

222
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,600
We could factor out a y.

223
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,840
There's all sorts of things
we could do it.

224
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,540
But just to keep things simple,
we could just leave

225
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,340
that as 10.

226
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,100
Let me just write
it different.

227
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,520
I could write that as this is
y to the first, this is y to

228
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,970
the 1/2 power.

229
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,200
I could write that as even
a y to the 3/2 if I want.

230
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,240
I could write that as y to
the 1 and 1/2 if I want.

231
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,650
Or I could write that as 10y
times the square root of y.

232
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,900
All of those are equivalent.

233
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,010
   

234
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,080
Plus 25y.

235
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,990
Anyway, hopefully you found
this rationalizing the

236
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,110
denominator interesting.

237
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,266
