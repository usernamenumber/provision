1
00:00:00,825 --> 00:00:01,975
Simplify 25 a to the third

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,933
and a to the third is being raised to the third power, times b squared

3
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:09,723
and all of that over 5 a squared, b times b squared

4
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:12,698
So we can do this in multiple ways, simplify different parts.

5
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:16,262
What I want to do is simplify this part right over here.

6
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:18,990
a to the third power, and we're raising that to the third power.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,871
So this is going to be from the power property of exponents, or the power rule

8
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:27,489
this is going to be the same thing as a to the 3 times 3 power

9
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:30,082
So this over here (let me scroll up a little bit)

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:36,456
is going to be equal to a the 3 times 3 power, or a to the ninth power.

11
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:41,329
We could also simplify this b times b squared over here.

12
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,415
This b times b squared, that is the same thing as b to the first power

13
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:49,271
remember, b is just b to the first power. So it's b to the first power times

14
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:53,606
b to the second power. So b to the first times b to the second power

15
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:59,375
is just equal to b to the one plus two power, which is equal to b to the third power

16
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:04,102
and then last thing we could simplify, just right off the bat just looking at this:

17
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:08,195
we have a 25 divided by 5. Well that's just going to give us 5.

18
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:10,790
or we could say it's going to give us 5 over 1

19
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,918
if you view it as dividing the numerator and the denominator both by 5.

20
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:17,082
So what does our expression simiply to?

21
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:25,667
We have 5a to the ninth, and then we still have this b squared here, b squared.

22
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:35,200
All of that over a squared times b to the third power... times b to the third power.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,887
Now, we can use the quotient property of exponents.

24
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:38,395
You have an a to the ninth

25
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:43,621
Let me use a slightly different color. We have an a to the ninth.

26
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:47,733
over a squared. What's that going to simplify to?

27
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,302
Well, that's going to simplify to be the same thing,

28
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:49,818
let me write this

29
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:56,677
a to the ninth over a squared, the same thing as a to the nine minus two, which is equal to

30
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:59,031
a to the seventh power.

31
00:01:59,031 --> 00:01:59,975
Now we also have

32
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:02,036
and this will get a little bit interesting here

33
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:05,025
We have a b squared over b to the third power

34
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,867
So that simplifies too.

35
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:10,118
So b squared over b to the third is equal to

36
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:12,975
b to the two minus three power, which is equal to

37
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:13,513
b to the negative one power.

38
00:02:13,944 --> 00:02:16,631
And we'll leave it alone like that right now.

39
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:18,790
So this whole expression simplifies to

40
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:27,810
It simplifies to: 5 times a to the seventh power (because this simplifies to a to the seventh)

41
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:33,092
a to the seventh, times (the bs right here simplify too)

42
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:36,600
b to the negative one.

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,979
We could leave it like that, you know, that's pretty simple

44
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,215
but we may not want a negative exponent there

45
00:02:41,215 --> 00:02:45,421
we just have to remeber that b to the negative one power is the same thing as

46
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:48,779
one over b. Now if we remember that, then we can rewrite this

47
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:52,036
entire expression as, the numerator will have a five

48
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:54,913
and will have a to the seventh

49
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:58,692
5 a to the seventh. And then the denominator will have the b.

50
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:02,179
So we're multiplying this times one over b.

51
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:04,523
That's the same thing as b to the negative one.

52
00:03:04,523 --> 99:59:59,999
And we are done!
