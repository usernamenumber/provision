1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,280
Let's do one more Gram-Schmidt
example.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,880
So let's say I have the subspace
V that is spanned by

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,190
the vectors-- let's say we're
dealing in R4, so the first

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,480
vector is 0, 0, 1, 1.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,450
The second vector
is 0, 1, 1, 0.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,120
And then a third vector-- so
it's a three-dimensional

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,940
subspace of R4-- it's 1, 1,
0, 0, just like that,

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,260
three-dimensional
subspace of R4.

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,780
And what we want to do, we want
to find an orthonormal

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,030
basis for V.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,070
So we want to substitute these
guys with three other vectors

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,560
that are orthogonal with
respect to each other

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,960
and have length 1.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,700
So we do the same drill
we've done before.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,975
We can say-- let's call this
guy v1, this guy is v2, and

17
00:00:56,975 --> 00:00:59,100
let's call this guy v3.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,040
So the first thing we want to
do is replace v1-- and I'm

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,030
just picking this guy at random
because he was the

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,720
first guy on the
left-hand side.

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,110
I want to replace v1 with an
orthogonal version of v1.

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,900
So let me call u1 is equal to--
well, let me just find

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,750
out the length the v1.

24
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,440
I don't think I have to explain
too much of the theory

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:17,960
at this point.

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,900
I just want to show
another example.

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,650
So the length of v1 is equal
to the square root of 0

28
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:32,300
squared plus 0 squared plus 1
squared plus 1 squared, which

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,450
equals the square root of 2.

30
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,200
So let me define my new vector
u1 to be equal to 1 over the

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,010
length of v1, 1 over the square
root of 2, times v1,

32
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:53,080
times 0, 0, 1, 1.

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,950
And just like that, the span
of v1, v2, v3, is the same

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,040
thing is the span of
u1, v2, and v3.

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,480
So this is my first thing
that I've normalized.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,729
So I can say that V is now
equal to the span of the

37
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,490
vectors u1, v2, and v3.

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,900
Because I can replace v1 with
this guy, because this guy is

39
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,940
just a scaled-up version
of this guy.

40
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,000
So I can definitely represent
him with him, so I can

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,950
represent any linear combination
of these guys with

42
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,580
any linear combination of
those guys right there.

43
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,820
Now, we just did our
first vector.

44
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,620
We just normalized this one.

45
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,930
But we need to replace these
other vectors with vectors

46
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,760
that are orthogonal to
this guy right here.

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,850
So let's do v2 first. So let's
replace-- let's call it y2 is

48
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:51,670
equal to v2 minus the projection
of v2 onto the

49
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,530
space spanned by u1 or onto--
you know, I could call it c

50
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,020
times u1, or in the past
videos, we called that

51
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,820
subspace V1, but the space
spanned by u1.

52
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,400
And that's just going to be
equal to y2 is equal to v2,

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:18,210
which is 0, 1, 1, 0, minus-- v2
projected onto that space

54
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:26,620
is just a dot product of v2, 0,
1, 1, 0, with the spanning

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,030
vector of that space.

56
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,020
And there's only one of them,
so we're only going to have

57
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,240
one term like this with u1, so
dotted with 1 over the square

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,940
root of 2 times 0, 0, 1, 1, and
then all of that times u1.

59
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,340
So 1 over the square root of 2
times the vector 0, 0, 1, 1.

60
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,330
And so this is going
to be equal to v2,

61
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,750
which is 0, 1, 1, 0.

62
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,890
The square root of 2, let's
factor them out.

63
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,440
So then you just get-- or kind
of reassociate them out.

64
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,603
So then you get this is 1 over
the square root of 2 times 1

65
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:09,890
over the square root
of 2 is minus 1/2.

66
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,640
You times-- what's the dot
product of these two guys?

67
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,690
You get 0 times 0 plus 1 times
0, which is still 0, plus 1

68
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,160
times 1 plus 0 times 0.

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,930
So you're just going to have
times 1 times this out here:

70
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,170
0, 0, 1, 1.

71
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,735
I'll write that a little
bit neater.

72
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,450
I'm getting careless.

73
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,560
1, 1.

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:39,750
So this is just going to be
equal to 0, 1, 1, 0 minus--

75
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,380
1/2 times 0 is 0.

76
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,640
1/2 times 0 is 0.

77
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,730
Then I have two halves here.

78
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:57,740
So y2 is equal to-- let's see,
0 minus 0 is 0, 1 minus 0 is

79
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:08,940
1, 1 minus 1/2 is 1/2, and then
0 minus 1/2 is minus 1/2.

80
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:19,460
So V, we can now write as the
span of u1, y2, and v3.

81
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,520
And this is progress.

82
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,350
u1 is orthogonal, y2-- sorry,
u1 is normalized.

83
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,500
It has length 1.

84
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,700
Y2 is orthogonal to it or
they're orthogonal with

85
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,570
respect to each other, but y2
still has not been normalized.

86
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,410
So let me replace y2 with a
normalized version of it.

87
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:44,680
The length of y2 is equal to
the square root of 0 plus 1

88
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,990
squared, which is 1, plus 1/2
squared, which is 1/4, plus

89
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:54,360
minus 1/2 squared, which is
also 1/4, so plus 1/4.

90
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,650
So this is 1 and 1/2.

91
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:01,340
So it's equal to the
square root of 3/2.

92
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,610
So let me define another
vector here.

93
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:09,070
u2, which is equal to 1 over the
square root of 3/2, or we

94
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,170
could say is the square root of
2/3, I'm just inverting it.

95
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,540
It's 1 over the length of y2.

96
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,620
So I'll just find the
reciprocal, so it's the square

97
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:25,190
root 2 over 3 times y2, times
this guy right here, times 0,

98
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,930
1, 1/2, and minus 1/2.

99
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,200
And so this span is going to be
the same thing as the span

100
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,660
of u1, u2, and v3.

101
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,410
And there's our second
basis vector.

102
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,400
And we're making a
lot of progress.

103
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,870
These guys are orthogonal with
respect to each other.

104
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,990
They both have length 1.

105
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,750
We just have to do something
about v3.

106
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,470
And we do it the same way.

107
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,780
Let's find a vector that is
orthogonal to these guys, and

108
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,370
if I sum that vector to some
linear combination of these

109
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,650
guys, I'm going to get
v3, and I'm going to

110
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,650
call that vector y3.

111
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:13,230
y3 is equal to v3 minus the
projection of v3 onto the

112
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,880
subspace spanned by u1 and u2.

113
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,600
So I could call that
subspace-- let me

114
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,150
just write it here.

115
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:25,240
The span of u1 and u2, just
for notation, I'm going to

116
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,670
call it v2.

117
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,860
So it's v3, and actually,
I don't even have

118
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,380
to write that .

119
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,180
Minus the projection
of v3 onto that.

120
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,620
And what's that going to be?

121
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:43,150
That's going to be v3 dot u1
times u1, times the vector u1.

122
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:49,080
And actually let me just--
plus v3 dot u2

123
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,180
times the vector u2.

124
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,420
Since this is an orthonormal
basis, the projection onto it,

125
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,160
you just take the dot product
of v2 with each of their

126
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,780
orthonormal basis vectors and
multiply them times the

127
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,840
orthonormal basis vectors.

128
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,180
We saw that several
videos ago.

129
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,280
That's one of the neat things
about orthonormal bases.

130
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,170
So what is this going
to be equal to?

131
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,560
A little bit more computation
here.

132
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,190
y3 is equal to v3, which
was up here.

133
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,120
That's v3.

134
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,520
v3 looks like this.

135
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,820
It's 1, 1, 0, 0 minus
v3 dot u1.

136
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:32,780
So this is minus v3,
1, 1, 0, 0, dot u1.

137
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:43,309
So it's dot 1 over the square
root of 2 times 0, 0, 1, 1.

138
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:48,230
That's u1-- so that's this part
right here-- times u1, so

139
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:54,240
times 1 over the square root
of 2 times 0, 0, 1, 1.

140
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,050
This piece right there is
this piece right there.

141
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,230
And then we can distribute this
minus sign, so it's going

142
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,160
to be plus.

143
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,010
You know, we have a plus, but
there's this minus over here

144
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,685
so we put a minus v3.

145
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:06,540
Let me switch colors .

146
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:15,680
Minus v3 , which is 1, 1 0, 0
dotted with u2, dotted with

147
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:27,450
the square root of 2/3 times 0,
1, 1/2, minus 1/2 times u2,

148
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,580
times the vector u2, times the
square root of 2/3, times the

149
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,270
vector 0, 1, 1/2, minus 1/2.

150
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,480
And what do we get?

151
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,270
Let's calculate this.

152
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,570
So we could take the-- so this
is going to be equal to the

153
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:52,040
vector 1, 1, 0, 0, minus-- so
the 1 over the square root of

154
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,390
2 and the 1 over the square
root of 2, multiply them.

155
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,930
You're going to get a 1/2.

156
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,140
And then when you take the dot
product of these two, 1 times

157
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,650
0-- let's see, this is actually
all going to be, if

158
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,430
you take the dot product of all
of these, then it actually

159
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,920
gets 0, right?

160
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,150
So this guy, v3, was actually
already orthogonal to u1.

161
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,920
   

162
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,350
This will just go straight
to 0, which is nice.

163
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,030
We don't have to have
a term right there.

164
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,580
I took the dot product 1 times
0 plus 1 times 0 plus 0 times

165
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,550
1 plus 0 times 1,
all gets zeroed.

166
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,850
So this whole term drops out.

167
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,120
We can ignore it, which makes
our computation simpler.

168
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,790
And then over here we have minus
the square root of 2/3

169
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,480
times the square root of 2/3
is just 2/3 times the dot

170
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,860
product of these two guys.

171
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,730
So that's 1 times 0, which is 0,
plus 1 times 1, which is 1,

172
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,980
plus 0 times 1/2, which is 0,
plus 0 times minus 1/2, which

173
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:54,630
is 0, so we just get a 1 there,
times the vector 0, 1,

174
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,140
1/2, minus 1/2.

175
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,730
And then what do we get?

176
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:10,820
We get-- this is the home
stretch-- 1, 1, 0, 0 minus 2/3

177
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,230
times all of these guys.

178
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,940
So 2/3 time 0 is 0.

179
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,340
2/3 times 1 is 2/3.

180
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:23,870
2/3 times 1/2 is 1/3.

181
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:29,120
And then 2/3 times minus
1/2 is minus 1/3.

182
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,470
So then this is going to be
equal to 1 minus 0 is 1, 1

183
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,290
minus 2/3 is 1/3, 0 minus 1/3 is
minus 1/3, and then 0 minus

184
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,600
minus 1/3 is positive 1/3.

185
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,790
So this vector y3 is orthogonal
to these two other

186
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,800
vectors, which is nice, but it
still hasn't been normalized.

187
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,770
So we finally have to normalize
this guy, and then

188
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,210
we're done.

189
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,450
Then we have an orthonormal
basis.

190
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,690
We'll have u1, u2, and
now we'll find u3.

191
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:05,020
So the length of my vector y--
actually, let's do something

192
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,440
even better.

193
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,360
It'll simplify things
a little bit.

194
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,440
Instead of a writing
y this way, I

195
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,650
could scale up y, right?

196
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,150
All I want is a vector that's
orthogonal to the other two

197
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,870
that still spans
the same space.

198
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,650
So I can scale this guy up.

199
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,740
So I could say, I don't know,
let me call it y3-- let me

200
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,400
call it y3 prime.

201
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,900
And I'm just doing this to
ease the computation.

202
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,250
I could just scale this guy
up, multiply him by 3.

203
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,910
So what do I get?

204
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,220
I probably should have done
it some of the other ones.

205
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,870
3, 1, minus 1, and 1.

206
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,370
And so I can replace y3 with
this guy, and then I can just

207
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,440
normalize this guy.

208
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,960
It'll be a little bit easier.

209
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,540
So the length of y3 prime that I
just defined is equal to the

210
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:55,750
square root of 3 squared, which
is 9, plus 1 squared

211
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,350
plus minus 1 squared plus 1
squared, which is equal to the

212
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,500
square root of 12,
which is what?

213
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,360
That's two square roots of 3.

214
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,360
That is equal to 2 square
roots of 3, right?

215
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,260
Square root of 4 times the
square root of 3, which is two

216
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,450
square roots of 3.

217
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:16,630
So now I can to find u3 as equal
to y3 times 1 over the

218
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,790
length of y3, so it's equal to
1 over two square roots of 3

219
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,720
times the vector 3,
1, minus 1, and 1.

220
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,970
And then we're done.

221
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,020
If we have a basis, an
orthonormal basis would be

222
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,520
this guy-- let me take the other
ones down here-- and

223
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,590
these guys.

224
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:41,470
All of these form-- let me bring
it all the way down.

225
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,960
If I have a collection of these
three vectors, I now

226
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,180
have an orthonormal basis for
V, these three right there.

227
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,390
That set is an orthonormal basis
for my original subspace

228
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,010
V that I started off with.
