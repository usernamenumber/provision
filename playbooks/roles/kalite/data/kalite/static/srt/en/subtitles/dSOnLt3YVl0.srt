1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:04,333
[music]

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,295
So in the first video, we established that

3
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:09,446
Martin Luther, this professor of theology in Wittenberg,

4
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:13,107
this Augustinian monk, had posted his "Ninety-Five Theses"

5
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:17,052
on the door of the castle church in Wittenberg -

6
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:19,542
at least, this is how the tradition tells the story -

7
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:23,304
that took issue with the way in which

8
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:26,320
the Catholic Church thought about salvation.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,551
And it specifically took issue with the selling of indulgences.

10
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,302
Luther was arguing against the sale of indulgences,

11
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:36,664
and that kind of monetary transaction for getting into heaven.

12
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:39,107
Tetzel, who was selling indulgences,

13
00:00:39,107 --> 00:00:41,946
we quoted in the first video; but here's another quote:

14
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:45,314
"Won't you part with even a farthing to buy this letter?

15
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:47,132
It won't bring you money, but rather

16
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:49,045
a divine and immortal soul,

17
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:52,217
whole and secure in the Kingdom of Heaven."

18
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:53,887
We have to understand that this exists

19
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,382
within this larger scheme, and the Church thought

20
00:00:56,382 --> 00:00:58,173
that the ultimate aim was a good one.

21
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:00,309
But he sounds like a used car salesman!

22
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:03,465
So Luther, in one section of the "Ninety-Five Theses," says,

23
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:04,954
you know, people are gonna ask questions

24
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:06,781
that we can't really answer about

25
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:09,013
what we're doing with these indulgences: such as,

26
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:14,015
"Why does not the Pope empty Purgatory for the sake of holy love,

27
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,818
and the dire need of the souls that are there,

28
00:01:16,818 --> 00:01:19,047
if he redeems an infinite number of souls

29
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:21,999
for the sake of miserable money with which to buy a church?

30
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,488
The former reason would be most just,

31
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:26,048
the latter is most trivial."

32
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:29,450
So what he's saying is, if the Pope has the authority,

33
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,461
the treasury of merit of all of the saints

34
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:34,561
that he can distribute,

35
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,518
why is he selling them to build a church?

36
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:39,290
Why doesn't he just redeem the souls

37
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,339
that are in Purgatory and send them up to Heaven,

38
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:42,595
if he has the power to do that?

39
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:45,749
And there was a perception that the Church at times

40
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:47,962
was a rather corrupt institution,

41
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:51,583
that seemed to be more concerned with power

42
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,804
and political issues and worldly issues,

43
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:58,079
and not so concerned with the salvation of souls.

44
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,400
Well, the previous pope, Julius II (the Second),

45
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,046
certainly had that kind of reputation.

46
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:05,608
Right. This is a hard thing for us to realize, I think;

47
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:09,458
but at this time, the popes claimed not only spiritual power,

48
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,787
like they do today, but also political power,

49
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:16,919
and governed these very significant lands known as the Papal States.

50
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,893
And so in some ways, the pope functioned as

51
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,382
the princes of territories in Italy.

52
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:25,242
Right, Pope Julius II led armies into battles

53
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:28,135
against other Christians, to reclaim territories

54
00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:30,727
that were historically part of the Papal States.

55
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:34,112
So this notion of a kind of corruption in Rome

56
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,509
is infusing this entire discussion, this entire argument.

57
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:41,303
So, there had been other reformers before Luther,

58
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:43,296
who were not successful. For example,

59
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,141
we could look to John Wycliffe, in the 14th century.

60
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:49,471
So in the 1300's, this Englishman had set about

61
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:53,100
to translate the Bible into the vernacular,

62
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,465
into the common language - into English.

63
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:59,845
He organized the translation of the Bible into English;

64
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,817
he translated much of it himself -

65
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:03,721
- Especially much of the New Testament.

66
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:06,385
It was important to him that the Bible be available

67
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:07,771
to people in their common language,

68
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,344
that people could read it. If it's in Latin,

69
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:11,525
essentially only the priests could read it.

70
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,263
This is important for us because this idea of

71
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:16,734
enabling the reading of the Bible

72
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:19,803
was critical for Luther. And we'll get to that.

73
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:22,197
Okay. So let's just step back for a moment,

74
00:03:22,197 --> 00:03:24,221
and just remember that in Western Europe at this time,

75
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:26,805
the vast majority of the population was illiterate.

76
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:30,298
But those that could read would be reading in the vernacular,

77
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:32,677
not Latin. And by vernacular, I mean

78
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:35,765
their common languages, whether it was English,

79
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:39,887
or German, or French, or Italian, it wasn't Latin.

80
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:44,937
And this was a means that the Church could control the Word of God.

81
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:49,314
Well, it meant that you heard the Word of God through the priest,

82
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:50,693
you weren't able to read it yourself.

83
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:54,101
Wycliffe also attacked the abuses of the Church,

84
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,641
the worldliness of the Church.

85
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:58,708
After he died, he was declared a heretic.

86
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,935
His body was exhumed, it was burned;

87
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:04,719
his books were burned. He was punished after the fact.

88
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,854
Another early reformer was John Hus.

89
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:09,793
Now, he was from Bohemia, and

90
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:12,303
he was ultimately burned at the stake.

91
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:16,387
In 1415, so this is just a little bit more than

92
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:18,150
a hundred years before Luther.

93
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,908
Now, those "Ninety-Five Theses" were posted in Latin,

94
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:26,339
but people translated it without his authorization into German,

95
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:29,263
and then used the new technology of the printing press

96
00:04:29,263 --> 00:04:31,310
and distributed it widely.

97
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,519
The printing press had been invented in the mid-fifteenth century,

98
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:39,668
an incredibly important invention for the spread of Protestant ideas.

99
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:41,670
Well, think about what's happening here.

100
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,553
Instead of the distribution network of the Church,

101
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,454
you have people acting on their own

102
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,900
outside of that structure, in their own language.

103
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,493
So Luther posts the "Ninety-Five Theses" in 1517,

104
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:58,349
word gets to the Pope, he's accused of heresy;

105
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:00,952
but he's gaining support, widely.

106
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:05,774
And in 1521, he's called to a large council.

107
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,639
So, this event we call the Diet of Worms.

108
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,259
And it was under the auspices of the Holy Roman Emperor.

109
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:16,958
So this is an unfortunate name, the Diet of Worms! [laughs]

110
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,215
Nobody's eating worms. [laughs]

111
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:21,006
But a "diet" is a gathering, a council;

112
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:24,526
and Worms, or "verms," is a city in Germany.

113
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:27,699
So, the new Holy Roman Emperor, who's, by the way,

114
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,611
only a teenager at this time, has summoned Luther.

115
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,415
He's given him an authorization of safe passage:

116
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,626
that is, he won't be arrested on his way;

117
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,912
and he is to testify at this council.

118
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:42,746
So Luther is asked if he authored the books.

119
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:44,822
He's presented with his own books.

120
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:47,322
Luther says "Yes I did." and then he's asked,

121
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:51,180
"Do you stand by the ideas in these books?"

122
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,389
and Luther says, "Give me a day to think about that,"

123
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,324
and that request is granted.

124
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:59,571
He comes back the next day, and by all accounts

125
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:03,236
gives an eloquent defense of the ideas in the books,

126
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:05,430
and does not renounce any of the ideas.

127
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,390
It's pretty clear that the lines are drawn.

128
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,322
And Luther leaves Worms,

129
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:12,864
he's declared an unrepentant heretic.

130
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:15,367
it's clear he's going to be arrested;

131
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:18,180
possession of his writings is forbidden,

132
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,234
and he leaves the city of Worms.

133
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:21,921
Remember, he's been granted safe passage,

134
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:23,956
so he's allowed to leave Worms.

135
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:25,672
Now, here's the crucial moment.

136
00:06:25,672 --> 00:06:28,889
Will he end up like Hus - that is, burned at the stake,

137
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,149
arrested, will that be the end of his efforts?

138
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,568
Or will something else happen?

139
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:35,054
Well, something else does happen,

140
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:37,463
and that's because of political issues.

141
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,359
The new Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire

142
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:45,708
had gotten that job because of the vote of men in Germany,

143
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,037
princes, who are called electors.

144
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:51,687
And one of those electors, the Elector of Saxony,

145
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:56,174
secretly kidnaps Luther as he leaves the city of Worms,

146
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:58,584
and hides him away in a castle, where, by the way,

147
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,998
Luther immediately gets down to work writing,

148
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:03,070
and translating the New Testament.

149
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,252
And by the time Luther emerges, and returns

150
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:09,411
to public life, the Holy Roman Emperor is involved

151
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:12,637
in other issues, and doesn't pursue his arrest.

152
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:15,500
So, Luther is able to do something that Hus,

153
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,213
that Wycliffe was not able to do, which is

154
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:19,665
to continue his campaign.

155
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:22,662
In a way, the whole Reformation happens

156
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:24,800
because of issues like this,

157
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,489
that local rulers, whether they're monarchs,

158
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:32,112
or princes, are tired of ceding so much authority

159
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:33,763
and political power to the pope,

160
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:36,498
and use the opportunity of the Reformation

161
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,954
to wrest back some control of their own lands,

162
00:07:39,954 --> 00:07:41,041
of their own people.

163
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:43,766
If you think about the power structure in Europe

164
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:46,635
at this time, especially in what will become Germany,

165
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:49,651
you have the local princes, you have

166
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:52,696
the authority of the Pope in Rome on the other side of the Alps,

167
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:54,940
but you also have the Holy Roman Emperor,

168
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,588
so it was very complicated;

169
00:07:56,588 --> 00:08:00,419
and everybody was trying to enlarge their own stake.

170
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,193
So Martin Luther is at the Diet of Worms.

171
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:05,919
He's been confronted with his own writings.

172
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,324
He's in a really dangerous situation.

173
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:13,065
Luther was going against one of the central doctrines of the Church,

174
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:15,464
and that was that you were justified -

175
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:16,864
that is, that you got to Heaven -

176
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:19,127
in two ways, according to the Church.

177
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:23,064
One: through God's forgiveness, through God's grace.

178
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:26,318
The other, through things that you could do yourself,

179
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:28,412
choices that you could make as a human being,

180
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:30,791
through what the Church called "good works."

181
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,690
So by good works, we mean for instance,

182
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,766
helping to build St. Peter's Basilica.

183
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,680
Exactly! Or donating money to the Church.

184
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,069
Or helping the poor, or any of the things

185
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:43,861
that we think, in the modern world, of charitable work.

186
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:48,993
Exactly. And Luther was deeply disturbed by this idea,

187
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:53,077
because in his own conscience, he felt so sinful,

188
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:56,050
that nothing he felt that he could do

189
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,999
could help him get to Heaven.

190
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:01,217
There was not enough good works to do in the world

191
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:05,002
to remove the sin that he felt that he lived with,

192
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,656
and that all human beings lived with.

193
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,679
If you think about the medieval mind,

194
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,909
tallying up the sins they've committed,

195
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:14,555
and sometimes sins can just be like jealousy,

196
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,741
or envy, and tallying those against

197
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,604
the good works that they've done,

198
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:21,526
you can imagine this constant tallying

199
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,821
that must have gone on in the medieval conscience.

200
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:27,057
So, this is a terrible responsibility on the individual.

201
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:29,964
And so, it must have been a tremendous relief

202
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:33,674
when he read carefully the words of St. Paul.

203
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,501
Luther read St. Paul, who said,

204
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:39,302
"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,

205
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:41,536
for it is the power of God to salvation

206
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:44,353
for everyone who believes. . . . For in it

207
00:09:44,353 --> 00:09:46,737
the righteousness of God is revealed

208
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:49,640
from faith to faith; as it is written,

209
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,490
'The just shall live by faith.'"

210
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,339
Those last words were critical for Luther.

211
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:58,471
That meant, to Luther, that one is justified -

212
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:01,948
one gets to heaven - through faith alone,

213
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:02,999
not through good works.

214
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:06,460
Salvation was something freely granted by God,

215
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,734
and not something that had to be earned by human beings.

216
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,792
So faith was a kind of gift that God gave you,

217
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:16,154
and that faith was all you needed to get to heaven.

218
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:19,729
"Through faith alone" is one of Luther's central ideas.

219
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:22,908
So, all of this makes sense in relationship to

220
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:26,659
the "Ninety-Five Theses," and to Luther's concern about indulgences,

221
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,854
because the indulgence is this proposition that

222
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:33,042
good works will hurry the soul to heaven,

223
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:36,654
and that's precisely what Luther is taking issue with.

224
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:39,656
And with really, the whole authority of the Church

225
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:44,509
to forgive, to remit sin and to allow a person

226
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,063
into Heaven. Luther's feeling was that

227
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,688
the only power to do that was with God.

228
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:53,993
So he looks at his books, and he does not renounce them.

229
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:57,208
No. And he eventually returns to Wittenberg,

230
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,238
and founds the Lutheran Church,

231
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:02,202
and sparks many other types of Protestantism

232
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:04,142
that we'll talk about in the next video.

233
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:13,699
