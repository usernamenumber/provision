1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390
   

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,330
What I want to do in this video
is talk about a bunch of

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,190
molecules or classes of
molecules that can be derived

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,220
from carboxylic acid.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,870
And just to show a specific
example I'll show things that

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,250
can be derived from
acetic acid.

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,750
And just as a review, acetic
acid looks like this.

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,370
   

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,070
The common name, as I just said,
is acetic acid, and if

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,270
you want to use the systematic
name, you look for the longest

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,270
chain, which is right
over there.

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,720
There's two carbons.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,490
So we use the eth- prefix, so
it's ethan-, and since this is

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:45,020
a carboxylic acid, it
is ethanoic acid.

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,270
Now, the derivatives of acetic
acid, and we can later

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,560
generalize this to all
carboxylic acids.

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,850
We really just have to change
what's going on in this carbon

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,580
chain right here.

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,490
It won't have to necessarily
just be two carbons.

20
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,280
It can just keep going.

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,400
It could have benzene rings,
whatever, and that would

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,330
change the name.

23
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,599
But really, I just want to give
you the gist and the gist

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,750
of the naming.

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,600
So if we were to replace this
hydroxyl group with an amine,

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,850
and in future videos we'll see
how that is done, so let me

27
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,660
just draw the acyl group.

28
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,505
So the acyl group is just
that right over there.

29
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:23,590
And we're just going to keep
changing what's bonded to the

30
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,050
acyl group right over here.

31
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:32,400
So if this is bonded to an
amine, so let me draw-- well,

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,490
this would be the simplest amine
right over here, which

33
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,200
would be NH2.

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,390
This thing right here it's
called an amide, and if we

35
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,890
were to give this its common
name, it would be acetamide.

36
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,310
This particular example
would be acetamide.

37
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,220
   

38
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,610
And if we wanted the systematic
name for it, it

39
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,710
would be ethanamide.

40
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,240
You have two carbons right there
so it is ethanamide.

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,199
   

42
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,590
Now the natural question is,
all amines won't just be

43
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,840
primary, you might have other
things other than hydrogens

44
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,390
attached to it, other radical
groups, other carbon chains,

45
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,910
so how do you name those?

46
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,570
And so if you had a molecule
that looked like this, and

47
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,980
actually, let me just change
things up a little bit so that

48
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,950
we diverge a little bit
from the ethane route.

49
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,400
So let's say you had three
carbons bonded or part of the

50
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,890
acyl group right there.

51
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:45,940
And then, we are bonded to a
nitrogen, which is bonded to a

52
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,860
methyl group and then
another hydrogen.

53
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,650
In this case, you start naming
with this methyl group right

54
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,150
here and to show that that
methyl group is attached to

55
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:06,040
the nitrogen, you call
this N-methyl.

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,370
And then you look at the chain
that forms the acyl group, the

57
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,140
carbon chain.

58
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,640
We have one, two, three carbons
so it is propanamide.

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,220
   

60
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,430
If you had another methyl here
you would say N comma

61
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,590
N-dimethyl.

62
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,250
If you had a methyl here and
a propyl group here, you

63
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,580
would've called it
N-methyl-N-propyl-propanamide.

64
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,390
So hopefully that gives
you a sense of amides.

65
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,240
Now, and this is something we've
seen before so it's a

66
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,810
little bit of review, if you
have something that looks like

67
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:55,060
this, I'll have it attached
to a methyl

68
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,040
group right over here.

69
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,070
We've seen this before.

70
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,660
This is an ester.

71
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,330
   

72
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,680
And if we have an-- let me
actually make the part that

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,710
makes it an ester in blue
to diferentiate it.

74
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,960
We keep substituting what is
attached to the acyl group.

75
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,740
Let me label it.

76
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,220
This right here is called
an acyl group.

77
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,290
That right there is
an acyl group.

78
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,760
So right over here, for the
ester, if we were to give it

79
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,570
its common name, and we've
seen this ester

80
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,170
before, it is acetate.

81
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,890
And if we wanted to give it its
systematic , name you look

82
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:37,740
at the longest chain, one, two
carbons so it is ethan-- and

83
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,590
you don't call it ethanoic
acid anymore.

84
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:47,570
You call it ethanoate,
just like that.

85
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,690
Now, the next one, and we
haven't seen this one before,

86
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,290
and it looks complex, but when
you really break it down into

87
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,160
its constituents,
it's not so bad.

88
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,080
So let's say we have a molecule
that looks like this.

89
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,400
So we have one acyl group bonded
to an oxygen, which is

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,880
bonded to another acyl group.

91
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,720
So it's almost like you have two
carboxylic acids that have

92
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,760
been joined together.

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,240
And you really do have two
acyl groups joined by an

94
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,390
oxygen here.

95
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,800
This is called an anhydride.

96
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,930
   

97
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,260
And they look very complex, but
you just have to realize

98
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,140
they're two carboxylic acids
attached to each other and

99
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,700
usually the same one.

100
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,280
Most anhydrides you're going
to see in organic chemistry

101
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,610
are formed from the same
carboxylic acid, so how ever

102
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,010
many carbons you have on this
end, you're normally going to

103
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,670
have on this end.

104
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,210
So the way the name these is you
name it just the same way

105
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,690
that you would have named the
carboxylic acid, but instead

106
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,910
of writing the word acid, you
write the word anhydride.

107
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,090
So this right here would
be acetic anhydride.

108
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,480
It's derived from acetic acid.

109
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,160
This right here is
acetic anhydride.

110
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
   

111
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,710
Or the systematic name is, we
have one, two carbons so it's

112
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,570
ethanoic anhydride.

113
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,570
   

114
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,160
And just to make things clear,
if this molecule instead of

115
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,670
that, if we had something that
looked like this, where the

116
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,280
carbons chains on either
end had three carbons.

117
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,900
One, two, three, one,
two, three.

118
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,950
We would call this propanoic
anhydride.

119
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:44,920
   

120
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,540
In the unusual circumstance, and
it is unusual, where you

121
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,080
would see different carbon
chains here, you would list

122
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,680
each of them.

123
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,100
So if this had two here and
three here, it would be

124
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,430
ethanoic propanoic anhydride.

125
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,460
But that is very,
very unusual.

126
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,930
Normally, these carbon chains
on either end of-- or both

127
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,380
acyl will groups will contain
the same number of carbons.

128
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,980
Now, the last carboxylic acid
derivative that you should

129
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,640
know about, and we've already
seen it, are the acyl halides,

130
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,085
and, in particular, the
acyl chlorides.

131
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:21,880
So let me draw it
right over here.

132
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,200
So you have your acyl group
right there and then it is

133
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,325
bonded to a chlorine and this
right here is an acyl

134
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:38,220
chloride, maybe the most
intuitive name.

135
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,810
This right here is an acyl
group and then you have a

136
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,210
chlorine, so it's an
acyl chloride.

137
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,580
And we've seen this exact
acyl chloride.

138
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,990
It's derived from acetic acid,
so this is acetyl chloride.

139
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:58,960
   

140
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,630
But if you wanted to give it
its systematic name, and we

141
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,560
haven't seen it's systematic
name before, we have one, two

142
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,520
carbons so it is ethanoyl.

143
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,150
   

144
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,920
This tells us that we are
dealing with an acyl group.

145
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:21,340
Ethanoyl chloride is how
we would name this.

146
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,640
And if this had three
carbons, it would

147
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,760
be propanoyl chloride.

148
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,840
So, hopefully, that gives you
at least a good introduction

149
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,570
to the differences in structures
of all these groups

150
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,550
and an introduction
to naming them.

151
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,600
In the next video, we'll talk
a little bit about the

152
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,110
relative stabilities and then
it'll give you good intuition

153
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,960
on which direction a
reaction might go.

154
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,169
Are you more likely to go from
amide to an acyl chloride or

155
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,720
from an acyl chloride to an
amide or anything in between?

156
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:47,999
