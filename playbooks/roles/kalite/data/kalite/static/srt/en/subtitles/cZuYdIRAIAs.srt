00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,176
We are in the Neues museum in Berlin and

2
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:10,957
we are looking at the famous bust of Neferititi. It is

3
00:00:10,957 --> 00:00:14,503
a life-sized full colored image and it is really

4
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:17,834
impressive. It is the treasure of this museum and

5
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:22,516
it has been placed in a rotonda with a large dome,

6
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:25,708
she's been placed slightly higher than eye level

7
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,778
so we look up at her. She is

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,112
fabulously beautiful. She is virtually the sole

9
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:32,673
work of art in this very large space. Its

10
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:36,577
clearly, she is the focal point. Yes, it's quite theatrical

11
00:00:36,577 --> 00:00:39,427
And unlike the many other Egyptian sculptures,

12
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:43,416
she wasn't intended for a tombe. She was found

13
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,769
in the studio of artist who made her, Thutmose. We

14
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,244
think that this sculpture is actually a model

15
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:53,274
that he'd created in order to work on other sculptures of her. That is

16
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:55,900
This sculpture would function as a three dimensional

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,362
sketch. As a prototype. That's right. And there are a few reasons

18
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:03,104
why that's thought, not only wat it found in his studio, but it

19
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:07,219
is incomplete in a way that it suggests that it was never meant

20
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:10,627
to be completed. If you look for instance at the sockets

21
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:13,378
of the eyes, that would generally be inlaid with semi precious stones

22
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:17,210
but only one eye has any inlay in it. And in that case

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,284
it is temporary material, even wax. And so,

24
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:23,183
not the kind of quality that one would expect in a full

25
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,731
fledged sculpture for the queen. Art historians

26
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:28,453
have discovered through scientific analysis that

27
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:32,810
she is made not of just painted limestone, but limestone that is covered

28
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,811
with a very thin layer of plaster and that

29
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:40,017
enabled the sculptor to achieve really a subtle effects

30
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,731
modelling her face. But in the neck and the headdress

31
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:46,394
the plaster gets much thicker. It would have been

32
00:01:46,394 --> 00:01:49,694
much easier to work and create that very fine detail on

33
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:51,976
the plaster rather than on the coarser material of the

34
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:56,193
limestone core. And that is so important where we see the lines

35
00:01:56,193 --> 00:02:00,150
very subtle movements around her cheeks. What is

36
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,411
so remarkable about this sculpture is how

37
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:06,564
sensitively carved she is, how we get a sense of skin

38
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:10,836
and bone and these lovely movements around

39
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:13,528
her face. She is tremendously elegant but

40
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:16,767
even beyond this simple elegance of the contrast of her face, her high cheekbones,

41
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,832
the shallow of her cheeks, her long neck,

42
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:22,981
beautiful symmetry. A way in which line is

43
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:25,781
unified throughout the entire potrait bust

44
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:29,746
for instance, if all the lines downwards that are constructed

45
00:02:29,746 --> 00:02:32,368
by the contours of her headdress, but tapers as

46
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:35,381
as it moves towards her chin to her face and headdress

47
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:38,692
create a perfect triangle. But that's actually continued

48
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:42,095
by the lines of her neck below her chin and

49
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,768
it's accentuated by the lighting in the museum,

50
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:47,351
but it really does create the sense of continuity

51
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:50,030
from the top of the sculpture to it's base.

52
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,736
What we are describing is a new ideal of beauty

53
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:54,733
that's really different from the tradition

54
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,885
of ancient Egyptian sculpture. And thats because

55
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,678
Nefertiti was the wife of the pharaoh Akhenaten,

56
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:04,197
who established a new religion in ancient Egypt that

57
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:06,479
was monotheistic instead of the traditional

58
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,194
polytheistic religon and with that he created a

59
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:13,775
new ideal of beauty, that we see in the

60
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:16,588
sculptures that were created during his reign.

61
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:18,227
Thats right. I think we see this sculpture

62
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:20,339
really is a perfect examplar. Nefertiti is

63
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:22,127
especially interesting, because we believe she did not

64
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:25,187
simply function as the wife of the pharaoh,

65
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:27,688
but she is shown in so many portaits with the

66
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:29,975
accoutrements of the ruler, that we think that

67
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:32,738
she actually shared power. It's interesting,

68
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:35,596
this period we call the Amarna period of Akhenaten's

69
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:39,278
reign, where we have two powerful women. His

70
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:42,776
mother Tiye and his wife Nefertiti. Both

71
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:45,875
represented as beautiful women, as powerful women

72
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:52,807
in giving us a kind of insight in to late Egyptian culture.
