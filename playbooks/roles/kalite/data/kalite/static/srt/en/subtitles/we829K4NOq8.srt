1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:08,360
We saw in the last video that
orthonormal bases make for

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,520
good coordinate systems,
coordinate systems where it's

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,180
easy to figure out
the coordinates.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:20,130
   

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,900
That's what we did in
the last video.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,300
Let's see if there are other
useful reasons to have an

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,330
orthonormal basis.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,670
So we already know, let's say
I have some subspace V.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:39,520
Let's say V is a
subspace of Rn.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,210
And let's say we have B, which
is an orthonormal basis.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:52,320
B is equal to v1, v2,
all the way to vk.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:02,820
And it is an orthonormal basis
for V, which is just a fancy

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,060
way of saying that all of these
vectors have length 1,

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,940
and they're all orthogonal with
respect to each other.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,960
Now, we've seen many times
before that if I have just any

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,240
member of Rn-- So let's say that
I have some vector x that

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:26,770
is a member of Rn, then x can
be represented as a sum of a

19
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,880
member of V, as some vector V
that is in our subspace, and

20
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,460
some vector w, that is
in the orthogonal

21
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,020
complement of our subspace.

22
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,050
Let me write that down.

23
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:47,740
Where V is a member of my
subspace, and w is a member of

24
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,140
my subspace's orthogonal
complement.

25
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,720
We saw this when I was doing
the whole set of videos on

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,370
orthogonal complements.

27
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,040
Now what is this thing
right here?

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,570
What is this thing
right there?

29
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:07,740
By definition, that is the
projection of x onto V.

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,880
This would be the projection
of x onto V's orthogonal

31
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,700
complement.

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,940
And we know in the past,
that this is not an

33
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,400
easy thing to find.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,690
Let's say I set up some matrix
A, that has my basis vectors

35
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,070
as the columns-- So if I set
up some matrix A that looks

36
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:34,460
like this, v1, v2, all the way
to vk, we learned before that

37
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,170
if we wanted to figure out, and
have a kind of a general

38
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,375
way of figuring out what the
projection is, we learned that

39
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:47,670
the projection of any vector x
onto V is equal to A times A

40
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,110
transpose A inverse,
times A, times x.

41
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,300
And this was a pain
to figure out.

42
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,925
That is a pain to figure out.

43
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:01,280
But let's see if the assumption
that these guys are

44
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,910
orthonormal, or that this is an
orthonormal set, in any way

45
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,480
simplifies this.

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,990
So the first thing we can
do is just explore

47
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,760
this a little bit.

48
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,010
This vector V, this is a member
of our subspace, which

49
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,520
means it could be represented as
a linear combination of my

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,130
basis vectors.

51
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:25,090
So I can write x is equal to,
instead of V, I can write c1

52
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,110
times v1, plus c2 times
v2, all the way to

53
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,010
plus ck times vk.

54
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,840
This is the same thing as just
any, or some unique, member of

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,610
my subspace V.

56
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,900
So that's V right there, and you
can also view this as the

57
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,170
projection of x onto
the subspace V.

58
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,570
So x can be represented as some
member of V, and then

59
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,490
some member of V's orthogonal
complement,

60
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,050
plus w right there.

61
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:02,340
Now what happens if we take both
sides of this equation,

62
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,480
if we dot it with one of these
guys with, let's say, vi?

63
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,590
Let's dot both sides of
this equation with vi.

64
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:17,269
So if I take vi dot x, or vi
of the ith basis vector up

65
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:22,650
here, the ith basis vector in
the basis for my subspace B,

66
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,740
what am I going to get?

67
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:31,700
This is going to be c1 times
vi, times v1, plus c2 times

68
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,860
vi, times v2, plus you're
going to keep going.

69
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,640
Eventually you'll get to the
ith term, which will be ci

70
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,110
times vi dotted with vi.

71
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,610
And then, you know, assuming
that i isn't 1, 2, or k,

72
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:56,030
eventually we'll get to ck
times vi dotted with vk.

73
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,190
We saw this in the last video.

74
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,220
I'm just dotting both sides.

75
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,890
But we also have this w term.

76
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:06,570
So then we'll go
plus vi dot w.

77
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,460
Now, you know, just to clarify
things, in the last video, we

78
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,820
assumed that x was inside of the
subspace, so that x could

79
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,550
be represented with
coordinates here.

80
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,280
Now x could be any member of Rn,
and we're just looking at

81
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,450
the projection of x.

82
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,280
And because it's any member,
it's going to be some

83
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,260
combination of these guys plus
some member of B's orthogonal

84
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,140
complement.

85
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,950
Now when I take the dot product
of one of my basis

86
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,290
vectors, the ith basis vector,
with both sides of this

87
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,470
equation, this side is just
that, but in the right side

88
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,160
something very similar
happens to what we

89
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,150
saw in the last video.

90
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,540
What is vi dot v1?

91
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,320
Well they're different members
of this orthonormal set, so

92
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,930
they're orthogonal.

93
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,630
So that's going to be 0, vi dot
v2, that's 0, assuming vi

94
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,720
doesn't equal 2.

95
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,960
vi dot vi is 1.

96
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,040
So this term is just going
to be ci, vi dot

97
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,600
vk, that's also 0.

98
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,570
It doesn't matter what our
constant is because 0 times

99
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,780
anything is 0.

100
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,630
And then what is vi dot w?

101
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,380
Well, by definition w is a
member of our orthogonal

102
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,420
complement to V, which means
it is orthogonal to every

103
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,270
member of V.

104
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,420
Well this is a member of V, so
these two guys are orthogonal.

105
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,080
So that is also equal to 0.

106
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:28,420
And just like that, you get ci
is equal to vi times xi.

107
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,930
Sorry, times x, just
like that.

108
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,600
So what does this do?

109
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,260
This is a kind of a very
similar result

110
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,120
that we got last time.

111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,720
But remember we're not looking
for-- We're not assuming that

112
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,200
x is a member of V.

113
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,470
In that case then, you know,
the ci's would be the

114
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,390
coordinates for x.

115
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,450
In this case, we're looking for
the projection of x onto

116
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,650
V, or the member of V that is
kind of x's component in V, or

117
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,420
that represents x's
projection onto V.

118
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:06,250
So if we now want to find the
projection of x onto V, it's

119
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,680
equal to these ci's times
their respective basis

120
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,010
vectors, but now we know
what the ci's are.

121
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,650
They're that basis vector
times your vector x.

122
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,210
So just like that, we get a
pretty simple way of figuring

123
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,330
out the projection onto
a subspace with

124
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,155
an orthonormal basis.

125
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:27,570
So let's see, c1 is just
going to be v1 dot x.

126
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,780
That's c1, and then we're going
to multiply that times

127
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,860
the vector v1.

128
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,120
That's a vector too.

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,910
And then the next, I guess we
could say, you know, the next

130
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,890
coefficient on v2 is going
to be v2 dot x

131
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,210
times the vector v2.

132
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,760
And then you're going to
go all the way to plus

133
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,790
vk dot x times vk.

134
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,130
And I don't know if you remember
what we did when we

135
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,935
took the projection of
x onto some line.

136
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:04,130
When we were taking the
projection of x onto some

137
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:10,850
line, where L is equal to the
span of some unit vector,

138
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,360
where this had a length 1.

139
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,530
You know, for t as any real
number, that's just a line,

140
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,740
sum of the span of
some unit vector.

141
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,940
Where we assume this
has length 1.

142
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,160
Then the projection onto a line
just simplified to the

143
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:31,320
formula x dot-- let me write
it this way --x dot u times

144
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,179
the vector u.

145
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,890
This was a projection
onto a line.

146
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,690
Notice when we're dealing with
an orthonormal basis for a

147
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,179
subspace, when you take a
projection of any vector in Rn

148
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:45,670
onto that subspace, it's
essentially, you're just

149
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,320
finding the projection onto the
line spanned by each of

150
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,950
these vectors, right?

151
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,950
x dot v1 times the vector v1.

152
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,050
x times v1 times
the vector v1.

153
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,890
You're taking x's projection
onto the line spanned by each

154
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,580
of these guys.

155
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,830
That's all it is.

156
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,990
But clearly this is a much, much
simpler way of finding a

157
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,110
projection than going through
this mess of saying A times

158
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:11,130
the inverse of A transpose A,
times A transpose-- I forgot

159
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,100
that A transpose when I wrote
it the first time --times x.

160
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,670
This is clearly a lot easier.

161
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,670
But you might say, OK, this is
easier but you told me that a

162
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,330
projection is a linear
transformation.

163
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,880
You've told me it's a linear
transformation, so I want to

164
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,630
figure out the matrix here.

165
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,180
So let's see if being
orthonormal in any way

166
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,746
simplifies this.

167
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:34,470
So we could always just figure
out for any particular x.

168
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,220
We can just apply the dot
product with each of the basis

169
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,510
vectors, those will be the
coefficients, and then apply

170
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,950
those coefficients times the
basis vectors, add them up and

171
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,000
you know your projection.

172
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,280
But, you know, some of us
might actually want the

173
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,350
transformation matrix.

174
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,520
So let's figure out
what it is.

175
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,360
Let me just rewrite what
we already know.

176
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,730
We already know that the
projection onto any subspace V

177
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:06,690
of x is equal to A times
A transpose A inverse,

178
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,650
times A, times x.

179
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:19,100
And where A's column vectors are
just the basis vectors v1,

180
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,010
v2, all the way to vk.

181
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,915
Now, let's see if the assumption
that these guys are

182
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:28,600
an orthonormal basis,
let's see if this

183
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,510
simplifies it at all.

184
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,570
Let's take the case in
particular of A transpose A.

185
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,820
A transpose A is going
to be equal to what?

186
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,940
It's going to be equal
to A transpose--

187
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,140
Let's think about this.

188
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,000
These guys are members of
Rn, so it's going to

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,200
be an n by k matrix.

190
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,110
So this is n by k, this guy
right here is k by n,

191
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,960
times an n by k.

192
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,880
We're going to have
a k by k product.

193
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,180
k by n times n by k is
going to be k by k.

194
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,145
A transpose A is going
to be k by k.

195
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:07,520
And what is it A transpose
equal to?

196
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,320
Well each of these columns
are going to become rows.

197
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,570
So the first row here is going
to be v1 tranpose.

198
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,230
   

199
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,270
The second column here is going
to be v2 transpose.

200
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,080
Then you're going to go
all the way down.

201
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,850
The kth column there is going
to be to vk transpose.

202
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,120
Just like that.

203
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,880
And then A is, of course,
this thing right there.

204
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,500
So A looks like this.

205
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,820
You have v1, like that.

206
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,010
You have v2, like that.

207
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:45,560
And then you keep going and you
have vk, just like that.

208
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,900
What's going to happen when
we take this product?

209
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,190
Let's do a couple of
rows right here.

210
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,320
So when I take this product,
I'm going to

211
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,530
get a k by k matrix.

212
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,370
Let me write it big so I can
explain it reasonably.

213
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,850
So what's the first row, first
column going to be?

214
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,540
It's going to be this
row dotted with this

215
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,610
column, or v1 dot v1.

216
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,580
Well, v1 dot v1, that's
nice, that's just 1.

217
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,370
And then what's the second
row, second column?

218
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,310
Well, that's just going be v2.

219
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,390
You're going to get your row
from this guy and your column

220
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,400
from that guy.

221
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,580
This row dotted with that
column, so v2 dot v2, so

222
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,260
that's nice.

223
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,880
That'll be a 1.

224
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,070
And in general, if you're
finding the Aii or you're

225
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,220
finding anything along the
diagonal, you're going to

226
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,630
take, let's say, the ith row
with the ith column.

227
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,960
So you're just going to have 1's
that go all the way down

228
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,170
the diagonal.

229
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,750
Now what about everything
else?

230
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:41,190
Let's say that you're looking
for this entry right here,

231
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,720
which is the first row,
second column.

232
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,240
This guy right here is going to
be the dot product of v2.

233
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,220
This is going to be
the dot product of

234
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,190
this row-- Oh, sorry.

235
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,820
The dot product of v1 is going
to be the dot product of this

236
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,280
row, with this column
right there.

237
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,890
So this is going to
be v1 dot v2.

238
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,460
But these two guys are
orthogonal, so what's that

239
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,760
going to be equal to?

240
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,460
It's going to be equal to 0.

241
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,520
This one right here is going
to be v1 dot v3.

242
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,400
Well that's going to be 0.

243
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,480
v1 dot anything other than
v1 is going to be 0.

244
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,770
Similarly, everything here
in the second row,

245
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,670
it's going to be v2.

246
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,400
The first column in the second
row is going to be v2 dot v1,

247
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,330
which is clearly 0.

248
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,580
And then you have v2
dot v2, which is 1.

249
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,130
And then v2 dot all the rest
of stuff is going to be 0.

250
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,210
They're all orthogonal with
respect to each other.

251
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,220
And so everything else, if your
row and your column is

252
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,650
not the same-- Well, if your
row and your column is the

253
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,070
same, you're going to be dotting
the same vectors, so

254
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,480
you're going to be getting
1, because all

255
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,560
their lengths are 1.

256
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,990
But if your row and column are
not the same, you're going to

257
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,470
be taking the dot product of two
different members of your

258
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,040
orthonormal basis.

259
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,760
And they're all orthogonal, so
you're just going to get a

260
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,010
bunch of 0's.

261
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,520
   

262
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,660
Now, what is this?

263
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,430
You have 0's everywhere, with
1's down the diagonal.

264
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,710
It's a k by k matrix.

265
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,220
This is the identity
matrix in Rk.

266
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,060
   

267
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,330
So normally this was
our definition.

268
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,730
This was our definition of, or
this is our way of finding our

269
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,780
transformation matrix
for the projection

270
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,820
of x onto some subspace.

271
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:33,770
But that simply, if we assume
an orthonormal basis, then A

272
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:40,210
transpose A becomes the k
by k identity matrix.

273
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,220
And so what's the inverse
of the identity matrix?

274
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,260
So A transpose A inverse becomes
the inverse of the k

275
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,470
by k identity matrix,
which is just the k

276
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,180
by k identity matrix.

277
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,550
So this simplifies to the
projection onto V of our

278
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,610
vector x, simplifies to A
times the inverse of the

279
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,140
identity matrix-- It was just
the identity matrix.

280
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,620
So it's just A times Ik, times
A transpose-- I always forget

281
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,270
that second A transpose
right there-- times x.

282
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,380
And we could just ignore this.

283
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,550
That does nothing to it.

284
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:25,080
So it's just equal to A times A
transpose, times x, which is

285
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,740
a huge simplification.

286
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,190
I still have to do a matrix
product, but finding the

287
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:35,200
transpose of a matrix is
pretty straightforward.

288
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,080
You just switch the rows
and the columns.

289
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,960
First multiplying the transpose
times A, that's a

290
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,670
lot of work.

291
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,020
But it's a huge amount
of work to find the

292
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,520
inverse of this thing.

293
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,310
But now, since we assumed that
these columns here form an

294
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,530
orthonormal set, this
just gets reduced to

295
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,650
the identity matrix.

296
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,550
And the projection of x onto V
is just equal to A times A

297
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,890
transpose, where A is the
matrix where each of the

298
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:07,750
column vectors are the basis
vectors for our subspace V.

299
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,690
Anyway, hopefully that gives you
even more appreciation for

300
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,940
orthonormal bases.

301
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,138
