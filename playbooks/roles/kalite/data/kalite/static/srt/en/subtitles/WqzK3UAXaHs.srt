1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:04,600
"The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God."

2
00:00:04,862 --> 00:00:07,523
And this is a quote by Euclid of Alexandria.

3
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:12,655
He was a Greek mathematician and philosopher who lived about 300 years before Christ

4
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:19,691
And the reason why I include this quote is because Euclid is considered to be the father of geometry.

5
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:22,663
And it is a neat quote, regardless of your views of God.

6
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:25,054
Whether or not God exists or the nature of God.

7
00:00:25,054 --> 00:00:27,516
It says something very fundamental about nature.

8
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:31,649
The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God.

9
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:35,016
That math underpins all of the laws of nature.

10
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:37,802
And the word "geometry" itself has Greek roots.

11
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:40,983
"Geo" comes from Greek for "Earth".

12
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:44,211
"Metry" comes from Greek for "measurement".

13
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,183
You're probably used to something like the "metric" system.

14
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:50,132
And Euclid is considered to be the father of geometry.

15
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:52,802
(not because he was the first person who studied geometry),

16
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,285
you could imagine the very first humans might have studied geometry.

17
00:00:56,562 --> 00:01:00,024
They might have looked at two twigs on the ground that looked something like that.

18
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:02,462
And they might have looked at another pair of twigs that looked like that.

19
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,178
And said "This is a bigger opening. What is the relationship here?"

20
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:13,654
Or they might have looked at a tree that had a branch that came off like that.

21
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:18,274
And they said, "Well, there's something similar about this opening here and this opening here."

22
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:19,737
Or they might have asked themselves,

23
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:26,123
"What is the ratio or what is the relationship between the distance around a circle and the distance across it?

24
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:28,352
And is that the same for all circles?

25
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:31,812
And is there a way for us to feel really good that that is definitely true?"

26
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:34,412
And then once you got to the early Greeks,

27
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:39,010
they started to get even more thoughtful about geometric things.

28
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,259
When you talk about Greek mathematicians like Pythagoras

29
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,535
(who came before Euclid).

30
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:54,511
The reason why people often talk about "Euclidean geometry" is around 300 B.C.

31
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:59,832
(and this over here is a picture of Euclid painted by Raphael, and no one really knows what Euclid looked like

32
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:05,793
or even when he was born or when he died, so this is just Raphael's impression of what Euclid might have looked like

33
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,383
while he was teaching in Alexandria).

34
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:14,397
But what made Euclid the "Father of Geometry" is really his writing of "Euclid's Elements".

35
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:21,263
And, "Euclid's Elements" was essentially a 13-volume textbook

36
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:24,773
(and arguably the most famous textbook of all time).

37
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:31,441
And what he did in those thirteen volumes was a rigorous, thoughtful, logical march

38
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:37,524
through geometry, number theory and solid geometry (geometry in three-dimensions).

39
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,682
And this right over here is the frontispiece of the English version---

40
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:44,955
or the first translation of the English version---of "Euclid's Elements".

41
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:47,532
This was done in 1570.

42
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:51,851
But it was obviously first written in Greek, and, during the Middle Ages,

43
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:55,334
that knowledge was shepherded by the Arabs and it was translated into Arabic.

44
00:02:55,334 --> 00:03:02,393
And then eventually the late Middle Ages translated it into Latin and then eventually English.

45
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:05,806
And when I say that he did a "rigiorous march", Euclid didn't just say,

46
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:14,374
"the square of the length of two sides of a right triangle is going to be the same as the square of

47
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:18,182
the hypotenuse..." and all these other things (and we'll go into depth about what all these mean).

48
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:24,475
He says, "I don't want to feel good that it's probably true. I want to prove to myself that it's true."

49
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:29,723
And what he did in "Elements" (especially the six volumes concerned with planar geometry),

50
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:37,721
was he started with basic assumptions.

51
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:43,747
And those basic assumptions in "geometric speak" are called "axioms" or "postulates".

52
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:51,549
And from them he proved, he deduced other statements or "propositions" (these are sometimes called "theorems").

53
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,729
And then he says, "Now, I know. If this is true and this is true, this must be true."

54
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:58,492
And he could also prove that other things cannot be true.

55
00:03:58,492 --> 00:04:01,255
So then he could prove that this is not going to be the truth.

56
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:04,042
He didn't just say, "Well, every circle I've sat in has this property."

57
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:06,155
He said, "I've now proven that this is true".

58
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:11,402
And then, from there, he could go and deduce other propositions or "theorems"

59
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:14,096
(and we can use some of our original "axioms" to do that).

60
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:17,068
And what's special about that is no one had really done that before.

61
00:04:17,068 --> 00:04:23,477
Rigorously proven beyond a shadow of a doubt across a whole, broad sweep of knowledge.

62
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:30,095
So not just one proof here or there. He did that for an entire "set" of knowledge.

63
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:39,692
A rigorous "march" through a subject so that he could build this scaffold of "axioms" and "postulates" and "theorems" and "propositions"

64
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:42,022
(and theorems and propositions are essentially the same thing).

65
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:47,881
And for about 2,000 years after Euclid (so this is an unbelievable shelf life for a textbook!),

66
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:55,427
people didn't view you as educated if you had not read and understood Euclid's "Elements".

67
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:59,862
And "Euclid's Elements" (the book itself) was the second-most printed book in the Western World

68
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:01,581
after the Bible.

69
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:04,344
This is a math textbook second only to the Bible.

70
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:07,943
When the first printing presses came out they said "Okay, let's print the bible. What next?"

71
00:05:07,943 --> 00:05:09,940
"Let's print 'Euclid's Elements'".

72
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:16,606
And to show that this is relevant into the fairly recent past (although it may depend whether or not you argue that

73
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:19,416
150-160 years ago is a recent past),

74
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:23,779
this right here is a direct quote from Abraham Lincoln (obviously one of the great

75
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:26,612
American Presidents). I like this picture of Abraham Lincoln.

76
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:29,747
This is actually a photograph of Lincoln in his late-30s.

77
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:35,900
But he was a huge fan of "Euclid's Elements". He would actually use it to "fine-tune" his mind.

78
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,872
While he was riding his horse he would read "Euclid's Elements". While he was in the

79
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,777
White House he would read "Euclid's Elements".

80
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,795
But this is a direct quote from Lincoln,

81
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:48,415
"In the course of my law reading, I constantly came upon the word 'demonstrate'.

82
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:53,454
I thought at first that I understood its meaning, but soon became satisfied that I did not.

83
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:59,375
I said to myself, what do I do when I demonstrate more than when I reason or prove?

84
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,580
How does 'demonstration' differ from any other proof..."

85
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,454
So, Lincoln is saying there is this word "demonstration" that means proving beyond doubt.

86
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:13,307
Something more rigorous---more than just simple feeling good about something or reasoning through it.

87
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:17,998
"...I consulted Webster's Dictionary..." (so Webster's dictionary was around even in Lincoln's era)

88
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:23,060
"...they told of certain proof---proof beyond the possibility of doubt. But I could

89
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,005
form no idea of what sort of proof that was. I thought a great many things were proven beyond

90
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:32,649
the possibility of doubt without recourse to any such extraordinary process of reasoning

91
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:35,668
as I understood 'demonstration' to be.

92
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:41,241
I consulted all the dictionaries and books of reference I could find but with no better results.

93
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:45,676
You might as well have defined 'blue' to a blind-man.

94
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:55,150
At last I said, 'Lincoln, you never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what 'demonstrate' means.

95
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,467
And I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there until

96
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:04,345
I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight."

97
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:06,806
(This refers to the six books concerned with planar geometry.)

98
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:11,868
"...I then found out what 'demonstrate' means and went back to my law study."

99
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:17,348
So one of the greatest American Presidents of all time felt that, in order to be a great lawyer,

100
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:24,128
he had to understood---be able to prove any proposition in the six books of "Euclid's Elements"

101
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:30,885
at sight. And also, once he was in the White House he continued to do this to "fine-tune" his mind

102
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:32,954
to become a great President.

103
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:36,922
And so, what we're going to be doing in the geometry playlist is essentially that.

104
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:42,806
What we're going to study---we're going to think about how do we "rigorously" prove things?

105
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:49,624
We're essentially going to be---in a more modern form---studying what Euclid studied 2,300 years ago.

106
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:59,812
To really tighten our reasoning of different statements and be sure that when we say something,

107
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,972
we can really prove what we're saying.

108
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:06,388
This is really some of the most fundamental, "real" mathematics that you will do.

109
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:08,525
Arithmetic was really just computation.

110
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:12,820
Now, in geometry, (and what we'll be doing is Euclidean geometry)

111
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,000
this is really what math is about.

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,388
Making some assumptions and then deducing other things from those assumptions.
