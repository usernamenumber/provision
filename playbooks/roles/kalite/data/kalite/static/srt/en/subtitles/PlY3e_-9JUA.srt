1
00:00:01,144 --> 00:00:04,211
I thought I would do few examples using the angle bisector theorem.

2
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:07,911
So, in the first triangle right over here, we are given that this side has length three;

3
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:10,428
this side has length six and this little dotted line here,

4
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:15,895
this is clearly the angle bisector because they are telling us this angle is congruent

5
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,097
to that angle right over there and

6
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:20,595
than they tell us the length of just this part of this side right over

7
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:24,096
here is 2. So from here to here is 2 and that this length

8
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:27,762
is x. let's figure out what x is. So the angle bisector theorem

9
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:31,580
tells us that the ratio of 3 to 2 is going to be equal to

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,764
6 to x. So we can just solve for x.

11
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:39,180
so 3 to 2 is going to be equal to 6.

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,864
to x and than once again you can cross multiply

13
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:45,413
or you multiply both sides by 2 and x. kind of

14
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:48,914
gives you the same result. If you cross multiply, you get 3x

15
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:52,582
3x equal to, 2 times 3 is 12.

16
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:57,014
x is equal to, divide both sides by 3, x is equal to

17
00:00:57,014 --> 00:01:00,598
4. So in this case, x is equal to 4.

18
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:05,098
and this is kind of interesting, because we just realized now that this side, this entire side

19
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,417
right over here is going to be equal to 6. So even thought, it doesn't look that way

20
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:12,118
based on the way, its drawn. This is actually an isosceles triangle.

21
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:15,982
It has a six and a six and the base right over here is 3.

22
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:20,500
kind of, kind of interesting. Over here, we are given that this length

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,152
is 5; this length is 7; this entire side is

24
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:27,352
10 and than we have this angle bisector, right over there

25
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:30,785
We have to figure out just this part of the triangle between this point

26
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:35,037
We call this point 'A' and this point right over here

27
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:38,219
find the length of line AB right over here. So once again

28
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:41,554
angle bisector theorem. The ratio of 5 to this

29
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:45,417
Let me do this in a new color, the ratio of 5

30
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:49,518
to x is going to be equal to ratio of 7

31
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:53,584
to this distance, right over here

32
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:57,104
and what is that distance? So if the whole is 10, and this is

33
00:01:57,104 --> 00:02:00,722
x, than this distance right over here is going to be 10 -x

34
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:05,039
So the ratio of 5 to x, is equal to 7

35
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,271
over 10 minus x, and we can cross multiply

36
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:12,088
Multiply 5 times 10 minus x is 50 minus

37
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:15,521
is 5x and than 7 times x is equal to 7x

38
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:18,905
minus 5x and than x times 7 is equal to

39
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,689
7x. Add 5x to both sides of the equation. You get

40
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:22,322
50 is equal to 12x

41
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:26,372
divide both sides by 12 and we get 50

42
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:29,839
over 12 is equal to x

43
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:34,806
So we can reduce this, let's see if you divide numerator and denominator by 2

44
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:38,437
You get. This is the same thing as 25 over

45
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:42,239
6, which is the same thing if you want to write as mix number as

46
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,523
4. 24 over 6 is 4

47
00:02:45,523 --> 00:02:48,923
and than you have one sixth left over, so 4 and one sixth

48
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:52,991
this length right over here is going. Oh Sorry, this length over

49
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:56,574
here x is 4 and one sixth and than

50
00:02:56,574 --> 00:03:02,024
this length over here is going to be 10 minus 4 and one sixth

51
00:03:02,024 --> 99:59:59,999
What is that? 5 and 5 sixth
