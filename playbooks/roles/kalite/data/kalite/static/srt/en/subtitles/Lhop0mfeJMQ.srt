1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,280
We're on problem 110. Let me scroll this up.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,100
Whenever Martin has a restaurant bill with an amount between

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,000
$10 and $99ŁŹhe calculates the dollar amount of the tip

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,260
as two times the tens digit of the amount of his bill.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,700
Fair enough. So essentially,

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,970
if there is a ten digit, he just multiplies it by 2.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,900
If the amount of Martin's most recent restaurant bill was

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,720
between $10 and $99, was the tip calculated by Martin on

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,250
his bill greater than 15% of the amount of the bill?

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,380
That is the question. Statement 1 says,

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,790
the amount of the bill was between $15 and $50.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,580
So 1 essentially is enough for this problem, is sufficient,

13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,000
if for every bill, based on his calculation where you

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,770
double the tens digit, it's going to be greater than 15.

15
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,800
And I suspect, let's see if we take the lower end of this,

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:10,300
on this he'll pay $2. He'll pay a $2 tip on $15.

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:18,650
And what percentage is that? 15 goes into 2.00. 1, 15, 50.

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:24,010
15 goes into 50 3 times.3 times 15,45 and it just keeps going

19
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,990
So that's a 13% tip.

20
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,500
Well, it's going to be even lower than that at $16.

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,190
Maybe the bill wasn't $15, the bill was $16.

22
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,090
So the tip is, at the lower end it's 13%, 12%.

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:49,100
And at the higher end, if the bill is $40 exactly and he

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,610
pays $8 on that. If the bill is $40,

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,010
then Martin would pay $8, which would be 20%.

26
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,620
So I can pick different numbers in this range,

27
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,300
and based on the way Martin calculates his tip,

28
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,580
he can either pay less than 15% or more than 15%.

29
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,170
So statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,450
What does statement 2 tell us?

31
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,140
The tip calculated by Martin was $8.

32
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,560
Well this is going to be 2 times the tens digit.

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
So that means that the bill was equal to $40-- I don't know,

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,080
$40-something. So let's think about it.

35
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,280
So the worst case is if the bill-- if he paid $8 on a $40

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,400
bill, that's definitely more than 15%. That's 20%.

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,310
That's what I just actually calculated.

38
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's see the worst case is on a $49 bill.

39
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,010
That the bill keeps going up and he just pays $8.

40
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,450
So is 8 bigger than 15% of 49? Well yeah.

41
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:06,010
Because 8/50 is equal to what? That's equal to 16%.

42
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,390
So if 8/50 is 16%, 8/49, if we lower the denominator a little

43
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,460
bit, that's going to be greater than 16%.

44
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,910
So no matter what range in the forties the bill was,

45
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,570
whether it's $40 or $49 or anything in between,

46
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,780
an $8 tip is going to be more than--it's actually going to be

47
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,030
more than 16%. Not to speak of even 15%.

48
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,840
So statement number 2 alone is sufficient

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,780
to answer this question.

50
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,570
And statement number 1 is fairly useless.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Problem 111.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,920
The price per share of stock x increased by 10% over the same

53
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,390
time period that the price per share of stock y

54
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,550
decreased by 10%.

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,420
The reduced price per share of stock y was what percent of

56
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,000
the original price per share of stock x? Fascinating.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,410
So let's do initial and final. So x final is equal to

58
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,090
an increase by 10% from the initial period.

59
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:19,000
OK, so it equals 1.1 times x initial. Fair enough.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,060
And then, over the same time period y decreased by 10%.

61
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,890
So y final is equal to 10% less than y initial.

62
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,300
So that's 0.9 times y initial.

63
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,860
And what they want to know is the reduced price per share of

64
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:43,980
stock y-- so that's y f-- was what percent of the original

65
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,220
price per share of stock x? Of x initial?

66
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,000
So this is what they want to figure out.This is a percentage.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,010
So let's see if the statements help us out at all.

68
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:01,880
The increased price per share of stock x was equal to the

69
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,710
original price per share of stock y.

70
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,760
So the increased price per share of stock x, so that's x f.

71
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,130
That's the final. That's the increased share price.

72
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,010
It increased from the initial to the final.

73
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,000
So the increased price per share of stock x was equal to

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,790
the original price per share of stock y.

75
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,180
So that equals y initial.

76
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,010
So this is interesting. I don't know if it gets us anywhere.

77
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:37,750
This deals with x final and x initial. So I think we can--

78
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:44,710
so if we could write all of it in terms of y initial.

79
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,800
So y final equals-- so let's rewrite this.

80
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,030
This is equal to-- y final is 0.9 times y initial.

81
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:59,040
That's just from this equation. 0.9 times y initial.

82
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,350
And let's see if we could write the initial x in terms

83
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,710
of the initial y.

84
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,400
So x final is equal to y initial.

85
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,360
So that means that y initial is equal to this.

86
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,060
So that equals 1.1 x initial.

87
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,600
And that means that we can divide both sides of this

88
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,740
equality by 1.1.

89
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:32,130
And we get x initial is equal to 1 over 1.1 times y initial.

90
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:39,230
So then we have this. 1 over 1.1 times y initial.

91
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,910
And then these two would cancel out.

92
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,520
And you would actually have your answer.

93
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,220
So statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

94
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,510
It wasn't obvious to me at first, but then you have to

95
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,850
realize that, the terminology is confusing but that you can

96
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,200
actually write both of these in terms of y initial given

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,830
that information.

98
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,010
Given the fact that x final is equal to y initial.

99
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,010
Let's see what statement 2 does for us.

100
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:10,980
The increase in the price per share of stock x was 10/11 the

101
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,770
decrease in the price per share of stock y.

102
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,020
Let me think about that.

103
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,040
The increase in the price per share of stock x.

104
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:27,940
So that means that x final minus x initial-- that's the

105
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:36,990
increase-- that this was equal to 10/11 times the decrease in

106
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,030
the price per share of stock y. So what was the decrease?

107
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:46,300
This was y initial minus y final.

108
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,690
Because this was a larger number and we wanted a

109
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,540
positive number here. Because we're just saying the decrease.

110
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,460
We're not saying the negative increase.

111
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,950
So let's see if we can simplify this at all.

112
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:11,030
So let's see, you get x final minus x initial is equal to

113
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:22,030
10/11 y initial minus 10/11 y final.

114
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,400
And remember, the whole time we just want to figure out

115
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,730
what y final over x initial is.

116
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,360
So let's think about this.

117
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,510
Let's write x final is equal to 1.1 times x initial. Right?

118
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:47,760
So we have 1.1 times x initial minus x initial is

119
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,400
equal to--actually I should have done that in the first step.

120
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,050
Let's just skip this right now.

121
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:58,730
Let's just write the 10 over 11. What do we want?

122
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,990
We want y final. So we just want to substitute for y initial.

123
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,730
I am confusing myself.

124
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,970
So y initial is going to be equal to y final divided by 0.9.

125
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:21,590
So 1 over 0.9 y final. I know this is a little confusing.

126
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,080
Minus y final. I just did a substitution for y initial.

127
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,600
And then here, well this is actually,

128
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,810
we know that we can solve this problem.

129
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,000
Although it gets quite hairy.

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,010
Because here, if you think about it, you're going to get

131
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,880
some number, well you're going to get 0.1 x initial is equal

132
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,150
to-- you're going to get some constant after you do all this

133
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,440
math-- times y final.

134
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,740
And so you can easily figure out what y final divided by x

135
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,900
initial is, just by dividing both sides by x initial and

136
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,650
then dividing both sides by A and you would

137
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,910
have solved the problem.

138
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,210
And I'm not going to do that because it's actually kind of

139
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,480
hairy and I don't have--1 divided by 0.9 and then multiplying

140
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,560
it by 10/11 is a fairly convoluted way of doing it.

141
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,980
But hopefully, you see that this is solvable.

142
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,540
And let me just review that again because I think I did it

143
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,070
in my own head.

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,650
So the statement itself said the change, the gain in x-- x

145
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,780
final minus x initial-- was 10/11 times the loss in y.

146
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,080
So y initial minus y final.Because y final is the smaller one

147
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,270
x final we can rewrite in terms of x initial just using

148
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,730
our initial, the fact that it was 10% more.

149
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,070
So I just did that here.

150
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,720
And y initial, we can rewrite as y final.

151
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,020
You could say y initial is equal to y final divided by 0.9.

152
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,510
And that's what we did there.

153
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,200
And then you could see here, this will simplify to some

154
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,120
constant times y final.

155
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
And then you multiply that times 10/11.

156
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,980
So you get some constant times y final.

157
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,610
And then you have 0.1 times x initial. 1.1 minus 1.

158
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,010
And then you can just do some simple algebra to figure out

159
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,020
what y final over x initial is.

160
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,240
So both statements, independently,

161
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,800
are sufficient to solve this problem.

162
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,000
I think that was the hardest one we've done so far.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,090
