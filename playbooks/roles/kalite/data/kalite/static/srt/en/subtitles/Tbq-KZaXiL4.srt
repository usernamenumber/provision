1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,040
I think we have a decent idea of
how a signal is transmitted

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,620
along the neuron.

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,800
We saw that a couple of
dendrites, maybe that one and

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,000
that one and that one, might
get excited or triggered.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,960
And when we say it gets
triggered, we're saying that

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,800
some type of channel
gets opened.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,290
That's probably the trigger.

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,790
That channel allows ions to be
released into the cell-- or

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,120
actually, there are situations
where ions can be released out

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,550
of the cell.

12
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,700
It would be inhibitory, but
let's take the case where ions

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,820
are released into the cells in
an electrotonic fashion.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,510
It changes the charge or the
voltage gradient across the

15
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,750
membrane and if the combined
effects of the change in the

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,280
voltage gradient is just enough
at the axon hillock to

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,790
meet that threshold, then the
sodium channels over here will

18
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,030
open up, sodium floods in, and
then we have the situation

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,160
where the voltage becomes
very positive.

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,090
Potassium channels open up to
change things again, but by

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,710
the time we went very
positive, then that

22
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,320
eletrotonically affects
the next sodium pump.

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,730
But then we have the situation
where that will allow sodium

24
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,360
ions to flood in and then
the signal keeps getting

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,550
transmitted.

26
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,240
Now the next natural question
is, what happens at the neuron

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,590
to neuron junctions?

28
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,640
We said that this dendrite gets

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,550
triggered or gets excited.

30
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,050
In most cases, it's getting
triggered or excited by

31
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,810
another neuron.

32
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,340
It could be something else.

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,550
And over here, when this axon
fires, it should be exciting

34
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,520
either another cell.

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,760
It could be a muscle cell or--
in probably most cases of the

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,820
human body-- it's exciting
another neuron.

37
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,050
And so how does it do that?

38
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,140
So this is the terminal
end of the axon.

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:51,980
There could be the dendrite of
another neuron right here.

40
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,430
This is another neuron with its
own axon, its own cell.

41
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,400
This would trigger the
dendrite right there.

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,190
So the question is, how
does that happen?

43
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,130
How does the signal go from one
neuron's axon to the next

44
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,990
neuron's dendrite?

45
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,770
It actually always doesn't
have to go from axon to

46
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,449
dendrite, but that's
the most typical.

47
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,460
You can actually go from axon to
axon, dendrite to dendrite,

48
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,040
axon to soma-- but let's just
focus on axon to dendrite

49
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,340
because that's the most
traditional way that neurons

50
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,180
transmit information from
one to the other.

51
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,990
So let's zoom in.

52
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,700
Let's zoom in right here.

53
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,610
This little box right there,
let's zoom at the base, the

54
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,740
terminal end of this axon
and let's zoom in

55
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,020
on this whole area.

56
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,010
Then we'll also zoom in-- we're
also going to get the

57
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,370
dendrite of this next neuron--
and I'm going to rotate it.

58
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,320
Actually, I don't even
have to rotate it.

59
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,950
So to do that, let me draw
the terminal end.

60
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,418
So let's say the terminal end
looks something like this.

61
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:49,076
I'm zoomed in big time.

62
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:49,984
Something like that

63
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,090
This is the terminal
end of the neuron.

64
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,160
This is inside the neuron and
then the next dendrite-- let

65
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,485
me draw it right here.

66
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:06,280
The next dendrite. The dendrite of the next neuron. Let me put it right there.

67
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,800
So we've really zoomed in.

68
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:17,100
So this is the dendrite
of the next neuron.

69
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,710
This is inside the
first neuron.

70
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,080
So we have this action
potential that

71
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,640
keeps traveling along.

72
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,580
Eventually for maybe right over
here-- I don't know if

73
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,970
you can zoom in-- which would
be over here, the action

74
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,680
potential makes the electrical
potential or the voltage

75
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,480
potential across this membrane
just positive enough to

76
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,410
trigger this sodium channel.

77
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,610
So actually, maybe
I'm really close.

78
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,750
This channel is this
one right here.

79
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:56,140
So then it allows a flood of
sodium to enter the cell.

80
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,560
And then the the whole
thing happens.

81
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,780
You have potassium that can then
take it out, but by the

82
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,340
time this comes in, this
positive charge, it can

83
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,930
trigger another channel and it
could trigger another sodium

84
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,240
channel if there's other sodium
channels further down,

85
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,750
but near the end of
the axon there are

86
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,470
actually calcium channels.

87
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,200
I'll do that in pink.

88
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,680
So this is a calcium channel
that is traditionally closed.

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,960
So this is a calcium
ion channel.

90
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,545
Calcium has a plus 2 charge.

91
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:30,070
Calcium ion channel.

92
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,230
It tends to be closed, but
it's also voltage gated.

93
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,960
When the voltage gets high
enough, it's very similar to a sodium gated or a

94
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,670
sodium voltage gated channel is
that if it becomes positive

95
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,640
enough near the gate, it will
open up and when it opens up,

96
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,400
it allows calcium ions to
flood into the cell.

97
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,450
So the calcium ions, their
plus 2 charge, to

98
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,180
flood into the cells.

99
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,270
Now you're saying, hey Sal, why
are calcium ions flooding

100
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,980
into the cells?

101
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,660
These have positive charge.

102
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,530
I just thought you said that the
cell is becoming positive

103
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,130
because of all the sodium
flowing in.

104
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,300
Why would this calcium
want to flow in?

105
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,890
And the reason why it wants to
flow in is because the cell

106
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,940
also-- just like it pumps out
sodium and pumps in potassium,

107
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,990
the cell also has calcium ion
pumps and the mechanism is

108
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,120
nearly identical to what I
showed you on the sodium

109
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,090
potassium pump, but it just
deals with calcium.

110
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,550
So you literally have these
proteins that are sitting

111
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,820
across the membrane.

112
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,720
This is a phospobilipid
layer membrane.

113
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,560
Maybe I'll draw two layers here
just so you realize it's

114
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,470
a bi-layer membrane.

115
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,525
Let me draw it like that.

116
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:47,020
That makes it look a little bit
more realistic, although

117
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,670
the whole thing is not
very realistic.

118
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,776
And this is also going to
be a bilipid membrane.

119
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:56,660
You get the idea, but
let me just do it to

120
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,400
make the point clear.

121
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,620
So there are also these calcium
ion pumps that are

122
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,100
also subsets of ATPases, which
they're just like the sodium

123
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,180
potassium pumps.

124
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,720
You give them one ATP and a
calcium will bond someplace

125
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,240
else and it'll pull apart the
phosphate from the ATP and

126
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,950
that'll be enough energy to
change the confirmation of

127
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,720
this protein and it'll
push the calcium out.

128
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,040
Essentially, what was the
calcium will bond and then

129
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,500
it'll open up so the calcium
can only exit the cell.

130
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,350
It's just like the sodium
potassium pumps, but it's good

131
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,880
to know in the resting state,
you have a high concentration

132
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,200
of calcium ions out here and
it's all driven by ATP.

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,170
A much higher concentration on
the outside than you have on

134
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,870
the inside and it's driven
by those ion pumps.

135
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,980
So once you have this action
potential, instead of

136
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,360
triggering another sodium gate,
it starts triggering

137
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,630
calcium gates and these calcium
ions flood into the

138
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,190
terminal end of this axon.

139
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,810
Now, these calcium ions, they
bond to other proteins.

140
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,980
And before I go to those other
proteins, we have to keep in

141
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,230
mind what's going on near this
junction right here.

142
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,840
And I've used the word
synapse already--

143
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,100
actually, maybe I haven't.

144
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,240
The place where this axon is
meeting with this dendrite,

145
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:29,059
this is the synapse.

146
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,680
Or you can kind of view it as
the touching point or the

147
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,020
communication point or
the connection point.

148
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,480
And this neuron right
here, this is called

149
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,920
the presynaptic neuron.

150
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,730
Let me write that down.

151
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,660
It's good to have a little
terminology under our belt.

152
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:49,220
Presynaptic neuron.

153
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,250
This is the post-synaptic
neuron.

154
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:58,550
Post-synaptic
neuron.

155
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,740
And the space between the two
neurons, between this axon and

156
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,680
this dendrite, this is called
the synaptic cleft.

157
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,610
Synaptic cleft.

158
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,700
It's a really small space in the
terms of-- so what we're

159
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,900
going to deal with in this video
is a chemical synapse.

160
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,450
In general, when people talk
about synapses, they're

161
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,260
talking about chemical
synapses.

162
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,880
There also are electrical
synapses, but I won't go into

163
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,810
detail on those.

164
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,470
This is kind of the most
traditional one that people

165
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,650
talk about.

166
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,669
So your synaptic cleft in
chemical synapses is about 20

167
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,460
nanometers, which
is really small.

168
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:45,620
If you think about the average
width of a cell as about 10 to

169
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,150
100 microns-- this micron
is 10 to the minus 6.

170
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,160
This is 20 times 10 to
the minus 9 meters.

171
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,290
So this is a very small distance
and it makes sense

172
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,950
because look how big
the cells look next

173
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,040
to this small distance.

174
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,210
So it's a very small distance
and you have-- on the

175
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,370
presynaptic neuron near
the terminal end,

176
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,750
you have these vesicles.

177
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,770
Remember what vesicles were.

178
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,920
These are just membrane bound
things inside of the cell.

179
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,120
So you have these vesicles.

180
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,760
They also have their
phospobilipid layers, their

181
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,360
little membranes.

182
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,590
So you have these vesicles so
these are just-- you can kind

183
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,350
of view them as containers.

184
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:31,020
I'll just draw one more
just like that.

185
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,060
And they can train these
molecules called

186
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,520
neurotransmitters and
I'll draw the

187
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,280
neurotransmitters in green.

188
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,790
So they have these
molecules called

189
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,140
neurotransmitters in them.

190
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,410
You've probably heard
the word before.

191
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,050
In fact, a lot of drugs that
people use for depression or

192
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:59,380
other things related to our
mental state, they affect

193
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,100
neurotransmitters.

194
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,720
I won't go into detail there,
but they contain these

195
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,710
neurotransmitters.

196
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,810
And when the calcium channels--
they're voltage

197
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,360
gated-- when it becomes a little
more positive, they

198
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,310
open calcium floods in and what
the calcium does is, it

199
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,820
bonds to these proteins that
have docked these vesciles.

200
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:26,170
So these little vesicles,
they're docked to the

201
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,430
presynpatic membrane or to this
axon terminal membrane

202
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,820
right there.

203
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,520
These proteins are actually
called SNARE proteins.

204
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,290
It's an acronym, but it's also
a good word because they've

205
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,540
literally snared the vesicles
to this membrane.

206
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,470
So that's what these
proteins are.

207
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,810
And when these calcium ions
flood in, they bond to these

208
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,970
proteins, they attach to these
proteins, and they change the

209
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,850
confirmation of the proteins
just enough that these

210
00:10:53,850 --> 00:11:00,610
proteins bring these vesicles
closer to the membrane and

211
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,090
also kind of pull apart the
two membranes so that the

212
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,040
membranes merge.

213
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,180
Let me do a zoom in of that
just to make it clear

214
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,370
what's going on.

215
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,700
So after they've bonded-- this
is kind of before the calcium

216
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,070
comes in, bonds to those SNARE
proteins, then the SNARE

217
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,190
protein will bring the vesicle
ultra-close to

218
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,580
the presynaptic membrane.

219
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,710
So that's the vesicle and then
the presynaptic membrane will

220
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:32,370
look like this and then you
have your SNARE proteins.

221
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,560
And I'm not obviously drawing it
exactly how it looks in the

222
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,210
cell, but it'll give you the
idea of what's going on.

223
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:42,000
Your SNARE proteins have
essentially pulled the things

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,510
together and have pulled them
apart so that these two

225
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,780
membranes merge.

226
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,050
And then the main side effect--
the reason why all

227
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,350
this is happening-- is it allows
those neurotransmitters

228
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,070
to be dumped into the
synaptic cleft.

229
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,980
So those neurotransmitters
that were inside of our

230
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,360
vesicle then get dumped into
the synaptic cleft.

231
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,840
   

232
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,630
This process right here
is called exocytosis.

233
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,170
It's exiting the cytoplasm,
you could say, of the

234
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,210
presynaptic neuron.

235
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,130
These neurotransmitters-- and
you've probably heard the

236
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,560
specific names of many of
these-- serotonin, dopamine,

237
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,770
epinephrine-- which is also
adrenaline, but that's also a

238
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,130
hormone, but it also acts
as a neurotransmitter.

239
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,380
Norepinephrine, also both
a hormone and a

240
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:29,830
neurotransmitter.

241
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,820
So these are words that you've
probably heard before.

242
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,070
But anyway, these enter into
the synaptic cleft and then

243
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:43,780
they bond on the surface
of the membrane of the

244
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,100
post-synaptic neuron
or this dendrite.

245
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,910
So they'll bond-- let's say they bond, I was doing yellow.

246
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,890
Let's say they bond here, they
bond here, and they bond here.

247
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,560
So they bond on special proteins
on this membrane

248
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,000
surface, but the main effect of
that is, that will trigger

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
ion channels.

250
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,880
So let's say that this neuron
is exciting this dendrite.

251
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,540
So when these neurotransmitters
bond on this

252
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,780
membrane, maybe sodium
channels open up.

253
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,650
So maybe that will cause a
sodium channel to open up.

254
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,240
So instead of being voltage
gated, it's

255
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,050
neurotransmitter gated.

256
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,950
So this will cause a sodium
channel to open up and then

257
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,350
sodium will flow in and then,
just like we said before, if

258
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,970
we go to the original one,
that's like this getting

259
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,680
excited, it'll become a little
bit positive and then if it's

260
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,870
enough positive, it'll
electrotonically increase the

261
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,250
potential at this point on the
axon hillock and then we'll

262
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,600
have another neuron-- in this
case, this neuron being

263
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,370
stimulated.

264
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,070
So that's essentially
how it happens.

265
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,160
It actually could
be inhibitory.

266
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,860
You could imagine if this,
instead of triggering a sodium

267
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,340
ion channel, if it triggered
a potassium ion channel.

268
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,450
If it triggered a potassium ion
channel, potassium ion's

269
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,400
concentration gradient will
make it want to go

270
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,900
outside of the cell.

271
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,740
So positive things are
going to leave the

272
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,870
cell if it's potassium.

273
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,430
Remember, I used triangles
for potassium.

274
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,430
And so if positive things leave
the cell, then if you go

275
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,550
further down the neuron, it'll
become less positive and so

276
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,520
it'll be even harder for the
action potential to start up

277
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,050
because it'll need even more
positive someplace else to

278
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,370
make the threshold gradient.

279
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,300
I hope I'm not confusing
you when I say that.

280
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,960
So this connection,
the way I first

281
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,240
described it, it's exciting.

282
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,140
When this guy gets excited
from an action potential,

283
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,620
calcium floods in.

284
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,680
It makes these vesicles dump
their contents in the synaptic

285
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,680
cleft and then that will make
other sodium gates open up and

286
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,930
then that will stimulate this
neuron, but if it makes

287
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,050
potassium gates open up, then
it will inhibit it-- and

288
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,520
that's how, frankly, these
synapses work.

289
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,600
I was about to say there's
millions of synapses, but

290
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,480
that'd be incorrect.

291
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,840
There's trillions of synapses.

292
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,870
The best estimate of the number
of synapses in our

293
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:18,990
cerebral cortex is 100 to 500
trillion synapses just in the

294
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,860
cerebral cortex.

295
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,450
The reason why we can have so
many is that one neuron can

296
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,840
actually form many, many,
many, many synapses.

297
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,740
I mean, you can imagine if this
original drawing of a

298
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,760
cell, you might have a synapse
here, a synapse here, a

299
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,600
synapse there.

300
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,680
You could have hundreds or
thousands of synapses even,

301
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,120
into one neuron or going
out of one neuron.

302
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,240
This might be a synapse with
one neuron, another one,

303
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,250
another one, another one.

304
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,260
So you'd have many, many, many,
many, many connections.

305
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,220
And so synapses are really what
give us the complexity of

306
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,400
what probably make us tick in
terms of our human mind and

307
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,980
all of that.

308
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,390
But anyway, hopefully you
found this useful.
