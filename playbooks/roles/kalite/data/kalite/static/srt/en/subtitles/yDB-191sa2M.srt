00:00:01,014 --> 00:00:04,350
Now that we've explored Stokes' Theorem a little bit, I want to talk about

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,448
the situations in wich we can use it. You'll see that this is pretty general

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:12,538
theorem. But we do have to thing about what type of surfaces

4
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:16,602
and what type of boundary are those surfaces we are actually dealing with

5
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:19,834
and the case of Stokes', we need

6
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:23,017
surfaces that are piecewise...

7
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:25,593
piecewise-smooth

8
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:31,372
piecewise-smooth surfaces so this surface right over here

9
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:34,644
it is actually smooth not just even piecewise-smooth.

10
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:39,856
Sounds like a very fancy term but all the smooth part means

11
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:42,332
that you have just continuous derivatives

12
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:45,334
and since we are talking about surfaces we're going to have continuous

13
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:48,549
partial derivatives regardless of which direction you pick.

14
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,510
So this is continuous derivatives,

15
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:56,114
and another way to think about that conceptually is if you pick a direction

16
00:00:56,114 --> 00:00:59,347
on the surface if you say that we go in that direction, the slope in that

17
00:00:59,362 --> 00:01:04,853
direction changes gradually, doesn't jump around. If you pick this direction right over here,

18
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:08,957
the slope is changing gradually. So we have a continuous

19
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:12,029
derivative. And you're like "what does the 'piecewise' means?"

20
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:14,779
Well, the piecewise actually allow us to use Stokes' Theorem with more surfaces.

21
00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:19,966
Because if you have a surface that looks like... Let's say a surface that looks like

22
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:24,219
this. Let's say looks like a cup. So this is the opening of the top of the cup

23
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:27,787
let's say that has no opening on top so we can see the backside of the cup

24
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:31,319
and this is the side of the cup and this right over here is the bottom

25
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,665
of the cup and if it was transparent we could actually see through it. So

26
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:38,892
surfaces like this is not entirely smooth because it has

27
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:41,644
edges. There are points right over here. So this edge

28
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:46,114
right over here... If we pick this... let's say if we pick this direction to go and if we go

29
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:50,907
this direction along the bottom, then right we get to the edge, all of the sudden the slope changes dramatically

30
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:54,808
jumps. So the slope is not continuous at that edge. The slope jumps

31
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:58,995
and we start going straight up. And so this entire

32
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:02,760
surface is not smooth. But the piecewise actually give us

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,296
an out. This tell us that it's okay as long as we can break

34
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:09,655
the surfaces up into pieces that are smooth. And so

35
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:13,780
this cup we can break it up but we were doing this wen tackling surfaces integrals

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,411
we can break it up into the bottom part, which is a smooth

37
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:22,997
surface, it has continuous derivative, and the sides

38
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:24,788
which kind of wraps around is also

39
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:29,292
is also a smooth surface

40
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:32,610
so most things you'll encounter in a traditional calculus course

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,788
actually do, especially surfaces, do fit piecewise-smooth. And the thing is

42
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:41,079
though actually very hard to visualize. I imagine this all outer pointy

43
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,877
fractely looking things where it's hard to break it up into pieces that are

44
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:49,127
actually smooth. That's for surface part but we also

45
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,138
have to care about the boundary, in order to apply Stokes' Theorem. And that is that

46
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:57,296
right over there. The boundary needs to be a simple,

47
00:02:57,296 --> 00:03:02,892
which means that doesn't cross itself, a simple closed

48
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,843
piecewise-smooth boundary. So once

49
00:03:04,843 --> 00:03:08,461
again: simple and closed that just means so this is not a

50
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:12,824
simple boundary. If it is really crossing itself or intersecting itself, although you can break it up

51
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:16,629
into to tow simple boundaries. But something like this is a simple

52
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,596
boundary. So that is a simple boundary right over there. It also have to be closed

53
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:25,996
wich really means that just loops in on itself. You just have something like that. It actually has to

54
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:31,111
close and actually has to loops in on itself. In order to use Stokes' Theorem and once again

55
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:34,421
it has to be piecewise-smooth but now we are talking about a path or a

56
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:39,039
line or curve like this and a piecewise-smooth just means that you can break it up

57
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,477
into sections were derivatives are continuous. The way I've drawm

58
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:44,878
this one, this one and this one, the slope is changing gradually. So over there

59
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,183
the slope is like that. It is changing gradually as we go around

60
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:53,798
this path. Something that is not smooth, a path that is not

61
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:56,176
smooth might look something like this.

62
00:03:56,176 --> 00:04:01,566
Might look something like that. And the places that this aren't smooth are

63
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:06,171
at the edges: not smooth there, not smooth there and not smooth there.

64
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:09,634
But we have to be simple-closed and this is simple and closed. And it's not

65
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:12,496
smooth but it is piecewise-smooth. We can break it up into

66
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:17,445
this section of the path. Which is that line right over there is smooth,

67
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:21,532
that line over there is smooth, that line is smooth, and that line is

68
00:04:21,532 --> 00:04:24,506
smooth. And we've done that when evaluating in line integrals. We broke it up into

69
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:28,174
smooth segments that we can then use to actually compute line

70
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:33,328
integral. So if you find... if you have a boundary where the...

71
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:36,861
if you have a surface that is piecewise-smooth and its

72
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:40,732
boundary is a simple-closed piecewise-smooth

73
00:04:40,732 --> 99:59:59,999
boundary, you're good to go.
