1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:01,600
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,550
Now let me apologize.

4
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,170
That last problem, I think I
rushed it a little bit because

5
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,760
I have to get under this
10-minute YouTube limit.

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,360
But let me know.

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,590
Send me a message on that last
video if you don't think the

8
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,920
explanation was as satisfying as
you would like it to be or

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,920
if you're still confused.

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,400
With that said, let
me move on.

11
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,390
Problem number 9 on page 461.

12
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:45,210
The decimal number above, and
they wrote 5.101001000100001,

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,820
and it keeps going.

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,780
The decimal number above
consists of only 1's and 0's

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,520
to the right of the
decimal point.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,720
The first 1 is followed
by one 0.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,650
The second 1 is followed
by two 0's.

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,120
Right?

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,005
The second 1 is followed by
two 0's, the third 1 is

20
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:00,960
followed by three 0's,
and so forth.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:12,500
What is the total number of 0's
between the 98th and 101st

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,830
1 in this decimal number?

23
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,250
Well, the first 1 is followed
by one 0, the second 1 is

24
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,650
followed by two 0's.

25
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,700
The third 1 is followed
by three 0's.

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,030
Right?

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,540
So the 50th 1 is going to
be followed by 50 0's.

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,380
Right?

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,750
The nth 1 is followed
by n 0's.

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:38,020
So the 98th is going to
be followed by 98 0's.

31
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,725
Right?

32
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,440
So you're going to have a 1,
then you're going to have 98

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,050
0's, then you're going
to have the 99th 1.

34
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,170
That's going to be followed
by 99 0's.

35
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,690
That's just the pattern
that they set up.

36
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,300
Then you're going to
have the 100th 1.

37
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,300
That's going to be followed
by 100 0's.

38
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,930
Then you're going to have
the 101st 1, right?

39
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,850
And we don't care about the 0's
that are after the 101st

40
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,250
1, because they said how many
0's are between the 98th 1 and

41
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,290
the 101st 1.

42
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,260
So I mean, another way to draw
it, as you know, we had a

43
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:21,540
bunch of 0's on this, and
then this is the 98th 1.

44
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,080
Then we're going to have
a bunch of 0's.

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,880
We're going to have
98 0's here.

46
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,280
Then you're going to have a 1.

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,570
Then you're going to have
a bunch of 0's.

48
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,630
This time you're going
to have 99 0's.

49
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,590
This is going to
be the 99th 1.

50
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,890
Then you have the 100th 1, which
is followed by 100 0's.

51
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,030
Then you have the 101st 1.

52
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,820
And we don't care about
this 0's after it.

53
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,720
So this is how many 0's
are in between.

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,420
We just have to add up this.

55
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,340
See, 8 plus 9 is 17.

56
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,650
So it's 98 plus 99 is 207.

57
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,190
So it's 307 0's.

58
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,930
Is that one of the choices?

59
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,255
Sorry.

60
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,810
I'm doing my math wrong.

61
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,350
See, this is how I know it's
late at night and I

62
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,400
should be in bed.

63
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:23,320
But 98 plus 99 is 197
plus 100 is 297.

64
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,660
So that's how many 0's are
between the 98th and 101st 1

65
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,240
in this decimal number.

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,900
Problem 10.

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,150
Let me switch colors.

68
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,695
This color is making
me sleepy.

69
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:41,730
   

70
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:53,290
f of x is equal to 3 minus
2x squared over x for all

71
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,760
non-zero x, then f of 2.

72
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,970
Well, we just take a 2.

73
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,810
f or 2, we're just taking a
2 and sticking it here.

74
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,840
So everywhere we see an x,
we replace it with a 2.

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,590
So it becomes 3 minus 2-- we
put a 2 in there, let me

76
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:21,899
switch colors for emphasis-- 2
squared over-- that's not the

77
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,980
same purple-- over 2.

78
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,250
   

79
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,730
Just so you know where
that 2 came from,

80
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,950
that's f of 2, right?

81
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,190
Everywhere where there
was an x, I just

82
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,280
replaced it with a 2.

83
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,890
Now I just evaluate this.

84
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,330
So 3 minus 2 times 2
squared-- so that 2

85
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,790
squared is 4-- over 2.

86
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:53,220
So 3 minus 8 over 2 equals--
well 3 minus 8 is minus 5-- so

87
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,660
it's minus 5 over 2.

88
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,315
That is choice d.

89
00:04:57,315 --> 00:05:00,860
   

90
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,560
OK, it looks like we
have a geometry

91
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:13,370
problem for number 11.

92
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,620
Let me draw this.

93
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,590
   

94
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,800
There's two lines like
this and like this.

95
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,660
   

96
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:39,510
These lines are perpendicular,
x degrees, y degrees.

97
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,470
This line is l.

98
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,040
This line m.

99
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,310
In the figure above, l is
perpendicular to n.

100
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,590
Right? l is perpendicular to n,
this is a 90 degree angle,

101
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,770
and x is greater than
90 degrees.

102
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,830
So this angle is larger
than 90 degrees.

103
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,670
So they didn't draw
it that way.

104
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,420
So this is actually probably
angling down a bit.

105
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,100
Which of the following
must be true?

106
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
y is less than 90 degrees?

107
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,740
So let's see.

108
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,080
So, it's interesting, because
who cares what's happening up

109
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,150
here, right?

110
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,500
If you have a line-- let me
just draw it like this.

111
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,605
Let me draw it with the
lines actually.

112
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:19,460
Let me draw it like if you have
one line like this, and

113
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,580
then this line like this.

114
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,400
   

115
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,450
If this right here is x,
x is greater than 90

116
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,960
degrees, and this is y.

117
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,820
We know that these two angles
are going to be supplementary

118
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,970
to each other, that they
add up to 180, right?

119
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,480
X plus y is equal
to 180 degrees.

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:49,760
So if x is greater than 90, then
we know that y has to be

121
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,150
less than 90, right?

122
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,550
So that's what we
know is true.

123
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,850
We could look at the
other choices.

124
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,030
y is definitely not going
to be greater than 90.

125
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,920
y is definitely not going
to be equal to 90.

126
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,210
If y is equal to 90 and x is
greater than 90, then these

127
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,210
two angles are going to be
greater than 180 degrees,

128
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,740
which we know it can't be.

129
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,780
n is perpendicular to m.

130
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,540
We know that's not true because
if this is 90 degrees,

131
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,670
then this is also 90 degrees.

132
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,720
But this angle is a
corresponding angle, but it's

133
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,530
not the same.

134
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,700
So they're not parallel lines.

135
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,310
This line is actually, I should
drawn it like this.

136
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,200
Actually I drew a straight line
when I didn't want to.

137
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,525
It's going to be skewed
down like this, right?

138
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:32,820
Because x degrees
is more than 90.

139
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,480
Then l is parallel to m, and
we also know that's not the

140
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,320
case for the same reason.

141
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,280
So it's choice a.

142
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,300
All right.

143
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,860
Let's see if I can fit in this
last problem within the

144
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,100
10-minute window.

145
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,970
Problem number 12.

146
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,670
In the the xy plane, the line
with the equation y is equal

147
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:04,680
to 5x minus 10 crosses the
x-axis at the point with the

148
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,610
coordinates a, b.

149
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,110
So this is where it crosses
the x-axis.

150
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,950
   

151
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,820
So that's where it crosses
the x-axis.

152
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,500
What is the value of a?

153
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,330
OK, so when something crosses
the x-axis, what's

154
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,340
the value of b?

155
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,630
What's the y-value?

156
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,470
Well, the y-value, we know,
is going to be 0, right?

157
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,100
I mean, I could draw that.

158
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:38,400
If I draw coordinates, and
if this is a line,

159
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,049
let me draw the line.

160
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,880
We'll say the line looks
something like this.

161
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,330
Where something crosses the
x-axis, that's going to be

162
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,910
right here, when y equals 0.

163
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,600
So all we have to do is
say that y equals 0

164
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,830
and solve for x.

165
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,600
So y equals 0 is equal
to 5x minus 10.

166
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,750
5x is equal to 10,
x is equal to 2.

167
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,210
So this is the point
right here.

168
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,290
This is the point 2 comma 0.

169
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:15,190
So a is going to be equal to
choice d, which is 2, which is

170
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,610
the answer.

171
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,910
I think that's all the time
I have for in this video,

172
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,930
because the next one
looks like I'll

173
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,200
have to draw a table.

174
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,510
So I will see you soon.

175
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,300
