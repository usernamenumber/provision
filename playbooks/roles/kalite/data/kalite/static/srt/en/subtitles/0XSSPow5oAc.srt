1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,350
In the last video we learned a
little bit about what a chiral

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,730
molecule or what a chiral carbon
or a chiral atom is.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,850
What I want to do in this video
is go through a bunch of

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,920
examples and see if we can
identify if there are any

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,770
chiral atoms and to also
see if we're dealing

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,590
with a chiral molecule.

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,840
So let's look at our
examples here.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,330
So here I have, what is this?

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,580
This is chlorocyclopentane.

11
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,640
   

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,680
So the first question is do
we have any chiral atoms?

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,580
And when we look at our
definition that we thought of

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,160
chiral atoms, it all comes from
this notion of handedness

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,320
and not being able to be
superimposable on your mirror

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,040
image, but we said that they're
usually carbons bonded

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,770
to four different groups.

18
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,160
Let's see, do we have any
carbons here bonded to four

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,000
different groups?

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,350
Well, all the CH2's, they're
bonded to another CH2

21
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,320
and then two H'2.

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,090
I could draw it like
this: H and H.

23
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,500
So they're bonded to two of
the same group, so none of

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,580
these CH2's are good candidates
for being a chiral

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,500
center or chiral carbon.

26
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,160
They're both bonded to-- or all
of them are bonded to two

27
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,620
hydrogens and two other very
similar-looking CH2 groups,

28
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,720
although you have to look
at the entire group

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,480
that it's bonded to.

30
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,970
But they're all definitely
bonded to two hydrogens, so

31
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,660
it's not four different
groups.

32
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,240
If we look at this CH
right here, we could

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,510
separate it out like this.

34
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,510
We could separate the H out like
this, and so since it's

35
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,740
bonded to a hydrogen.

36
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,540
This carbon is bonded to a
chlorine, and then it's bonded

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,340
to-- well, it's not clear when
you look at it right from the

38
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,960
get-go whether this group is
different than this group.

39
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:45,840
But if you go around, if you
were to split it half-way like

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,940
this, or maybe another better
way to think about is if you

41
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,050
were to go around this molecule
in that direction,

42
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,800
the counterclockwise direction,
you would encounter

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,895
a CH2 group, and then you
encounter a CH2 group, and

44
00:01:57,895 --> 00:01:59,510
then you would encounter a
third, and then you would

45
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,360
encounter a fourth CH2 group,
then you would come back to

46
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,190
where you were before.

47
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,180
So you would encounter four
CH2's and then you'd come back

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,320
to where you were before.

49
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,330
If you go in this direction,
what happens?

50
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,200
You encounter one, two, three,
four CH2's and you come back

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,780
to where you were before.

52
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,950
So all of this, this bottom
group, depending on how far

53
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,480
you want to extend it, and this
top group, are really the

54
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,490
same group.

55
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:36,650
So this is not a chiral center
or not a chiral carbon.

56
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,690
It's not bonded to four
different groups.

57
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,610
And this is also not a chiral
molecule, because it does not

58
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,820
have a chiral center.

59
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,970
And to see that it's not a
chiral molecule-- let me see

60
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,610
if I can backtrack this
back to the way I

61
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,060
wrote it right before.

62
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,980
So you see that it's not
a chiral molecule.

63
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,540
There's a couple of ways you
could think about it.

64
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,170
The easiest way, or the way my
brain likes to think about it,

65
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,180
is just to think about
its mirror image.

66
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,720
Its mirror image will
look like this.

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,340
So if that's the mirror, you
would have a chlorine.

68
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:19,460
Then you have a CH, CH2, CH2,
and you have a CH2, CH2, and

69
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,300
then you complete your
cyclopentane.

70
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,470
Now, in this situation, is there
any way to rotate this

71
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,630
to get this over there?

72
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,400
Well, if you just took this
molecule right here and you

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:37,000
just rotated it 180 degrees,
what would it look like?

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,880
Well, maybe a little over--
yeah, well, not quite 180

75
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,550
degrees, but if you were to
rotate it so that the chlorine

76
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,430
goes about that far, you would
get this exact molecule.

77
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,430
You would get something.

78
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,750
It would look a little
bit different.

79
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,040
It would look like this.

80
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,040
Let me see if I can
do it justice.

81
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,350
It would look like this.

82
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,680
You would have a CH2.

83
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,420
So let me let me do it up
here where I have a

84
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,290
little bit more space.

85
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:13,310
If I were to rotate this about
that far, I would get a CH.

86
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:20,890
You get the chlorine and then
you have your CH2, and then

87
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:28,380
you have another CH2, CH2,
and then you would

88
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,760
have your CH2 up there.

89
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,540
If you were to rotate this all
the way around, or actually

90
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,200
this is almost exactly
180 degrees, it

91
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,050
would look like this.

92
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,570
And the only difference between
this and this is just

93
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,870
how we drew this bond here.

94
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,850
I could have easily, instead
of drawing that bond like

95
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,010
that, I could draw it facing
up like that, and these are

96
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,130
the exact same molecule.

97
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:53,100
So this molecule is
also not chiral.

98
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,600
So let's go to this
one over here.

99
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,510
So what is this?

100
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,915
This is a
bromochlorofluoromethane, just

101
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:04,930
to practice our naming
a little bit.

102
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,670
But it's very clear that
we are bonded to

103
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,750
four different groups.

104
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,500
All of the different groups, or
the atoms in this case that

105
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,510
are bonded to this carbon, are
different, so this carbon is a

106
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,760
chiral center.

107
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,140
   

108
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,900
And it should also be pretty
clear that it is

109
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,260
also a chiral molecule.

110
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,010
If you were to take its mirror
image, and this is very

111
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,900
similar to the example we did
in the first video on

112
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,530
chirality, but its mirror image
will look like this.

113
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,360
You have the bromine
on the right now.

114
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,970
The hydrogen is still in
back, and you have the

115
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,040
fluorine above it.

116
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,220
No matter how you try to rotate
this thing, if you try

117
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,690
to get the bromine all the way
over there, all the way to

118
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,770
that position, then the hydrogen
would be in this

119
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,790
position and the chlorine would
be in that position.

120
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,580
And no matter how you try to
flip this around or rotate it

121
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,040
or shift it, you will never be
able superimpose this molecule

122
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,210
on that molecule right there.

123
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,400
So that is a chiral center and
this is a chiral molecule.

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,400
   

125
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,000
And there's a word for
these two versions.

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,770
We're going to go into the
naming of them later on.

127
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,850
It's a little bit
more involved.

128
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,720
We'll have a whole separate
video on it.

129
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,500
But these two versions of
bromochlorofluoromethane, they

130
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,900
sometimes have different
chemical properties.

131
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,150
And these are called
enantiomers.

132
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,650
   

133
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:34,500
And enantiomers are just
the mirror images.

134
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Each enantiomer is a mirror
image of each other, but they

135
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,750
are stereoisomers.

136
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,120
   

137
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,600
This is all just terminology.

138
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,450
Stereoisomers.

139
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,570
You're familiar with the word
isomer, and isomer just means

140
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,570
that you have the same atoms
in your molecule.

141
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,800
But then you have different
types of isomers.

142
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,360
You have constitutional
isomers that say, OK,

143
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,410
different things are connected
to different things.

144
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,510
Stereoisomers, the same
things are all

145
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,520
connected to the same things.

146
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,370
You have a carbon connected to
only a fluorine, a chlorine

147
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,980
connected to the carbon, a
hydrogen connected to the

148
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,840
carbon, a bromine connected
to the carbon.

149
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,500
So all of the same things are
connected to the same things,

150
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,930
but they're a three-dimensional

151
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,860
configuration.

152
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,620
That's where we're dealing
with the stereo part.

153
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,300
Stereochemistry is the study
of three-dimensional

154
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,450
chemistry, as essentially
understanding the actual

155
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,390
three-dimensional structure
of things.

156
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,140
So stereoisomers mean that we
have the same constituents,

157
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,460
the same atoms. They
have the same

158
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,530
connections to each other.

159
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,140
Bromine is still connected
to carbon, which is still

160
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,980
connected to hydrogen.

161
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,160
That's all true over here.

162
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,830
But their three-dimensional

163
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,210
orientation is still different.

164
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,900
And in this case where they
are mirror images of each

165
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,880
other, we call them
enantiomers.

166
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,640
And I should probably make
one clarification.

167
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,160
In the last few videos, I've
been a little bit, you know,

168
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,720
sometimes I'll say configuration
and sometimes I

169
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,860
use the word conformation.

170
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,200
So sometimes I'll use the word
configuration and sometimes I

171
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,200
use the word conformation, and
I actually should be a little

172
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,650
bit more, or I should have been
a little bit more exact

173
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,380
about these.

174
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,770
When you're talking about a
configuration, you're actually

175
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,310
talking about a different
structure.

176
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,205
To go from one configuration to
another configuration, you

177
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:23,150
would actually have to
break bonds and kind

178
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:23,940
of reassemble them.

179
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,320
So these are different
configurations.

180
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,000
Because in order for them to be
able to be the same thing,

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,010
you would have to swap maybe the
bromine and the hydrogen

182
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,679
in there where they are relative
to the carbon, so

183
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,450
these are different
configurations.

184
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,940
Confirmations are really just
different shapes or different

185
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,880
orientations of the
same molecule.

186
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,840
So when we talked about
cyclohexane being in a boat,

187
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,590
so this is cyclohexane being
in a boat conformation, or

188
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,910
this is cyclohexane being in a
chair conformation, it's the

189
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,170
exact same molecule with the
exact same connections.

190
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,340
We didn't detach any bonds
or reattach any bonds.

191
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,100
They just flipped around
a little bit.

192
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,720
So these are two different
conformations.

193
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,820
These are two different
configurations.

194
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,090
To go from one configuration
to another, you have to

195
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,940
rearrange bonds.

196
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,630
Now let's look at this
molecule over here.

197
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,210
Can we identify any
stereocenters or chiral

198
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,860
carbons or chiral atoms?

199
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,520
And you have this carbon
right here.

200
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,130
Let's see, this carbon right
here is bonded to a chlorine,

201
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,700
a hydrogen, a bromine, and
then another carbon.

202
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,880
So this is bonded to four
different things, so this is a

203
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,940
chiral carbon.

204
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,000
Sometimes they put a little
asterisk there.

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,390
If we look at this carbon right
here you can-- well,

206
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,340
it's bonded to a fluorine and
another carbon, but it's

207
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,790
bonded to two hydrogens,
so it's not chiral.

208
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,100
It has two of the same things
that it's bonded to.

209
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,390
You can even see a little axis
of symmetry through it.

210
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,840
If you look at that, you can
kind of flip it over, and it's

211
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,860
going to be the same thing.

212
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,820
But this one right here, that
is a chiral center.

213
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,900
That is a chiral center, or
chiral carbon, or chiral atom,

214
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,550
or asymmetric carbon.

215
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,350
You'll see it used in
different ways.

216
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,120
And because this molecule has
got that chiral center, you'll

217
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,930
see that if you were to take its
mirror image, it would be

218
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,000
an enantiomer.

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,560
This is not superimposable
on its mirror image.

220
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,690
We could even try to draw it.

221
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,880
And just so you know, you don't
always have to do the

222
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,660
mirror image on the
right side.

223
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,210
We can draw the mirror image
on the left side.

224
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,720
So if we want to draw
its mirror image, it

225
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,490
would look like this.

226
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:28,420
You would have a fluorine,
carbon, carbon, chlorine.

227
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,180
You have your two hydrogens,
and then you would have a

228
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,020
hydrogen here, and then you
would have your bromine here.

229
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,890
No matter what you try to do, if
you try to flip this around

230
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,670
or whatever, you will never be
able superimpose this on top

231
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,670
of this, so these
are enantiomers.

232
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,450
These are both stereoisomers
relative to each other.

233
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,270
And either of these, regardless
of which one you

234
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,520
pick, are chiral molecules.

235
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,220
   

236
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,740
I'm over the time that I
normally want to go in the

237
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,360
video, so in the next video
I'll do even more.

238
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,533
