1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,830
We're on problem 13.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:11,520
And they say if 4x is equal to
6u, which is equal to 5v,

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,670
which is equal to 7w, all of
which is greater than 0, which

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,210
of the following is true.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,243
So they're essentially wanting
you to order w to-- they want

7
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:27,670
you to order these terms in
order from least to greatest.

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,710
So one thing I'm going to do,
let me order these terms, the

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,900
coefficients from least to
greatest. That's the same

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,330
thing as 4x is equal to 5v,
which is equal to 6u, which is

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,840
equal to 7w.

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,290
They're all greater than 0.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,290
So what's going to be
greater, x or w?

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,350
So if I have 4 of something
and that equals 7 of this

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,090
thing, this is going to be
the smallest, right?

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,340
Think of it this way.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,590
   

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,990
If x was 7, then w would be 4.

19
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,330
Try that out.

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,660
If x was 7 and this term would
be 28, the w would be 4.

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,920
So w is the smallest. And by
that same principle, u is

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,800
going to be next.

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,780
So w is less than u, which
is less than v, which

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,990
is less than x.

25
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,790
And it's just on the principle,
if it takes me 7 of

26
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,080
something to make up the 4 of
something else, this thing has

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,900
to be bigger because I
need fewer of it to

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,000
make 7 of this thing.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,430
And by the same logic u is less
than v, right, because

30
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,640
you need 6 of that thing
to make one of v.

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,550
I mean if you really wanted to
kind of try it out you could

32
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,100
divide all of these by 4 and
you'd get x is equal to 5/4v,

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,710
which is equal to 6/4u, which
is equal to 7/4w.

34
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,800
All of these terms are
greater than 1.

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,560
So x is more than
all of these.

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,800
And you could do it for all of
these and you would see that

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,380
same order.

38
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,655
That whichever one has the
highest coefficient is going

39
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:01,320
to be the smallest number, and
then the next smallest is

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,700
going to be u, then v, then x.

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,210
So let's see what choice that
is. w is less than u, which is

42
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,780
less than u, which
is less than x.

43
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,930
That's choice D.

44
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,800
Problem 14.

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,210
Let the function h be defined by
h of t is equal to 2 times

46
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,910
t cubed minus 3.

47
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:33,280
When h of t is equal to minus
60, so h of t is equal to

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,730
minus 60, what is 2 minus 3t?

49
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,280
What is 2 minus 3t.

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,260
So let's see what
we can do here.

51
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,452
2 minus 3t.

52
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:53,710
So h of t is equal to minus 60,
so minus 60 is equal to 2

53
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:59,210
times t cubed minus 3.

54
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,810
Fair enough.

55
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,410
And then divide both
sides by 2.

56
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,460
I'm just trying to see where
I can go with this.

57
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,650
Divide both sides by 2.

58
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:13,350
So you get minus 30 is equal
to t cubed minus 3.

59
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,050
Add 3 to both sides you get
minus 27 is equal to t cubed.

60
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,450
This is pretty straightforward.

61
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,960
Something to the third power
is equal to minus 27.

62
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,920
Well what's the cubed
root of 27?

63
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,680
It's 3.

64
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,830
So the cubed root of minus
27 is minus 3.

65
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,360
So t is equal to minus 3.

66
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,100
And you could try that out.

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,430
What's minus 3 to
the third power?

68
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,140
Minus 3 times minus 3 is 9 times
minus 3 is minus 27.

69
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,340
So when h of t is minus 60,
t is equal to minus 3.

70
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,810
And so what is 2 minus 3t, which
is what they asked us

71
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,285
originally?

72
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:51,670
It's going to be 2 minus
3 times minus 3.

73
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:58,790
So it's 2 minus minus 9 or 2
plus 9, which is equal to 11.

74
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,910
And that is choice B.

75
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,160
Next problem.

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,410
   

77
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,840
I'll switch colors.

78
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,100
Where was I?

79
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,770
My brain is fried from doing all
of these SAT problems. But

80
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,430
I figure I do it once an it'll
be there forever for students

81
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,589
for the rest of eternity to
learn SAT problems and compete

82
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,220
with my future children and
they'll be [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

83
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,630
Problem 15.

84
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,410
If x is divisible by 3 and y
is divisible by 5, which of

85
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,630
the following must be
divisible by 15?

86
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:37,040
So x divisible by 3, so x is a
multiple of 3-- you can view

87
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,130
it that way.

88
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,130
y is the divisible by 5.

89
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,970
Which of the following must
also be divisible by 15?

90
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,710
Do you know how I'm
going to do it?

91
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,400
I'm going to say look, you could
write x is equal to 3k

92
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,660
where k is some integer.

93
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,120
We don't know what multiple x
is of 3, but we know 3 times

94
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,270
some integer, k,
is equal to x.

95
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,550
And similarly, you could say y
is equal to 5, I don't know,

96
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,690
5m where you could say
some integer m times

97
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,550
5 is equal to y.

98
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,960
Because we know that 5 times
something's equal to y.

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,510
That's what divisible means.

100
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,520
So let's look at the choices.

101
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,890
1.

102
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,090
They want to know which
are the ones that are

103
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,350
divisible by 15.

104
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,170
So choice 1 is x times y.

105
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:25,540
Well x times y is the same
thing as 3k times 5m.

106
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,530
And that's the same
thing as 15km.

107
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,430
So xy is the same thing as 15
times a product of integers,

108
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,040
and the product of two integers
is going to be an

109
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,330
integer, right?

110
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,560
So this is definitely
divisible by 15.

111
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,720
So choice 1 is divisible
by 15.

112
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,970
Problem 2.

113
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,750
   

114
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,930
3x plus 5y.

115
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,260
So we could do the same thing.

116
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:03,610
x is 3k, so that's 3 times 3k
plus 5y plus 5 times 5m.

117
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,350
   

118
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,210
That equals 9k plus 25m.

119
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,270
This isn't necessarily
divisible by 15.

120
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,810
I mean what if k and
m are both 1?

121
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,680
Then you get 34 and-- this
is not divisible by 15.

122
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,930
Choice 3.

123
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,730
   

124
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,700
5x plus 3y.

125
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,510
Doing the same thing.

126
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,600
That equals 5 times 3k,
right, this is x.

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,360
5 times 3k plus 3 times 5m.

128
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,480
And this equals 15k plus 15m.

129
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,670
An you can factor out the 15.

130
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,020
That's 15 times k plus m.

131
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,270
And once again, so this thing is
equal to 15 times k plus m.

132
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,900
k plus m is going to
be some integer.

133
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,760
We said k and m are
both integers.

134
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,420
So this term right here is
definitely divisible by 15.

135
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,720
So one and three
are our answer.

136
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,940
And that is choice D.

137
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,070
And you know, if you didn't want
to do this fancy stuff

138
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,720
where you say it's multiplying
by some integer,

139
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,160
et cetera, et cetera.

140
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,090
Just x is divisible by 3, y is
divisible by 5, well let's

141
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,810
just say x is equal to 3
and y is equal to 5 and

142
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,920
then try them out.

143
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,090
Then xy is going to be 15,
which is, of course,

144
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,810
divisible by 15.

145
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,670
This would be, let's see, 3
times 3 plus 5 times 5, this

146
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,620
would be 34.

147
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,380
Not divisible by 15.

148
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,205
And then the final one, 3 times
5 is 15 plus 3 times 5

149
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:35,970
is 15, this would be 30, which
is divisible by 15.

150
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,950
So that would have been the
quick and dirty, not

151
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,920
necessarily the most
mathematically rigorous way of

152
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,170
doing it, but it would have
gotten you the right answer.

153
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,400
And that really is what matters,
I guess, on the SAT.

154
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,610
   

155
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,455
That would have been the quick
and dirty solution.

156
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:55,900
Let me see if I can
draw this thing.

157
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,920
One line like that.

158
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,270
One line like that.

159
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,900
One line something like that.

160
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,460
And what do they tell
us about this?

161
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,750
I'll use yellow.

162
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:14,020
They tell us that this angle
right here is 115 degrees.

163
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,910
This is line l.

164
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,290
This is z degrees.

165
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,190
Line m, line n, and
this is y degrees.

166
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,730
Looks like we're going to have
to play the angle game here.

167
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,920
This is y degrees.

168
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,370
In the figure above
what is y plus z?

169
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,039
   

170
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,370
So when I play the angle game
I just try to figure out as

171
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,750
many sides as I can.

172
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,330
So if this is 115 what
is this going to be?

173
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,320
Well 115 plus this
supplementary, right?

174
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,440
So these are going to add up to
be 180, so this is going to

175
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,380
be 180 minus 115.

176
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,070
What's 80 minus 15?

177
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,910
It's 65, right, because
80 minus 10 is 70.

178
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,010
So this is 65 degrees.

179
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,720
And I just said that because
this angle plus

180
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,390
this has to be 180.

181
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,370
Now what is this angle
right here?

182
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,760
This angle right here is going
to be 180 minus y for the same

183
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,650
reason because it's
supplementary to y.

184
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:15,330
This angle here, same reason,
it's going to be 180 minus z.

185
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,690
And we know that this angle
plus this angle plus this

186
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,680
angle has to add up to 180.

187
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:29,060
So 65 plus 180 minus y plus 180
minus z is equal to 180.

188
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:35,150
Let's see, so that's-- you could
subtract 180 from both

189
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,770
sides, you get a 0 here.

190
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,740
What's 65 plus 180?

191
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:47,160
65 plus 180 is 245 minus y
minus z, is equal to 0.

192
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,110
Add y and z to both sides, you
get 245 is equal to y plus z.

193
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,780
And that is choice E.

194
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,600
See you in the next video.

195
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:57,800
