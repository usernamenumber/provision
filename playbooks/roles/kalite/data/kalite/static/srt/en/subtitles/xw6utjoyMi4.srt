1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
   

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,440
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,430
Now let's do a problem that
involves almost everything

4
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,460
we've learned so far about
probability and combinations

5
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,880
and conditional probability.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,485
So let's say I
have a bag again.

7
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:17,700
And in that bag, I have
5 fair coins, and I

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,060
have 10 unfair coins.

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,960
   

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,580
And a fair coin, of course, is
a 50:50 chance of getting heads

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,930
or tails, and the unfair coin--
let's say that there is an 80%

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,240
chance of getting a heads for
any one of those coins,

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,110
and that there is a 20%
chance of getting tails.

14
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,350
Right?

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,020
Because it's going to
either be heads or tails.

16
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,160
So my question is, what happens
is I put my hand in the bag,

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,430
and my eyes are closed,
and I picked out a coin.

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,055
And then I flip it six times.

19
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:55,090
   

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,380
Let's say I got four
out of six heads.

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,620
That's the result I got.

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,530
What I want to know is, what is
the probability that I picked

23
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,040
out a fair coin, given that I
got four out of six heads?

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,550
   

25
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,430
So before moving on, let's do a
little bit of review of Bayes'

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,490
Theorem, and I think that'll
give us a good framework for

27
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,090
the rest of this problem.

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,760
So Bayes' Theorem-- and let me
do it in this corner up here.

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,210
Bayes' Theorem tells us
the probability of both

30
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,610
a and b happening.

31
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,250
That upside down u is just an
intersection in set theory, but

32
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,930
it's essentially saying, you
know, it's a set of events in

33
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,340
which both a and b occur.

34
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,810
That's equal to the probability
of a occurring given b, times

35
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:49,660
the probability of b, which is
also equal to the probability

36
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:55,655
of b occurring given a,
times the probability of a.

37
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:58,450
And I think this should make
some intuition for you.

38
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,570
If it doesn't, it might be
a good idea to watch the

39
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,450
conditional probability videos.

40
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,970
But what we can do is we can
rearrange this equation right

41
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,115
here to get-- if we just divide
both sides by the probability

42
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:13,280
of b, we get the probability--
and I'll do this in a vibrant

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,910
color-- the probability of a
given b is equal to the

44
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:27,770
probability of b given a, times
the probability of a divided

45
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,530
by the probability of b.

46
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,530
I just took this equation,
divided both sides by the

47
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,560
probability of b,
and I got this.

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,250
So what is a and b in the
problem we're trying

49
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,610
to figure out?

50
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,470
We're want to try to figure out
the probability that I picked

51
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,810
out a fair coin, given that I
got four out of six heads.

52
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,250
So in this situation, a is
that I got a fair coin.

53
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,850
a is equal to picked fair coin.

54
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,090
   

55
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,450
And then b is equal to
four out of six heads.

56
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,240
   

57
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,440
So in order to figure out the
probability that I picked a

58
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,360
fair coin, given that I got
four out of six heads, I have

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,620
to know the probability of
getting four out of six heads

60
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,120
given that I picked the fair
coin, times the probability of

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,870
picking out a fair coin,
divided by the probability of

62
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,250
getting four out of six
heads, in general.

63
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,990
So this is probably the
hardest part to figure out.

64
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,710
And we will-- along the way--
we will actually probably

65
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,830
figure out the top 2 terms.

66
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,680
So what's the probability of b,
or the probability of getting

67
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,800
four out of six heads?

68
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,290
Let's see what happens.

69
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,110
Right when I put my hand into
the bag and I pick out a coin,

70
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,470
there is a five in fifteen
chance-- right, there are 15

71
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,630
total coins-- that I
pick a fair coin.

72
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,550
So five in fifteen-- that's
the same thing as 1/3--

73
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,440
that I pick a fair coin.

74
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,860
And then there's a 2/3 chance
that I pick an unfair coin.

75
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,730
Now if I pick a fair coin,
given that I have a fair coin,

76
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,710
what is the probability
given the fair coin?

77
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,520
What is the probability that
I get four out of six heads?

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,420
   

79
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,460
Well, once again, let's
think about the previous

80
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,080
several videos.

81
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,690
What's the probability of
getting any one particular

82
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,150
combination of four
out of six heads?

83
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,950
So, for example, you know,
it could be heads, tails,

84
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,585
heads, tails, heads, heads.

85
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,500
   

86
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,380
It could be the first four
heads: heads, heads, heads,

87
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,560
heads, tails, tails.

88
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:35,750
Right?

89
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,890
And there are a bunch of these,
and we once again will use the

90
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,050
binomial coefficient, or we'll
use our knowledge of

91
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,450
combinations to figure
out how many different

92
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,340
combinations there are.

93
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,040
But what's the probability of
each of these combinations?

94
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Well, what's the
probability of heads?

95
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,030
That's .5 times .5
times .5 times .5.

96
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,330
And the probability of
tails, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

97
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,460
is also .5 times .5 times .5.

98
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,660
So each of these-- there's a
1/2 chance of getting a heads,

99
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,510
times a 1/2 chance of a tails,
times a 1/2 chance of a heads,

100
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,600
times 1/2 chance of a tails,
et cetera, et cetera.

101
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,990
So each of these are
essentially 1/2 times

102
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,910
1/2, six times.

103
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,070
So the probability of each
of the combinations is

104
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,380
1/2 to the sixth power.

105
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,830
   

106
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,190
And so how many combinations
are there like this?

107
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,370
Where you get-- out of the six
flips, you're essentially

108
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,150
choosing four heads.

109
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,550
You're choosing-- if I'm once
again the God of probability--

110
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,550
I'm picking four, exactly
four, of the six heads.

111
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,630
Sorry, I'm picking four of
exactly six of the flips

112
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,940
to end up heads, right?

113
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,060
I'm choosing which of the flips
get selected, so to speak.

114
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:50,480
So it's essentially, there are
going to be-- out of six flips,

115
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,090
I'm choosing, as the God of
probability-- four to be heads.

116
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,230
So that's the number of unique
combinations, where you have

117
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,120
four out of six heads, times
the probability of each of

118
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,670
the combinations, which is
1/2 to the sixth power.

119
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,610
Well, what's 6 choose 4?

120
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,830
That's 6 factorial over
4 factorial times 6

121
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,880
minus 4 factorial.

122
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,840
So that's 2 factorial.

123
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,630
   

124
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,620
And that's times
1/2 to the sixth.

125
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,530
I'm going to switch
colors again, just to

126
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,370
stop the monotony.

127
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:33,580
And that equals 6 times 5 times
4 times 3 times 2-- we don't

128
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,020
have to write the 1 times 1,
but I'll do it anyway--

129
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,720
over 4 factorial.

130
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,980
4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

131
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,930
And then 2 factorial.

132
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,490
2 times 1.

133
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,320
So that cancels with that.

134
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,850
The 1 we can ignore.

135
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,530
2, divide the numerator
and denominator by 2,

136
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,950
and this becomes 3.

137
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,560
So this becomes 15.

138
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,720
So this equals 15 times
1/2 to the sixth.

139
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,690
What's 1/2 to the sixth?

140
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,550
It's 1/64, right?

141
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,770
So 1/64, so it becomes 15/64.

142
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,590
So the probability of getting
four out of six heads, given a

143
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,190
fair coin, is 15 out of 64.

144
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:19,740
   

145
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,225
And if you look at it, based on
our definition of b and a, this

146
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:26,560
is the probability
of b given a.

147
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,590
Right? b is four out of six
heads, given a fair coin.

148
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,850
Fair enough.

149
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,600
So let's figure out the
probability of-- because

150
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,690
there's two ways of getting
four out of six heads.

151
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,710
One, that we picked a
fair coin, and then

152
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,070
times 15 out of 64.

153
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,960
And then there's the
probability that we

154
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,080
picked an unfair coin.

155
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,490
So what's the probability
of the unfair coin?

156
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,670
Of getting four out of six
heads, given the unfair coin?

157
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,930
Well, once again, what's the
probability of each of the

158
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,410
combinations where we
got four out of six?

159
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,740
So in this situation,
let's do the same one.

160
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,680
Heads, tails, heads,
tails, heads, heads.

161
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,860
That's four out of six heads.

162
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,930
But in this situation, it's not
a 50% chance of getting heads.

163
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,630
It's 80%.

164
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:16,090
So it would be .8 times
.2 times .8 times .2

165
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,170
times .8 times .8.

166
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,410
Now, essentially, we have-- you
know, this multiplication, we

167
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,060
can rearrange it, because it
doesn't matter what order

168
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,290
you multiply things in.

169
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:32,470
So it's .8 to the fourth
power times .2 squared.

170
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,080
And it doesn't matter.

171
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,050
You know, any of the unique
combinations will each have

172
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,910
the same probability.

173
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,510
Because we can just rearrange
the order in which we multiply.

174
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,520
And then how many of these
combinations are there?

175
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,480
If we are, once again, the God
of probability, and out of six

176
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,950
flips we're picking four--
we're choosing four that

177
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,860
are going to end up heads?

178
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,600
How many ways can I
pick a group of four?

179
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,220
Well, once again, that's
times 6 choose 4.

180
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,320
We figured out what that is.

181
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,290
6 choose 4 is 15.

182
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:13,365
So this equals 15 times .8 to
the fourth times .2 squared.

183
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:16,520
   

184
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:24,430
And this is the probability
of four out of six heads,

185
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,990
given an unfair coin.

186
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,740
So what's the total
probability of getting

187
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,430
four out of six heads?

188
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,820
Well, it's going to be the
probability of getting the fair

189
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,700
coin-- which is 1/3-- times the
probability of getting four out

190
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:47,540
of six heads, given the fair
coin-- and that's this 15/64.

191
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,260
Plus the probability of getting
an unfair coin-- 2/3-- times

192
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,610
the probability of getting four
out of six heads, given the

193
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,550
unfair coin-- and that's
what we figured out here.

194
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:07,562
Times 15 times .8 to the
fourth, times .2 squared.

195
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:09,950
And this is the probability of
getting four out of six heads.

196
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,580
And let's figure
out what that is.

197
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,910
This'll cancel out with this.

198
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,450
This becomes 5 out of
64, that's easy enough.

199
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,470
2/3 times 15, that's 10.

200
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,540
And now we just have to
figure out what that is.

201
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,900
Let's see, I'm going to go over
the time limit to see if being

202
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,980
a Youtube partner allows me
to go over the time limit.

203
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:40,370
.8 times .8 times .8 times
.8 is equal to-- and

204
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,950
then times .2 squared.

205
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:48,120
So times .2 times .2
is equal to .016.

206
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,150
So that's that.

207
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,580
And we said times 10, right?

208
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,460
Because 2/3 times 15.

209
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:59,950
So, times 10, is
equal to 16.384%.

210
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,630
So the probability is-- so this
term right here-- let me write

211
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:12,140
that down, and I'll switch
colors again-- this is .16384.

212
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,040
And we're going to add
that to 5 divided by 64.

213
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,290
So let's see.

214
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:24,460
5 divided by 64 is equal to
.07, whatever, whatever.

215
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:32,770
Plus .16384 is
equal to .241965.

216
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,860
So that's the probability-- not
knowing which coin I picked

217
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,250
out-- that's the probability of
getting four out of six heads.

218
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,230
When you combine them you know?

219
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,310
It could be 1/3 chance
fair, 2/3 chance unfair.

220
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:50,440
So that's 24.19-- I'm keeping
the precision, just because it

221
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,430
might come in useful
later-- % chance.

222
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,310
So that's the probability of b.

223
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,730
So let's see if we can clean
this up a little bit, just

224
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,990
because I don't think we need
all of this writing now.

225
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,050
I think we're ready to
substitute into the Bayes'

226
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,640
formula, which we-- Bayes'
Theorem-- that we rederived.

227
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,980
Nope, that's not what
I wanted to do.

228
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,110
   

229
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,370
Recording longer videos is
dangerous because if I

230
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,130
make a mistake that's
more time wasted.

231
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,820
I don't want to delete anything
that could be useful.

232
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,770
   

233
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,750
OK.

234
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,650
So let's see if we can solve
the probability that we picked

235
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,400
a fair coin, given that we
got four out of six heads.

236
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,880
So that is going to be equal
to-- by Bayes' Theorem, which

237
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,620
should make some sense to
you-- that is equal to the

238
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,820
probability of b given a.

239
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:48,040
So it's the probability that we
get four out of six heads,

240
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,060
given a fair coin, times the
probability of a fair coin,

241
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,660
over the probability of
getting four out of

242
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,090
six heads either way.

243
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,480
So four out of six heads, given
a fair coin-- we figured that

244
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,270
over here-- that's 15/64.

245
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,540
So this equals 15/64.

246
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,240
What's the probability that
we picked a fair coin?

247
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,110
Well, there's 15 coins and 5
of them are fair, so it's

248
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,860
5 out of 15, so it's 1/3.

249
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,040
So times 1/3.

250
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,110
And what's the probability
that, in general, we picked

251
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,250
four out of six heads?

252
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:26,115
Well that's this
number: .241965.

253
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:33,720
So this equals-- let's see,
this is equal to 5/64 divided

254
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,690
by .241965, and what
does that equal to?

255
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,520
   

256
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:58,380
That's 5 divided by 64 divided
by .241965 is equal to 32.--

257
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:05,170
well, roughly 3%--
is equal to 32.3%.

258
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,790
So that's amazing.

259
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,290
Or relatively amazing.

260
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,970
It's a little bit less than a
1/3 shot that we picked the

261
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,730
fair coin, given that we
got four out of six heads.

262
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,480
And what's interesting is, the
four out of six heads, it kind

263
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,880
of decreased the probability
that we got a fair coin.

264
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,800
Because before having any data
on what happens when we flip

265
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,560
it, we would have had
a 1/3 probability.

266
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,130
Which is 33.3, right?

267
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:36,860
But given that we got more
heads than tails, the universal

268
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,280
probability is telling us that,
well, if you got more heads

269
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,340
then tails, that makes it a
little bit more likely that you

270
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,220
picked the unfair coin, which
is a little bit more

271
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,090
weighted to heads.

272
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,240
But it's saying it's not that
much more likely, because this

273
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,870
isn't that unusual of a result
to get, even with a fair coin.

274
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,230
So that's why it became a
little bit less likely

275
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,380
to get a fair coin.

276
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,420
And let me give you a bit
of an intuition, visually,

277
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,840
kind of with Set Theory,
on why that makes sense.

278
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,850
   

279
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,450
So if we go back to Bayes'
Theorem-- let's just say

280
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:22,180
that this is the universe
of all of the events.

281
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,060
That's all of the universe.

282
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,490
There's roughly a 1/3 chance
that I picked a fair coin.

283
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,320
So roughly 1/3 of
this will be fair.

284
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,040
This is fair, this is unfair.

285
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,590
And then if I picked a fair
coin, we figured out there's

286
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,830
roughly a 15 out of 64
shot that I get four

287
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,460
out of six heads.

288
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,732
So maybe that's this little
section of this-- let me do

289
00:15:44,732 --> 00:15:45,470
it in a different color.

290
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,250
That's this section.

291
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,200
And then we figured out if we
have an unfair coin-- I forgot

292
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,590
what the exact number is-- but
there was some probability that

293
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,720
we get four out of six heads.

294
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,160
It's actually a little bit
bigger, it's like that.

295
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,090
So this is getting four out
of six heads, given you

296
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,230
got an unfair coin.

297
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,940
This is getting four out
of six heads, given that

298
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,290
you got a fair coin.

299
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,680
And then this whole area is
the probability that you

300
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,110
get four out of six heads.

301
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,530
So all Bayes' Theorem
told us is, look, we got

302
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,470
four out of six heads.

303
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,590
So we're in this universe where
we got four out of six heads.

304
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,570
And if we got four out of six
heads, 1/3 of this universe--

305
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,850
roughly, or 32.3% of this
subset of four out of six

306
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,620
heads-- intersects with
the fair coin universe.

307
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:38,370
So this 32.3% is essentially
this fraction of the total

308
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,740
probability of getting
four out of six heads.

309
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,240
Anyway, hopefully that gave you
a little bit of intuition.

310
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,170
And I hope that Youtube lets me
publish this video, because

311
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,100
I'm on my 17th minute.

312
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,370
I'll see you in the next video.

313
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:51,500
