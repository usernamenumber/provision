1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,340
The last video was very
abstract in general, and

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,980
I used you know, f of x
and g of t, and h of t.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,720
What I want to do in this video
is do an actual example.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,730
Let's say I have f of xy.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,325
Let's say that f of
xy is equal to xy.

7
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:20,595
And let's say that we have
a path in the xy plane, or

8
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:21,775
a curve in the xy plane.

9
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:29,480
And I'm going to define my
curve by x being equal to

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,430
cosine of t, and y being
equal to sine of t.

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,090
And we're going to go from--
you know, we have to define

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,740
what are our boundaries in our
t --and we're going to go from

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,800
t is equal to 0-- or t is going
to be greater than or equal to

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,930
0 --and then less
than or equal to.

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,340
We're going to deal in
radians, pi over 2.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,370
If this was degrees, that
would be 90 degrees.

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,440
So that's our curve.

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,860
And immediately you might
already know what this type

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,770
of a curve looks like.

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,900
And I'm going to draw that
really fast right here in and

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,110
we'll try to visualize this.

22
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,120
I've actually drafted
ahead of time so that

23
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,590
we can visualize this.

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,530
So this curve right here, if I
were to just draw it in the

25
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,530
standard xy plane-- do that in
a different color so we can

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,430
make the curve green; let's say
that is y, and this is right

27
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:24,400
here x --so when t is equal
to 0, x is going to be

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,310
equal to cosine of 0.

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,620
Cosine of 0 is 1, y is going to
be equal to sine of 0, which

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,500
is 0, so t is equal to 0.

31
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,650
We're going to be at x equal to
1, that's cosine of 0, and y is

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,706
sine of 0, or y is going to
be 0, so we're going

33
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:40,500
to be right there.

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,380
That's what t is equal
to; t is equal to 0.

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,990
When t is equal to pi of 2,
what's going to happen?

36
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,000
Cosine of pie over 2--
that's the angle; cosine

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,270
of pi over 2 --is 0.

38
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,010
Sine of pi over 2 is 1.

39
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,270
We're going to be
at the point 0, 1.

40
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,410
So this is when we're at
t is equal to pi over 2.

41
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,340
You might recognize what we're
going to draw is actually the

42
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,080
first quadrant of the unit
circle; when t is equal to pi

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,530
over 4, or 45 degrees, we're
going to be at square root

44
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,240
of 2, square root of 2.

45
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,860
You can try it out for
yourself, but we're just

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,360
going to have a curve
that looks like this.

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,050
It's going to be the
top right of a circle,

48
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,915
of the units circle.

49
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:20,280
It's going to have radius 1.

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,670
And we're going to go in that
direction, from t is equal to

51
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,830
0, to t is equal to pi over 2.

52
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,300
That's what this
curve looks like.

53
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,240
But our goal isn't here just to
graph a parametric equation.

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,680
What we want to do is raise a
fence out of this kind of base

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,685
and rise it to this surface.

56
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:41,570
So let's see if we can do that
or at least visualize it first,

57
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,740
and then we'll use the tools
we used in the last video.

58
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:51,210
So right here I've graphed this
function, and I've rotated it a

59
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,230
little bit so you can
see [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

60
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,010
case.

61
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,080
This right here-- let me get
some dark colors out --that

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,680
right there is the x axis, that
in the back is the y axis, and

63
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,560
the vertical axis
is the z axis.

64
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,330
And this is actually 2, this
is 1 right here, y equal 1

65
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,310
is right there, so this
is graphed that way.

66
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,030
So if I were to graphs this
contour in the xy plane, it

67
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,900
would be under this graph and
it would go like something like

68
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,110
this--- let me see if I can
draw it --it would look

69
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,730
something like this.

70
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,800
This would be on the xy plane.

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,300
This is the same exact graph,
f of x is equal to xy.

72
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,080
This is f of x; f of
xy is equal to xy.

73
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,480
That's both of these,
I just rotated it.

74
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,170
In this situation that right
there is now the x axis.

75
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,380
I rotated to the left,
you can kind of imagine.

76
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,080
That right there is the x axis,
that right there is the y

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,710
axis-- it was rotated closer
to me --that's the z axis.

78
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,630
And then this curve, if I were
to draw in this rotation, is

79
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,260
going to look like this: when t
is equal to 0, we're at x is

80
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,420
equal to 1, y is equal to 0,
and it's going to form a unit

81
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,000
circle, or half or quarter
of a unit circle like that.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,745
And when t is equal to pi over
2, we're going to get there.

83
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,590
And what we want to do
is find the area of the

84
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,680
curtain that's defined.

85
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,030
So let's see, let's raise
a curtain from this

86
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,730
curve up to f of xy.

87
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,930
So if we keep raising walls
from this up to xy, we're

88
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,929
going to have a wall looks
something like that.

89
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:22,690
   

90
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,590
Let me shade it in, color
it in so it looks a little

91
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,660
bit more substantive.

92
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,530
So a wall that looks
something like that.

93
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,850
If I were to try to do it here
this would be under the

94
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,560
ceiling, but the wall
look something like

95
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,680
that right there.

96
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,440
We want to find
the area of that.

97
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,400
We want to find the area of
this right here where the base

98
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,160
is defined by this curves, and
then the ceiling is defined by

99
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,550
this surface here, xy, which I
graphed and I rotated

100
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,270
in two situations.

101
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,940
Now in the last video we came
up with a, well, you could

102
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,230
argue whether it's simple, but
the is, well, let's just take

103
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,000
small arc lengths-- change in
arc lengths, and multiply them

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,300
by the height at that point.

105
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,910
And those small change in arc
lengths, we called them ds,

106
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,050
and then the height is just
f of xy at that point.

107
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,600
And we'll take an infinite sum
of these, from t is equal to 0

108
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,660
to t will equal pi over 2, and
then that should give us

109
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,640
the area of this wall.

110
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,510
So we said is, well, to figure
out the area of that we're just

111
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:28,670
going to take the integral from
t is equal to o to t is equal

112
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,750
to pi over 2-- it doesn't make
a lot of sense when I write it

113
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,935
like this --of f of xy times--
or let me even better, instead

114
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:41,300
of writing f of xy, let me just
write the actual function.

115
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,110
Let's get a little
bit more concrete.

116
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,710
So f of xy is xy times-- so the
particular xy --times the

117
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,520
little change in our arc
length at that point.

118
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,030
I'm going to be very
hand-wavy here.

119
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,290
This is all a little bit
review of the last video.

120
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,890
And we figured out in the last
video this change in arc length

121
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:04,990
right here, ds, we figured out
that we could rewrite that as

122
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,250
the square root of the dx
versus-- or the derivative of x

123
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,480
with respect to t squared
--plus the derivative of y with

124
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,090
respect to t squared, and
then all of that times dt.

125
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,790
So I'm just rebuilding
the formula that we

126
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,590
got in the last video.

127
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,090
So this expression can be
rewritten as the integral

128
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:33,640
from t is equal to 0 to t is
equal to pi over 2 times xy.

129
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,160
But you know what?

130
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,170
Right from the get go we
want everything eventually

131
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,070
be in terms of t.

132
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,070
So instead of writing x
times y, let's substitute

133
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,170
the parametric form.

134
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,720
So instead of x let's
write cosine of t.

135
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,180
   

136
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,370
That is x.

137
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,980
x is equal to cosine
of t on this curve.

138
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,700
That's how we define x, in
terms of the parameter t.

139
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,250
And then times y, which
we're saying is sine of t.

140
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,830
   

141
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,360
That's our y; all I
did is rewrote xy in

142
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,310
terms of t times ds.

143
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:16,170
ds is this; it's the square
root of the derivative of x

144
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,690
with respect to t squared plus
the derivative of y with

145
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,950
respect to t squared.

146
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,630
All of that times dt.

147
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,380
And now we just have to find
these two derivatives.

148
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,670
And it might seem really hard,
but it's very easy for us to

149
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,180
find the derivative of x with
respect to t and the derivative

150
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,360
of y with respect to t.

151
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,860
I can do it right or down here.

152
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,320
Let me lose our graphs
for a little bit.

153
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,600
We know that the derivative of
x with respect to t is just

154
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,620
going to be: what's the
derivative of cosine of t?

155
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,790
Well, it's minus sine of t.

156
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,000
And the derivative of
y was respect to t?

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,510
   

158
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,670
Derivative of a sine of
anything is the cosine

159
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,125
of that anything.

160
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,450
So it's cosine of t.

161
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,330
And we can substitute these
back into this equation.

162
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,250
So remember, we're just trying
to find the area of this

163
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,020
curtain that has our curve here
as kind of its base, and

164
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,700
has this function, this
surface as it's ceiling.

165
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,460
So we go back down here,
and let me rewrite

166
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,240
this whole thing.

167
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,090
So this becomes the integral
from t is equal to o to t is

168
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,700
equal to pi over 2-- I don't
like this color --of cosine of

169
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,290
t, sine of t, cosine times
sine-- that's just the xy

170
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,900
--times ds, which is this
expression right here.

171
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,110
And now we can write this as--
I'll go switch back to that

172
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,870
color I don't like --the
derivative of x with respect to

173
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:50,170
t is minus sine of t, and we're
going to square it, plus the

174
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,750
derivative of y with respect to
t, that's cosine of t, and

175
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,670
we're going to square it-- let
me make my radical a little bit

176
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,330
bigger --and then all
of that times dt.

177
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,820
Now this still might seem like
a really hard integral until

178
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,510
you realize that this right
here, and when you take a

179
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,420
negative number and you squared
it, this is the same thing.

180
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,300
Let me rewrite, do this
in the side right here.

181
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:23,260
Minus sine of t squared plus
the cosine of t squared, this

182
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:31,310
is equivalent to sine of t
squared plus cosine

183
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,820
of t squared.

184
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,090
You lose the sign information
when you square something;

185
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,430
it just becomes a positive.

186
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,850
So these two things
are equivalent.

187
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,640
And this is the most
basic trig identity.

188
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,690
This comes straight out of the
unit circle definition: sine

189
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,600
squared plus cosine squared,
this is just equal to 1.

190
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,020
So all this stuff under
the radical sign is

191
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,710
just equal to 1.

192
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,130
And we're taking the square
root of 1 which is just 1.

193
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:59,120
So all of this stuff right
here will just become 1.

194
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,890
And so this whole crazy
integral simplifies a good bit

195
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,240
and just equals the square root
of t equals 0 to t is equal to

196
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,540
pi over 2 of-- and I'm going to
switch these around just

197
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,440
because it will make it a
little easier in the next step

198
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:23,440
--of sine of t times
cosine of t, dt.

199
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,060
All I did, this whole thing
equals 1, got rid of it,

200
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,340
and I just switched
the order of that.

201
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,050
It'll make the next up a
little bit easier to explain.

202
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,920
Now this integral-- You say
sine times cosine, what's

203
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,350
the antiderivative of that?

204
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,080
And the first thing you should
recognize is, hey, I have a

205
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,790
function or an expression here,
and I have its derivative.

206
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,040
The derivative of
sine is cosine of t.

207
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,460
So you might be able to a u
substitution in your head;

208
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,020
it's a good skill to be
able to do in your head.

209
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,620
But I'll do it very
explicitly here.

210
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,040
So if you have something
that's derivative, you

211
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,890
define that something as u.

212
00:10:52,890 --> 00:11:00,160
So you say u is equal to sine
of t and then du, dt, the

213
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,650
derivative of u with respect
to t is equal to cosine of t.

214
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,190
Or if you multiply both sides
by the differential dt, if

215
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,960
we're not going to be too
rigorous, you get du is

216
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,140
equal to cosine of t, dt.

217
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,720
And notice right
here I have a u.

218
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,860
And then cosine of t, dt,
this thing right here, that

219
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,470
thing is equal to d of u.

220
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,030
And then we just have to
redefine the boundaries.

221
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,350
When t is equal to 0-- I mean
so this thing is going to turn

222
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,760
into the integral --instead of
t is equal to 0, when t is

223
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,550
equal to 0 what is u equal to?

224
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,280
Sine of 0 is 0, so this
goes from u is equal to 0.

225
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,850
When t is pie over 2
sine of pi over 2 is 1.

226
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,260
So when t is pi over
2, u is equal to 1.

227
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,940
So from is equal to 0
to u is equal to 1.

228
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,000
Just redid the boundaries
in terms of u.

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,280
And then we have instead
of sign of t, I'm

230
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,930
going to write u.

231
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,810
And instead of cosine of t, dt,
I'm just going to write du.

232
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,060
And then this is a super-easy
integral in terms of u.

233
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,320
This is just equal to: the
antiderivative of u is u 1/2

234
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,820
times u squared-- we just
raised the exponent and then

235
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,970
divided by that raised exponent
--so 1/2 u squared, and we're

236
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,640
going to evaluate
it from 0 to 1.

237
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,570
And so this is going to be
equal to 1/2 times 1 squared

238
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:32,140
minus 1/2 times 0 squared,
which is equal to 1/2 times 1

239
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,820
minus 0, which is equal to 1/2.

240
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,750
So we did all that work and
we got a nice simple answer.

241
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,630
The area of this a curtain-- we
just performed a line integral

242
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:48,430
--the area of this curtain
along this curve right here

243
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,380
is-- let me do it in a
darker color --on 1/2.

244
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,080
You know, if this was in
centimeters, it would be

245
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,540
1/2 centimeters squared.

246
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,710
So I think that was you know,
a pretty neat application

247
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,460
of the line integral.

248
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,000
