99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The first step to understanding the disease that we call asthma is to understand how air enters and leaves the lungs in both healthy individuals and individuals that are suffering from asthma.So lets just review that.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You might already know that air enters the lungs via the mouth and nose.That's the first step.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the it passes through a set of tubes.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The main one, that enters the lungs is called the trachea.I'll write it over here.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the trachea then branches to two mainstem bronchi.I'll write that down here.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the those bronchi branch further to bronchioles.And those bronchioles are really big players in the disease that we call asthma.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So remember that name because it is very important when we're talking about asthma.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These are the bronchioles.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Cause this is where all the action is when we're exploring asthma

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Okey, now this is also a very important point.The trachea is held open by rings of cartilage.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can actually feel those rings of cartilage if you rub your hand gently across the front of your throat.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You'll feel kind some of breaches and those are rings of cartilage that hold both the trachea and the mainstem bronchi

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These rings of cartilage holds these tubes basically at a constant size or a constant diameter so that these guys don't change much in size.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, the bronchioles don't have that reinforcement and they are actually designed to change size according to the needs of the person breathing in and out.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's look at how that happens

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If i draw the lungs of this person in here and i'm gonna draw them a bit bigger than they actually would be.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the lungs are actually surrounded by something called a pleural sack.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the pleural sack is not really a sack, it's a potential space so that means it could be filled with something,

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it's actually in a healthy person just two membranes that are folded in on themselves and those membranes have a little bit of fluid inside of them.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So only in bad situations like for example if a person gets stabbed or if they get in an car accident and the break a rib

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that perforates this pleural cavity,that's when this potential space could become a real space.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The function of the pleural cavity is to kind of reduce friction between the rib cage.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the rib cage is made out of bones that protect the lungs.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll just draw a few of them in here.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm not drawing these all the way around, they actually do come all the way around and join at the sternum

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the mid-line, at least the upper ribs do

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There are some floating ribs down below but we'll just draw them in half way

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we can see what's going on in the lungs

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the pleural cavity reduces the friction as the lungs move back and forth

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
across these ribs.But what the pleural cavity does is, it keeps the

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lungs tightly opposed or snugly fitting up against the rib cage

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
while still allowing them to move freely back and forth.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's now look at what causes for example a person to draw air into tjeir lungs.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we'll start by looking at inhalation at rest.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So when you're quietly sitting on your sofa there's a very important

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
dome-shaped muscle.And the pleural cavity also keeps the ribs tightly in contact

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or tightly in a position with this muscle called the diaphragm

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this muscle is in its relaxed form a dome-shaped muscle and at rest when we wanna

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
draw air into our lungs, this muscle contracts.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it doesn't become flat, it just becomes less dome-shaped.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And because it becomes less dome-shaped so it moves down from its original position

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the result is that the volume of the thoracic cavity increases

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And when the volume increases in a space the pressure decreases

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
kind of like a vacuum

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the result is that air is going to enter the mouth and pass through these tubes

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to enter the lungs in order to equalize the pressure on the outside

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the atmospheric pressure

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with the pressure on the inside of the lungs

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's inhalation at rest.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're using a muscle called the

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
diaphragm

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What about when we're doing physical activity

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I'll just write exercise here

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, during exercise we need to recrute other muscles

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to help us get air in faster

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the muscles that we use to do that are called

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
external intercostals.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As the name would suggest they attach on the external surface of the ribs in between

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the ribs and they pull the rib cage upward and outward

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These are the external intercostals

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, again by doing this they basically pull the rib cage up and out and

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they help increase the volume of the thoracic cavity

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thereby draw even more air in to equalize the pressure on the inside and the outside

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Another set of muscles that are used during exercise

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are the muscles of the neck.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have a bone called the clavicle, you might know it as the collarbone

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the clavicle is actually attached to the head by muscles

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sternocleidomastoid is one of them, but we'll just write muscles of the neck

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the muscles of the neck

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When they contract what they do is they pull the clavicle upward

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that also helps to increase the volume and get more air in

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to this thoracic cavity

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's now look at what happens when we want to exhale

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is an interesting thing

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exhalation at rest, when you're sitting on that sofa and you've just

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
without even thinking about you've taken a breath in
