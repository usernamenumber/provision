1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,160
At the Grind House, Honduran
coffee sells for $8 per pound,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,860
and Costa Rican coffee sells
for $11.50 per pound.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,390
If 1 pound of Central American
Blend coffee contains 0.4

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,570
pounds of Costa Rican-- so I did
Costa Rican in this orange

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,360
color before, so I'll do it
again-- so it contains 0.4

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,650
pounds of Costa Rican coffee
and 0.6 pounds of Honduran

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,670
coffee-- I'll do the Honduran
coffee in blue.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,750
That was our original--
that first statement.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,570
How much should 1
pound sell for?

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,680
So they're really just saying,
well, how much does it cost

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,480
for me to buy 0.4 pounds
of Costa Rican and

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,990
0.6 pounds of Honduran?

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,490
And if I take that total, that's
how much it's going to

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,350
cost me to get 1 pound of my
Central American Blend.

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,750
So let's just figure that out.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,010
The Costa Rican coffee-- I'll
write it here-- Costa Rican

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,690
coffee-- we're going to--
it's $8 per pound.

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,720
Oh no, sorry, it's
$11.50 per pound.

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,700
We have to be very careful.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:06,630
The Costa Rican coffee
is $11.50 per pound.

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,970
We can write it like
this, per pound.

23
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,820
And then we're going to multiply
that times the number

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,650
of pounds we want of the Costa
Rican coffee in our blend.

25
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,020
And we have 0.4 pounds of it.

26
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,950
So times 0.4 pounds.

27
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,760
The pounds cancel out, and
you have 0.4 times 11.50.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,090
4 times 11.50 would be 44 plus
2, which would be 46, so 0.4

29
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,500
is going to be 4.6.

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,390
So this is equal to $4.60.

31
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,630
Now, we'll do the same thing
for the Honduran coffee.

32
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,310
   

33
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,870
We're going to get 0.6 pounds.

34
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,200
Well, first, let's put
the price here.

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,930
It's $8 per pound.

36
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,750
So it is $8 per pound.

37
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,530
And multiply it times the
number of pounds.

38
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,130
We need 0.6 pounds of it.

39
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,870
   

40
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:09,550
And 8 times 6 is 48, so
8 times 0.6 is $4.80.

41
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,950
So this is equal to $4.80.

42
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,410
So that's how much we're going
to have to spend on Costa

43
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,920
Rican, that's how much we're
going to have to spend on

44
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,700
Honduran coffee.

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,510
If we add them up, that's how
much a pound of the Central

46
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,980
American Blend is going to cost.
Because we're getting--

47
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,710
if you add up the pounds, you
get a pound here, so the total

48
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,740
cost is the total cost of
a pound of the blend.

49
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,410
Let's put it right here.

50
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,540
0 plus 0 is 0.

51
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,700
6 plus 8 is 14.

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,810
1 plus 4 plus 4 is 9.

53
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,050
Put the decimal in
the right place.

54
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,390
It's going to cost us a total
of $9.40 for the blend.

55
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,533
