1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,090
   

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:05,120
We have the equation negative 9
minus this whole expression,

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,720
9x minus 6-- this whole thing
is being subtracted from

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,750
negative 9-- is equal to
3 times this whole

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,500
expression, 4x plus 6.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,740
Now, a good place to start is
to just get rid of these

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,400
parentheses.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,800
And the best way to get rid of
these parentheses is to kind

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,940
of multiply them out.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,880
This has a negative 1-- you
just see a minus here, but

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,660
it's just really the same thing
as having a negative 1--

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,310
times this quantity.

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,790
And here you have a 3
times this quantity.

14
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,820
So let's multiply it out using
the distributive property.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,780
So the left-hand side of
our equation, we have

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,250
our negative 9.

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,710
And then we want to multiply the
negative 1 times each of

18
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:47,980
these terms. So negative 1 times
9x is negative 9x, and

19
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:54,040
then negative 1 times negative
6 is plus 6, or positive 6.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,230
And then that is going to be
equal to-- let's distribute

21
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,430
the 3-- 3 times 4x is 12x.

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:08,210
And then 3 times 6 is 18.

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,850
Now what we want to do, let's
combine our constant

24
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,780
terms, if we can.

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,600
We have a negative 9 and a 6
here, on this side, we've

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
combined all of our like terms.
We can't combine a 12x

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,040
and an 18, so let's
combine this.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,550
So let's combine the negative 9
and the 6, our two constant

29
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,260
terms on the left-hand
side of the equation.

30
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,270
So we're going to have
this negative 9x.

31
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,590
So we're going to have negative
9x plus-- let's see,

32
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,030
we have a negative 9 and then
plus 6-- so negative 9 plus 6

33
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,510
is negative 3.

34
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,260
So we're going to have a
negative 9x, and then we have

35
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,660
a negative 3, so minus
3 right here.

36
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,430
That's the negative 9 plus
the 6, and that is

37
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,850
equal to 12x plus 18.

38
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,280
Now, we want to group all the
x terms on one side of the

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,200
equation, and all of the
constant terms-- the negative

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,150
3 and the positive 18 on the
other side-- I like to always

41
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,650
have my x terms on the left-hand
side, if I can.

42
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,250
You don't have to have them on
the left, so let's do that.

43
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,410
So if I want all my x terms on
the left, I have to get rid of

44
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,590
this 12x from the right.

45
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,860
And the best way to do that is
to subtract 12x from both

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,390
sides of the equation.

47
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,620
So let me subtract 12x from the
right, and subtract 12x

48
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,500
from the left.

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,800
Now, on the left-hand side, I
have negative 9x minus 12x.

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,880
So negative 9 minus 12,
that's negative 21.

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,480
Negative 21x minus 3 is equal
to-- 12x minus 12x, well,

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,240
that's just nothing.

53
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,990
That's 0.

54
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,250
So I could write a 0
here, but I don't

55
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:42,960
have to write anything.

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,830
That was the whole point of
subtracting the 12x from the

57
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,910
left-hand side.

58
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,420
And that is going to be equal
to-- so on the right-hand

59
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,320
side, we just are
left with an 18.

60
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,370
We are just left with
that 18 here.

61
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,130
These guys canceled out.

62
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,990
Now, let's get rid of
this negative 3 from

63
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,840
the left-hand side.

64
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,900
So on the left-hand side, we
only have x terms, and on the

65
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,800
right-hand side, we only have
constant terms. So the best

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,940
way to cancel out a negative
3 is to add 3.

67
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,200
So it cancels out to 0.

68
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,340
So we're going to add
3 to the left, let's

69
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,320
add 3 to the right.

70
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,490
And we get-- the left-hand side
of the equation, we have

71
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,420
the negative 21x, no other x
term to add or subtract here,

72
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,090
so we have negative 21x.

73
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,320
The negative 3 and the plus 3,
or the positive 3, cancel

74
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,060
out-- that was the whole
point-- equals--

75
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,290
what's 18 plus 3?

76
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,820
18 plus 3 is 21.

77
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,730
So now we have negative
21x is equal to 21.

78
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,880
And we want to solve for x.

79
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,300
So if you have something times
x, and you just want it to be

80
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,400
an x, let's divide by
that something.

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,800
And in this case, that something
is negative 21.

82
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,350
So let's divide both sides of
this equation by negative 21.

83
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,670
Divide both sides
by negative 21.

84
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,510
The left-hand side, negative
21 divided by negative 21,

85
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,100
you're just left with an x.

86
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,440
That was the whole point behind

87
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,260
dividing by negative 21.

88
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,820
And we get x is equal
to-- what's 21

89
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,150
divided by negative 21?

90
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,170
Well, that's just negative 1.

91
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:09,450
Right?

92
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,340
You have the positive version
divided by the negative

93
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,850
version of itself, so it's
just negative 1.

94
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,510
So that is our answer.

95
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,060
Now let's verify that this
actually works for that

96
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,850
original equation.

97
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,320
So let's substitute negative 1
into that original equation.

98
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,370
So we have negative 9-- I'll do
it over here; I'll do it in

99
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,560
a different color than we've
been using-- we have negative

100
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,400
9 minus-- that 1 wasn't there
originally, it's there

101
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,320
implicitly-- minus 9
times negative 1.

102
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,720
9 times-- I'll put negative 1
in parentheses-- minus 6 is

103
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
equal to-- well, actually,
let me just solve for the

104
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,600
left-hand side when I substitute
a negative 1 there.

105
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,060
So the left-hand side becomes
negative 9, minus 9 times

106
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,420
negative 1 is negative
9, minus 6.

107
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,860
And so this is negative 9
minus-- in parentheses--

108
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,740
negative 9 minus 6
is negative 15.

109
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,110
So this is equal
to negative 15.

110
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,450
And so we get negative 9-- let
me make sure I did that--

111
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,080
negative 9 minus 6,
yep, negative 15.

112
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,620
So negative 9 minus negative 15,
that's the same thing as

113
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,590
negative 9 plus 15,
which is 6.

114
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,980
So that's what we get on the
left-hand side of the equation

115
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,000
when we substitute x is
equal to negative 1.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,680
We get that it equals 6.

117
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,640
So let's see what happens when
we substitute negative 1 to

118
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
the right-hand side
of the equation.

119
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,680
I'll do it in green.

120
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,750
We get 3 times 4 times
negative 1 plus 6.

121
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,010
So that is 3 times negative
4 plus 6.

122
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,530
Negative 4 plus 6 is 2.

123
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,790
So it's 3 times 2,
which is also 6.

124
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,460
So when x is equal to negative
1, you substitute here, the

125
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,340
left-hand side becomes 6, and
the right-hand side becomes 6.

126
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,610
So this definitely works out.
