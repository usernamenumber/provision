1
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:07,187
We talked about how there's an efferent and an afferent arteriole.

2
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:14,292
This is the afferent arteriole, going towards the glomerulus,
there's a whole clump of blood vessels here.

3
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:18,537
There's the efferent arteriole which 
leaves that clump of blood vessels.

4
00:00:18,537 --> 00:00:23,803
Those blood vessels we know are gonna be
surrounded by Bowman's capsule.

5
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:26,435
We named all the different parts of the nephron.

6
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:30,637
The proximal convoluted tubule, 
the loop of Henle,

7
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:39,970
and this is the distal convoluted tubule. I'm drawing it in between the afferent and efferent arteriole on purpose.

8
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:47,901
This is where all the different distal convoluted tubules 
meet up into that collecting duct.

9
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:53,803
In this section, in this little video,
I want to expand on this little piece.

10
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:58,470
Where the efferent and afferent arteriole
are coming together into that glomerulus

11
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,614
between that there's that distal convoluted tubule.

12
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:06,736
Just keep that picture in mind 
as I start expanding this drawing.

13
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:15,504
Over here we have the afferent arteriole,
I'm gonna start drawing it, I have enough space here.

14
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:18,343
Something like that.

15
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:31,531
These are the endothelial cells 
that are lining that blood vessel, that arteriole.

16
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:41,302
On this side we have the same endothelial cells of course, but now it's leaving the glomerulus.

17
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:54,768
We've got coming and going,
over here is the efferent arteriole.

18
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:58,806
The other one is of course the afferent arteriole.

19
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:05,169
I'm gonna reverse that arrow, just so there's no confusion about the direction of the blood flow.

20
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:08,434
I don't want you to be confused 
about where the blood is going.

21
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:15,021
It's gonna be going like that
and this is the afferent arteriole.

22
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:18,543
I've got my blood vessels labeled.

23
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:24,571
Between the two I also have the distal convoluted tubule,
so let's draw that in.

24
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:30,938
This are the cells surrounding the distal convoluted tubule.

25
00:02:30,938 --> 00:02:36,974
There are some very special cells in here,
I'm gonna draw them in a different color.

26
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:40,836
They are the macula densa cells.

27
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:46,879
They're part of the tubule, but they're very special,
so I'm gonna draw them for that reason.

28
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:56,069
This is the distal convoluted tubule.

29
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,020
And in green are the macula densa cells.

30
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,301
I'm throwing a lot of names at you
and I want you to start feeling comfortable with these names,

31
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:11,141
because they're gonna be used quite a bit.

32
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:19,143
It's not particularly hard once you get used to the language, but I know it can be confusing to see all these funny words thrown at you.

33
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:27,369
The next thing I want you to think back about and remember is that arterioles don't just have one layer.

34
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:30,146
We know that arterioles have multiple layers.

35
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:34,703
The inner layer, the tunica intima, 
is the endothelial cells, we know that.

36
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:41,604
There's also smooth muscle cells.
We know that there's also a layer called the tunica media.

37
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:44,912
That's here, with smooth muscle cells.

38
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:49,038
I'm gonna try to draw some smooth muscle cells right there.

39
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:51,972
We have a layer of these smooth muscle cells.

40
00:03:51,972 --> 00:03:59,809
If you look closely under a microscope, you'll see 
that there are also some interesting cells right here.

41
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:05,036
I'm drawing them in blue, 
just to highlight that they're different.

42
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,204
They are actually very similar to smooth muscle cells.

43
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:13,708
In a way they're specialized smooth muscle cells.

44
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:17,703
Let me label these two cell types that I've drawn for you.

45
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:26,437
Smooth muscle cells, they're on the afferent arteriole side.

46
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:31,805
You'll see them a little bit on the efferent arteriole side 
as well, but mostly on the afferent arteriole side.

47
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:39,204
Smooth muscle cells.
Then you have these juxtaglomerular cells.

48
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:41,808
Juxta, talk about a funny word...

49
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:45,978
Juxtaglomerular cells.

50
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:49,304
All right, so the juxtaglomerular cells are there.

51
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:52,768
If you looked under a microscope, they'd be full of granules.

52
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:58,536
Sometimes they're even called granular cells.

53
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:06,101
Let me draw in some granules
just to remind you that's what people see under a microscope.

54
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:09,351
Little green granules in this case.

55
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:13,903
I'll put them into all of them.

56
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:21,436
You know that these cells are on both sides of the vessel,
because of course we cut it longways,

57
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:24,812
so we're just looking as if it's disconnected.

58
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:29,973
But these two sides are obviously touching,
if you thought of it in three dimensions.

59
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:36,036
Now I've talked about four cell types,
let's round it up with a last cell type.

60
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:42,133
This is in orange now, these are the mesangial cells.

61
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,638
Mesangial cells are there for structure.

62
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:59,033
They're really there to hold the whole thing together
so that the blood vessels and the nephron are in close contact.

63
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:04,536
So that they're structurally sound.
Think of them as being there for support reasons.

64
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:09,860
These are the mesangial cells.

65
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:18,340
Combined, if you think about all this stuff together, remember 
this is all the white box in the little picture blown up.

66
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:24,905
If you think about all this stuff together, the macula densa cells, the endothelial cells, the smooth muscle cells,

67
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:35,203
the juxtaglomerular cells and the mesangial cells,
put together, this whole thing is the juxtaglomerular complex.

68
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:46,180
Or apparatus rather, the juxtaglomerular apparatus.

69
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:54,512
Kind of a funny word, but it's how people refer 
to all these cells, the juxtaglomerular apparatus.

70
00:06:54,512 --> 00:07:02,538
The key here is to remember that the goal of the juxtaglomerular apparatus is to release renin.

71
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:07,277
Think about where renin is.
I mentioned these little granules here.

72
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:13,037
These are actually each gonna be loaded with renin.

73
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:21,236
These little granules dump themselves into the vessels,
this is your renin.

74
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:28,141
That renin is gonna make its way into the afferent arteriole, just like I drew it,

75
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:30,578
then it's gonna make its way through the glomerulus.

76
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:36,804
On the other and it's gonna sprinkle out 
and go into the efferent arteriole.

77
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:38,569
That's the way renin gets released.

78
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:48,478
What we hadn't figured out yet, what we hadn't said,
is how, why would the juxtaglomerular apparatus release renin.

79
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,172
What is the trigger?

80
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:56,869
Let's figure out what are the key triggers 
for the release of renin.

81
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:57,937
What are the triggers?

82
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:02,264
There are three actually.
Three common ones we know.

83
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:12,774
One is simply low blood pressure.
This cells are gonna feel mechanically less blood pressure.

84
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:18,137
They're gonna say 'What's going on here? 
Pressure is low, we've got to do something about it.'

85
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:20,304
'We're gonna release renin.'

86
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:24,875
So one trigger would be low blood pressure.

87
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:31,835
That's the first one and it's actually directly sensed 
by the juxtaglomerular cells.

88
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:37,180
That's actually sensed right here.
I'm gonna draw a 1 for that.

89
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,364
The second trigger is a nerve cell trigger.

90
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:44,703
Actually I haven't even drawn that in for you yet.

91
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:54,537
Remember that this is a blood vessel, right here, with our two layers, 
our endothelial layer and our tunica media layer.

92
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:58,849
There's also an external layer, the tunica externa.

93
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:06,139
We also have a blood vessel here, these mesangial cells, they're also specialized smooth muscle cells.

94
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:13,802
We have these layers of blood vessels and the two blood vessels are kind of merging and fusing right here.

95
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:16,806
They're coming together right here.

96
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:24,877
In this external layers you actually have, I'm gonna 
draw it in yellow, you have these little nerve endings.

97
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:30,370
Remember that nerves can end in that layer,
the external layer.

98
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:38,700
You have the sympathetic nerve endings.

99
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,967
They come and sit with their nerve endings 
right on the juxtaglomerular cells.

100
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:52,934
They're sitting right there and when they fire, 
that's gonna make the JG cells want to dump their renin.

101
00:09:52,934 --> 00:10:01,344
So the second trigger is sympathetic nerves.

102
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:05,520
Now there's one more trigger, the third trigger.

103
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,700
This one is actually a little distance away.

104
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,036
It's the macula densa cells.

105
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:15,686
I mentioned them earlier and I said that they're special.

106
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:20,469
I haven't really gotten into why they're special.
Let me tell you what happens.

107
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:25,972
What happens is these macula densa cells, 
they're sitting there in the distal convoluted tubule,

108
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:30,746
sampling what comes through.
They're just kind of feeling what comes through.

109
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:33,312
They're seeing sodium come through.

110
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:38,581
They're checking and checking, 
is there a lot of sodium coming through, or a little bit of sodium.

111
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:43,200
When they start sensing that the sodium content, 
that the amount of sodium

112
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,238
coming through that distal convoluted tubule 
is really quite low,

113
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:50,702
when they start feeling like 
not too much sodium is coming through,

114
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:54,514
they start thinking to themselves 
'Why is this happening?'

115
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:57,005
If you think about it, you can figure it out too.

116
00:10:57,005 --> 00:11:02,472
If there is not a lot of sodium here,
that's probably because there's not a lot of sodium here.

117
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:06,428
And that could be because there's not 
enough sodium here or here.

118
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:10,691
So really, when the distal convoluted tubule 
senses low sodium,

119
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:20,194
it's probably related to the fact that not enough sodium is getting in at the getgo, at the point of filtration.

120
00:11:20,194 --> 00:11:24,076
And that could be a reflection of low blood pressure.

121
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:35,270
So when the macula densa cells sense low sodium levels,
what they're sensing is low pressure in the glomerulus.

122
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:41,403
So if there's low pressure in the glomerulus,
our glomerulus right here,

123
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:48,602
they think 
'Ok,that's probably the reason our sodium levels are low.'

124
00:11:48,602 --> 00:11:54,120
'Let's send a signal out to the juxtaglomerular cells.'

125
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:04,444
Low sodium in the macula densa,
picked up by the macula densa rather.

126
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:09,747
It means that the filtration pressure 
in the glomerulus was too low.

127
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:16,646
So what they decide to do,
let me find a new color, maybe something like this.

128
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:21,976
They send a little messenger.

129
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:26,313
I'll do my messenger in orange.

130
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:31,306
They send a messenger to go 
over to the juxtaglomerular cells.

131
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:38,670
That messenger is a little molecule called prostaglandin.

132
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,520
It's a local messenger.

133
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,311
It really doesn't act far away from these cells, 
it just acts locally.

134
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:54,848
This local hormone, it's sometimes called a paracrine hormone, I'll write that here, paracrine hormone,

135
00:12:54,848 --> 00:13:03,137
is going to send a signal from the macula densa cells 
over to the juxtaglomerular cells.

136
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:09,636
They say 'Hey, there's a trigger, we sensed low sodium 
and we think it's because of low blood pressure.'

137
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:11,936
'Why don't you go and do something about it?'

138
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:15,014
So those are the three triggers.

139
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:18,431
Actually I don't think I've labeled them well.

140
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,681
This is trigger number two and this is trigger number three.

141
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:29,043
These are the three triggers that will make 
the renin get released into our blood stream.

142
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:33,438
This is a picture of renin, this is a picture of the molecule.

143
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:38,670
I've actually already drawn kind of like 
a pacman-like shape around it.

144
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:47,020
When I talk about renin coming out of the juxtaglomerular cells, you get a sense of what it actually looks like.

145
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,571
This is a three dimensional figure of this protein.

146
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:54,601
Keep in mind this is a protein hormone.

147
00:13:54,601 --> 00:14:03,137
Meaning it's a protein that has the ability of 
letting one cell talk to other cells at a distance.

148
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:05,105
This is what that renin looks like.

149
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:09,000
We'll discuss more about how renin works in the next video.
