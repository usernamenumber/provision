1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,030
Luis looked at the expression x
minus y times x squared plus

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,410
xy plus y squared, and
wrote the following.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,600
He said, using the distributive
property-- so he

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,360
took x minus y and he
distributed this expression

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,690
onto the x and this expression
onto the negative y.

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,010
So that's why we have an
x times this entire

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,585
expression over here.

9
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:24,550
x times the entire expression
minus y times this entire

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,610
expression.

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,800
Then he says, using the
distributive property again,

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,290
this is equal to-- so then he
distributed this x into that

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:36,010
and got all of the first
three terms here.

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,330
He got these first three
terms. And then he

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,990
distributed the y.

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,940
He distributed the y over here
and he got these three terms.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,760
And then he saw, looks like
that this term x squared y

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,710
cancels out with a minus x
squared y, and the xy squared

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,770
cancels out with the negative
xy squared.

20
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,480
Then he saw that it equals
x to the third

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,250
minus y to the third.

22
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,290
And he wrote down, I conjecture
that x minus y

23
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,990
times x squared plus xy plus y
squared is equal to x to the

24
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,220
third minus y to the third
for all x and y.

25
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,960
Did Carlos use inductive
reasoning?

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,230
Explain.

27
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,410
Well, inductive reasoning is
looking at a sample of

28
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:19,620
things-- looking at some set
of data, if you will-- and

29
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,340
then making a generalization
based on that.

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,850
You're not 100% sure, but based
on what you've seen so

31
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,280
far, you think that the pattern
would continue.

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,720
Or you think it might be true
for all things that have that

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,240
type of property or whatever.

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,050
Now in this situation,
he didn't look at

35
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,220
some type of a sample.

36
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,630
He actually just did a proof.

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,460
He multiplied this out
algebraically.

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,630
In fact, it's incorrect for him
to say I conjecture here.

39
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,650
A conjecture is a statement or
proposition that is unproven,

40
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,470
but it's probably going
to be true.

41
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,020
It's unproven but it seems
reasonable, or it seems likely

42
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,900
that it's true.

43
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,030
This isn't a conjecture.

44
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,950
This is proven.

45
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,930
He proved that x minus y times
x squared plus xy plus y

46
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,100
squared is equal to x to the
third minus y third.

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,240
He should have written-- and
this is a much stronger thing

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,320
to say-- he should have said, I
proved that this is true for

49
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,340
all x and y.

50
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,010
So to answer the question, did
he use inductive reasoning?

51
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,350
No.

52
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,000
I would say that he made
an outright proof.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,730
No, he made a proof.

54
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,010
Inductive reasoning would have
been, if he would have saw, if

55
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,290
you would have given him 5 minus
2 is equal to-- or 5

56
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,150
minus 2 times 5 squared plus 5
times 2 plus 2 squared, and

57
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,180
you saw that that was equal to
the same thing as 5 to the

58
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,630
third minus 2 to the third.

59
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,770
And then let's say he did it
for, I don't know, one in

60
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,350
seven in a couple of examples.

61
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,430
And it kept holding for all the
examples that it was the

62
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,900
first number cubed minus the
second number cubed.

63
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,340
Then it would have been
inductive reasoning to say

64
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,140
that that is true for
all numbers x and y.

65
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,690
But here it's not
an induction.

66
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,890
He didn't use induction.

67
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,930
Or I shouldn't say induction.

68
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,560
He didn't use inductive
reasoning.

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,500
He outright proved that
this statement is true

70
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,660
for all x and y.

71
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:02,666
