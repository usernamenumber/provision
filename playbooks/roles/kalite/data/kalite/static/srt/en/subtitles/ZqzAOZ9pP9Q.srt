1
00:00:00,123 --> 00:00:03,093
Let's do some solid geometry and volume problems.

2
00:00:03,093 --> 00:00:06,494
so they tell us shown is a triangular prism.

3
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:09,505
and so there's a couple of types of three dimensional figures that deal with triangles.

4
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:12,497
And this is what a triangular prism looks like

5
00:00:12,497 --> 00:00:18,723
it has a triangle on one two faces and they are kind of separated, they kind of have rectangles in between.

6
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:20,937
the other kind of triangular three dimensional figures

7
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,308
as you might see would be pyramids

8
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:29,002
this is a rectangular pyramid, cuz it has a rectangular, or it has a square base, just like that

9
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:37,222
you could also have a triangular pyramid where literally every side is a triangle.

10
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:39,933
but this over here is a triangular prism.

11
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:43,026
I don't want to get to much into the shape classification.

12
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:45,929
if the base of the triangle b is equal to 7

13
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,737
the height of the triangle 'h' is equal to 3

14
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:52,988
and the lenght of the prism 'l' is equal to 4

15
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:56,285
what is the total volume of the prism?

16
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:58,607
so they are saying that the base is equal to seven

17
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:03,994
so this right over here is equal to base is equal to seven

18
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,916
the height of the triangle is equal to 3

19
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,225
so this right over here

20
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,714
this distance right over here

21
00:01:09,714 --> 00:01:12,155
'h' is equal to 3

22
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,604
and the length of the prism is equal to 4

23
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:17,556
so i'm assuming it is this dimension

24
00:01:17,556 --> 00:01:19,245
right over here is equal to 4

25
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,365
so length is equal to four

26
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:24,537
so in this situation what you really just have to do

27
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:26,940
is figure out the area of this triangle right over here

28
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:29,878
we could figure out the area of this triangle

29
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:32,232
and multiply it by how much you go deep

30
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:34,401
so multiply it by this length

31
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:37,478
so the volume is going to be the area of this triangle

32
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:38,040
let me do it in pink

33
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:39,575
the area of this triangle

34
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:40,893
we know that the area of a triangle

35
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,905
is one half, times the base, times the height

36
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:44,531
so the area

37
00:01:44,593 --> 00:01:47,511
this area right over here is going to be

38
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:50,434
one half times the base times the height

39
00:01:51,788 --> 00:01:56,427
and we are going to multiply it by like kind of our depth of our triangular prism

40
00:01:56,473 --> 00:01:58,208
so we have a depth of four

41
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,715
so we are going to multiply that

42
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:01,756
times the four

43
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:03,125
times this depth

44
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,720
times the four

45
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:06,655
and we get, let's see

46
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:07,556
one half times four is two

47
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:11,428
so these guys cancel out, you'll just have a two

48
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:13,596
and then 2 times 3 is 6

49
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:16,163
6 times 7 is forty...

50
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:18,008
is forty two

51
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:20,562
and it would be in some kind of cubic unit

52
00:02:20,562 --> 00:02:21,202
so if these were in

53
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:21,702
i don't know

54
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:23,693
centimeters, it would be centimeters cubed

55
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,379
but they are not making us focus on units in this problem

56
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,168
let's do another one

57
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,211
shown is a cube

58
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:36,473
if each side is of equal length 'x' is equal to 3

59
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:38,904
what is the total volume of the cube?

60
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,320
so each side is equal length x

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,579
which happens to equal to 3

62
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,988
so this side is 3

63
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:46,724
this side over here x is equal to 3

64
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:48,517
every side x is equal to 3

65
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:51,783
so it's actually the same exercise as the triangular prism

66
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:53,627
it is actually a bit easier when you are doing it with a cube

67
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:58,154
where you really just want to find the area of this surface right over here

68
00:02:58,154 --> 00:03:00,233
now this is pretty straight forward

69
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:01,766
this is just a square

70
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,749
it would be the base times the height

71
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:06,410
or since they are the same it is just 3 times 3

72
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,243
so the volume is going to be the area of this surface

73
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:11,007
3 times 3

74
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:12,649
times the depth

75
00:03:12,803 --> 00:03:14,490
times the depth

76
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:17,277
so we go 3 deep

77
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:19,307
so times

78
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:20,146
so times

79
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:20,773
three

80
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:22,736
and so we get 3 times 3 times 3

81
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,376
so this is 27

82
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:26,906
or you might recognize this from exponents

83
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,612
this is the same thing as three to the third power

84
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:32,092
and that is why sometimes if you have something to the third power

85
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:34,367
they'll say you cubed it

86
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,751
because literally to find the volume of a cube

87
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:41,909
you take the length of one side and you multiply that number by itself three times

88
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:43,332
one for each dimension

89
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:47,480
one for the length, the width, and or I guess the height,

90
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,619
the length and the depth.

91
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:50,983
depending on how you want to define them.

92
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:55,928
so it's literally just 3 times 3 times 3
