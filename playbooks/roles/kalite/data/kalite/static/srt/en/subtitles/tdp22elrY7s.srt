1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,520
We're looking at the Birth of Venus by Botticelli.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,961
This is of course one of the most iconic images in the history of western art

3
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:15,655
Venus is fabulously beautiful. How could it be otherwise?

4
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:22,404
So she stands, radically naked in a Renaissance painting here, not in a Christian context here

5
00:00:22,404 --> 00:00:29,573
Until really this point in the Renaissance the only time you would see a nude was Eve

6
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:31,588
This is not Eve

7
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:41,504
No, Botticelli's portrait is the ancient goddess of love, Venus. And he's portrayed her actually, based her on an ancient Roman sculpture.

8
00:00:41,504 --> 00:00:45,612
Which was a copy of an earlier ancient Greek sculpture

9
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:50,420
known sometimes as the modest Venus, which was actually in the collection

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:57,478
of the Medici. We think this painting might have actually been for one of the Medici court, perhaps even for a cousin of Lorenzo de Medici.

11
00:00:57,478 --> 00:01:00,381
So Venus stands in the middle. She's born of the sea.

12
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:05,765
being pushed in by the winds the zephyrs, personified on the left.

13
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,180
She stands on a seashell, or almost stands on a seashell

14
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,073
There's so much impossibility in this painting

15
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:18,030
And when she gets to the shore, she'll be received by an attendant that's ready to wrap her nude body

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,826
But we're delighted that she hasn't gotten there yet.

17
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:25,599
The body is just so beautiful. It's so sensuous.

18
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,846
And it's an impossible kind of pose. It's not really contrapposto

19
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:32,165
There's this extraordinary curve to the body that suggests

20
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:37,980
that she's got a very flexible kind of skeletal structure

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,930
And even the zephyrs, who are those winds that blow her to shore

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,540
are intertwined in impossible ways

23
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,559
and every figure here floats

24
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:51,618
When we look at Renaissance paintings we generally expect to see real naturalism.

25
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:56,483
We expect to see figures that have weight, with bodies that make sense, existing in a realistic

26
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,658
space. That's what we think of when we think about the Renaissance.

27
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:04,600
But that's not Botticelli gives us. Some art historians have suggested that Botticelli is looking

28
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,695
back to ancient Greek painting and the only painting that Botticelli would have had available

29
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,780
to him from the classical Greek tradition would have been vase painting

30
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,559
Where the figures are often isolated against a ground. This is really a freeze. All the figures are

31
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:22,801
and this is very much a Botticelli characteristic, are pushed forward and occupying a single plane

32
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:28,987
That's right, and they're sort of isolated, these 3 groupings. And you can sort of imagine them as line paintings

33
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:32,743
on a vase. In fact, this painting is really linear.

34
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:36,368
And because of the patterning, because of the quality of the linear

35
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:39,554
it sort of defies space. I mean, yes, we can look into the deep space

36
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:47,947
But this is not a massachio. The attempt here is to really de-emphasize deep space and to instead create a sense of pattern, create a sense of beauty

37
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:52,317
This is a painting, presumably, and we're just guessing, we don't know

38
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:59,666
That is really about beauty, perhaps in the neo-Platonic sense with beauty as physical, as sensual, as erotic

39
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:03,500
that leads one to a notion of divine beauty.

40
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:11,386
Right, and there are two kinds of beauty and through a contemplation of physical beauty we can arrive at divine beauty.

41
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:21,685
Botticelli's creating a kind of beauty that is a result of the narrative. It's the result of the elegance of the figure herself

42
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:25,762
But also through the use of pattern, through the use of kind of purely decorative quality.

43
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:30,532
We can see that especially in the traces of gold he's placed in her hair

44
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:33,449
in the trees on the right.

45
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,365
There's a kind of sensuality that's irresistable, right?

46
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:42,570
Pink flowers, fluttering between Venus and the zephyrs, the beautiful line that creates the waves

47
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,939
the lines from her hair, fluttering drapery.

48
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,992
It's a beautiful world

49
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:51,992
that we want to enter.
