2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,769
We're in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna,

3
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:09,733
and we're looking at Bruegel's amazing painting,

4
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:10,998
"The Tower of Babel."

5
00:00:10,998 --> 00:00:12,205
I really love this painting.

6
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:12,772
Me too!

7
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:14,133
It's just, there's so much to look at,

8
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:18,130
and it reminds you that before movies, before video,

9
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,418
paintings could be incredibly entertaining.

10
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:23,901
And here's an image that gives us so many little narratives,

11
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:25,206
so many things to look at.

12
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:28,672
It really does reward close, prolonged looking.

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,679
So this story comes from the Bible.

14
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,633
Man decided to build a building that would be so high,

15
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,436
it would reach into the heavens; it would reach God.

16
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,183
And God didn't like that.

17
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:40,648
No, not one bit. So the way that God took care of this

18
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:42,219
was sort of wonderful and elegant.

19
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:45,715
Humanity had been one people up to this time.

20
00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:49,726
But God said now He would divide man by language,

21
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:53,422
so that when these men could no longer communicate with each other,

22
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:55,206
well, the building couldn't be built.

23
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:58,503
But Bruegel is painting this now in the Renaissance,

24
00:00:58,503 --> 00:01:00,305
and there's a different set of meanings.

25
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:02,219
Yes, the Bible is the underlying story;

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,744
but there's the politics of his era.

27
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:06,381
When we think about the Renaissance, it's hard

28
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:09,601
not to think about the massive building campaigns.

29
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:12,393
Bruegel himself is living in Antwerp,

30
00:01:12,393 --> 00:01:16,218
an incredibly wealthy city that trades in luxury goods.

31
00:01:16,218 --> 00:01:21,055
So in some ways, this is about the dangers of man's success.

32
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:24,685
All the things that we build, all the things that we create,

33
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,596
all of the power and wealth that we have

34
00:01:27,596 --> 00:01:30,214
is really nothing before God.

35
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:32,272
I think Bruegel makes that point rather nicely

36
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:34,046
in the lower left corner of the painting,

37
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:36,970
where you see a king, who is presumably the man

38
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,454
who's ordering the building of this monument,

39
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:42,013
and you see the workers who are actually carving stone,

40
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:43,332
but also bowing down to him.

41
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:46,251
There's a kind of irony there, because as the workers

42
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:49,307
bow down to him, we know that this tower

43
00:01:49,307 --> 00:01:53,258
that they're building at his request is going to utterly fail;

44
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:56,871
and in fact, it is failing right before our eyes,

45
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:59,679
and before theirs, if only they would notice it too.

46
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:02,513
You mean, even as it's being built, it's so large

47
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:04,395
that it's also falling apart. In fact,

48
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:06,699
the whole tower, although it seems so massive

49
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:10,097
and so solid, is leaning to the left slightly,

50
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:13,221
and it seems to be almost menacing the medieval city

51
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:14,443
that's just beyond it.

52
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:18,530
There are some places where it seems very unfinished;

53
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,424
I mean, if we look at the center, there's uncut block;

54
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:23,822
and then in other areas it looks completed;

55
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:25,964
in other areas there's scaffolding.

56
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:30,090
There's this sense that it's rising and falling simultaneously.

57
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,431
You know, the whole thing really looks believable.

58
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:34,243
You see winches, and cranes -

59
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:35,579
- hoists -

60
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,174
- And sort of the basic construct itself seems to be

61
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:40,915
loosely based on the Coliseum in Rome,

62
00:02:40,915 --> 00:02:44,268
which Brugel would have seen when he visited that city.

63
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:47,173
And so, the whole thing really does seem as if it's possible,

64
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:49,545
and there is this sense that here in the Renaissance,

65
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,653
man has become so capable.

66
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:53,349
And what are the dangers of that?

67
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:56,010
I mean, it is an issue that even in the modern era,

68
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,519
we still grapple with. If you read science fiction,

69
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,643
it's always the robots and the computers

70
00:03:00,643 --> 00:03:02,970
that are the threat, right? And in a sense,

71
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,788
this is an older take on technologies

72
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:07,491
that were perhaps too big for us.

73
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:10,510
Men look like ants, everywhere, here!

74
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,922
You get a sense of trade, you have a sense of materials

75
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:15,813
coming from afar in the ships on the extreme right;

76
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:19,656
you see a large castle, but it's completely dwarfed

77
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:22,508
by the massiveness of the tower itself.

78
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:24,981
There's a total sense of futility here.

79
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:26,594
Everyone is doing something.

80
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:28,950
Everyone is building or carrying or carving

81
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,995
or climbing or doing something to make this happen.

82
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:38,818
And yet, as they're so busy, we know that it's all for naught.

83
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:44,091
And so, there's a sense of the complete futility of human endeavor.

84
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,860
And even while we know that futility is central,

85
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,902
there's still an absolute love of the investigation

86
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:52,564
of the building itself.

87
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:55,174
We really have Bruegel the architect here.

88
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:59,904
The tower is so fun. We want to go into it.

89
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:03,205
We can see through it, and into the arches

90
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:06,425
and spaces, and windows; and we want to know

91
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:10,170
what it's like inside. It's a dreamlike space

92
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,580
that is incredibly seductive.

93
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,823
So in a sense, it's a kind of entrapment.

94
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:18,580
Bruegel is giving us this wonderful, seductive environment,

95
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,536
and then he's telling you,

96
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:22,048
"You don't want to do this. This isn't all right."

97
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,216
It seduces us and entraps us,

98
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:29,728
and it's really difficult to pull your eyes away from it.

99
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:38,650
