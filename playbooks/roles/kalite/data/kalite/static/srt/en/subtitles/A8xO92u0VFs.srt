1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,565
So this is a picture of Dr. Korotkoff.

2
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:10,970
   

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,376
Dr. Korotkoff is a very famous Russian doctor who lived about a 100 years ago and something he came up with, something very clever, and that still affects all of us or most of us today.

4
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:21,621
So he lived in the early 1900s and around 1905, he started thinking.

5
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:29,931
He was thinking about blood vessels, and he was trying to figure "How to use the stethoscope to (let's just draw the skin here over the blood vessel)

6
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:35,147
How to use the stethoscope to listen and figure out the blood pressure?"

7
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:38,960
So he was thinking "How can I get about to do that?"

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,708
So, first thing he decided to do was inflate a cuff like a blood pressure cuff

9
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:50,388
and he would put a lot of pressure on the outside of the skin on that blood vessel,

10
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:53,843
so he thought, "well for example, let's do something like 200 mmHg

11
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:59,966
and for this example let's just assume that he is working with me,

12
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:02,082
let's assume that he is working with my blood vessel

13
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:08,048
and my blood pressure is about 115 systolic over 75 diastolic.

14
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:12,337
So, if you put 200 mm of pressure on the outside,

15
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:17,088
what's going to happen? The first thing is that that vessel is definitely not going to stay open, right?

16
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:19,877
It's going to collapse down, so it is going to do this.

17
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:26,137
As he gets all that pressure in the blood, it is going to turn right around

18
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:29,899
and say, "well we can't go through this way."

19
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:33,075
So, if he listens with his stethoscope here, if he is listening, he would really hear silence here,

20
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:36,733
he would hear a nothing at all, it would be very quiet.

21
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,952
So we put "silence"

22
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:40,819
because there is no blood flowing

23
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:42,921
at this point, because the vessel is collapsed.

24
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:49,087
Okay, so Dr. Korotkoff thought about this and said "okay well, what if I go ahead and

25
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:54,033
do something slightly different?" Let's open this up a little

26
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:59,154
bit, because what he is going to do next is instead of putting 200 mm of pressure

27
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:04,325
as he did the first time, he is going to put exactly 115,

28
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:09,628
exactly the systolic pressure
