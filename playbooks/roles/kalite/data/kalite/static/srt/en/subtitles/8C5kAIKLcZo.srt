1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420
   

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,830
We're asked how many inches
are in 4 and 1/2 yards?

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,300
Let me write that down.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,110
4 and 1/2 yards.

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,501
Now, whenever we're dealing with
fractions and we're going

6
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:14,350
to multiply and divide by
fractions, it really

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,400
complicates the issue to
have a mixed number.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,540
So right from the get go, I
want to turn this into an

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,020
improper fraction.

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,140
Let me do it over here
in the top right.

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,640
4 and 1/2 written
as an improper

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,010
fraction is equal to what?

13
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,000
We're still going to have
2 as a denominator.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,900
So 2 times 4 is 8.

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,680
So 8/2 is the same thing 4.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,140
Let me rewrite this, just
as a bit of review.

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,640
4 is the same thing as 8/2.

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,070
That's the same thing as 4.

19
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,170
And then you have
that plus 1/2.

20
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,670
That is going to give you 9/2.

21
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,870
The quick way to do it: 2 times
4 is 8, 8 plus 1 is 9.

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,070
So 4 and 1/2 is the
same thing as 9/2.

23
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,760
So 4 and 1/2 yards is the same
thing as-- let me write it

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,185
over here-- 9/2.

25
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:06,530
   

26
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,450
yards.

27
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,160
Now, we want to convert
this into inches.

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,990
Just so we can take this in baby
steps, maybe we convert

29
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,890
this into feet first, and then
once we have it in feet, then

30
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,850
we can convert it into inches.

31
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,620
So to convert it into feet, we
just have to remember that

32
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,620
there are 3 feet for
every 1 yard.

33
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,530
So let me write that down.

34
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:36,330
There are 3 feet per yard.

35
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,810
And if we were to multiply 9/2
yards times 3 feet, this yard

36
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,900
would be in the numerator.

37
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,670
It'd be divided by this yard,
and they would cancel out, and

38
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,740
we'd just be left with feet.

39
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,810
So we know we have
to multiply by 3.

40
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,220
You can say this is 3 feet for
every 1 yard, if it makes it

41
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,470
simple, or just 3
feet per yard.

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,340
Another way to think about it
is however many yards you

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,200
have, you're going to have
more feet, right?

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,480
There are 3 feet per yard.

45
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,170
So if I have 1 yard, I'm
going to have 3 feet.

46
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,750
If I'm going to have 2 yards,
I'm going to have 6 feet.

47
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,190
So you should always think about
it in your head, OK,,

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,539
well, yeah, multiplying by 3.

49
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,009
So that also makes sense.

50
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,360
So if we multiply by 3
right over here the

51
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,760
9 times 3 is 27/2.

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,330
Let me write it out.

53
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,760
Let me take it step by step,
not skipping any steps.

54
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:33,290
So this is equal to 9/2
times 3/1 yards.

55
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,590
This yards right here,
I'll do it in orange.

56
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,040
Yards times feet per yards.

57
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:49,890
   

58
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,790
The yards cancel out, and you're
left with 9 times 3 is

59
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:04,210
equal to 27/2 feet.

60
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,890
So we figured out 4 and 1/2
yards is 27/2 feet.

61
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,070
And that makes sense because
we should have

62
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,370
more feet than yards.

63
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,180
And actually, this should
be three times more, so

64
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,490
everything makes sense.

65
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,290
27/2 is 3 times 9/2.

66
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:26,710
So now we have 27/2 feet,
and now we want to

67
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,050
convert this to inches.

68
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,260
And we just have to remember
there are 12 inches per yard.

69
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,260
And we're going to want to
multiply by 12, because

70
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,300
however many feet we have, we're
going to have 12 times

71
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,840
as many inches.

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,290
If we have 1 foot, we're
going to have 12

73
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,520
inches, 2 feet, 24 inches.

74
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,440
27/2 feet, we're going to
multiply it by 12 to get the

75
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,720
number of inches.

76
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,300
Since this is going to be times
12, and we'll make sure

77
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,840
the dimensions work out:
12 inches per foot.

78
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,010
And the feet and the foot, this
is just the plural and

79
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,440
the singular of the same word.

80
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,790
It's the same dimension.

81
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,135
This will cancel out.

82
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:09,130
So this will be-- if we just
rearrange the multiplication,

83
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,210
view it as everything is getting
multiplied, and when

84
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,540
you just multiply a bunch of
things, order doesn't matter.

85
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:20,519
So this is equal to 27/2
times 12 feet.

86
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,540
I'm just swapping the order.

87
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:31,540
Feet times inches divided by
feet, or foot, just the

88
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,140
singular of the same word.

89
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,720
The feet and the foot cancel
out, they're the same unit.

90
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,710
And you have 27 times 12
divided by 2 inches.

91
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,560
And what we could do here is
that our final answer is going

92
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:51,660
to be 27 times 12/2 inches.

93
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,770
And before we multiply the 27
times 12 and then divide by 2,

94
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,460
you immediately see, well, I can
just divide 12 by 2, and 2

95
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,400
by 2, and it makes our
computation simpler.

96
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,200
12 divided by 2 is 6,
2 divided by 2 is 1.

97
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,450
It becomes 27 times 6 inches,
and let's figure

98
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,860
out what that is.

99
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,050
27 times 6.

100
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,340
7 times 6 is 42.

101
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,770
2 times 6 is 12, plus 4 is 16.

102
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:34,910
This is equal to 162 inches,
which makes sense.

103
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,320
4 and 1/2 yards, that gets us to
this number right here: 27

104
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,180
divided by 2 is 13
and 1/2 feet.

105
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,440
You multiply that by
12, it makes sense.

106
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,580
You're going to have
a bunch of inches.

107
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,980
162 inches.

108
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,067
