1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:06,674
We're asked to add 0.822 to 5.65.

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:11,224
So let me rewrite this. And when I rewrite it, I want to line up the decimals,

3
00:00:11,224 --> 00:00:14,163
so that we add the right place to the right place.

4
00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:18,074
And so, we can write either number first, although I like to write the larger number first.

5
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:25,625
So let's write 5.65, and remember, the important thing is that we line up the decimal points.

6
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:31,623
So if we write 0.822, so we line up the decimals - let me line up the decimals first -

7
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:34,988
so I'll write the decimal right below the other decimal,

8
00:00:35,172 --> 00:00:45,424
and it is 0.822. And now we are ready to add. So let's see what's going on here.

9
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:50,670
So, I like to start in the smallest place, that way the carrying works out well.

10
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,334
So you might say, "Wait, I need to add this 2 thousandths to something. I don't see anything up here."

11
00:00:56,334 --> 00:01:00,427
Well, you could say that there's just a "0 thousandths" right up here.

12
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:05,345
Then it makes it very clear. Well, 0 thousandths plus 2 thousandths, is going to be 2 thousandths.

13
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:16,157
Five hundredths plus 2 hundredths is seven hundredths. 6 tenths plus 8 tenths is 14 tenths,

14
00:01:16,374 --> 00:01:22,010
Well, 14 tenths is the same thing as 4 tenths, and 1 one.

15
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,613
Another way of thinking about it, is that you're carrying the 1.

16
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:31,073
But really what you're saying is "Look, this is 14 tenths.". I could write that as 4 tenths and a one.

17
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:33,341
Or 1's place. Or 1 in the 1's place.

18
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:38,582
Then we have 1 plus 5 is 6. And, of course, you can not forget the decimal.

19
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:42,876
The decimal goes right there, and this is 6.472.
