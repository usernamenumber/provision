2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:12,325
We're in Belvedere in Vienna and we're looking at Gustav Klimt's The Kiss from 1908. Probably the most famous Klimt.

3
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:16,529
And I actually have to admit that I had forgotten that the painting is almost a perfect square,

4
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,045
because I have seen it in so many posters where it's been cut down and made into a rectangle.

5
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:28,781
It's a very large painting, and there's so much gold that it's hard not to think of a religious icon.

6
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:34,271
And I think in some ways, Klimt was trying to create a modern icon.

7
00:00:34,271 --> 00:00:37,369
Something that suggested a sense of transcendence.

8
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:41,958
Well, there's no question that the gold here makes you think of the Byzantine tradition,

9
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,610
maybe some of the tile work at Ravenna.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,511
There is a way that patterning, especially around the faces, becomes a kind of a halo as well.

11
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:57,026
You have Klimt building up the gold; he's got those gold circles they actually rise off the surface of the canvas.

12
00:00:57,026 --> 00:01:02,215
And catch the light, much the way the gold was tooled in Medieval paintings.

13
00:01:02,215 --> 00:01:07,076
There is this sense of the male figure, of patterns that are direct linear

14
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:12,398
in contrast to the curvilinear to the circles and the ovals that we see in the female form.

15
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:18,067
The point that you made about the sense of the spiritual is so powerful in this painting.

16
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:26,007
I think we forget that darker gold ground seems so much as if the figures are somehow being dissipated into the cosmos,

17
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:31,020
that they're so lost in the intensity, the eternity of that kiss.

18
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,561
And all removed from the everyday world.

19
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:40,058
I mean, we have to remember that this is a time of incredible modernization in Vienna.

20
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:44,650
The City of Vienna has been transformed in the previous thirty years into a modern city.

21
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:54,069
Here, Klimt is abstracting universal experience from the trauma, the difficulties, the anxieties of everyday life.

22
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:58,383
I think it's also important to see this in relationship to Klimt's Beethoven Frieze.

23
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:03,550
Where the figures confront evil forces, this mythic figures.

24
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:11,032
And in the end, there's this embrace, this kiss, this emergence from evil into fulfillment and perfection.

25
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:15,900
A minute ago, we were looking at the painting by Egon Schiele called The Embrace.

26
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,710
But there, there was so much more of a sense of physicality of the bodies.

27
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:30,014
The way that the bodies really aren't present here, and are cloaked in these decorative forms reminds us how much Klimt,

28
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:38,504
although he was exploring this kind of sensuality, was also disguising and covering it with a kind of decorative patterning.

29
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:45,046
And that's absolutely right, with the exception of the faces. And here, this is where the entire painting changes.

30
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:48,685
The female figure is completely full frontal, but horizontal,

31
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:53,281
so that there is this beautiful sense of her passivity receiving that kiss,

32
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:57,343
but also a kind of deep interior feeling with her eyes closed.

33
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:02,240
Her fingers just delicately touching his as he holds her head.

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:09,427
And his neck reaches out and around, and you get a sense of his physical power through the strength of that neck,

35
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:12,177
but also intensity of his desire.

36
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:13,822
And of course, they're both crowned.

37
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:22,029
On his head you can see a wreath of leaves; on hers almost as if they were the stars of the heavens.

38
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:28,845
Schiele gives us an image of a couple that's electrified by kinds of agitated outlines.

39
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:34,509
Shiele is showing us a kind of truth through the energy of the moment,

40
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:40,396
whereas Klimt seems to be reaching out to a truth that is for all time.

41
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:45,410
That is so aestheticized it feels as if it has a degree of absolute permanence.

42
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:59,745
