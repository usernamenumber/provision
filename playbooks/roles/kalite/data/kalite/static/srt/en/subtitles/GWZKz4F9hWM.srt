1
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:11,204
So that it's less likely that we get shown up by talking birds in the future, we've set a little bit of exercise for solving systems of equations with substitution.

2
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:14,864
And so this is the first exercise or the first problem that they give us.

3
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:19,294
-3x-4y=-2 and y=2x-5

4
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:23,924
So let me get out my little scratch pad and let me rewrite the problem.

5
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:32,177
So this is -3x-4y=-2

6
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,429
and then they tell us y=2x-5.

7
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,942
So, what's neat about this is that they've already solved the second equation.

8
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:46,264
They've already made it explicitly solved for y

9
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:50,969
which makes it very easy to substitute for. We can take this constraint, the constraint on y

10
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:53,854
in terms of x and substitute it for y

11
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:58,342
in this first blue equation and then solve for x.

12
00:00:58,342 --> 00:00:59,824
So let's try it out.

13
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:01,985
So this first blue equation would then become

14
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:07,353
-3x-4 but instead of putting a y there

15
00:01:07,353 --> 00:01:11,742
the second constraint tells us that y needs to be equal to 2x-5.

16
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:22,963
So it's 4(2x-5) and all of that is going to be equal to -2.

17
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:26,198
So now we get just one equation with one unknown.

18
00:01:26,198 --> 00:01:28,313
and now we just have to solve for x.

19
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:30,259
So, let's see if we can do that.

20
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:34,891
So, it's -3x and then this part right over here

21
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:39,266
we have a -4, be careful, we have a -4 we want to distribute.

22
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:45,530
We are going to multiply -4*2x which is -8x

23
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:52,767
and -4*-5 is positive 20 and thats going to equal -2.

24
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:55,802
And now we can combine all the x terms

25
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:02,992
so -3x-8x, that's going to be -11x

26
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:09,965
and then we have -11x+20=-2.

27
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:13,704
Now to solve for x, we'll subtract 20 from both sides

28
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:18,945
to get rid of the 20 on the left hand side.

29
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:21,244
On the left hand side, we're just left with

30
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:30,938
the -11x and then on the right hand side we are left with -22.

31
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:37,410
Now we can divide both sides by -11.

32
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:47,646
And we are left with x is equal to 22 divided by 11 is 2, and the negatives cancel out. x = 2.

33
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:51,024
So we are not quite done yet. We've done, I guess you can say

34
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,856
the hard part, we have solved for x but now we have to solve for y.

35
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:59,279
We could take this x value to either one of these equations and solve for y.

36
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,319
But this second one has already explicitly solved for y

37
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,337
so let's use that one, so it says y = 2 times

38
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:10,895
and instead of x, we now know that the x value

39
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:14,564
where these two intersect, you could view it that way

40
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:19,825
is going to be equal to 2, so 2 * 2 - 5

41
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:25,062
let's figure out the corresponding y value.

42
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:37,898
So you get y=2(2)-5 and y = 4 - 5 so y = -1.

43
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:40,767
And you can verify that it'll work in this top equation

44
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:50,435
If y = -1 and x=2, this top equation becomes -3(2) which is -6-4(-1)

45
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:56,292
which would be plus 4. And -6+4 is indeed -2.

46
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:59,100
So it satisfies both of these equations and now

47
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,029
we can type it in to verify that we got it right,

48
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:06,167
although, we know that we did, so x=2 and y=-1.

49
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:14,071
So, let's type it in... x=2 and y=-1.

50
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:18,071
Excellent, now we're much less likely to be embarassed by talking birds.
