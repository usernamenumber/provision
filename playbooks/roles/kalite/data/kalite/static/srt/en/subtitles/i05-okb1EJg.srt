1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420
   

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,770
What I want to do in this
video is go over the math

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,810
behind a mortgage loan.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,680
And this isn't really going
to be a finance video.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,270
It's actually a lot
more mathematical.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,470
But it addresses, at least in
my mind, one of the most basic

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,470
questions that's at least been
circling in my head

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,120
for a long time.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,970
You know, we take out these
loans to buy houses.

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,100
Let's say you take out a
$200,000 mortgage loan.

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,900
It's secured by your house.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,700
You're going to pay it over--
30 years, or you could

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,180
say that's 360-- months.

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,720
Because if you normally pay the
payments every month, the

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,140
interest normally compounds
on a monthly basis.

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,460
And let's say you're
paying 6%-- interest.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,760
This is annual interest, and
they're usually compounding

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,150
on a monthly basis,
so 6% divided by 12.

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,210
You're talking about
0.5% per month.

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,210
   

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,870
Now normally when you get a
loan like this, your mortgage

22
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,780
broker or your banker will look
into some type of chart or

23
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,480
type in the numbers into some
type of computer program.

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,710
And they'll say oh OK,
your payment is going

25
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,590
to be $1,200 per month.

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:26,170
And if you pay that $1,200 per
month over 360 months, at the

27
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,700
end of those 360 months you
will have paid off the $200,000

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,190
plus any interest that
might have accrued.

29
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,290
But this number it's not
that easy to come along.

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,550
Let's just show an example of
how the actual mortgage works.

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,430
So on day zero, you
have a $200,000 loan.

32
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:51,490
   

33
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,010
You don't pay any
mortgage payments.

34
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,670
You're going to pay your
first mortgage payment

35
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,120
a month from today.

36
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:05,010
So this amount is going to be
compounded by the 0.5%, and

37
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,440
as a decimal that's a 0.005.

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,250
So in a month, with interest,
this will have grown to

39
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:19,200
200,000 times 1 plus 0.005.

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,290
Then you're going
to pay the $1,200.

41
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,485
Just going to be minus 1,200
or maybe I should write 1.2K.

42
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:28,820
But I'm just really just
showing you the idea.

43
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,400
And then for the next month,
whatever is left over is

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,230
going to be compounded
again by the 0.5%, 0.005.

45
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,140
And then the next month you're
going to come back and you're

46
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,010
going to pay this $1,200 again.

47
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,370
Minus $1,200.

48
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,980
And this is going to
happen 360 times.

49
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,250
So you're going to
keep doing this.

50
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,780
And you can imagine if you're
actually trying to solve for

51
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,740
this number-- at the end of it
you're going to have this huge

52
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,090
expression that's going to have
you know 360 parentheses over

53
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,690
here-- and at the end, it's
all going to be equal to 0.

54
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,570
Because after you've paid your
final payment, you're done

55
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,260
paying off the house.

56
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,130
But in general how did they
figure out this payment?

57
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,850
Let's call that p.

58
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,900
Is there any mathematical
way to figure it out?

59
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,580
And to do that, let's get a
little bit more abstract.

60
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,560
Let's say that l is equal
to the loan amount.

61
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,630
   

62
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,660
Let's say that i is equal
to the monthly interest.

63
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:38,340
   

64
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:46,100
Let's say n is equal to
the number of months

65
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,150
that we're dealing with.

66
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,400
And then we're going to set
p is equal to your monthly

67
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,360
payment, your monthly
mortgage payment.

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,340
Some of which is interest, some
of which is principle, but it's

69
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,550
the same amount you're going to
pay every month to pay down

70
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,830
that loan plus interest.

71
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,640
So this is your
monthly payment.

72
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,390
   

73
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,360
So this same expression I just
wrote up there, if I wrote it

74
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,740
in abstract terms, you start
off with a loan amount l.

75
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,100
After 1 month it
compounds as 1 plus i.

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,620
So you multiply it times
1 plus i. i in this

77
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,480
situation was 0.005.

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,440
Then you pay a monthly
payment of p, so minus p.

79
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,560
So that's at the
end of one month.

80
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,330
Now you have some amount still
left over of your loan.

81
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,990
That will now compound
over the next month.

82
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,030
Then you're going to
pay another payment p.

83
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,770
And then this process is going
to repeat 300 or n times,

84
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,920
because I'm staying abstract.

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,870
   

86
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,975
You're going to have
n parentheses.

87
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:57,180
   

88
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,970
And after you've done this
n times, that is all

89
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,830
going to be equal to 0.

90
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,020
So my question, the one that
I'm essentially setting up in

91
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,160
this video, is how
do we solve for p?

92
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,510
You know if we know the loan
amount, if we know the monthly

93
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,980
interest rate, if we know the
number of months, how

94
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,080
do you solve for p?

95
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,870
It doesn't look like this is
really an easy algebraic

96
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,930
equation to solve.

97
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,235
Let's see if we can
make a little headway.

98
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:24,200
   

99
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,360
Let's see if we can rearrange
this in a general way.

100
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,850
So let's start with an example
of n being equal to 1.

101
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,510
If n is equal to 1, then our
situation looks like this:

102
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,850
you take out your loan, you
compound it for one month, 1

103
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,230
plus i, and then you pay
your monthly payment.

104
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,860
Now this was a mortgage that
gets paid off in 1 month, so

105
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,840
after that 1 payment you are
now done with their loan,

106
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,660
you have nothing left over.

107
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,490
Now if we solve for p, you
can now swap the sides.

108
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,630
You get p is equal to
l times 1 plus i.

109
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,920
Or if you divide both sides
by 1 plus i, you get p over

110
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,340
1 plus i is equal to l.

111
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,890
And you might say hey you
already solved for p

112
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,640
why are you doing this?

113
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,950
And I'm doing this, because
I want to show you a

114
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,630
pattern that'll emerge.

115
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,890
Let's see what happens
when n is equal to 2.

116
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,410
   

117
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,300
Well then you start
with your loan amount.

118
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,500
It compounds for one month.

119
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,610
You make your payment.

120
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,380
Then there's some
amount left over.

121
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,400
That will compound
for one month.

122
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,250
Then you make your
second payment.

123
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,480
Now this mortgage only
needs two payments,

124
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,550
so now you are done.

125
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,110
You have no loan left over.

126
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,490
You've paid all the
principal and interest.

127
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,060
Now let's solve for p.

128
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,470
So I'm going to color the p's.

129
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,960
I'm going to make this p pink.

130
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,510
So let's add p to both
sides and swap sides.

131
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,380
So this green p will be
equal to all of this

132
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,310
business over here.

133
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:09,460
Is equal to l times 1 plus
i minus that pink p.

134
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,320
They're the same p, I just
want to show you what's

135
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,040
happening algebraically.

136
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,610
Minus that pink p
times 1 plus i.

137
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,680
Now if you divide both sides
by 1 plus i, you get p over

138
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:30,590
1 plus i is equal to l times
1 plus i minus that pink p.

139
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,380
Now let's add that pink p to
both sides of this equation.

140
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:43,410
You get the pink p plus this
p plus p over 1 plus i is

141
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,350
equal to l times 1 plus i.

142
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,320
Now divide both
sides by 1 plus i.

143
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:59,820
You get the pink p over 1 plus
i plus the green p, the same p,

144
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,210
times-- it already is being
divided by 1 plus i, you're

145
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,910
going to divide it again by 1
plus i, so it's going to be

146
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:10,280
divided by 1 plus i squared
is equal to the loan.

147
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,630
Something interesting
is emerging.

148
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,400
You might want to watch the
videos on present value.

149
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,620
In this situation, you take
your payment, you discount it

150
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,800
by your monthly interest rate,
you get the loan amount.

151
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,490
Here you take each of your
payments, you discount it, you

152
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:31,380
divide it by 1 plus your
monthly interest rate to the

153
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,270
power of the number of months.

154
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,490
So you're essentially taking
the present value of your

155
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,400
payments and once again,
you get your loan amount.

156
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,180
You might want to verify this
for yourself if you want a

157
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,510
little bit of algebra practice.

158
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,670
If you do this with
n is equal to 3.

159
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,110
I'm not going to do it just
for the sake of time.

160
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,280
If you do n is equal to 3,
you're going to get that the

161
00:08:51,280 --> 00:09:00,990
loan is equal to p over 1 plus
i plus p over 1 plus i squared

162
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,600
plus p over 1 plus
i to the third.

163
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,010
If you have some time, I
encourage you to prove this for

164
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,480
yourself just using the exact
same process that we did here.

165
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,460
You're going to see it's going
to get little bit harry.

166
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,800
There's going to be a lot of a
manipulating things, but it

167
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,440
won't take you too long.

168
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,800
But in general, hopefully, I've
shown to you that we can write

169
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,460
the loan amount as the present
value of all of the payments.

170
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,300
So we could say in general the
loan amount, if we now

171
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,790
generalize it to n instead of
and n equals a number, we could

172
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,080
say that it's equal to-- I'll
actually take the p out of the

173
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,940
equation, so it's equal to p,
times 1 plus 1 over 1 plus i

174
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,510
plus 1 over 1 plus i squared
plus, and you just keep

175
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:58,710
doing this n times, plus 1
over 1 plus i to the n.

176
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,760
Now you might recognize this.

177
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,585
This right here is a
geometric series.

178
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:07,180
   

179
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,450
And there are ways to figure
out the sums of geometric

180
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,410
series for arbitrary ends.

181
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,360
   

182
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,330
As I promised at the beginning
of the video this would be

183
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,750
an application of a
geometric series.

184
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:31,250
It's equal to the sum of 1 over
1 plus i to the, well I'll use

185
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:37,040
some other letter here, to
the j from j is equal to 1.

186
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,520
This is to the one power you
could view this is to the first

187
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,340
power to j is equal to n.

188
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,350
That's exactly
what that sum is.

189
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,200
Let's see if there's any simple
way to solve for that sum.

190
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,890
You don't want to
do this 360 times.

191
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,020
You could, you'll get a number,
and then you could divide

192
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,940
l by that number, and you
would have solved for p.

193
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,730
But there's got to be simpler
way to do that, so let's see

194
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,800
if we can simplify this.

195
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,400
Just to make the math easier,
let me make a definition.

196
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,940
Let's say that r is equal
to 1 over 1 plus i.

197
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,350
And let me call
this whole sum s.

198
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,980
This sum right here
is equal to s.

199
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,720
Then if we say r is equal to
each of these terms then s is

200
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,220
going to be equal to this is
going to be r to

201
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,910
the first power.

202
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,420
I'll write r to first this is
going to be r squared, because

203
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,400
if you square the numerator
you just get a 1 again.

204
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,490
So this is plus r squared plus
r to the third, plus all

205
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,410
the way this is r to the n.

206
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,930
And I'll show you
a little trick.

207
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,120
I always forget the formula,
so this is a good way to

208
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,580
figure out the sum of
a geometric series.

209
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,460
Actually this could be used to
find a sum of an infinite

210
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,240
geometric series if you
like, but we're dealing

211
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,940
with a finite one.

212
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,530
Let's multiply s times r.

213
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,880
So r times s is going
to be equal to what?

214
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,720
If you multiply each of these
terms by r, you multiply r

215
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,390
to the first times r
you get r squared.

216
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,750
You multiply r squared times
r you get r to the third.

217
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,650
And then you keep doing that
all the way, you multiply r--

218
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,040
see there's an r to the n minus
one here-- you multiply that

219
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,030
times r, you get r to the n.

220
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,060
And then you multiply r to
the n times r, you get

221
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,500
plus r to the n plus 1.

222
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,120
All this is right here is all
of these terms multiplied

223
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,650
by r, and I just put them
under the same exponent.

224
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,460
Now what you can do is you
could subtract this green

225
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,180
line from this purple line.

226
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:42,720
So if we were to say s
minus rs, what do we get?

227
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,210
I'm just subtracting this
line from that line.

228
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:52,000
Well, you get r1 minus 0,
so you get r to the first

229
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,590
power minus nothing there.

230
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,320
But then you have r squared
minus r squared cancel out r

231
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,090
to the third minus r to
the third cancel out.

232
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,163
They all cancel out, all the
way up to r to the n minus r to

233
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:03,460
the n cancel out, but then
you're left with this

234
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,450
last term here.

235
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,140
And this is why
it's a neat trick.

236
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,280
So you're left with minus
r to the n plus 1.

237
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,910
Now factor out an s.

238
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:18,080
You get s times 1 minus r-- all
I did is I factored out the s--

239
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,670
is equal to r to the first
power minus r to the n plus 1.

240
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,120
And now if you divide
both sides by 1 minus

241
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,580
r, you get your sum.

242
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:42,250
Your sum is equal to r minus r
to the n plus 1 over 1 minus r.

243
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,250
That's what our sum is
equal to, where we defined

244
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,380
our r in this way.

245
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,130
So now we can rewrite this
whole crazy formula.

246
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:55,480
We can say that our loan amount
is equal to our monthly

247
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,990
payment times this thing.

248
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,620
I'll write it in green.

249
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:05,420
Times r minus r
to the n plus 1.

250
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,870
All of that over 1 minus r.

251
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,760
Now if we're trying to solve
for p you multiply both sides

252
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,370
by the inverse of this, and you
get p is equal to your loan

253
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,520
amount times the
inverse of that.

254
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,060
I'm doing it in pink,
because it's the inverse.

255
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:30,860
1 minus r over r minus
r to the n plus 1.

256
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,060
Where r is this
thing right there.

257
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,150
And we are done.

258
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,250
This is how you can actually
solve for your actual

259
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,000
mortgage payment.

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,550
Let's actually apply it.

261
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:45,120
So let's say that your loan
is equal to $200,000.

262
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,400
Let's say that your interest
rate is equal to 6% annually,

263
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:58,220
which is 0.5% monthly which
is the same thing as 0.005.

264
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,230
This is monthly interest rate.

265
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,710
And let's say it's a 30 year
loan, so n is going to

266
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,800
be equal to 360 months.

267
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's figure out what we get.

268
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,830
So the first thing we want
to do is we want to figure

269
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,200
out what our r value is.

270
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,160
   

271
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,350
So r is 1 over 1 plus i.

272
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:31,040
So let's take 1 divided by
1 plus i so plus 0.005.

273
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,050
That's what our monthly
interest is, half a percent.

274
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,590
   

275
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,870
So 0.995 that's what
our r is equal to.

276
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,575
Let me write that down, 0.995.

277
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:48,070
Now this calculator doesn't
store variables, so I'll

278
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,730
just write that down here.

279
00:15:50,730 --> 00:16:00,020
So r is equal to 0.995.

280
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,020
We just used that right there.

281
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,340
I'm losing a little bit
of precision, but I

282
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,140
think it will be OK.

283
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,350
The main thing is I want to
give you the idea here.

284
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,980
So what is our payment amount?

285
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:24,220
Let's multiply our loan amount
that's $200,000 times 1 minus

286
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:48,800
r, so 1 minus 0.995 divided by
r which is 0.995 minus 0.995 to

287
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,390
the of the-- now n is 360
months, so it's going to be

288
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:58,520
360 plus 1 to the 361 power,
something I could definitely

289
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,970
not do in my head, and then I
close the parentheses, and my

290
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,440
final answer is roughly $1,200.

291
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,140
Actually if you do it with the
full precision you get a little

292
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,050
bit lower than that, but this
is going to be roughly $1,200.

293
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,800
So just like that, we were
able to figure out our

294
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,790
actual mortgage payment.

295
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,560
So p is equal to $1,200.

296
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,570
So that was some reasonably
fancy math to figure out

297
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,660
something that most people deal
with everyday, but now you know

298
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,900
the actual math behind it.

299
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,170
You don't have to play with
some table or spreadsheet to

300
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,460
kind of experimentally
get the number.

301
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,422
