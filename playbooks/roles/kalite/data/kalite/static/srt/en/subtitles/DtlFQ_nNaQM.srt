1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,730
Let’s review how China can maintain a trade in balance with the United States

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,720
by artificially keeping its currency weak.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,130
So we have a simplified scenario.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,590
Where we have exchanged it of six Yuan per one dollar,

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,080
we have Chinese manufacturer selling 50 million dollars worth of microwaves.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,830
In United States we have a US software producer selling 20 million dollars

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,520
worth of software in China if we had a floating exchange rate

8
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,030
the supply of dollars is much greater than the demand for dollars.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,770
So the dollar would become weaker.

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,270
It would become weaker.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,170
And the Yuan would become stronger and that would resolve the trading balance.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,890
We saw that the people’s bank of china does not want that happen.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,280
So what they do is that they artificially create,

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,130
artificially create demand for dollars to keep it strong.

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,270
They do that by essentially just printing Yuan and converting it to dollars

16
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,470
and that obviously also increases the supplies of Yuan.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,070
So it makes that less expensive.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,580
It weakens the Yuan, strengthens the dollar.

19
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,950
Now, they’re not going to just sit on literally cash with those dollar bills

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,220
they’ll actually want to lend them out.

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:20,870
So what this does is increase the supply, increases the supply,

22
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,930
of money for loans, supply of loans,

23
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,990
well if you increase the amount of dollars that can be lent.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,480
That’s going to lower the cost of borrowing dollars.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,980
So the affect is you are lowering borrowing costs

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,740
and if you’re lowering borrowing costs that just means

27
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,090
interest is less and it’s easier to use your credit card either for the U.S government,

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,080
or if you’re the U.S. consumer.

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,490
Now if things, if debt becomes cheaper if debt is cheaper.

30
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,400
Debt is cheaper.

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,110
Or we have lower interest rate if you have lower interest rate on your credit card

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,090
that means you are just going to consume more.

33
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,910
Consume more. So the end result,

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,310
the big picture what’s happen here in order to maintain a trade imbalance

35
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,490
in order to keep its currency pegged?

36
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:17,680
You have the Chinese central bank essentially, essentially lent printing money converting it dollars,

37
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,940
and then lending that to the U.S government and consumer

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,120
and what are they are going to do with it?

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,760
Essentially they’re going to end up buying more Chinese goods,

40
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,730
and our simplified example they’ll buy even more microwaves.

41
00:02:30,730 --> 99:59:59,999
