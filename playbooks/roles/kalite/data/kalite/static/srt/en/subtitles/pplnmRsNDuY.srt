1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,610
We're in the last section of test 6.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,480
Section 9, page 743. Problem number 1.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,980
For which of the following values of m

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,110
will the value of 3m minus 1 be greater than 10?

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,930
So we add 1 to both sides.

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,440
3m is going to be greater than 11.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,320
Divide both sides by 3,

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,610
and you don't have to switch the inequality

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,640
because 3 is positive.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,000
So you get m is going to be greater than 11/3,right?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,930
And 11/3, this is what? This is equal to 3 and 2/3.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,620
So anything greater than 3,really,any integer greater than 3.

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,080
If you look at all the choices,

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,250
the only one that's greater than 3 and 2/3 is choice A, 4.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Next problem. If a times k is equal to k--

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,490
sorry, if a times k is equal to a for all values of a,

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,160
what is the value of k?

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,730
And the reason why they have to say all values of a is

19
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,560
because if a was 0, then that would work for any k.

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,400
But if it's for all values of k,

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,180
you divide both sides of this equation by a,

22
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,080
you get k is equal to a/a which is equal to 1.

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,060
So k would have be equal to 1, which is D.

24
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,770
And you knew that. You didn't have to do any algebra.

25
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,620
If I multiply something times some number

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,010
and I get the original thing, that number's going to be 1.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:42,540
Problem 3. So let me draw what they've drawn.

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,250
So I have one parallel line like that.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,620
I'm assuming they're parallel,

30
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,940
because they look parallel in the picture.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,820
And then there's a line that comes down like this.

32
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,560
There's another line that goes up like that.

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,190
And what do they tell us about it?

34
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,000
They tell us that this is x degrees right here.

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,420
This is z degrees. This is y degrees.

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,850
This is line l. This is line m.

37
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,960
In the figure above,l is parallel to m.

38
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,470
If x is equal to 80 degrees-- so this is 80 degrees--

39
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,260
and y is equal to 70 degrees, what is the value of z?

40
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,790
So the trick here is just to see the opposite angles.

41
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,590
In fact, the information that

42
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,140
they're parallel lines is actually just extra information

43
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,630
to start making you do corresponding angles

44
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,840
and all that kind of fancy stuff.

45
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,110
Which you could do.

46
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,040
But the really easy thing is to realize that x,

47
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,380
this angle, is the same thing as this angle,

48
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,430
which is going to be 80 degrees. Right?

49
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,910
Because they're opposite angles of intersecting lines.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,880
And this--

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,130
if that's 70, then this angle is also going to be 70.

52
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,690
And now 80 plus 70 plus z has to equal 180,

53
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,340
because they're all in the same triangle together.

54
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,620
Subtract 150 from both sides,

55
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,350
you get z is equal to 30 degrees.

56
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,360
The other way you could have done it

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,750
is you could have used the information

58
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,860
about the parallel lines.

59
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,620
And you could have said,

60
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,960
well,the corresponding angle here is here,

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,490
so that this is also 80 degrees.

62
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,930
And you could have said the corresponding angle here

63
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,720
is also here, so this is 70 degrees.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,940
And then you could have said

65
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,450
all three of these are supplementary,

66
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,920
and that they would have to add up to 180.

67
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,430
And you'd get z equals 30 either way. And that is choice A.

68
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,740
Next problem. Problem 4.

69
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,890
The scenic route from Mia's home to her office

70
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,960
is 5 kilometers longer than the direct route.

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,540
So I'll call S for scenic.

72
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,610
S is equal to the direct route plus 4.

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,480
The scenic route is 4 miles longer than the direct route,

74
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,510
or 4 kilometers.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,580
When she goes by the scenic route

76
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,500
and returns by the direct route,

77
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,300
the round trip is 35 kilometers.

78
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,730
So that means what? The distance of the scenic route

79
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,830
plus the distance of the direct route

80
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,090
is equal to 35 kilometers.

81
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,370
How many kilometers is the direct route?

82
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,040
So we want to solve for this.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,150
So this top equation,

84
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:41,530
we can rewrite this as S minus D is equal to 4.

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,210
And actually just to make things-- well,

86
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,240
let me write that down right here.

87
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,660
So you get S minus D is equal to 4.

88
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,000
And we can multiply this equation by negative 1,

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,780
so you cancel out the S's instead of the D's,

90
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,220
but since it's so convenient already,

91
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,390
let's just cancel out the D's and solve for the scenic route.

92
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,110
The S's.

93
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,050
So this is just a system with two equations and two unknowns.

94
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,930
So let's add these two equations.

95
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:16,050
So you get 2S-- D plus D is 0-- is equal to 35 plus 4 is 39.

96
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:26,250
The numbers look strange. The scenic distance is 39/2. Right?

97
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,640
That's 39/2 kilometers. And what is that equal to?

98
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,280
If I were to write that as a mixed number.

99
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,060
Let's see. 38 is-- that's 19 and 1/2 kilometers.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,590
A little less than 20 kilometers. That's the scenic route.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,650
The direct route is 4 less than that, right?

102
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,180
We said the scenic route is 4 more than the direct route.

103
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,770
So the direct route is going to be that minus 4.

104
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,180
So what's 19 minus 4?

105
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,690
It's 15, and then you still have that half there.

106
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,630
15 and 1/2 kilometers.

107
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,070
And I don't see that choice there,

108
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,570
so I must have made a mistake.

109
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,650
Let me do it here, just to see where--

110
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,190
I don't see that choice.

111
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,880
The scenic route from Mia's home to her office

112
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,790
is 5 kilometers longer than the direct route. Right.

113
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,440
The scenic route-- we could even say scenic route minus--

114
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,070
oh, sorry, it's 5 kilometers longer.

115
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,100
Sorry. This is 5. That was my mistake.

116
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,990
5 kilometers longer. Scenic minus direct is 5.

117
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,320
They normally don't give weird numbers like that.

118
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:34,300
So this is 5. This is 40. This is 40/2. This is 20.

119
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,790
Hope I'm not confusing you.

120
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,920
And then if you're going to be 5 less than 20,

121
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,880
it's going to be 15 kilometers, right?

122
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,850
I hope you see what I just did.

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,160
I wrote 4 kilometers longer instead of 5.

124
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,750
That was my mistake, which you should avoid.

125
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:54,280
Next problem. Let me switch colors.

126
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,740
I think that yellow induces careless mistakes. 5.

127
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,170
A complete cycle of a traffic light takes 80 seconds.

128
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,500
During each cycle, the light is green for 40 seconds.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,920
Amber-- I guess that's red--amber for 10 seconds.

130
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,310
Oh, I guess amber is yellow. I don't know my colors.

131
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,900
And red for 30 seconds.

132
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,620
And the whole cycle takes 80 seconds.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,100
If you add those up. At a randomly chosen time,

134
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,740
what is the probability that the light will not be red?

135
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,400
So the probability that the light will not be red

136
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,180
is the probability that it's going to be green or amber.

137
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,500
And it's green or amber for 40 plus 10,

138
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,180
for 50 seconds out of a total of 80 seconds, right?

139
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,610
So the probability that

140
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,580
when you randomly walk up to the light,

141
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,040
that it's going to be green or amber--

142
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,650
or not red-- is going to be 50 seconds.

143
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,840
50/80, which is 5/8. And that is choice B.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,810
Next problem. Problem 6.

145
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,080
For a certain hot water heater,

146
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,240
the increase in heating expenses

147
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,500
is directly proportional to the increase

148
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,210
in the water temperature setting.

149
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,000
If heating expenses increase by $24

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,460
when the water temperature

151
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,770
is increased by 20 degrees Fahrenheit-- so

152
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:28,770
expense goes up by 24

153
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:37,130
when temperature is increased by 20 degrees Fahrenheit.

154
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,010
By how much will heating expenses increase

155
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,420
when the water temperature setting

156
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,750
is increased by 15 degrees Fahrenheit?

157
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,890
So this is just a ratio problem.

158
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,730
So you say, well, the expenses go up $24

159
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,610
when we have a 20-degree increase in temperature.

160
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,180
So then how many dollars will it increase

161
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,930
when you have a 15-degree increase?

162
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,970
The denominator in both cases was the change in temperature.

163
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,160
And then this is the change in expense.

164
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,690
The triangle means change, right?

165
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,860
So you just have to make sure that

166
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,910
the ratios are consistent and let's just multiply.

167
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,440
You get 20--actually,and so we don't have to get big numbers,

168
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,460
let me reduce this fraction. Divide the top and the bottom.

169
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,900
This is the same thing as 6/5 is equal to x/15.

170
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,930
This is easier to multiply now.

171
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,360
You get 5x is equal to 15 times 6.

172
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,360
Divide both sides by 5.

173
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,370
You get x is equal to 15 times 6 divided by 5.

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,610
That's 3, that's 1, that's 18.

175
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,800
So the change in expense will be $18, and that's choice B.

176
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,000
