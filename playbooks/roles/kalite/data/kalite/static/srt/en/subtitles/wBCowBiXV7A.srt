1
00:00:00,987 --> 00:00:05,968
You might have heard the term LIBOR when people are quoting interest rates.

2
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:11,076
Or they're saying "Hey I'm gonna lend you money a few percentage points above LIBOR"

3
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:14,267
You will hear...LIBOR quoted on some of the financial news channels.

4
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:21,533
And what it is, is just an average of the interest rates that banks are lending to each other.

5
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:27,533
And it is calculated by the British Bank Association.

6
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:30,350
It's actually calcuated by Thomson Reuters for the British Bank Association.

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:35,944
But it's there to kind of provide a benchmark for other types of securities and financial transactions.

8
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:40,267
And it literally stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate.

9
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:45,733
So...it's the..... in London...it's the rate..the offered rate between banks.

10
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,667
The London Interbank Offered Rate.

11
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:52,667
To understand that a little bit better we have set up two banks over here

12
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:56,359
Bank A and Bank B. And you might have already known that

13
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,095
when you go and deposit your money in banks,

14
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:01,791
the bank won't leave all that money around.

15
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:08,267
The way it makes money is lend a good bit of money to other people as loans.

16
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:10,283
And it keeps just enough cash on hand

17
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:14,467
That things well you know, people would actually come and ask for money from their checking account.

18
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:15,933
We have enough on hand

19
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:19,636
You could imagine....every now and then that bank might get low on cash.

20
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:22,875
or it might get close to kind of a reserve requirement

21
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,867
that the central bank in that country requires a bank to have on it.

22
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:32,231
So in those situations ...say bank A is getting to that...that situation.

23
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:34,200
They said "let me go borrow some money"

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,067
Let me go borrow money from another bank.

25
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,056
So this is interbank borrowing.

26
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:41,000
Bank B over here they are flushed with cash

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,067
So they say we don't like to keep so much cash around.

28
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:46,754
We want to lend it. So we can actually get interest. We get no interest on cash

29
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:49,933
So maybe bank B lends money to Bank A

30
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:53,067
So maybe they lend this much cash

31
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:55,548
So that's the new cash that bank A got.

32
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,338
Right over there ...the new cash

33
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:01,671
And of course it is a loan

34
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:05,079
So this is a new loan. To offset it, remember

35
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,570
assets are equal to liabilities plus equity.

36
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,985
So liabilities is this whole thing over here.

37
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:15,187
So this is loan from B for this cash.

38
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:18,530
They have a little bit better of a cushion.

39
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,035
And now B, their loan has increased and their cash has decreased.

40
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:26,053
So this is a loan, loan to A.

41
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:29,444
Right now, they took this cash and they gave to bank A

42
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:32,694
And that rate that they lent it at,

43
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,038
maybe it was that 1% annual rate.

44
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:41,656
And of course it is to be renewed everyday, it is overnight rate.

45
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:44,119
This rate is an interbank rate.

46
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:48,856
So what they do is on behalf of the British Bank Association

47
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:51,456
They go survey a bunch of banks in London

48
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:54,333
eight, twelve, sixteen banks in London.

49
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,122
So they said "Hey what was the rate in which you all transacted"

50
00:02:57,122 --> 00:03:00,373
and they will quote that

51
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:03,205
They quote that as the overnight LIBOR

52
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:08,830
So they quoted it, say hey 1.2% across all of the banks that we surveyed

53
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,726
But what's interesting about the LIBOR, it is done in ten currencies

54
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,723
It is not just in the sterling, the dollar

55
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:18,733
or the yen...It is in ten currencies

56
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,642
That's what really differentiate it amongst other things

57
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:28,605
But really differentiate it from the effective Federal Funds Rate which is another interbank borrowing rate

58
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:30,867
But that's in the United States

59
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:34,390
And that's more revolving around policy concerns.

60
00:03:34,390 --> 99:59:59,999
The Federal Bank actually tries to change it.
