99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the last video, we talk about how seasons on Earth are not caused

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by how close Earth is to the Sun, its orbit.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We also hint at the fact that it's actually bacause by tilt of the Earth.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so, in this video, I wanna show you

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how the tilt of the Earth causes the seasons to happen.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's draw...

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll try to draw as many diagrams as possible here

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because at least for my brain and they help me visualize what's actually going on.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we can imagine a top view first.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let's have a top view.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That is the Sun right over there.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let me draw Earth's orbit.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So Earth's orbit maybe looks something like that.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me draw it almost - it is almost circular.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I'll draw this something that's pretty close to a circle right over here.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now,I gonna draw Earth at different points in its orbit

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I will try to depict the tilt of its rotational axis.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And obviously this is not drawn anywhere near close the scale.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Earth is much further away from the Sun

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and much much smaller than the Sun as well.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I'll draw the Earth at that point,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and at this point the Earth will be tilted away from the Sun.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, Earth's tilt does not change if you think about the direction -

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or this over the course of a year,

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're talking about relatively small periods of time -

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it does not change relative to the direction that it's pointing at in the universe.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me .. I will talk about that in a second.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let's say right over here we are pointed away from the Sun,

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we're up and out of this page.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so I will put some perspective of an arrow.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Actually it would be more like up and out of this page,

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so, that's the direction if you were to come straight out of the North Pole,

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you were to come straight out of the South Pole,

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you would go below that circle right over there.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if I wanna draw the same position but if we were looking sideways,

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
along the orbital plane, or the plane of Earth's orbit,

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so for looking at from that direction,

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let me do it this way.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For looking at directly sideways,

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is the Sun right over here

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is Earth at that position.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I were to draw an arrow pointing sraight out of the North Pole,

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it would look something like this.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this arrow and this arrow, they are both popping straight out of the North Pole.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so, when we talk about the tilt of the Earth,

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're talking about the tilt of its orbital axis,

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
kind of this pole that can go straight between the South Pole and the North Pole.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The angle between that and the pole that would actually be at a 90° angle

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and perpendicular to the plane of its orbit,

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
compared to it if it was just sraight up and down

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
relativ to the plane of the orbit.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, this right here is the angle of Earth's tilt.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me draw that a little bit bigger

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just so it becomes a little bit clearer.

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, this is the plane of the orbit,

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're looking sideways along the plane of the orbit,

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is Earth right over here.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My best attempt to draw a circle.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That is Earth.

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Earth does not rotate, its axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the plane of the orbit.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, this is how Earth would rotate if it was.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Earth's rotational axis is at an angle to that vertical

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
relative to the plane of its orbit, I guess you could say it.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It rotates at an angle like this.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, this would be the North Pole,

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is the South Pole,

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so it rotates like this.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that angle relativ to being vertical

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with respect to the orbital plane,

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this angle right here for Earth right now

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is 24. ... is 20 ...

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sorry, 23,4°.

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
23,4°

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And for talking about relatively short periods of time,

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
like, you know, our life spans,

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is constant.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it is actually changing over long periods of time.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That is changing between, and these are rough numbers,

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is is changing between 22,1° and 24,5°, if my sources are correct,

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but I guess they're rough estimate of what it's changing between.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But I wanna make it clear: this is not happening overnight.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The period that it takes to go from roughly a 22° angle to a 24,5° angle and back to the 22° angle

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is 41,000 years.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this long-term change in the tilt,

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this might have played to some of the long-term climate change,

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe it might have contributed on some level to some of the Ice Ages

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that have formed over Earht's past,

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but for the sake of thinking about our annual seasons,

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you don't have to worry too much,

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or you don't have to worry at all really about this variation.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You really just have to know that it is tilted,

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and right now it is tilted in an angle of 23,4°.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, you might say: 'OK, I understand what the tilt is,

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but how does that change the season,

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the .. of the Northern or that Southern Hemisphere.

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And to do that, I'm going to imagine the Earth

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when the Northern Hemisphere is most tilted away from the Sun

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and when it is most tilted towards the Sun.

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So remember, this tilt, the direction this arrow poits into relative the rest of the universe,

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if we assume that this tilt, that 23,4° it's not changing throughout the year,

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but depending on where it is in the orbit

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's either going to be tilted away from the Sun,

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as it is in this example right over here,

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or it would be tilting towards the Sun.

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I will do the "towards the Sun" in this magenta color.

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or it will be tilting towards the Sun.

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, six months later when the Earth is over here,

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
relative to the rest of the universe it will be tilted in that same direction,

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
up, out of this page and to the right.

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, out of this page and to the right again,

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just like it was over here,

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but now that it's on the other side of the Sun,

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that makes the tilt a little bit more towards the Sun.

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I were to draw it right over here,

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it is now tilted towards the Sun.

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what I want to think about is

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how much sunlight will different parts of the planet receive,

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'll focus on the Northern Hemisphere,

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but you can make a similiar argument for the Southern Hemisphere.

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I wanna think about how much sunlight they receive

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at when it's tilted away or tilted towards the Sun.

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's think about those two situations.

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, first of all let's think about the situation here

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where we're tilted away from the Sun.

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let me zoom it a little bit.

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the situation where we're tilted away from the Sun.

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, if this is the vertical ...

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I could actually use this diagram, but let me make it.

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we're tilted away from the Sun like this,

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me use a different color...

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, if we had an arrow coming straight out of the North Pole,

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it would look like this.

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we have an arrow coming straight out of the North Pole

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're rotating around like that.

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Out of the page on the left-hand side

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and into the page on the right-hand side.

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so we're rotating towards the east constantly.

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, this arrow is in the direction of the east.

139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, when we're at this point in Earth's orbit,

140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and actually let me copy and paste this

141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'm going to use the same exact diagram for the different seasons.

142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let me copy and paste this exact same diagram,

143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll do it over here for two different points.

144
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, when we're here in Earth's orbit,

145
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where is the sunlight coming from?

146
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, it's going to be coming from the left,

147
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at least the way I've drawn the diagram right over here.

148
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, the sunlight is coming from the left.

149
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sunlight is coming from the left in this sutation.

150
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so if you think about it,

151
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what half of the Earth or what part of the Earth

152
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is being lit by sunlight?

153
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or what part of the Earth is in daylight?

154
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The way I have drawn it over here.

155
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, the part that is facing the Sun!

156
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, all of this right over here is going to be in daylight.

157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As we rotate, whatever part of the surface of the Earth

158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
enters into this yellow part right over here

159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will be in daylight.

160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But let's think about what's happening at different parts of the Earth.

161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me draw the equator

162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which separates our Northern and Southern hemispheres.

163
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, this is the equator.

164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then let me go to the Northern Hemisphere.

165
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I wanna show you why when the North Pole is pointed away from the Sun,

166
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
why this is our winter.

167
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, when we're pointed away from the Sun...

168
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or if we go to the Actic Circle.

169
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me go right over here.

170
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me go to some point in the Arctic Circle.

171
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As it goes, as the Earth rotates every 24 hours,

172
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this point on the globe will just rotate around just like that.

173
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It will just keep rotating around just like that.

174
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My question is: that point at the Arctic Circle that rotates,

175
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will it ever see the sunlight?

176
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, no, it will never see the sunlight.

177
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun.

178
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, what I'm shading here in purple,

179
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that part of the Earth that's completely tilted away

180
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will never see sunlight.

181
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or at least it won't see sunlight while it'S tilted away,

182
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
why it's in this position in the orbit.

183
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It never... I won't say never because once it becames summer,

184
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they will be able to see the Sun,

185
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so, no sunlight, no day I guess you could say.

186
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
No daylight.

187
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If go to slightly more southern latitudes,

188
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's say you go over here,

189
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe that's the latitude of something like

190
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
New York, San Francisco or somenthing like that.

191
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's think about what it would see as the Earth rotates every 24 hours.

192
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, this would be daylight,

193
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then nighttime,

194
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is now going behind the globe,

195
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
nighttime, nighttime,

196
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
daylight, daylight.

197
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, if you just compare this,

198
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me do the daylight in orange,

199
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
daylight is in orange

200
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and nighttime I'll do in this bluish-pruplish color.

201
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So nighttime over here.

202
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you go to really northern latitudes like the Arctic Circle,

203
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they don't get any daylight when we're tilted away from the Sun.

204
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we go to slightly still northern latitudes,

205
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but not as northern as the Arctic Circle,

206
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it does get daylight, but it gets a lot less daylight.

207
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It spends a lot less in the daylight than in the nigttime.

208
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So notice, if you say that this circumference represents the possition over 24 horus,

209
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it spends much less time in the daylight

210
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
than it does in the nighttime.

211
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, because while the Northern Hermisphere is tilted away from the Sun,

212
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere are getting less daylight.

213
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They're getting less daylight.

214
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They're also getting less energy from the Sun,

215
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's what leads to winter

216
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or just being generally colder.
