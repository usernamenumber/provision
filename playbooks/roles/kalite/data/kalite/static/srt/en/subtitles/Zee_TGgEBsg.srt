1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,200
We're now on test number
6 in section 3.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,140
Let's just get started.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:06,245
Problem number 1.

4
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:06,895
Which of the following numbers
is between 1/5 and 1/4?

5
00:00:06,895 --> 00:00:07,623
So when you look at the choices,
you immediately see

6
00:00:07,623 --> 00:00:07,991
that all of the numbers
are decimals.

7
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:08,226
So let's just convert
these to decimals.

8
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:08,421
1/5 is what?

9
00:00:08,421 --> 00:00:08,742
It's 0.2.

10
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:09,177
And 1/4 is 0.25.

11
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:09,421
So we need a number that's
larger-- so let me call it x--

12
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:09,695
than 0.2 and less than 0.25.

13
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:09,941
And if you look at the choices,
d is that answer.

14
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:10,196
And if you didn't know off
hand that 1/5 is 0.2, you

15
00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:10,429
could divide 5 into 1.0.

16
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:10,637
5 goes into 10 two times.

17
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:50,450
2 times 10 is 10, 0, and then,
of course, the decimal you

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,590
bring up, so it's 0.2 times.

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,540
And just do the same
thing with 1/4.

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,970
Next problem.

21
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,630
Problem 2.

22
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,150
The following are coordinates
of points in the xy plane.

23
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,800
Which of these points is
nearest the origin?

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,690
So if we look at all of the
choices-- well, let me

25
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,110
actually write all
the choices down.

26
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,020
We have a, a says
0, minus 1/2.

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,160
b is-- I was thinking whether
I should draw these for you,

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,540
but it's good to learn how
to do this without

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,540
drawing-- 0, 1/2.

30
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:32,400
c is 1/2, minus 1/2.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,550
d is 1/2, 1/2.

32
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:45,530
And e is minus 1, minus 1.

33
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,110
So if we look at all the
choices, we didn't move at all

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,520
along the x-axis here, right?

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,560
Because we're still
at x equals 0.

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,740
We want to figure out how
far it is away from 0.

37
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,130
So we didn't move at all from
the x-axis and we went one

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,510
below the y-axis here,
to minus one.

39
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,070
Clearly b is closer than
a because b is

40
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,220
only 1/2 away, right?

41
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,320
Once again, we didn't move on
the x-axis, and we only moved

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,470
1/2 away on the y-axis.

43
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,680
So a is not our choice.

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,350
So far, b is our
best contender.

45
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,790
It's only 1/2 away
from the origin.

46
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,720
c is 1/2 away in the x direction
and 1/2 away in the

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,720
y direction, and if you do
the math, if you use the

48
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,365
Pythagorean theorem, you'll see
that, of course, is going

49
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:29,080
to be further than 1/2.

50
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,270
And let me just draw a little
bit of a graphic for you just

51
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,240
so you get the intuition.

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,550
How I can do that without
drawing it.

53
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,800
So this point is 0, 1/2.

54
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,200
So that point is here.

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,450
That's our best contender
right now, 0, 1/2.

56
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,480
The point 1/2, negative
1/2 is here.

57
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,570
See, this is 1/2
minus 1/2 here.

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,450
So its distance from
the origin is

59
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,450
this line right here.

60
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,980
And that difference is
definitely going to be longer

61
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,730
than this distance.

62
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,170
How do I know?

63
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,890
Because this distance is the
same thing as this distance,

64
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,800
it's the same thing as 1/2 to
the negative side, right?

65
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,570
And if you do the Pythagorean
theorem, we

66
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,340
could figure it out.

67
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,420
This distance is 1/2
half as well.

68
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,700
This is going to be the square
root of 1/2 squared plus 1/2

69
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,950
squared, so 1/4 plus
1/4, which is 1/2.

70
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,020
So it's the square root of
1/2, which is 1 over the

71
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,190
square root of 2.

72
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,550
Which is the same thing as two
square roots of 2 over 2.

73
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,750
Any way you look at it, it is
a bigger number than 1/2.

74
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,120
When you take a square root of
a fraction, you're going to

75
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,680
get something bigger than
the fraction, right?

76
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,250
So this is essentially the
square root of 1/2.

77
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,810
So it's going to be
bigger than 1/2.

78
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,930
So we know that this
isn't the choice.

79
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,005
And d is the same distance as c,
d is up here, it's just in

80
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:59,740
the positive quadrant, right?

81
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,190
This distance is 1/2 and then
this distance is 1/2.

82
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,320
So d, for the same reasons,
is further then b.

83
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,910
And e is the furthest
of them all, right?

84
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,890
It's one away in two directions,
so it's out here

85
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,520
someplace relative to
this origin, so

86
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,330
that's not the choice.

87
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,190
So b is definitely the closest,
and it's only 1/2

88
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,610
units away from the origin.

89
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,860
Next problem.

90
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,120
I will change colors
for variety.

91
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,370
Problem 3.

92
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,330
OK, they drew a lot here.

93
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,090
Let me see if I can draw the
same thing they did.

94
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,746
So they have a horizontal
line.

95
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,380
I want to draw just like
the way they did it.

96
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:51,730
And so then there's
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

97
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,660
I'm telling you, drawing
it is the hardest part.

98
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:04,110
And they have something
like this, like that,

99
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,310
and then like that.

100
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,410
And then the next two don't go
all the way through, they go

101
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,090
kind of halfway.

102
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,050
That one goes like that.

103
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,100
And that one.

104
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,090
That's my best shot.

105
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:25,670
And they say that this is x
degrees, x degrees, x degrees,

106
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,980
x degrees, x degrees, x
degrees, x degrees.

107
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,940
And they say that this big one
right here is y degrees.

108
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,180
In the figure above, what
is the value of y?

109
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,880
Well, the first thing I would
do is figure out what the

110
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
value of x is.

111
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,840
And how do I do that?

112
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,470
Well, you could make a whole
circle or whatever, but you

113
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:52,010
could say look, all of these
x's here, how many is that?

114
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,470
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, x's right?

115
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,660
These five x's are collectively
supplementary to

116
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,350
each other, right?

117
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,590
They're going to add
up to 180 degrees.

118
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:07,240
So we know that 5x is equal
to 180 degrees.

119
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,230
And that x is equal to-- how
many times does 5 go into 180?

120
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,740
5 goes into 150 30 times, and
so there's another 30, so

121
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,210
it'll go into it 36 times.

122
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,680
So x equal to 36 degrees,
you just divide

123
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,470
180 by 5 to get that.

124
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,780
So how do we figure out y?

125
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,820
Well, the easy way to do this
is say well, if you go into

126
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:38,180
the other side of the circle,
that's also going to be equal

127
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,470
to 180 degrees, right?

128
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,910
So we have two x's here.

129
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,160
And then we have y, right?

130
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,090
So you could say y plus
2x is equal to 180.

131
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,290
I know what x is.

132
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,990
x is 36 degrees, so y
plus 2 times 36 is

133
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,170
72 is equal to 180.

134
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:12,340
y is equal to 180 minus 72,
which is 108 degrees.

135
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,360
Now, if you wanted to do this
really, really, really fast,

136
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,080
what you could have said
is well, you know what?

137
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,440
If I kept drawing these
x's all the way

138
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,730
around the circle, right?

139
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:27,420
So let's say that I had
lines like this.

140
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,820
Say this line actually just
continues on like this.

141
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,310
And let's say that this line
continued on like this.

142
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,790
And we know that this is kind
of a visualization exercise,

143
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,290
but you'd have known that this
is x, this is x, this is x.

144
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,620
And then how many x's
total are there?

145
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,790
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

146
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,020
There would have been
10 x's, right?

147
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,630
And we're going all the way
around the circle, so 10x

148
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,090
would equal 360.

149
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,760
x is equal to 36.

150
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,380
And then a really easy thing,
you could've said well y is 3

151
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,150
of these x's, right?

152
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,870
1, 2, 3.

153
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,190
y is three of those x's,
so three times

154
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,650
36 is equal to 108.

155
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,740
Either way would've been fine.

156
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,970
I think the way we did it the
first time, well, it didn't

157
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,880
take too long, but if you
can do it faster,

158
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,832
that all the better.

159
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:16,490
Because at some point,
the SAT really just

160
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,770
becomes a speed exam.

161
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,020
Problem number 4.

162
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:34,130
If 6,565 is equal to 65 times
x plus 1, then x equals?

163
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,280
So the real trick here is being
able to divide fast.

164
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,710
Divide both sides by 65, you
get 65 goes into 6,565 goes

165
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:48,200
into 65 one time, 1 time 65, 0,
0, 6, goes into it 0 times.

166
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,410
Get a 0, 65, goes into
65 one time.

167
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,560
So you divide both sides
by 65, you get 101 is

168
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,920
equal to x plus 1.

169
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,180
Subtract 1 from both sides,
you get 100 is equal to x.

170
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,960
This is just kind of
a speed problem.

171
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,500
Maybe they want to make you
have a careless mistake.

172
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,920
The answer is c.

173
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,880
I'll see you in the
next video.
