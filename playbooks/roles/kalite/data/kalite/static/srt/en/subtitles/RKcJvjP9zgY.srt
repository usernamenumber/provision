2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:08,814
Not all artists that produce religious work are themselves religious.

3
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:11,742
But an exception to that was Bernini.

4
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:15,317
Bernini was deeply religious, but he was also

5
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:17,334
especially interested in the theater.

6
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:22,273
He did set designs, he wrote plays, and he brought together

7
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:26,256
his deep religious faith and his interest in theater

8
00:00:26,256 --> 00:00:30,014
here in this great masterpiece, "The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa."

9
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:35,273
-Within the Cornaro Chapel, within the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria.

10
00:00:35,273 --> 00:00:38,637
It's important to think about the sculpture with the architecture,

11
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:41,833
because Bernini was both a sculptor and an architect.

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,356
And you could say he brought together not only sculpture and architecture here,

13
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:48,511
but also painting, because he's using colored marble.

14
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:51,755
There's also fresco up on the ceiling, and there's stained glass.

15
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:56,637
And you've got gilding, and so it really is an entire installation piece.

16
00:00:56,637 --> 00:01:02,808
He used whatever means he could to do what all Baroque art tried to do, and that is

17
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:06,124
to involve the viewer, to inspire faith.

18
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:11,459
-And to inspire faith again in the miraculous, and that's precisely what this is about.

19
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,733
The subject matter is the Ecstasy of St. Teresa; that is,

20
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:19,722
a woman who had recently been canonized, been made a saint,

21
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:25,421
who is here having one of her not-so-uncommon visions of an angel.

22
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:33,167
That's right. She was canonized in 1622, and she wrote accounts of the visions that she had of angels.

23
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:37,933
I can read the one that Bernini used for the "Ecstasy of St. Teresa."

24
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:38,573
-Please do.

25
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:43,107
"Beside me on the left appeared an angel in bodily form.

26
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:46,934
He was not tall, but short, and very beautiful;

27
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:51,356
and his face was so aflame that he appeared to be one of the highest ranks of angels,

28
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:56,386
who seem to be all on fire. In his hands I saw a great golden spear,

29
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:59,635
and at the iron tip there appeared to be a point of fire.

30
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:02,662
This he plunged into my heart several times,

31
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:04,826
so that it penetrated to my entrails.

32
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:07,394
When he pulled it out I felt that he took them with it,

33
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:11,373
and left me utterly consumed by the great love of God.

34
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:15,211
The pain was so severe that it made me utter several moans.

35
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:19,509
The sweetness caused me by this intense pain is so extreme

36
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:22,504
that one cannot possibly wish it to cease,

37
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:25,956
nor is one's soul content with anything but God.

38
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:29,308
This is not a physical, but a spiritual pain,

39
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:33,395
though the body has some share in it, even a considerable share."

40
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:35,872
That last line is especially important.

41
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:41,896
Both the text that you just read and Bernini's approach use the physical body

42
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:48,016
and a kind of sexual symbolism to get at the spiritual experience.

43
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,610
-That's right, to represent it for us.

44
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:57,979
We need to understand St. Teresa's spiritual visions by means of a metaphor; that's all we have.

45
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:02,024
We don't have visions, you and I; most people don't. But St. Teresa was blessed.

46
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:07,050
The only way that Bernini and St. Teresa herself could explain that to us

47
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,842
was by a metaphor involving the body:

48
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:14,939
This made her moan; this was a physical experience.

49
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:22,006
And so Bernini has translated that relationship between the physical and spiritual into stone;

50
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:26,593
and if we look, for instance, at the two figures, we see this gorgeous angel,

51
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:30,545
who is plunging that arrow that she spoke of with its iron tip,

52
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:35,639
pointing it right at her, and you can see her body writhing under the heavy cloth.

53
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,176
He has this very sweet, angelic smile on his face.

54
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:41,693
His body is very graceful.

55
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:45,695
There's such a difference in that gauze fabric that he wears.

56
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:50,256
-Well, look at the way the wind seems to whip it around his body, creating this fabulous torsion,

57
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:55,089
in such contrast to the heavy quality of the cloth that she wears.

58
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:57,314
She is of the earth, he is of the heavens.

59
00:03:57,314 --> 00:04:02,326
-And that also in contrast to the feathers that we can almost feel in his wings.

60
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:06,511
Bernini is using marble, the same substance, for all of these,

61
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:09,541
but making them seem such different textures.

62
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,173
-Well, it's almost impossible to remember this is marble, in fact.

63
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:15,679
Especially because the whole thing seems to float in midair.

64
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:18,976
Well, he's done that by supporting it from quite a deep recess,

65
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:22,858
so that everything underneath is in shadow, and the miraculous is expressed.

66
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,798
You know, this is the Counter-Reformation.

67
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:29,359
This is a moment when Protestants in the North are revolting against the Catholics

68
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:33,930
and are saying that the pomp and the ceremony of the Catholic tradition

69
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,625
is not necessary; it gets in the way.

70
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,910
The Protestants said that we should have a personal relationship with God,

71
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,972
that we didn't need all that ceremony of the Church.

72
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:45,377
And what Bernini is doing here, very cleverly,

73
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:48,215
is in fact using all that pomp and ceremony,

74
00:04:48,215 --> 00:04:51,399
all of the fabulous gold, all of the marble here,

75
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,412
to express a direct relationship between an individual and the spiritual realm.

76
00:04:56,412 --> 00:05:00,013
-Giving us a kind of dramatic access to that.

77
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:04,254
And the main thing that Baroque art always does is that it involves the viewer;

78
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:07,078
and here Bernini does that in a number of ways.

79
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:12,175
He's not just thinking about the sculpture of St. Teresa and the angel, but about the whole space of the chapel;

80
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:15,446
because on either side, we see relief sculptures

81
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:17,885
of figures that look like they're in theater boxes,

82
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,411
as though we were part of an audience,

83
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:25,094
so we become immediately part of the work of art.

84
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:28,316
-Look at the way that the broken pediment, this sort of proscenium,

85
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:31,019
this stagelike space, literally seems to open up

86
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,885
as if the marble is moving to reveal this sort of intimate image,

87
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:38,879
and to give us a sense of the specialness of our vantage point.

88
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,603
But the figures on the upper left and the upper right are very curious.

89
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:46,702
They are like us, in that they are seeing this sacred event,

90
00:05:46,702 --> 00:05:51,488
but they're not like us, because they are the patron and the family of the patrons.

91
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:56,417
This is the Cornaro Chapel, and Federico Cornaro was a cardinal in Venice,

92
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:59,299
but had important ties to Rome.

93
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:04,133
-So we have Teresa and the angel on a cloud appearing to float in the air

94
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:09,888
with rays of gold that seem to be mysteriously illuminated from above.

95
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:13,957
-Well, we're in the church, looking at the chapel in the late afternoon in the summer;

96
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,652
and light does seem to be miraculously pouring down on these figures from above.

97
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:22,451
And if we look way up, we can see that there's a fresco on the ceiling of the chapel

98
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:27,114
that shows the Holy Spirit, a white dove, and light is emanating from that;

99
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:30,797
and it almost seems as if the light that's pouring down on these two figures

100
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:32,936
is coming from the Holy Spirit.

101
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:37,342
But Bernini, remember, is a dramatist. And, remember, is a stagecraftsman.

102
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:40,121
And he is using all of his tricks to make this happen.

103
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:45,491
-And so, the trick in this case is that there's a window hidden behind that broken pediment

104
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:49,917
that shines light through and then down onto the sculptures.

105
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:55,402
So Bernini's doing everything he can to make us walk up to this chapel and go, [gasp!]

106
00:06:55,402 --> 00:07:00,138
and feel this moment, this spiritual vision, in our bodies.

107
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:03,901
You often think about how Baroque art appeals to our senses

108
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:08,532
in a way that's so different from the High Renaissance and its appeal to the rational mind.

109
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:12,756
This is not at all about the rational. This is about change; it's about metamorphosis;

110
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:17,075
it's about spiritual awakening. And it is incredibly powerful emotionally.

111
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:21,916
-It's about that union of our world with the spiritual.

112
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,916
