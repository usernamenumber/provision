1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,730
We're told to solve and graph
the solution for the system of

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,050
equations right here.

4
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,180
And the first thing that jumps
out at me, is that we might be

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,930
able to eliminate one
of the variables.

6
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,510
And if we just focus on the x,
we have a 4x here and we have

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,530
a 2x right here.

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,330
If we were to just add them
right now, we would get a 6x.

9
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,740
So that wouldn't eliminate it.

10
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,780
But if we can multiply this 2x
by negative 2, it'll become a

11
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,400
negative 4x, and then when you
add it, they would cancel out.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,050
So let's multiply this
equation, this second

13
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,510
equation, by negative 2.

14
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,830
So I'm going to multiply both
sides of this equation by

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,710
negative 2.

16
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,350
And the whole motivation is
so that this 2x becomes a

17
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,280
negative 4x.

18
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,790
And, of course, I can't just
multiply only the 2x.

19
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,010
Anything I do to the left-hand
side of the equation I have to

20
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,740
do to every term, and
I have to do to both

21
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,100
sides of the equation.

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,760
So the second equation becomes
negative 4x-- that's negative

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,520
2 times 2x-- plus-- we have
negative 2 times negative y--

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,430
which is plus 2y is equal to 2.5
times negative 2, is equal

25
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,630
to negative 5.

26
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,880
I just rewrote the second
equation, multiplying both

27
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,500
sides by negative 2.

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,160
Now, this top equation-- I'll
write it on the bottom now--

29
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,260
we have 4x minus 2y is
equal to positive 5.

30
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,450
And now we can eliminate it.

31
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,530
We can say, hey, look, the
negative 4x and the positive

32
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,900
4x should cancel out, or
they will cancel out.

33
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,780
So let's add these
two equations.

34
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,940
Let's add the left side to the
left side, the right side to

35
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,160
the right side, and we can
do that because these

36
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,100
two things are equal.

37
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,060
We're doing the same thing to
both sides of the equation.

38
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,450
So what do we get?

39
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,340
If we take our negative 4x
plus our 4x, well, those

40
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,550
cancel out.

41
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,810
So you're left with nothing.

42
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,770
Maybe I could write a 0 there.

43
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,410
0x if you want.

44
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,160
And then you have your plus
2y and your negative 2y.

45
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,370
Those also cancel out.

46
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,530
So you're also left with 0y.

47
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,460
And then that equals negative
5 plus 5 is equal to 0.

48
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,360
So this just simplifies to 0
equals 0, which is true, but

49
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,570
it's kind of bizarre.

50
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,940
We had all these x's and y's.

51
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,690
Everything canceled out.

52
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,180
So let's explore this
a little bit more.

53
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,950
Let's graph it and see what this
0 equals 0 is telling us

54
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,710
when we try to solve this
system of equations.

55
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,150
So let me graph this top guy.

56
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,920
I'll do it in blue.

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,870
So right now it's in
standard form.

58
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,280
Let's put it in slope-intercept
form.

59
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,130
So we have 4x minus
2y is equal to 5.

60
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's subtract 4x
from both sides.

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,790
I want the x terms on
the right-hand side.

62
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,950
So then I'm left with negative
2y is equal to

63
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,990
negative 4x plus 5.

64
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,140
Now we can divide both
sides by negative 2.

65
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,280
   

66
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,170
And we are left with y is equal
to positive 2x, right,

67
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,350
that's positive 2x, minus 2.5.

68
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,590
   

69
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,950
So let's graph that.

70
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,540
The y-intercept is
negative 2.5.

71
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,330
So negative 2.5 right there, and
then it has a slope of 2.

72
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,380
So if we move up 1, if we move
up in the x-direction, if we

73
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,080
move to the right 1 in the
positive x-direction, we

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,300
will move up 2.

75
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,340
So 1, 2.

76
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,370
Right there.

77
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,920
And if we were to do it again,
we move up 1, 2.

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,630
Just like that.

79
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,590
So the line's going to look
something like this.

80
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,920
I'll try my best to draw
a straight line.

81
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,170
This is the hardest part
about a lot of these

82
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,720
problems. There you go.

83
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,900
So that's the top equation.

84
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,370
Now, let me draw the
bottom equation.

85
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,680
Let me draw and I'll do it
in this green color.

86
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,980
So this bottom equation was 2x
minus y is equal to 2.5.

87
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,240
And we can subtract 2x
from both sides.

88
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,540
   

89
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,110
The left-hand side becomes
negative y is equal to 2x

90
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,270
plus-- or is equal to negative
2x plus 2.5.

91
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,460
Now let's multiply or divide
both sides by negative 1.

92
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:04,090
And you get y is equal to
positive 2x minus 2.5.

93
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,080
And let's try to graph this, and
you already might notice

94
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,380
something interesting about
these two equations.

95
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,480
You try to graph this, the
y-intercept is at negative

96
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,120
2.5, right there.

97
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,550
The slope is 2.

98
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,400
So it's going to be this
exact same line.

99
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,190
   

100
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,320
And you saw that
algebraically.

101
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,670
I didn't have to graph it.

102
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,370
These two lines have the exact
same equation when you put

103
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,460
them in slope-intercept form.

104
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,160
That's the first equation.

105
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,850
That's the second equation.

106
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,460
So what this 0 equals 0 is
telling us is actually that

107
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,815
these are the same line.

108
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:38,680
That these actually have an
infinite number of solutions.

109
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,310
Any point on this line, which
is both of those lines, will

110
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,550
satisfy both of these
equations.

111
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,290
You give me an arbitrary y,
solve for x in the top

112
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,930
equation, that x
and y will also

113
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,720
satisfy the bottom equation.

114
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,970
So this actually has an infinite
number of solutions.

115
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,490
These are the same line.

116
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,133
