1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,770
Let's say we have the same path
that we had in the last video.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,710
Draw my y-axis,
that is my x-axis.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,630
Let's say the path looks
like this, it looks

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,570
something like this.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,080
It's the same one we
had in the last video.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,270
Might not look exactly like
it, let me see what I

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,430
did in the last video.

9
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,330
It looked like that in the
last video, but close enough.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,270
Let's say we're dealing
with the exact same

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,450
curve as the last video.

12
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,840
We could call that curve c.

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,850
Now last video, we dealt with
a vector field that only had

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,240
vectors in the i direction.

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,590
Let's build with another vector
field that only has vectors in

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,680
j direction, or the
vertical direction.

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,810
So let's say that q, the vector
field q of xy, say it's equal

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:54,430
to capital Q of xy times j, and
we are going to concern

19
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,120
ourselves we're going to
concern ourselves with though

20
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:09,310
closed line integral around the
path c of q dot dr. And

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,760
we've seen it already.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:20,240
dr can be rewritten as dx
times i, plus dy times j.

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,940
So if we were to take the dot
product of these two, this

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,300
line integral is going to
be the exact same thing.

25
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,830
This is going to be the same
thing as the closed line

26
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,090
integral over c of q dot dr.
Well, Q only has a j-component.

27
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:34,830
So if you take [? its ?]

28
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,780
0i, so 0 times dxs is 0,
and then you're going

29
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,190
to have Q xy times dy.

30
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,810
They had no i-component, so
this is just going to be Q,

31
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:51,780
I'll switch to that same color
again, Q of x and y times dy.

32
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,900
That's the dot product.

33
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,960
There was no i-component,
that's why we lose the dx.

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,030
Now let's see if there's any
way that we can solve this line

35
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,710
integral without having to
resort to a third parameter, t.

36
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,780
Just like we did in
the last video.

37
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,875
Actually, it will be almost
identical, we're just dealing

38
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,080
with y's now instead of x's.

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,920
So what we can do is, we
could say, well, what's our

40
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,070
minimum y and our maximum y?

41
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,120
So our minimum y, let's
say it's right here.

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
The minimum y,
let's call that a.

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,906
Let's say our maximum y that we
attain is right over there.

44
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:24,880
Let's call that b.

45
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,960
Oh, and just like in the last,
I forgot to tell you the

46
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,250
direction of the curve.

47
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,270
But this is the same path as
last time, so we're going in a

48
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,070
counterclockwise direction.

49
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,500
The exact same curve,
exact same path.

50
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,180
So we're going in
that direction.

51
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,160
Now in the last video, we broke
it up into two functions of

52
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,600
x's, two y's as a
function of x.

53
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,920
Now we want to deal with y's.

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,530
Let's break it up into
two functions of y.

55
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:54,560
So if we break this path into
two paths, those are kind of

56
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,720
our extreme points, let's call
this past right here, let's

57
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:06,110
call that path right there,
let's call that y, let's call

58
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,930
that x of-- so here, along this
path, x is equal to-- or I

59
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,350
could just write path
2, or a call it c2.

60
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,956
We could say it's,

61
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:22,210
x is equal to x2 of y.

62
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,550
That's that path.

63
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,250
And then the first path, or
it doesn't have to be the

64
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,740
first path, depending
where you start.

65
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,670
You can start anywhere.

66
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,410
Let's say this one in magenta.

67
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,050
We'll call that path 1, and we
could say, that that's defined

68
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,480
as x is equal to x1 of y.

69
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,395
It's a little confusing when
you have x as a function of y,

70
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,290
but it's really completely
analogous to what we

71
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,470
did in the last video.

72
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,630
We're literally just
swapping x's and y.

73
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,140
We're now expressing x as
a function of y, instead

74
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,870
of y as a function of x.

75
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,560
So we have these two curves.

76
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,680
You can imagine just flipping
it, and we're doing the exact

77
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,460
same thing that we did in
the last videos, just

78
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,820
now in terms of y.

79
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,610
But if you look at it this way,
this line integral can be

80
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:07,590
rewritten as being equal to
the integral, let's

81
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,650
just do c2 first.

82
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,380
This is the integral
from b to a.

83
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,860
We start at b, and we go to a.

84
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,290
This is, we're coming back
from a high y to a low y.

85
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:30,240
The integral from b to a of
Q of-- in that gray color.

86
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,430
Q of, instead of having an x
there, we know along this curve

87
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,650
right here, x is equal to, we
want everything in terms of y.

88
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,210
So here, x is equal to x2 of y.

89
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:47,800
So Q of x2 of y, x2 of y comma
y, maybe I'm using too many

90
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,680
colors here, but I think
you get the idea.

91
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,045
dy.

92
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:54,320
   

93
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,580
So this is the part of the
line integral, just over

94
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,800
this left hand curve.

95
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,940
And then we're going to add to
that the line integral, or

96
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,980
really just a regular integral
now, from y is equal to a to y

97
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:18,325
is equal to b of Q of, instead
of x being equal to x2, now x

98
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:21,170
is equal to x1 of y, it's equal
to this curve, this

99
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,780
other function.

100
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:33,060
So x1 of y, x1 of y comma y,
dy, and we can do exactly what

101
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,900
we did in the previous video.

102
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,370
Instead of, we don't like the
larger number on the bottom, so

103
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,760
let's swap these two around.

104
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,870
So if you swap these two, if
you make this into an a, and

105
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,800
this into a b, that makes it
the negative of the integral,

106
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,200
when you swap the two,
change the direction.

107
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,150
This is exactly what we did in
the last video, so hopefully

108
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,000
it's nothing too fancy.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,490
But now that we have the same
boundaries of integration,

110
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,690
these two definite integrals,
we can just write them as

111
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,280
one definite integral.

112
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,470
So this is going to be equal
to the integral from a to b.

113
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,450
And I'll write this one
first, since it's positive.

114
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,370
Of, I'll write in this one.

115
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:18,500
Q of x1 of y comma
y, minus this one.

116
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:18,730
Right?

117
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,710
We have the minus sign here.

118
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:28,590
Minus q of x2 of y and y dy.

119
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,540
Let me do that in
that neutral color.

120
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,590
dy, that's multiplied by
all of these things.

121
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,060
I distributed out the dy,
I think you get the idea.

122
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,930
This is identical to what
we did in the last video.

123
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,810
And this could be rewritten as,
this is equal to the integral

124
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,120
from a to b of, and inside of
the integral, we're evaluating

125
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:57,490
the function of Q of xy from
the boundaries, the upper

126
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,880
boundary, where, the upper
boundary is going to be from x

127
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,696
is equal to x1 of y, and
the lower boundary is

128
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:11,560
x is equal to x2 of y.

129
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:11,970
Right?

130
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,950
All the x's we substituted with
that, and then we get some

131
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,490
expression, and then from that,
we subtract this with x

132
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,650
substituted as x2 of y.

133
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,110
That's exactly what we did, and
just like I said in last video,

134
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,160
we're going kind of the reverse
direction that we normally

135
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,990
go in definite integrals.

136
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,640
We normally get to this,
and then the next

137
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,580
step is, we get this.

138
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,210
But now we're going in the
reverse direction, but it's

139
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,420
all the same difference.

140
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,860
And all of that times dy.

141
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,540
   

142
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,740
And just like we saw in the
last video, this, let me do it

143
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,870
in orange, this expression
right here, actually let me

144
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,590
draw that dy a little
further out so it doesn't

145
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,460
get all congested.

146
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,830
Let me do the dy out here.

147
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:56,100
This expression, this entire
expression, is the same exact

148
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:07,410
thing as the integral from x is
equal to, I can just write it

149
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,280
here, let me write it
in the same colors.

150
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:27,450
x2 of y to x1 of y to x1
of y the partial of Q

151
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,760
with respect to x dx.

152
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,220
   

153
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,020
I want to make it very clear.

154
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,620
This is, at least in my
mind, the first part,

155
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,680
a little confusing.

156
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,620
But if you just saw an integral
like this, this is the

157
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,680
inside of a double integral.

158
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,390
And it is.

159
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,250
The outside is what we
saw there, the integral

160
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,380
from a to b, dy.

161
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,280
But if you just saw this in a
double integral, what you would

162
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,620
do is you would take the
antiderivative of this, the

163
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,640
antiderivative of this
with respect to x, the

164
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,430
antiderivative of the partial
of Q with respect to x with

165
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,510
respect to x, is going
to be just Q of xy.

166
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,120
And since it's a definite
integral, you would evaluate it

167
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,850
at x1 of y, and then subtract
from that, this function

168
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,370
evaluated x2 of y, which
is exactly what we did.

169
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,220
So hopefully you
appreciate that.

170
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,520
And then we got our result,
which is very similar

171
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,410
to the last result.

172
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,220
What does this double
integral represent?

173
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,390
It represents, well, anything,
if you have any double integral

174
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,970
that goes from-- if you
imagine, this is some function,

175
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,640
let me draw it in
three dimensions.

176
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,430
This is really almost a
review of what we did

177
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,360
in the last video.

178
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,240
If that's the y-axis, that's
our x-axis, that's our z-axis.

179
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,720
This is some function of x
and y, so some surface you

180
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,595
can imagine on xy plane.

181
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:50,750
It's some surface.

182
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:56,160
So we could call that the
partial of q with respect to x.

183
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,260
And what this double integral
is, this is essentially

184
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,490
defining a region, and you can
kind of view this dx times

185
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,550
dy as kind of a small
differential of area.

186
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,690
So the region under question,
the boundary points, are from y

187
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,460
going from, y goes from, at the
bottom, it goes from x2 of y,

188
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,130
which we saw was a curve that
looks something like this.

189
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,620
That's the lower y, and over
here, if we draw it in two

190
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,600
dimensions, this was
the lower y-curve.

191
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,730
The upper y-curve is x1 of y,
so the upper y-curve looks

192
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,210
something like that.

193
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,570
The upper y-curve goes
something like that.

194
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,510
So x varies from the lower
y-curve to the upper

195
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,650
y-curve, right?

196
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,540
That's what we're
doing right here.

197
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,180
And then y varies from a to b.

198
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,340
And so this is essentially
saying, let's take the double

199
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:51,020
integral over this region
right here of this function.

200
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,950
So it's essentially the volume,
if this is the ceiling,

201
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,300
and this boundary is
essentially the wall.

202
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,680
It's the volume of that room.

203
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,750
And I don't know what it
would look like when

204
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,140
it comes up here.

205
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,840
But you can kind of imagine
something like that.

206
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,990
It would be the volume of that.

207
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,690
So that's what we're taking.

208
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,490
This is the identical result
we got in the last video.

209
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,060
And this is a
pretty neat thing.

210
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,600
So all of a sudden, this
vector, that-- and Q of xy, I

211
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,060
didn't draw it out like I did
the last time, Q of xy

212
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,630
only has [? things ?]

213
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,475
in the j-direction, so it only
has, if I were to draw its

214
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:21,920
vector field, the vectors
only go up and down.

215
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,960
   

216
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,650
They have no horizontal
component to them.

217
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,270
But we saw, when you start with
a vector field like this, you

218
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,810
take the line integral around
this closed loop, and I'll

219
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,000
rewrite it right here, you take
this line integral around this

220
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,200
closed loop of q dot dr, which
is equal to the integral around

221
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,560
the closed loop of Q of xy dy.

222
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,240
We just figured out that that's
equivalent to the double

223
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,490
integral over the region.

224
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,660
This is the region.

225
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:00,920
Right?

226
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,380
That's exactly what
we're doing over here.

227
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,950
If I just gave you the region,
you'd have to define it, you'd

228
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,116
say, well, x is going from,
this is going from this

229
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:09,780
function to that function, and
y is going from a to b, and you

230
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,310
might want to review the double
integral videos, if

231
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:11,970
that confuses you.

232
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,270
So we're taking the double
integral over the region of the

233
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,370
partial of Q with respect to x,
d-- well, you could write dx

234
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,490
dy, or you can even right
a little da, right?

235
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,110
The differential of area,
right, that we can imagine

236
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,670
as a da, which is the
same thing as a dx dy.

237
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,390
And if we combine that with the
last video, and this is kind of

238
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,030
the neat bringing it all
together part, the result of

239
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,760
the last video was this.

240
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,940
That if I had a function that's
defined completely in terms of

241
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,270
x, we had this, right here.

242
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,090
We had that result.

243
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,280
Actually, let me copy and paste
both of these to a nice clean

244
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,100
part of my whiteboard,
and then we can do the

245
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,030
exciting conclusion.

246
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,170
Let me copy and paste that.

247
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,300
So that's what we got
in the last video.

248
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,200
And this video, we
got this result.

249
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,080
I'll just copy and paste
that part right there.

250
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,140
You might already predict
where this is going.

251
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,490
And then let me
paste it over here.

252
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,240
This is the result
from this video.

253
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,390
Now let's think about an
arbitrary vector field but is

254
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:27,160
defined as, I'll do that in
pink, let's say F is a vector

255
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,780
field defined over the xy
plane, and F is equal to P

256
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:39,920
of xy i plus Q of xy j.

257
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,520
You can almost imagine F being
the addition of our vector

258
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,040
fields, P and Q, that we did
in the last two videos.

259
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,550
Q was this video, and we did
P in the video before that.

260
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,570
But this is really any
arbitrary vector field.

261
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,710
And let's say we want to take
the vector field, or sorry, the

262
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,680
line integral of this vector
field, along some path.

263
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,730
It could be the same one
we've done, which has been

264
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,870
a very arbitrary one.

265
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,440
It's really any arbitrary path.

266
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,620
So let me draw some
arbitrary path over here.

267
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,010
Let's say, that is my arbitrary
path, my arbitrary curve.

268
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,610
Let's say it goes in that
counterclockwise direction,

269
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,530
just like that.

270
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,830
And I'm interested in what the
line integral, the closed line

271
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,570
integral, around that
path of F dot dr is.

272
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,810
And we've seen it
multiple times.

273
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:36,700
dr is equal to dx i
plus dy times j.

274
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,740
So this line integral can be
rewritten as, this is equal

275
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,390
to the line integral
around the path c.

276
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,990
F dot dr, that's going to be
this term times dx, so that's

277
00:14:48,990 --> 00:15:00,090
p of xy times dx plus this
term, Q of xy times dy.

278
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:04,250
And this whole thing,
essentially this is the same

279
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:11,470
thing as the line integral of
p of xy dx, plus the line

280
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,660
integral of Q of xy dy.

281
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,750
Now what are these things?

282
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,180
This is what we figured out in
the first video, this is what

283
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,160
we figured out just
now in this video.

284
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,190
This thing right here is
the exact same thing

285
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,510
as that over there.

286
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:35,270
So this is going to be equal to
the double integral over this

287
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:41,310
region right here, of the minus
partial of P with respect to y.

288
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,710
   

289
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,550
Instead of a dy dx, we
could say just over the

290
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,750
differential of area.

291
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,870
And then plus this
one, this result.

292
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,120
Q.

293
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,930
This thing right here is
exactly what we just proved,

294
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,480
is exactly what we just
showed in this video.

295
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,380
So that's plus, I'll leave it
up there, maybe I'll do it in

296
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,760
the yellow, plus the double
integral over the same region

297
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,220
of the partial of Q
with respect to x.

298
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,090
da, where that's just dy
dx, or dx dy, you can

299
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:15,950
switch the order, it's

300
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,010
the differential of area.

301
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,130
And now, we can add
these two integrals.

302
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,070
What do we get?

303
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,220
So this is equal to, and
this is kind of our

304
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,680
big, grand conclusion.

305
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,130
Maybe magenta is
called for here.

306
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,720
The double integral over the
region of, I'll write this one

307
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,230
first because it's positive,
that one's negative, of the

308
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:42,390
partial of Q with respect to x,
minus the partial of p with

309
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:48,360
respect to y, d, the
differential of area.

310
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,960
This is our big takeaway.

311
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,670
This is our big takeaway.

312
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,700
Let me write it here.

313
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,620
The line integral of the closed
loop of F dot dr is equal to

314
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,420
the double integral
of this expression.

315
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,720
And it's something,
just remember.

316
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,545
We're taking the function that
was associated with the

317
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:09,540
x-component, or the
i-component, we're taking the

318
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,880
partial with respect to y.

319
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,610
And the function that was
associated with the

320
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,530
y-component, we're taking the
partial with respect to x.

321
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,580
And that first one, we're
taking the negative of.

322
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,910
That's a good way
to remember it.

323
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,140
But this result right here,
this is, maybe I should

324
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:30,730
write it in green, this
is Green's Theorem.

325
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,850
   

326
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,080
And it's a neat way to relate a
line integral of a vector field

327
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,770
that has these partial
derivatives, assuming it has

328
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,460
these partial derivatives, to
the region, to a double

329
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,330
integral of the region.

330
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,680
Now, and this is a little bit
of a side note, we've seen in

331
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:56,980
several videos before, we've
learned that if F is

332
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,780
conservative, which means it's
the gradient of some function,

333
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,280
that it's path-independent,
that the closed integral around

334
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,550
any path is equal to 0.

335
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,980
And that's still true.

336
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,720
So that tells us that if F is
conservative, this thing right

337
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,560
here must be equal to 0.

338
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,070
That's the only way that you're
always going to enforce that

339
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,350
this whole integral is going to
be equal, is going to be equal

340
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,970
to 0 over any, any, any region.

341
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,270
I'm sure you could think
of situations where they

342
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,880
cancel each other out, but
really over any region.

343
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,700
That's the only way that
this is going to be true.

344
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,880
That these two things are
going to be equal to 0.

345
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,220
So then you could say, partial
of Q with respect to x, minus

346
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,370
the partial of P with respect
to y, has to be equal to 0, or

347
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,970
these two things have
to equal each other.

348
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,300
Or.

349
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,370
This is kind of a corollary
to Green's Theorem.

350
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,900
Kind of a low-hanging fruit
you could have figured out.

351
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,010
The partial of Q with respect
to x is equal to the partial

352
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,920
of P with respect to y.

353
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,070
And when you study exact
equations in differential

354
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,460
equations, you'll
see this a lot more.

355
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,140
And actually, well, I won't go
into too much, but conservative

356
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,330
fields, you're actually, the
differential form of what you

357
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,500
see in the line integrals, if
it's conservative, it would

358
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,450
be an exact equation.

359
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,610
But we're not going to
go into that too much.

360
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,330
But hopefully you might see the
parallels if you've already run

361
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,790
into exact equations in
differential equations.

362
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,980
But this is the big takeaway,
and let's maybe do some

363
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,780
examples using this takeaway
in the next video.

364
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,000
