1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,545
We touched on this in the video
on resonance, but I want

3
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,666
to devote an entire video
to aromatic compounds.

4
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:13,180
   

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,440
And one of the big mysteries in
chemistry is why they were

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,170
named aromatic compounds.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,820
Because you know it clearly
comes from the word aroma.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,370
So one would think maybe all of
these compounds smell good,

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,150
or smell bad, or don't
smell at all.

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,060
But actually it turns out
that a lot of them don't

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,130
even smell at all.

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,260
So it's a little bit
of a mystery.

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,800
Some people think that they
have some relation, the

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,590
gentleman who named them, saw
that they had some chemical

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,210
relation to things that did
smell, so that he named them

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,250
aromatic compounds.

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,210
So it is a bit of a mystery.

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,520
In general, the most common
aromatic compound-- and really

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,210
this is like 99% of the time
what you're going to see in

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,150
chemistry class as an aromatic
compound-- is either benzene

21
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,580
or a molecule derived
from benzene.

22
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,720
Let me draw benzene
right here.

23
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,510
So benzene is normally
drawn like this.

24
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,640
So it's a six carbon ring.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,710
And it has three double bonds.

26
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,490
It has three double
bonds like that.

27
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,170
And we learned in the resonance
video, that this

28
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,170
isn't actually the only
configuration for benzene.

29
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,130
It could just as likely be
in this configuration.

30
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,300
That this electron up here, this
electron up here, might

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,940
move there.

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,680
This electron might
move over there.

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,190
And then this electron might
move over there.

34
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,670
Let me clear that up, so you
don't make it too confusing.

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,140
So it could just as likely
be in this configuration.

36
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,490
It could just as likely be in
this configuration right here,

37
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,690
where the double bonds are on
the other bonds that aren't

38
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,170
double bonded over here.

39
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,260
So it could just as easily
be over there.

40
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,470
And we learned in the resonance
video that the

41
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,040
reality is that it's actually
in between.

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,600
And sometimes it's
drawn like this.

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,240
It's going back and forth
between these configurations.

44
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,620
But the reality-- and
you'll sometimes see

45
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,850
it drawn like this.

46
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,930
You'll sometimes see it drawn
like this, with just a circle

47
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,450
in between, in the middle of the
hexane ring, I guess you

48
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,020
could say, or the
benzene ring.

49
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,350
Which is showing that the
electrons, those pi electrons,

50
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,880
those electrons that form the
double bond are actually just,

51
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,300
they're going back and
forth between this.

52
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,630
They're just spreading around
the entire ring.

53
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,350
And what makes aromatic
compounds interesting is

54
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,340
because these pi electrons can
spread around the entire ring,

55
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,750
it's actually a much more stable
configuration, or a

56
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,460
much more stable molecule, than
what you would predict if

57
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,800
you just looked at one of these
two configurations.

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,670
Another way that it's
often drawn looks

59
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,600
something like this.

60
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,490
And I'm just doing it in yellow,
just to have something

61
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,640
in a different color.

62
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,830
Sometimes you'll just see
this, that you know, is

63
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,160
someplace in between
that and that.

64
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,050
So you'll have a dotted line
there, dotted line, dotted

65
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,210
line, dotted line, dotted
line, dotted line.

66
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,740
This is the most common kind of
short hand for showing both

67
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,770
benzene and for showing that
it's experiencing this

68
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,860
resonance, that you have
this conjugated

69
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,540
system of pi electrons.

70
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,540
And I'll help you visualize
that in a second.

71
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,990
But you also might see
something like this.

72
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,640
It can go back and forth, and
everything in between, between

73
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,220
these two configurations.

74
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,330
Now just to visualize
what's going on.

75
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,970
Because you'll sometimes hear
people talk about conjugated

76
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,470
system of pi electrons.

77
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,080
I want to actually think about,
help a little bit more

78
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,010
visualizing what the molecule
might look like in three

79
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,260
dimensions.

80
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,980
   

81
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,410
So that is the six carbon
ring right there.

82
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,500
So it's carbon, carbon, carbon,

83
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,760
carbon, carbon, carbon.

84
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,780
And then each of these carbons
is bonded to three other

85
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,850
atoms. It's bonded
to 1, 2 carbons.

86
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,710
And it's also bonded
to a hydrogen.

87
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,220
So let me draw the
hydrogens here.

88
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,750
They're also bonded
to hydrogen.

89
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,940
So this one will have a
hydrogen over here.

90
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,850
This will have a hydrogen
over here.

91
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,910
That will have a hydrogen
over there.

92
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,000
That one has a hydrogen
over there.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,110
Hydrogen and hydrogen
right over there.

94
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,990
So if we talk about
hybridization, we have three

95
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,630
hybridized orbitals.

96
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,910
This is sp2 hybridization.

97
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,709
And each of these have a
leftover pi orbital that has

98
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,709
not been hybridized.

99
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,070
It's not directly bound to, or
that does not have a sigma

100
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,720
bond to another atom.

101
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,270
So you have these pi orbitals.

102
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,070
You know, these pi orbitals
look like these dumbbells.

103
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,280
So you have a pi orbital
over here.

104
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,600
You have a pi orbital here.

105
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,750
Pi orbital over here.

106
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,570
Pi orbital over there.

107
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,950
You have another pi orbital
over there.

108
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,000
Pi orbital and pi orbital.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,850
And you know, pi orbital, I drew
them like this, because

110
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,030
if I drew them bigger
than that, the

111
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,430
diagram would get messy.

112
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,830
But in general, whenever you
have double bonds, like this

113
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,360
double bond.

114
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,070
Let's say that this carbon--
let me change colors, so we

115
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,000
know what we're focused on.

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,450
So let's say this sigma bond
right over there, let's say

117
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,110
that sigma bond right over
there, is this sigma bond.

118
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,360
Actually let me do another
one, just so

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,810
it's easier to see.

120
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's say that this sigma bond
right over here is this sigma

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,790
bond, between these
two carbons.

122
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,290
This double bond, the double
bond in blue, this one, or in

123
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,020
purple right over there,
that's due to these

124
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,180
overlapping pi orbitals.

125
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,750
That carbon's pi orbitals and
that carbon's pi orbitals

126
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,470
overlapping.

127
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,580
I haven't drawn them
overlapping, but-- well,

128
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,980
actually an electron
can really show up.

129
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,310
It's all probabilistic anyway.

130
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,390
But I could draw them big
enough, they would overlap,

131
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,640
and these electrons would
form that extra pi bond.

132
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,090
What happens in a conjugated
system of pi electrons.

133
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,940
Let me write that down.

134
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,770
It's just a very fancy word.

135
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:54,598
Conjugated system
of pi electrons.

136
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:59,490
   

137
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,350
These guys, at we see,
they could be

138
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,710
bonded with each other.

139
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,910
These guys could overlap.

140
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,720
So there could be an overlap
going on over here.

141
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,120
Or we could flip into this
configuration, where this guy

142
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,280
would overlap with this
guy over here.

143
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,610
And the reality is that these pi
electrons will actually be

144
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,300
able to float around the ring.

145
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,210
They'd actually be able to float
around all of these pi

146
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,270
orbitals right over there.

147
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,980
They'd actually be able to
float around the ring.

148
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,300
So that's what people are really
talking about when they

149
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,480
talk about aromatic compounds,
or aromaticity.

150
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,070
That because of this, this is
a more stable compound.

151
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,920
The most typical one that you're
going to see is a six

152
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,470
carbon chain with three double
bonds, benzene, or things

153
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,670
derived from them.

154
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,490
But there actually are
more general ones.

155
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,080
In general, you're going to see
anything that has 4n plus

156
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:57,120
2 pi electrons in a cycle is
going to have aromaticity.

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,190
Or is going to be an
aromatic compound.

158
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,190
Let's just confirm this
actually makes it.

159
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,140
Each of these guys over here
have one pi electron, even

160
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,880
though this looks
like two bonds.

161
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,750
Remember, this is one pi orbital
right over here.

162
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,410
And you have one electron that's
going to be in this

163
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,430
entire pi orbital.

164
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,350
So this has one pi electron,
two, three, four, five, six.

165
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,940
Another way to think about it,
each of these double bonds

166
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,620
involves two pi electrons.

167
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,190
So one, two, three,
four, five, six.

168
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,450
So that follows what is
called Huckel's rule.

169
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:41,110
   

170
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,070
I think there's two
dots above the u.

171
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,880
Huckel's rule, maybe.

172
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,600
That follows Huckel's rule.

173
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,750
Because if you said n is
equal to 1, 4 times 1

174
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,390
is 4 plus 2 is 6.

175
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,210
So 6 pi electrons work.

176
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,190
If n was 2, you'd have 4 times
2 plus 2, which is 10.

177
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,650
So if you had 10 pi electrons,
it would also work.

178
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,660
So a molecule that looks
like this-- let me see

179
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,310
if I can draw it.

180
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,920
A molecule that looks like
this would also work.

181
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:13,750
So if you have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

182
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,640
eight, nine, ten, ten carbons.

183
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,275
And then you had five
double bonds.

184
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:27,760
So, one, two, three,
four, five.

185
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,350
Just like that.

186
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,290
You could imagine, these
guys could flip around.

187
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,840
But this would also be
an aromatic compound.

188
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,770
This has 10 pi electrons.

189
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,870
Each of the carbons have
a pi electron.

190
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,730
Or you could count the
pi electrons on each

191
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,909
end of these pi bonds.

192
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:47,800
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

193
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,980
Now this is one thing that
I always wonder.

194
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,470
It's like OK, it worked
with six.

195
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,030
It worked with 10.

196
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,750
But what about eight?

197
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,760
It seems like with eight, maybe
these electrons, these

198
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,210
double bonds, could flip
around just as easily.

199
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,540
So what if I had, what if
I had-- or even four.

200
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,860
What if I had a molecule
that looked like this?

201
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,410
What if I had a molecule
that looked like this?

202
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,770
Or a molecule that looked like
a stop sign-- so one, two,

203
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:14,280
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight-- that had double bonds

204
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,270
that alternated like this.

205
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,230
You might say, hey,
maybe those also

206
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,300
are aromatic compounds.

207
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,500
Those also experience
aromaticity.

208
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,010
Because couldn't this guy jump
around here, then that guy

209
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,420
over there, and the electrons
cycle around.

210
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,200
Or this guy jump over, these
electrons move there.

211
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,010
Those move there.

212
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,830
Those move there.

213
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,210
And those move there.

214
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:39,290
And it turns out that in these
compounds, the electrons do

215
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,780
not, the pi electrons do not
stabilize the system.

216
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,860
But this is actually less
stable than if it

217
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,360
was not in a cycle.

218
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,210
So actually this is-- these
right here, that don't follow

219
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,310
the 4n plus 2.

220
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,360
So 4n plus 2, you're talking
about 6, 10, 14 pi electrons.

221
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,270
Which usually means
14 carbons, or 10

222
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,290
carbons, or six carbons.

223
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,090
The ones that don't follow them
but are still cyclical,

224
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,150
and still have these alternating
bonds, these are

225
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,400
called anti-aromatic.

226
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,380
   

227
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,630
And are actually
very unstable.

228
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,240
These are very, very unstable
and are more likely to break

229
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,690
into a non-cycle.

230
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,490
Anyway, hopefully you found
that vaguely useful.

231
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:23,667
