99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Electronegativitiy is probably the most important concept to understand in organic chemistry

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are gonna use the definition of Linus Pauling in his book about the nature of a chemical bond

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So Linus Pauling says that electronegativity refers to

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the power of an atom in a molecule to attract the electons to itself

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, if I am looking at the molecule and going to compare it to two atoms in that molcule

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and going to compare carbon with oxygen in terms of the electronegativity

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and to do that I need to look over here right on the periodic table which shows the elements

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
most commonly used in the organic chemistry

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then in blue, it gives us the Pauling scale for electronegativity

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, Linus Pauling actually calculated the electronegativity values for elements and

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
put them into table and that allows us to comopare different elements in terms of

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
their electronegativities. For example, we are concerned with carbon which has an electrogativity

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
value of 2.5 and compare that to Oxygen which has an electronegativity value of 3.5

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So oxygen is more electronegative than carbon and the definition tell us that

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the oxygen is more electronegative and it has greater power to attract electrons to itself than carbon does

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, think about the covalent bond between carbon and oxygen atoms that is shared

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is shared unequally because oxygen is more electronegative

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Oxygen is going to pull those electrons in red closer to itself

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But since electrons are negatively charged, the oxygen is going to get a little bit more negative charge

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's what we call partial negative charge on it

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that is represented by lower case greek letter delta

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so the oxygen is partially negative, it's pulling the electrons towards itself

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Another way to show the movement of those electrons in red would be this arrow here

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the arrow points in the direction of the movement of the elctrons in red

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, carbon is loosing some of those elctrons in red. Carbon is loosing electron is electron density

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and carbon is losing a little bit of negative charge

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, carbon used to be neutral but since it is loosing a bit of negative charge,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this carbon ends up being partially positive

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The carbon is partially positive and oxygen is partially negative

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a polarized situation, a little bit of negative charge on one side

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and a little bit of positive charge on the other side

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, it's still a covalent bond but it's a polarized covalent bond due to the difference in electronegativity

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Few more examples here will show the difference in electronegativity

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, if I think about the molecule that has two carbons in it

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I am thinking about what happens to electrons in red

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, for this example each carbon has same value for electrongeativity

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, carbon on left has a value of 2.5, the carbon on the right has a value of 2.5

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a difference in electronegativity of zero which means that the electrons in red

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are not going to move towards any carbon, they are going to stay in the middle

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where they can be shared between the two atoms

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, it's a covalent bond but there is no polarity created here since there is no difference in electrongativity

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We call this a non-polar covalent bond like that

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's do another example. Let's compare carbon to hydrogen

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, if I have a molecule and I have a bond between carbon and hydrogen and I want to know

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what happens to the electrons in red

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have seen that carbon has an electronegativity of 2.5 and we go up here to hygrogen

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which has a value of 2.1. So that's a difference of 0.4

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, there is a difference in electronegativity between those atoms but it's a very small one

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we consider the bond between carbon and hydrogen to still be a non-polar covalent bond

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right, let's go ahead and put the example we did above and compare the elctronegativity of carbon and oxygen

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Carbon had an electronegativity value of 2.5 and oxygen had a value of 3.5 for a difference of 1

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's enough to have a polar covalent bond

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Polar covalent bond between carbon and oxygen

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The elctrons in red are pulled close to oxygen giving it a partial negative charge

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and since the electron density is moving awat from carbon, it gets a partial positive charge

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we can see that if there's a difference in electronegativity of 1, it's considered to be

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a polar covalent bond and if difference is 0.4, it's considered to be a non-polar covalent bond

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, somewhere in between them must be the difference between a non-polar and a polar covalent bond

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Most textbooks will tell you approximately somewhere 0.5 range

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if the difference is greater than 0.5, you can go ahead and consider it a polar covalent bond

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it it is less than 0.5, we consider it to be a non polar covalent bond

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, I shouuld point out that we are using Pauling scale of electronegativity here and

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so these numbers are not absolute, it's more the relative differences and

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's relative differences in electronegativity that we care the most about

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's compare oxygen to hydrogen, let's think about what happens to the electrons between oxygen and hydrogen

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We've already seen the electronegativity values for both of these elements,

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
oxygen had a value of 3.5 and hydrogen 2.1, so that's a difference of 1.4

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so that's a polar covalent bond. Since oxygen is more elctronegative that hydrogen,

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the elctrons in red are going to move close to oxygen

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, oxygen is going to get partial negative charge and hygrogen partial positive charge like that

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's do carbon and lithium now

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I draw a bond between carbon and lithium, once again we are concerned with two electrons

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
between carbon and lithium

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the electronegativity value of carbon is 2.5 and we find that of Lithium to be 1
