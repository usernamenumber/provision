1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,210
We're on problem 68.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,130
And they want to know,

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,940
what is the average arithmetic mean of j and k?

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,120
So essentially, if we knew what they were, you could take

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,440
j plus k, and divide by 2, and you'd know their average.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,640
What is statement one?

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,730
Statement one tells us the average of

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,750
j plus 2, and k plus 4, is 11.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,890
So this is interesting.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:41,160
So means that j plus 2, plus k plus 4, over 2--

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,380
I'm just averaging the two numbers--

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,080
they're telling us that that is equal to 11.

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,220
And remember,

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,040
the question they're asking is the average of j and k.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,000
So if we could just figure out what j plus k, over 2

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,430
is equal to, we're done.

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,650
Or, if we just knew what j plus k is, we were done.

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,950
Maybe we could figure that out from this.

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,840
Let's see if we can simplify.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:14,240
This simplifies to j plus k, plus 6, over 2, is equal to 11.

21
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:22,850
This simplifies to j plus k, over 2, plus 3, right?

22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,770
So plus 6 over 2. I'm just taking the 6 over 2 out.

23
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,550
So plus 6 over 2, is equal to 11.

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,550
So then we get j plus k, over 2 is equal to 8.

25
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,160
And we're done.

26
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,950
The average of j and k is 8. We're done.

27
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,450
Statement one alone is sufficient.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,270
Let's see what statement number two does for us.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,460
Statement number two says the average of jk and 14 is 10.

30
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,260
I suspect we're going to be able to do the exact same thing.

31
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,080
So the average of j plus k, plus 14--

32
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,250
so now we're averaging three numbers-- is equal to 10.

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
And here, we should be able to figure out

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,410
what j plus k is again.

35
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,390
We don't have a convenient 2 in the denominator anymore,

36
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,650
so let's just solve for j plus k.

37
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,050
So then you get j plus k, plus 14-- multiply both sides by 3

38
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,950
is equal to 30.

39
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,790
And then you get j plus k is equal to what?

40
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,910
Subtract 14 from both sides, is equal to 16.

41
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,090
And then if you wanted to figure out the average of the two,

42
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,410
you just divide both sides by 2.

43
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,770
And you get j plus k over 2 is equal to 8.

44
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,950
So each statement alone was sufficient to solve this problem.

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,030
Next problem.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,650
I feel a sneeze coming on.

47
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,780
This is not happening.

48
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,770
All right.

49
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,840
Where was I?

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,560
Problem 69.

51
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,070
Let me move the scroll bar up all the way.

52
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,200
Paula and Sandy were among those people

53
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,270
who sold raffle tickets to raise money for club x.

54
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,010
If Paula and Sandy sold a total of 100 of the tickets,

55
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,500
how many of the tickets did Paula sell?

56
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,860
OK, so essentially they're telling us Paula plus Sandy

57
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,150
sold 100 tickets.

58
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,040
And they want us to figure out how many did Paula sell?

59
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,520
Where P is the number Paula sold,

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,990
and S is the number Sandy sold.

61
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,090
Problem number one.

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,740
Sandy sold 2/3 as many of the raffle tickets as Paula did.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,370
So Sandy is equal to 2/3 times Paula.

64
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,330
Well, this alone is sufficient.

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,440
We have one equation of two unknowns,

66
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,760
and now we have another equation of the same two unknowns.

67
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,280
These are both linear equations.

68
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,790
So we have two equations of two unknowns.

69
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,930
We can easily now solve for S and P.

70
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,380
And maybe I'll do it, but you should just already recognize

71
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,420
that this is sufficient if you're on the GMAT.

72
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,380
And we'll solve it, just to do it after this.

73
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,370
Sandy sold 8% of all the raffle tickets sold for club x.

74
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,990
All right. Now, this is a little different.

75
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:14,690
This is Sandy is equal to 8% of not all the tickets that

76
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,920
Sandy and Paula sold,

77
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,950
she sold 8% of the total that club x sold.

78
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,120
So this is a different number, because there could have been

79
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,070
I might have been in club x selling raffle tickets.

80
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,500
So we don't know how many I sold.

81
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,210
So we don't know what this total number is.

82
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,080
So there's not much we can do with it,

83
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,530
because there's no way for us to figure out this total number

84
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,520
So this is not that useful.

85
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,870
So statement one alone is sufficient.

86
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,590
And just to prove the point to you--

87
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,070
we're trying to figure out what Paula sold.

88
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,600
So let's just substitute this back in.

89
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,030
So you have P plus-- for S I'll write 2/3P-- is equal to 100.

90
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:56,200
And so this is 5/3P is equal to 100.

91
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,530
Just added 1 plus 2/3, or 3/3 plus 2/3.

92
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,160
And then you have P is equal to 3/5 times 100,

93
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,030
which is equal to 60.

94
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,350
So that's how many she sold.

95
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,750
So we would definitely be able figure it out,

96
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,960
but this would've been a waste of time

97
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,040
if you were taking the GMAT for real.

98
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,360
You should have just recognized

99
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,710
two linear equations and two unknowns. I'm done.

100
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,450
Next problem, 70.

101
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,330
Is ax equal to 3 minus bx?

102
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,930
Who knows?

103
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,210
statement number one.

104
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,320
Let me scroll down a little bit.

105
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:48,800
Statement number one tells us,x times a,plus b is equal to 3.

106
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,840
Well, that's essentially the same thing as this top equation,

107
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,210
right?

108
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:53,990
Let me show you.

109
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,840
x times a, that's ax, plus bx is equal to 3.

110
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,800
And then subtract bx from both sides.

111
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,290
You get ax is equal to 3 minus bx,

112
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,770
which is exactly what we were trying to prove.

113
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,220
So if this is true, then this is definitely true.

114
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,620
Statement one alone is sufficient.

115
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:24,600
Statement two tells us, a equals b, equals 1.5,

116
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,640
and x is equal to 1.

117
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,960
Well, let's see if this is true.

118
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,410
So a is-- you have 1.5 times 1.

119
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:38,960
So you have 1.5 is equal to 3, minus 1.5 times 1.

120
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,280
So 3 minus 1.5. Well, this is true.

121
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,350
1.5 is equal to 3 minus 1.5, is 1.5.

122
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,850
So two alone is also sufficient.

123
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,410
So the answer is D.

124
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,230
Each statement alone is sufficient to solve this problem.

125
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:55,890
71.

126
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,430
Let me switch colors.

127
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,160
A number of people each wrote down

128
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,630
one of the first 30 positive integers.

129
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,340
Were any of the integers written down

130
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,610
by more than one of the people?

131
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,230
All right. That's interesting.

132
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,520
So are there any repeats?

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,240
A number of people.

134
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,050
So clearly if we had more than 30 people

135
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,930
and they all had to pick one of the first 30 integers,

136
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,300
then you're going to have repeats.

137
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,570
But let's see what they tell us.

138
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,010
The number of people who wrote down an integer was

139
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:30,490
greater than 40.

140
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,130
Well, there you go.

141
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,590
So 40 people each have to pick a number between--

142
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,300
one of the first 30 positive integers, right?

143
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,070
So they only have a pool of 30 to pick from.

144
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,650
So if 40 people have to pick number from a pool of 30 numbers

145
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,930
there's definitely going to be repeats, right?

146
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,410
So even if the first 30 people all picked different numbers,

147
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,350
which we cannot guarantee by any means,

148
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,900
the next 10 are going to have to repeat with somebody.

149
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,180
Because all of the first 30 would've already been picked.

150
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,450
And you could very easily have even more repeats.

151
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,130
So statement number one is very sufficient.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,980
Statement number two.

153
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,600
The number of people who wrote down an integer

154
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,770
was less than 70.

155
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,700
Well, that's useless.

156
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,660
I mean, by this statement,

157
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,990
maybe only one person wrote down an integer, right?

158
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,070
And if only one person wrote down an integer,

159
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,200
we definitely don't have any repeats

160
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,740
because there's no one to repeat with.

161
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,410
So this is a useless statement.

162
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,480
So statement one alone is sufficient

163
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,250
and statement two is useless.

164
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,020
73.

165
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,210
I think there should be a third option,

166
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,830
where you can rate the degree of uselessness of a statement.

167
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,250
Some of them borderline on almost being useful,

168
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,110
some of them are ridiculous, like this one.

169
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,770
OK, 73.

170
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,730
72.

171
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,600
In the figure above, is CD greater than BC?

172
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,390
So they drew us a number line,or whatever you want to call it

173
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,580
Some type of a line. Let me do another color.

174
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,010
This end we have A.

175
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,110
Then we have B.

176
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,890
Then we have C.

177
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,190
And then we have D.

178
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:25,800
In the figure above, is CD-- so this is CD-- greater than BC?

179
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,580
So they want to know is this greater than this?

180
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,180
So is CD greater than BC?

181
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,090
All right.

182
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,810
So number one, they tell us that AD is equal to 20.

183
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,920
So this whole thing is equal to 20.

184
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,540
So that doesn't help me much.

185
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,030
Statement number one tells us AD is equal to 20.

186
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,840
It just tells me the whole length.

187
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,610
Maybe I can get some more information.

188
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,710
Statement number two.

189
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,810
AB is equal to CD.

190
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,250
So this is interesting.

191
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,580
They're telling us that this is equal to this.

192
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,810
But this still doesn't help us, right?

193
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,690
I can imagine a situation where both of these are--

194
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,350
let's say that both of these are 5.

195
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,880
That could be 5, that could be 5.

196
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,330
And then this would be 10, right?

197
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,630
5 plus 10, plus 5.

198
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,570
In which case, CD would not be greater than BC, right?

199
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,110
So this would be a situation that meets all of the conditions

200
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,750
where CD would not be greater than BC.

201
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,560
But then I can construct one where it is greater than BC.

202
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,670
I can make CD equal to-- what if that was 8?

203
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,750
And then this one also has to be 8.

204
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,470
And then we would only have 4 left.

205
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,290
Where CD is greater than BC.

206
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,970
So in this case, both statements together

207
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,810
are still not sufficient.

208
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,330
So the answer is E.

209
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,700
And I've run out of time.

210
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,970
I'll see in the next video.
