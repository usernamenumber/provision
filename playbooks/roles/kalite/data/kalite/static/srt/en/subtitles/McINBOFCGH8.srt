00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,667
In the last video we showed that the ratios of the sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are, if we assume the

2
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:11,702
longest side is X, the hypotenuse is X, then the shortest side is X over 2, and the side in between,

3
00:00:11,702 --> 00:00:15,587
the side that is opposite the 60 degree side is the square root of three times x over 2.

4
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:22,087
Another way to think of it is if the shortest side is one, and I'll do the shortest side then the medium

5
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:27,133
side than the longest side. So if the side opposite the 30 degree side is 1 then the side opposite the

6
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:32,333
60 degree side is the square root of three times that. So it's going to be square root of three and then

7
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:37,000
the hypotenuse is going to be twice that. In the last video we started with x and we said that the 30

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,267
degree side is X over 2, but if the 30 degree side is one, then it is going to twice that so this is

9
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:48,200
going to be 2. This right here is the side opposite the 30 degree side, opposite the 60 degree side,

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,533
and then the hypotenuse, opposite the 90 degree side.

11
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:56,933
And so in general, if you see and triangle that has those ratios, you say hey, that's a 30-60-90 triangle.

12
00:00:56,933 --> 00:01:03,933
Or if you see a triangle that you know is a 30-60-90 triangle you cold say, Hey!, I know how to figure out

13
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:08,133
out one of the sides, based on this ratio right over here, and just as an example:

14
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:16,267
If you see a triangle that looks like this, where the sides are 2, 2 square root 3, and 4.

15
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:20,133
Once again the ratio of 2 to 2 square root of 3 is 1 to square root of 3.

16
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:25,400
The ratio of 2:4, is the same thing as 1:2, this right here must be a 30-60-90 triangle.

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,867
What I want to introduce you to in this video is another important type of triangle that shows up alot

18
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:36,867
in geometry, and a lot in trigonometry. And this is a 45-45-90 triangle.

19
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:41,333
Or another way to think about it is, if I have a right triangle that is also isosceles

20
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:45,000
,so a right triangle that is also isosceles.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,733
You obviosly can't have a right triangle that is equilateral,

22
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,667
because an equilateral triangle has all, all of their angles have to be 60 degrees.

23
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:56,067
But you can have a right angle, you can have a right triangle that is isosceles.

24
00:01:56,067 --> 00:02:03,933
An isosceles, let me write this, this is a right isosceles, i-sos-ce-les triangle.

25
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:07,533
And, if it's isosceles that means 2 of the sides are equal.

26
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:10,867
So, these are the 2 sides that are equal.

27
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:15,667
And then if the 2 sides are equal we have proved to ourselves, that the base angles are equal.

28
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:20,467
If we call the measure of these base angles X, now we know that X+X+90

29
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:26,067
have to be equal to 180. X plus X plus 90, need to be equal to 180.

30
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:31,000
Or if we subtract 90 from both sides, you get X plus X is equal to 90.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,067
Or 2X is equal to 90, OR if you divide both sides by 2, you get X is equal to 45 degrees.

32
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:44,533
So a right isosceles triangle can also be called, and this is the more typical name for it:

33
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:55,185
It can also be called a 45-45-90 triangle.

34
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:58,267
And what i want to do with this video, is to come up with the ratios for the sides

35
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:02,067
of a 45-45-90 triangle, just like we did for a 30-60-90 triangle.

36
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:03,600
And this one is actually more straight forward.

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,667
Because in a 45-45-90 triangle, if we call each of, if we call one of

38
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:11,333
the legs X, the other leg is also going to be X.

39
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,333
and then we can use the pythagorean theorem to figure out the length

40
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,733
of the hypotenuse.

41
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,698
So the length of the hypotenuse, let's call that C.

42
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:27,467
So we get, X squared + X squared, that's the square of both of the legs.

43
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:30,600
so when we sum those up that's going to have to be equal to C squared.

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,333
This is just straight out of the pythagorean theorem.

45
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:38,467
So we get 2X squared is equal to C squared, C squared.

46
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:42,867
We can take the principle root of both sides of that.

47
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:46,200
I want to change it to yellow, and it's not letting me,, ok.

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,133
Ok, to C squared, now let's take the principle root of both sides of that.

49
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,533
Principle root of both sides.

50
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,467
The left hand side, you get, principle root of 2 is just square root of 2.

51
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:58,533
And then principle root of X squared is just going to be X.

52
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:05,667
So you're going to have X times the square root of 2 is equal to, C.

53
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:09,267
So if you have a right isosceles triangle, whatever the two legs are,

54
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:11,933
they're gonna have the same length, that's why it's isosceles.

55
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:14,867
The hypotenuse is going to be square root of 2 times that.

56
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:19,000
So C is equal to, X times the square root of 2.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,867
So for example, if you have a triangle that looks like this.

58
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:24,933
Let me draw it in a slightly different way.

59
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:28,800
It's good to have to orient ourselves in different ways everytime.

60
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,933
So if we see a triangle that is a 90 degree, 45, and 45 like this,

61
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,667
And you really jst have to know two of these angles to know what the other one

62
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,800
is going to be.

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,800
And if i told you that this side right over here is 3.

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,267
Actually, I don't even have to tell you that this other side is going to be 3.

65
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:47,933
This is an isosceles triangle, so the two legs are going to be the same.

66
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:50,600
And you wont even have to apply the pythagorean theorem if you know this,

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,267
And this is a good one to know,

68
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:54,467
That the hypotenuse here, the side opposite the 90 degree side,

69
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:58,667
is just going to be the square root of 2 times the length of either of the legs.

70
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:02,200
So its going to be 3 times the square root of 2.

71
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,667
So the ratio of the sides and the hypotenuse, in a 45-45-90 triangle,

72
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,133
or a right isosceles triangle.

73
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:13,200
The ratio of the sides are: one of the legs can be 1,

74
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,267
then the other leg is going to have the same measure, the same length.

75
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:20,133
And then the hypotenuse is going to be the square root of 2 times either of those.

76
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,867
One to one to square root of two.

77
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:29,600
So this is 45-45-90, let me write, this is 45-45-90.

78
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,533
That's the ratios. And just as a review, if you have a 30-60-90

79
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:39,467
the ratios were one to square root of three to two.

80
00:05:39,467 --> 99:59:59,999
And now we will apply this in a bunch of problems.
