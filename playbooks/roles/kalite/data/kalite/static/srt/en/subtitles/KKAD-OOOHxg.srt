1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,870
So far we've dealt with simple
chains and rings of carbons.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,540
But let's think about what
happens when things get a

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,810
little bit more complex.

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,210
Let me just draw a molecule here
and we can think about

6
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,470
how we'll name it.

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:20,890
So let me draw it like that.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,710
So here we don't have
a simple chain.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,910
It branches off at some point.

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,870
So what we do in this situation
is we find the

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,370
longest chain in this molecule,
and let's think

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,010
about what the longest
chain is.

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,170
If we start here we get one,
two, three, four, five, six,

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,330
seven, eight carbons.

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,820
If we start here we get one,
two, three, four, five, six,

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,570
seven, eight, nine carbons.

17
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,060
So what we do is we look
at the longest chain.

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,770
The longest chain is this
one right here.

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,290
Let me do this in a
different color.

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,930
So this is one, two, three, one,
two, three, four, five,

21
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,920
six, seven, eight,
nine carbons.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,239
And so this will be-- that will
be kind of the core of

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,840
our naming.

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,510
So it's nine carbons.

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:15,270
So that right here, longest
chain, has nine carbons.

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,740
You can kind of view this is the
backbone of our molecule

27
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,830
and also the backbone
of our naming.

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,660
Nine carbons, so we're dealing
with a nonane.

29
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,310
   

30
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,600
Remember, nine, non- for nine,
and then -ane, because we're

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,230
dealing with an alkane.

32
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,860
We have all single
bonds over here.

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,420
Now, what do we do with
this thing over here?

34
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,140
Well, what's kind of sticking
off of this chain?

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,130
Well, we essentially have one
carbon here that's attached to

36
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,970
the chain, right?

37
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,470
This carbon is bonded to
a carbon on the chain.

38
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,930
If we wanted to draw the entire
molecule, we could draw

39
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,550
carbon here and it would it be
bonded to three hydrogens, but

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,850
that is all implicit.

41
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,900
But what is this thing
right here?

42
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,330
Well, it's one carbon.

43
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,270
You might be tempted to say
it's methane, but it's not

44
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,520
methane because it's attached
to other things.

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,550
But it would be right to
use the prefix meth-.

46
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,340
So this right here, you would
use the prefix meth-, so this

47
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:17,020
is one carbon, so you would want
to use the prefix meth-,

48
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,200
but because it isn't the main
chain, it is added to

49
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,760
something else, we don't write
methane, we write methyl.

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,210
So let me write this
right here: methyl.

51
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,900
   

52
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:37,360
So this means it branches
off longer chain.

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,810
   

54
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,070
So this molecule right here
would be called-- and

55
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,340
actually, there's one
more thing that we

56
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,390
have to think about.

57
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,670
This thing could have been--
we could just call it

58
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,750
methylnonane.

59
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,250
Let me just write that
down right now.

60
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,490
So we could just call this
right from the get-go, we

61
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,740
could call it methylnonane.

62
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:01,990
   

63
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,740
But there's one problem with
just calling it methylnonane.

64
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,970
This is methylnonane, but so
what's-- let me draw it.

65
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,930
So the thing I just drew here,
this is, one, two, three,

66
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,340
four, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

67
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,610
So that's the nonane.

68
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,430
And the one I drew here's one,
two, three, the methyl is

69
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,340
right over here.

70
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,650
That's what I just drew.

71
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,250
That is-- let me do it
in the same color.

72
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,210
So this is what I just drew.

73
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,420
But maybe, what if it was
something like this?

74
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,500
What if it was one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

75
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,490
eight, nine?

76
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,560
And let's say that the methyl
group was, instead of being

77
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,970
right here, let's say the methyl
group was right here.

78
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,170
So how would you name these
two things differently?

79
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,210
This name right now does not
differentiate between the

80
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,920
methyl group being on this
carbon versus the methyl group

81
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,740
being on this carbon over here
or this carbon over there.

82
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,210
And what you do in this case is
you number the carbons on

83
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,170
the longest chain, on the main
backbone, and you number them

84
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,820
so that the methyl group is
attached to the lowest

85
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,570
possible number.

86
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,730
So there's two possible ways
to number this chain.

87
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,420
You could start here
as one, two, three,

88
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,440
four, five, six, seven.

89
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,710
Then you would say that this
would be that the methyl group

90
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,170
is attached to the
seven carbon.

91
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,450
Or you could start numbering
from this end of the chain.

92
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,779
It would be one, two, three.

93
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,740
Or so it could also be attached
to the third.

94
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,420
Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

95
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,440
So you want to number
it so you're closest

96
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,130
to the methyl group.

97
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,020
So you want to start here.

98
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:36,240
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

99
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,240
So in this case, this would
not just be methylnonane.

100
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,406
This thing right here
would be three.

101
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,690
Let me make this very clear.

102
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,540
It would be 3-methylnonane.

103
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,160
Because the methyl group, that
one carbon, that one CH3, is

104
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,810
attached to the third carbon
on our nonane backbone, so

105
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,430
that right there is
3-methylnonane.

106
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,880
Since I drew this out, what
is this right here?

107
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,490
Well, once again, we have this
nonane backbone, one, two,

108
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,980
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, and you want to

109
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,420
number it so that this methyl
group is at the lowest number

110
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,640
carbon as possible.

111
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,320
So it's closer to this
end than that end.

112
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,870
So it's one, two, three, four,
I'll do that in magenta, and

113
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,930
you can keep numbering, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

114
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,780
So this one is going to be four,
and then you have your

115
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,360
methyl group.

116
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,570
It's just one carbon sitting
right there, so

117
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,820
4-methylnonane.

118
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:42,560
   

119
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,840
Now, let's go the other
way around.

120
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,740
Let's say we start with the name
and we want to figure out

121
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,490
its formula.

122
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,310
And hopefully, this gives you
a good understanding how

123
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,410
things will get more complex.

124
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,020
And over the next few videos,
they'll get more and more

125
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,550
complex, but you'll
see it's all at

126
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,270
least reasonably logical.

127
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:07,410
So let's say I were to give
you let me think of one.

128
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,660
Let's say 2-propylheptane.

129
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:18,510
   

130
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,780
So how do we take this apart?

131
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,310
So the first thing you
see, it is an alkane.

132
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,930
It's all going to
be single bonds.

133
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,540
Heptane, this is kind
of the core.

134
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,520
So the longest chain here, hept-
is the prefix for seven.

135
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,530
So this tells us-- let
me make this clear.

136
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,005
This tells us that we're dealing
with all single bonds.

137
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:39,790
   

138
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,295
That's what the -ane tells us.

139
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:43,700
If we had double bonds,
it would be -ene,

140
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,970
triple bonds, -ine.

141
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,680
We're going to see that in the
future, but let's stay

142
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,220
simple right now.

143
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,955
The hept- tells us we're dealing
with seven carbons.

144
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:54,570
   

145
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,470
And then what does this
2-propyl mean?

146
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,980
Well, propyl tells us-- what
was the prop- prefix?

147
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,870
If methyl is one, ethyl is two,
propyl is three, butyl is

148
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:12,180
four, so this is a three-carbon
group, and it's

149
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,980
going to be attached to the
second carbon on the heptanes.

150
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,520
Let me draw the heptane chain.

151
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,420
So we have seven carbons, so
one, two, three, four, five,

152
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,850
six, seven.

153
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,490
And then on the second carbon--
just let me pick a

154
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,220
good color here.

155
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,580
On the second carbon, so if we
just number it one, two,

156
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,170
three, four, five, six, seven,
on the second carbon right

157
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,440
there, we have a propyl group.

158
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,015
We have a propyl group, but it
is a three-carbon group.

159
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:44,430
So let me draw the
propyl group.

160
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,920
So we have a one, two, three,
three-carbon group, and it's

161
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,170
attached at the second
carbon right there.

162
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,330
So this molecule,
2-propylheptane

163
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,240
looks just like this.

164
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,610
Let's do another one, maybe one
that seems a little bit

165
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,670
more difficult.

166
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:08,850
Let's say that we have
6-butyltetradecane.

167
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:16,700
   

168
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,880
And all of these might seem a
little daunting when you see

169
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,450
it at first, but if you really
just break it up, it actually

170
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,540
is pretty logical.

171
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,945
So once again, we have the -ane
there, so it's all going

172
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:27,110
to be single bonds.

173
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,830
What is tetradec-?

174
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,350
What is that prefix?

175
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,240
Well, dec- is 10 and then
we have tetra-, that's 4

176
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,620
plus 10, that's 14.

177
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,510
Tetradec- is 14.

178
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,850
So this is telling us
that we're dealing

179
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:43,870
with a 14-carbon chain.

180
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,240
Let's draw that.

181
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,540
So one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

182
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,380
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen carbon chain.

183
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,540
And if we number them, one, two,
three, four, five, six,

184
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,910
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen,

185
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,530
fourteen, this tells us that
the sixth carbon will be

186
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,360
butyl, will be a butyl group.

187
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,410
So let's see, the sixth
carbon is right here.

188
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,680
And butyl, and you should
memorize this, methyl is one,

189
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,910
ethyl is two, propyl is three,
butyl is four, so we have a

190
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,015
four-carbon group.

191
00:09:23,015 --> 00:09:25,290
So let me write this
in a pink maybe.

192
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:33,140
So this is a four-carbon
group.

193
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,650
When you call it an alkyl
group, it's attached to

194
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,770
something else.

195
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,870
So on the sixth carbon, we have
a four-carbon group, so

196
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,990
one-- let me draw it this way.

197
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,410
No, this is fine.

198
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,540
Let's say we have one, two,
three, four, so that is our

199
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,560
butyl right there, and it's
attached to the sixth carbon.

200
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,700
It's attached to the sixth
carbon right there.

201
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,900
So this is what our molecule
would look like.

202
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,460
Now, let me ask you
a question.

203
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,385
Would you ever see a
9-butyltetradecane?

204
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:04,990
   

205
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,640
Would you ever see a
9-butyltetradecane?

206
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,400
So something where-- so let
me redraw it like this.

207
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,030
So a 9-butyltetradecane, so it
would have butyl over here.

208
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,460
One, two, three, four, one,
two, three, four.

209
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,880
Would you ever see a
9-butyltetradecane?

210
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,060
Will you ever see
that written?

211
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,510
You might say, oh, yeah,
Sal, you just drew it.

212
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,320
And the reason why you won't
ever see that written is

213
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,390
because there's a better
way to number it

214
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,430
if it's like this.

215
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,410
Instead of starting over here at
one at this end, you'd want

216
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,810
to start one that end.

217
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,810
So instead of saying
9-butyltetradecane, you should

218
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,520
number it the other way.

219
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,550
You should say this is one, two,
three, four, five, six.

220
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,715
So this is actually also
6-butyltetradecane.

221
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:50,565
   

222
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:51,580
Let me be sure I got that.

223
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,320
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

224
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,280
So instead of starting from the
left and making this the

225
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,140
ninth carbon, you always want
to start numbering from the

226
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,340
direction that has the lowest
number for the first group.

227
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,590
