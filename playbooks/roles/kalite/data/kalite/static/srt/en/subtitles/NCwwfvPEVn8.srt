1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,806
In the last video, we figured out

2
00:00:01,806 --> 00:00:05,203
how to construct a unit normal vector to a surface,

3
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:09,007
and so now we can use that back in our original surface integral

4
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:10,694
to try to simplify it a little bit —

5
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:13,069
or at least give us a clue of how we can calculate these things —

6
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:17,804
and also think about different ways to represent this type of a surface integral.

7
00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:22,239
So, if we just substitute what we came up with as our unit normal vector,

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,801
we will get...

9
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:28,138
So, once again, it's the surface integral of

10
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:33,804
F · (dot) (all of this business),

11
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:35,067
and I'm gonna write it all in white,

12
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,471
just so it doesn't take me too much time.

13
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:38,802
So, ru × rv — the partial of r with respect to u

14
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:42,879
crossed with the partial of r with respect to v —

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,587
over |ru × rv|, the magnitude of the same thing:

16
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:51,469
partial of r with respect to u, crossed with partial of r with respect to v.

17
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,736
And now, we've played with dS a lot.

18
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:55,736
We know that another way to write dS —

19
00:00:55,736 --> 00:00:58,296
and I gave the intuition for that, hopefully, several videos ago,

20
00:00:58,296 --> 00:01:00,615
when we first explored what a surface integral was all about —

21
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:07,601
we know that dS can be represented as |ru × rv| du dv:

22
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:13,880
the magnitude of the partial of r with respect to u, crossed with the partial of r with respect to v, du dv.

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,213
And obviously the du dv can be written as dv du.

24
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:22,803
You could write it as dA, a little chunk of area in the uv-plane, or in the uv-domain.

25
00:01:22,803 --> 00:01:25,547
And actually, since now this integral is in terms of (u,v),

26
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:27,214
we're no longer taking a surface integral;

27
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:30,614
we're now taking a double integral over the uv-domain.

28
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:33,004
So you could say, kind of a region in (u,v).

29
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:33,879
So this is gonna...

30
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:39,135
I'll say R to say that it's a region in the uv-plane that we're now thinking about.

31
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:40,546
But there's probably a huge...

32
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:42,212
or there should be, or I'm guessing,

33
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:44,802
there's a huge simplification that's popping out at you right now.

34
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:47,687
We're dividing by the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors,

35
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:52,469
and then we're multiplying by the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

36
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:53,962
Those are just scalar quantities.

37
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:55,879
You divide by something and multiply by something...

38
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,202
Well, that's just the same thing as

39
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:59,054
multiplying or dividing by 1.

40
00:01:59,054 --> 00:02:01,261
So, these two characters cancel out,

41
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:04,852
and our integral simplifies to ∫ ∫ F · (ru × rv) du dv —

42
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:07,344
the double integral over that region,

43
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,928
the corresponding region R in the uv-plane,

44
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:15,707
of our vector field F, dotted with

45
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:16,901
this cross product ru × rv.

46
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:18,847
This (ru × rv) is going to give us a vector right over here.

47
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,347
That's going to give us a vector.

48
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:22,377
It gives us actually a normal vector,

49
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:23,385
and then when we divide by its magnitude |ru × rv|,

50
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:25,402
it gives you a unit normal vector.

51
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:29,178
So this, you're going to take the dot product of F with

52
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:41,221
the partial of r with respect to u, crossed with the partial of r with respect to v, du dv.

53
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:45,533
(Let me scroll over to the right a little bit.)

54
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,457
And we'll see in a few videos from now

55
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:50,671
that this is essentially how we go about actually calculating these things.

56
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,188
If you have a parametrization, you can then get everything

57
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:56,724
in terms of a double integral, in terms of (u,v), this way.

58
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:57,522
Now, the last thing I want to do is

59
00:02:57,522 --> 00:03:00,790
explore another way that you'll see a surface integral like this written.

60
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,925
It all comes from really writing this part in a different way,

61
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:05,390
but hopefully it gives you a little bit more intuition

62
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,056
of what this thing is even saying.

63
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:12,424
So I'm just going to rewrite this chunk right over here.

64
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:14,005
I'm just going to rewrite that chunk.

65
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:16,088
And I'm going to use slightly different notation,

66
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:18,505
because it'll hopefully help make a little bit more sense.

67
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:20,856
So the partial of r with respect to u,

68
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:25,789
I can write as ∂r/∂u,

69
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,457
and we're taking the cross product

70
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,590
— let me make my 'u's a little bit more 'u'-like, so we don't confuse them with 'v's —

71
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:37,389
and we're taking the cross product of that, with ∂r/∂v.

72
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,522
So, very small changes in our vector,

73
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:42,457
in our parametrization, our position vector,

74
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:43,757
given a small change in v.

75
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,522
Very small changes in the vector,

76
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:47,255
given a small change in u.

77
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:49,854
And then we're multiplying that times du dv.

78
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:56,005
We're multiplying that times du dv.

79
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:58,922
Now, du and dv are just scalar quantities.

80
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,755
They're infinitesimally small,

81
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:02,789
but for the sake of this argument,

82
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:03,757
you can just view the...

83
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:05,854
they're not vectors, they're just scalar quantities.

84
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:08,522
And so, you can essentially include them,

85
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:10,587
you know, if you have the cross product...

86
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:14,854
if you have x(a×b), you know, a × b (a cross b),

87
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,123
times some scalar value — I don't know, 'x' —

88
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:23,339
you could rewrite this as (xa)×b,

89
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:28,657
or, you could write this as a×(xb),

90
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:31,392
because x is just a scalar value. It's just a number.

91
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:32,674
So, we can do the same thing over here.

92
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:35,339
We can rewrite all of this business as...

93
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:37,190
and I'm going to group the du, with

94
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,190
where we have ∂u in the denominator,

95
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,458
and I'll do the same thing with the 'v's.

96
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,589
And so, you'll get:

97
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:52,316
∂r/∂u times du (times that scalar) —

98
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:53,840
so, that'll give us a vector —

99
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:06,120
and we're going to cross that with ∂r/∂v dv.

100
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,931
Now, these might look notationally like two different things,

101
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:11,527
but that just comes from the necessity of,

102
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:14,005
when we take partial derivatives, to say,

103
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:15,004
"Oh no, this is, you know,

104
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:17,128
this vector function is defined,

105
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:18,861
it's a function of multiple variables,

106
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,062
and this is taking a derivative

107
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:21,595
with respect to only one of them."

108
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:23,529
So, this is how much does our vector change,

109
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:26,086
when you have a very small change in u.

110
00:05:26,086 --> 00:05:29,327
But this is also an infinitesimally small change in u over here;

111
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:31,337
we're just using slightly different notation.

112
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:32,421
So, for the sake...

113
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:34,337
and this is a little bit loosey-goosey mathematics,

114
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:35,726
but it'll hopefully give you the intuition

115
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:39,009
for why this thing can be written in a different way:

116
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,669
these are essentially the same quantity.

117
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:44,345
So, if you divide by something and multiply by something,

118
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,837
you can cancel them out.

119
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:48,061
You divide by something, multiply by something,

120
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:49,337
you can cancel them out,

121
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:53,127
and all you're left with, then, is

122
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:55,528
∂r, the differential of r,

123
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:57,862
and since we lost the information that it's in the u-direction,

124
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:00,728
I'll write here ∂r u, the differential of r in the u-direction.

125
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,421
I don't want you to get the notation confused.

126
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:05,504
This is just a differential, this is just how much r changed.

127
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:09,129
This is not ∂r/∂u, the partial derivative of r with respect to u.

128
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,462
This, right over here (∂r/∂u), is how much does r change,

129
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:14,929
given, per unit change, per small change in u.

130
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:18,262
This one (∂r u) just says, a differential in the direction of,

131
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:21,505
I guess, as u changes, this is how much,

132
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:23,728
that infinitely small change that just r changes.

133
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:27,004
This isn't change in r with respect to change in u.

134
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:34,596
And we're going to cross that with ∂r v, the partial of r in the v-direction.

135
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:37,196
Now, this right over here, let's just conceptualize this.

136
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,690
And this goes back to our original visions

137
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,796
of what a surface integral was all about.

138
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:44,089
If we're on a surface — and I'll draw a surface;

139
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:47,528
let me draw another surface, I won't use the one that I had already drawn on —

140
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:48,860
if we draw a surface,

141
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,727
and for a very small change in u,

142
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:52,862
and we're not gonna think about the rate;

143
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:55,755
we're just thinking about kind of the change in r,

144
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:57,861
you're going in that direction,

145
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:00,929
so this thing, if that thing looks like this,

146
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:05,004
this is actually kind of a distance moved on the surface,

147
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:06,712
because it's just, it's not,

148
00:07:06,712 --> 00:07:07,785
remember, this isn't the derivative ∂r/∂u,

149
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:09,210
this is the differential ∂r.

150
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,838
So it's just a small change along the surface,

151
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:13,129
that's that over there.

152
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:16,590
And then this is a small change when you change v,

153
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,922
so it's also a change along the surface.

154
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:21,194
When you take the cross product of these two things,

155
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:23,027
you get a vector that is orthogonal,

156
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:31,219
you get a vector that is normal to the surface,

157
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:35,938
and its magnitude — and we saw this when we first learned about cross products —

158
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:38,945
its magnitude is equal to the area that's kind of,

159
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:41,856
that is defined by these two vectors.

160
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:49,391
So, its magnitude is equal to area.

161
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:51,320
So, in a lot of ways, you can really think of it,

162
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,790
you really could think of it as a unit normal vector n times dS.

163
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,855
And so, the way that we would, I guess,

164
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:01,020
notationally do this, is we can call this,

165
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,322
because this is kind of a dS,

166
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:03,938
but it's a vector version of the dS.

167
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:06,323
Over here, this is just an area right over here.

168
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:08,388
This is just a scalar value.

169
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:13,311
But now, we have a vector that points normally from the surface,

170
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,594
but its magnitude is the same thing as that dS

171
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:17,978
that we were just talking about.

172
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:20,259
So we can call this thing right over here

173
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:21,927
(∂r u × ∂r v), we can call this dS,

174
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:23,608
and the key difference here is

175
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:24,859
this is a vector now,

176
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:28,192
so we'll call it dS with a little vector over it,

177
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:29,690
to know that this is this thing (∂r u × ∂r v),

178
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,733
this isn't the scalar dS that is just concerned with the area.

179
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,532
But when you view things this way —

180
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:38,934
we just saw that this entire thing simplifies to dS —

181
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:43,066
then our whole surface integral can be rewritten,

182
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,428
instead of writing it like this,

183
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:49,077
we can write it as ∫ ∫ F · (∂r u × ∂r v),

184
00:08:49,077 --> 00:08:51,207
the surface integral —

185
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:53,798
those integral signs were too fancy —

186
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:58,686
the surface integral of F, dot,

187
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:00,934
instead of saying a normal vector times a scalar quantity,

188
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:02,739
that little chunk of area on the surface,

189
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:07,534
we can now just call that the vector differential dS.

190
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:09,999
And I want to make it clear, these are two different things:

191
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,019
this is a vector, this is how we would,

192
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,866
this is essentially what we're calling it (∂r u × ∂r v).

193
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:16,731
This right over here (ndS) is a scalar times a normal vector.

194
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:17,938
So these are three different ways

195
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:19,533
of really representing the same thing.

196
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,798
And in different contexts, you will see different things,

197
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:23,519
depending on what, I guess, the author,

198
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,731
or whoever is trying to communicate,

199
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,684
is trying to communicate.

200
00:09:26,684 --> 00:09:27,866
This right over here —

201
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:30,101
∫ ∫ F · (ru × rv) du dv — is the one that we'll use most frequently,

202
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:34,101
as we actually try to calculate these surface integrals.
