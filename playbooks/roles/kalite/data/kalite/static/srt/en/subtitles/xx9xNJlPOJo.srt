1
00:00:00,915 --> 00:00:04,180
Let's now move away from the world of the hunter-gatherer

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,209
and into the dinnerware market.

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:08,678
So let's say we're going to talk about two products --

4
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:11,760
two types of dinnerware.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,347
We'll have cups on this axis,

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,464
and we will have plates on this axis.

7
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:19,518
And let's say we have a producer, Charlie,

8
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:21,895
and if he were to focus all of his time on cups,

9
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:29,167
he could produce - let me put these [labels]10, 20, 30.

10
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:31,337
So if he were to focus all of his time on cups,

11
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:33,275
he could produce 30 cups,

12
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:36,900
and if he were to focus all of his time on plates,

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,052
he could produce 10 plates.

14
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:40,432
And we're going to assume he has

15
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:43,318
a linear Production Possibilities Frontier.

16
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:47,060
So, this is what his PPF is going to look like.

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,951
We draw a little bit, actually connect the 2 dots,

18
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:52,959
so that's.. I want to make it more looking like a line,

19
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,372
so that's about as good as I can do.

20
00:00:54,372 --> 00:01:00,222
So that right over there is the PPF for Charlie.

21
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:02,062
Now let's think about his opportunity cost.

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,862
And because this is a linear PPF

23
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:05,489
his opportunity cost does not change.

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,127
The slope of this line is not changing.

25
00:01:07,127 --> 00:01:08,878
It's not that bow-shaped curve

26
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:10,630
that we saw for the hunter gatherer.

27
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,727
So it's going to be a fixed opportunity cost

28
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:14,251
for one product relative to the other,

29
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:18,321
at any point along this production possibilities frontier.

30
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:20,236
So let's say we're sitting over here,

31
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:21,247
this will just make things simple

32
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,802
to just think about the end points,

33
00:01:22,802 --> 00:01:24,427
and he's producing 30 cups,

34
00:01:24,427 --> 00:01:27,497
what is his opportunity cost of producing 10 plates?

35
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:28,843
Well to produce 10 plates,

36
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,388
he's going to have to give up those 30 cups.

37
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:37,264
So his opportunity cost of producing 10 plates,

38
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,985
is equal to 30 cups.

39
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:43,149
Or if you want the opportunity cost for one plate,

40
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,395
you just divide both sides by 10,

41
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,996
and so you get the opportunity cost of 1 plate,

42
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:54,421
is equal to 3 cups. That's fair enough.

43
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,970
Now let's think about the same scenario

44
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,065
or let's think about another producer,

45
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:03,238
in this market for dinner ware. Let's call her Patty.

46
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:05,355
If Patty focused all of her time on cups

47
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:07,227
she could produce 10 cups in a day

48
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,831
and if she focused all of her time on plates,

49
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:12,989
she could produce 30 plates in a day.

50
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,154
So that is..

51
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:17,456
and she also has a linear production possibilities frontier,

52
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:25,999
so that right over there is the PPF for Patty.

53
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,371
And let's think about

54
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:29,928
her opportunity cost for producing a plate.

55
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:32,514
So the opportunity cost, if she's sitting right over here,

56
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:34,347
and she was focused all on cups,

57
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:36,044
and if she wanted to produce 30 plates,

58
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:37,828
and I'm intentionally using the end points

59
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:39,611
to make the math more obvious.

60
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:41,730
If she wanted to produce 30 plates

61
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,807
then she would have to give up 10 cups.

62
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:49,155
So her opportunity costs to produce 30 plates

63
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:53,148
is equal to 10 cups.

64
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:55,319
Or if you divide both sides by 30,

65
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,118
the opportunity cost of her producing 1 plate,

66
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:00,332
in terms of cups,

67
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:04,628
is 10 divided by 30, is 1/3, 1/3 of a cup.

68
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:06,094
Now this is interesting,

69
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:09,143
we can now compare their relative opportunity costs.

70
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:10,541
The opportunity cost for Charlie

71
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,432
to produce a plate is 3 cups,

72
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:13,986
the opportunity cost for Patty

73
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,547
to produce a plate is 1/3 of a cup.

74
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:17,805
So for Patty,

75
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:19,585
especially when you measure it in terms of cups,

76
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:21,995
it is cheaper for her to produce a plate.

77
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,642
She has a lower opportunity cost

78
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:25,903
than Charlie does in producing plates.

79
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:29,189
So relative to Charlie, we say, because her opportunity cost

80
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,688
is lower in producing plates, 1/3 relative to 3,

81
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:44,159
we say that Patty has the comparative advantage in plates,

82
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,817
relative to Charlie.

83
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:52,190
And it's not just because she can produce -

84
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,825
We'll see situations in maybe the next video where

85
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:55,915
we'll actually show this.

86
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:57,256
It doesn't even have to be the case that

87
00:03:57,256 --> 00:04:00,421
she can produce more plates in a given day.

88
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:02,465
This is not why she has a comparative advantage.

89
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:03,964
This is called an absolute advantage,

90
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,500
and we'll talk about that more.

91
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,101
She has a comparative advantage

92
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:09,937
because her opportunity cost is lower.

93
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:11,940
Her opportunity cost for producing a plate

94
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,313
is lower than it is for Charlie.

95
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:16,870
Now let's think about it the other way around.

96
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,515
Who has a comparative advantage in cups?

97
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:25,161
Well, if we divide both sides of this right over here by 3,

98
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:28,993
well let's swap both sides,

99
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:32,856
so the opportunity costs for Charlie of producing 3 cups,

100
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,162
is equal to 1 plate.

101
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:37,867
Or if you divide both sides by 3,

102
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:43,318
opportunity cost of 1 cup is 1/3 of a plate.

103
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:46,080
If we go to the situation for Patty,

104
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,019
let's swap these 2 around,

105
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:55,562
the opportunity cost for 10 cups is 30 plates.

106
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,224
If you divide both sides by 10,

107
00:04:57,224 --> 00:05:02,502
the opportunity cost of 1 cup is equal to 3 plates.

108
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,000
And obviously, and we've talked about this before,

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,952
the opportunity cost of 1 incremental unit

110
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:10,818
is the same thing as the marginal cost of a cup.

111
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:11,816
But anyway,

112
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:15,922
who has the lower opportunity cost for producing cups?

113
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:19,011
Well, let's see, Charlie can produce a cup,

114
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:22,074
or Charlie's opportunity cost for producing an extra cup

115
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:25,391
is 1/3 of a plate, and Patty's is 3 plates.

116
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,653
So Charlie has

117
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:30,561
the lower opportunity cost for producing a cup.

118
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:33,676
So, it's only 1/3 plate relative to 3 plates.

119
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:40,194
So this is where Charlie has the comparative advantage.

120
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:41,391
What we're going to see is

121
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:43,563
if both of these parties

122
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:46,411
specialize in their comparative advantage

123
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:50,452
and then trade, they can get outcomes that are beyond

124
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:53,996
each of their individual production possibility frontiers.

125
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:55,446
So what we can see is, for example,

126
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:57,687
they can get an outcome where

127
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:01,040
they are each able to get 15 cups and 15 plates,

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,745
which would have been impossible left to their own devices.

129
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:05,626
So let's see how they can actually do it.

130
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:06,881
So we've said that

131
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:09,028
Charlie has a comparative advantage in cups.

132
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:11,524
His opportunity cost of producing a cup

133
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:14,021
is lower than it is for Patty.

134
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:16,610
It's only 1/3 of a plate relative to 3 plates.

135
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,219
So let's make him specialize in cups. So cup specialties.

136
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:23,437
So he's going to specialize in cups, and

137
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:29,506
Patty, for the same reason, is going to specialize in plates.

138
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:32,183
So Charlie specializing in cups means

139
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,785
he's going to focus only on cups.

140
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:38,848
So he's going to produce 30 cups every day.

141
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:41,308
And Patty specializing in plates means

142
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:44,638
that she's going to produce 30 plates every day.

143
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,254
(Let me do this in a different color: magenta).

144
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:49,762
She's going to produce 30 plates every day.

145
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:52,083
Now imagine, I'm going to make an assumption here,

146
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,387
but imagine that they both do that but

147
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:57,383
they don't each only want to have what they're producing

148
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,253
they want to have some combination of them,

149
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,593
so they decide to trade.

150
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:02,308
And I'm going to fix the price here.

151
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:04,720
We're going to talk more about markets in the future.

152
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:13,062
But I assume that they agree to trade at 1 cup for 1 plate.

153
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:15,251
And this makes sense for either of them

154
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:19,387
because this trading price, or this market price,

155
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:21,718
is lower than their opportunity cost.

156
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:25,245
So here's Charlie, he's got all of these cups,

157
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,655
left to his own devices, if he wanted an extra plate

158
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,808
he would have to spend 3 cups but now

159
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:32,838
in the market, with this price over here,

160
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:36,105
he only has to spend 1 cup for an extra plate.

161
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:39,460
So, this makes sense for him because the market price

162
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,681
is lower than his opportunity cost.

163
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:45,253
So he would definitely rather get a plate in the market

164
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,717
than have to do it by producing it himself.

165
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,774
It‘s cheaper this way.

166
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:50,317
And the same thing for Patty.

167
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:53,099
She has all of these plates, but if she wants a cup,

168
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,446
left by herself, she would have to spend 3 plates to do it.

169
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:58,056
She would have to give up 3 plates.

170
00:07:58,056 --> 00:07:59,622
But now in the market,

171
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:03,588
she would only have to give up 1 plate.

172
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:04,775
So this is a good deal,

173
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,731
this is lower than her opportunity cost.

174
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:08,580
So she'll want to transact.

175
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,678
And so they can do, each of them,

176
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:13,585
so for example, Charlie could keep trading cups for plates

177
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:17,430
and he could end up anywhere on this line over there.

178
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,084
And Patty could actually do the same thing:

179
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:20,398
she could trade the cups for plates

180
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:22,079
and end up someplace over there.

181
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,140
But obviously where they end up is dependent on

182
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,246
how much the other one is willing to trade.

183
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:27,561
But let's say

184
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,415
that they both want to get to that 15-15 scenario

185
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:33,200
so they can both trade 15 cups to the other person.

186
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,427
So Charlie could trade 15 cups for 15 plates

187
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:38,302
and obviously Patty would be trading 15 plates for 15 cups.

188
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:41,619
And they would both be able to get right over there.

189
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:43,940
Which is a situation that was unattainable

190
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,790
left to their own production possibilities.

191
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,671
So hopefully you found that interesting.

192
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:51,745
By specializing they could get these gains of trade.

193
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:55,745
They specialize in their comparative advantage.
