1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,910
Let's see if taking the
transpose of a matrix does

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,510
anything to its determinant.

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,365
So a good place to start is just
with the 2-by-2 scenario.

5
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:12,380
So let's do the 2-by-2
scenario.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,570
So if I start with
some matrix here.

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,219
Let me just take its
determinant.

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,280
So a, b, c, d.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,610
And then let me take
its determinant.

10
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,930
So this is going to be
equal to ad minus bc.

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,370
Let me take the transpose of
this and then take its

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:30,980
determinant.

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,810
So that would be the determinant
of ac, the columns

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
turn into the rows, and
then bd, the rows

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,150
turn into the columns.

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,570
What is this going
to be equal to?

17
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,620
This is going to be equal
to ad minus bc again.

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,820
The only thing that happened is
these two guys got swapped

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,610
and they multiply times
each other anyway.

20
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,700
So these two things
are equivalent.

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:01,090
So at least for the 2-by-2 case,
the determinant of some

22
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:07,440
matrix is equal to the
determinant of the transpose

23
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,100
of that matrix.

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,380
Now, that's just the
2-by-2 case.

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,210
Now, I'm going to make an
inductive argument, or I could

26
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:21,170
just say an argument by
induction, to show that this

27
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:27,090
works for all n by
n, for all cases.

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,760
And the way you construct an
argument by induction is you

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,990
assume that it's true
for the n-by-n case.

30
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,560
   

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,373
So let's assume that for
n by n, and let's

32
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:49,623
say I have some matrix.

33
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:52,590
   

34
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,920
Let me call it matrix B, and
let's say it's an n-by-n

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,270
matrix, we assume that the
determinant of any matrix B

36
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:06,740
that's n by n is equal to the
determinant of B's transpose.

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,289
That's where we started off with
our inductive argument.

38
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:20,580
And then we see if given this,
if given that, is it true of n

39
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,610
plus 1 by n plus 1 matrix?

40
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,910
Because if we can, if we can
say, look, given that it's

41
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,470
true for the n-by-n case, it's
going to be true for the n

42
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,240
plus 1 by n plus 1 case, then
we're done because we know

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,220
it's true for the base case,
the 2-by-2 case, which you

44
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,130
could say, well, that's
your first n by n.

45
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,460
So if it's true for the 2 by 2
case, then it'll be true for

46
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,170
the 3-by-3 case, because that's
just one increment.

47
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,530
But then if it's true for the
3-by-3 case, then it'll be

48
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,170
true for the 4-by-4 case.

49
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,210
And if it's true for the 4-by-4
case, it'll be true for

50
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,190
the 5-by-5 case, and you just
keep going up like that.

51
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,730
So when you do a proof by
induction, you prove a base

52
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,050
case, and then you prove that if
it's true for n, or in this

53
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,010
case an n-by-n determinant, if
you can prove that given it's

54
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,690
true for an n-by-n determinant,
it's going to be

55
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,560
true for an n plus 1 by n plus
1 determinant or an n plus 1

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,850
by n plus 1 matrix, then you
have completed your proof.

57
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,145
So let's see if this
is the case.

58
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:24,742
So let me construct an n plus
1 by n plus 1 matrix.

59
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:30,140
So let's say I have my matrix
A, my favorite letter to use

60
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,330
for matrices, I think the
entirely linear algebra's

61
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,180
favorite letter to
use for matrices.

62
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,290
And let's say it's an n plus
1 by n plus 1 matrix.

63
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,430
And just to simplify my notation
let's just say that m

64
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,740
is equal to n plus 1.

65
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,160
So we could call it
an m-by-m matrix.

66
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,840
And what is it going
to look like?

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,070
Let's draw its entries
right here.

68
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,270
I'm going to draw more than the
normal amount of entries.

69
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:03,970
a11, this is its first row,
a12, all the way to a1m.

70
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,000
We have m columns, which is the
same thing as m plus 1.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's not m times 1 columns.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,830
This is m plus 1 as well.

73
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,800
And then we do our second
row right here.

74
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:22,700
a21, a22, a23, all
the way to a2m.

75
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:31,120
Then you have your third row
right here: a31, a32, a33, all

76
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,540
the way to a3m.

77
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,050
And then you go all
the way down here.

78
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,015
At the end you have your mth
row, which you could also say

79
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,150
is your m plus 1 row.

80
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,600
So it's your mth row, first
column, and then you have a

81
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:56,820
sub m2, and then a sub m3,
all the way to a sub mm.

82
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,280
Fair enough.

83
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,340
Now, let me draw the
transpose of A.

84
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:09,120
So A transpose is also going to
be an n plus 1 by n plus 1

85
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,270
matrix, which you could also
write as an m-by-m matrix.

86
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm just going to have to take
the transpose of this.

87
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,670
So the transpose of that, this
row becomes a column, so it

88
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:25,690
becomes a11, and this entry
right here is a12.

89
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,440
It's this entry right there.

90
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:35,450
Then you can go all the
way down to a1m.

91
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:42,480
Then this pink row becomes a
pink column here, a21-- I

92
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,600
wanted to do it in pink.

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:54,190
You have a21, a22, you have an
a23, and it goes all the way

94
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,680
down to a2m.

95
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,065
You have your green row right
here, it's your third one, so

96
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:07,390
it's a31, a32, a33, all
the way down to a3m.

97
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,820
And then we can just skip a
bunch of rows in this case,

98
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,270
but it's columns in this case.

99
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:18,910
So you just draw some dots
and you have am1, am2.

100
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,290
I'm just going down this guy,
but this row is now going to

101
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,875
become-- which was
the last row.

102
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,970
It's now going to become
the last column.

103
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,990
am3, all the way down to amm.

104
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,320
And I have my transpose.

105
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,100
Now, let's take the
determinant of A.

106
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,730
   

107
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,270
Let me do it in purple.

108
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:47,260
So the determinant of my matrix
A, we could just go

109
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,120
down this first row up here.

110
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,450
It's going to be equal to a11
times the determinant of its

111
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,410
submatrix, so it's the
determinant of this submatrix

112
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,660
right here.

113
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,110
   

114
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,180
We could call that the
submatrix a sub 11.

115
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,740
We've seen this notation
before.

116
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:19,170
So it's the determinant of a sub
11, and then it is minus

117
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,560
a12 times the determinant of
its submatrix, so you cross

118
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,710
out that row and that column.

119
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,230
So that is going to be a sub 12,
and you're going to go all

120
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,140
the way to-- and I don't what
the sign on that is, so we

121
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,650
could call it negative 1 to the
1 plus m-- that'll give us

122
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,260
the right sign for the
checkerboard pattern-- times

123
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,220
the determinant of the submatrix
for this guy.

124
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,960
So we call it a1m, where you
cross out that guy's row, that

125
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,540
guy's column, and you're
just left with all of

126
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,250
this stuff over here.

127
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,310
Fair enough.

128
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,790
Now, let's look at the
determinant of a transpose.

129
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,820
   

130
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,200
We learned earlier, you don't
have to go down the first row

131
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
or you don't even
go down a row.

132
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,840
You could go down a column.

133
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,970
Let me be clear.

134
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,080
So for our determinant of A, we
went down this row, and our

135
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,140
submatrices, this was
my first submatrix.

136
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,820
My second submatrix, you know
what it looks like.

137
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,460
You would cross out the second
column and that row, and

138
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,040
whatever's left over would be
the second submatrix and so on

139
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,010
and so forth.

140
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,420
But for our determinant of A
transpose, let's just go down

141
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,520
this first column and get the
submatrices like that.

142
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,790
So this is going to be equal
to-- let's get our first term

143
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,070
right here.

144
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,320
a sub 11 times the determinant
of its submatrix.

145
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,039
So what's the determinant
of its submatrix?

146
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,740
It's going to be-- its
submatrix, you cross out its

147
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,000
row and its column, and you're
going to be left with this

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
thing right here.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
Now, an interesting question
is how does this thing that

150
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,760
I've just squared off, this
guy's submatrix, relate to

151
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,450
this guy's submatrix?

152
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,610
Well, if you look at it
carefully, this row from a22

153
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,320
to a2m has now become a column
from a22 to a2m.

154
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,820
This row, which is the next one,
from a32 to a3m has now

155
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,540
become a column from
a32 to a3m.

156
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,120
If you keep going down this last
row, it has now become

157
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,570
this column.

158
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,690
So this guy's submatrix or the
thing we're going to have to

159
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,610
take the determinant of right
here is equal to the transpose

160
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,710
of this guy.

161
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:34,190
So this is equal to a
sub 11 transpose.

162
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:40,350
And if you go through it, we go
minus this guy, minus a12

163
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,590
times the determinant
of his submatrix.

164
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:48,110
And if we cross out this guy's
row and that guy's column,

165
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,400
what is that going
to look like?

166
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,840
His submatrix is going
to look like this.

167
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,030
It's going to have that there
and it's going to have that

168
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,120
right there.

169
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,060
How does that compare to a12?

170
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,670
So a12 is if you crossed out
this and this, you're left

171
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,260
with all of this right here.

172
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,040
   

173
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,920
So once again, you see that this
row is the same thing as

174
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,610
this column, that this row is
the same thing as this column,

175
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,880
that that row is the same
thing as that column.

176
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,980
So once again, the submatrix
we have to take the

177
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,070
determinant of is equal
to the transpose of

178
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,580
this thing over here.

179
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,500
So it's equal to
a12 transpose.

180
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,270
This thing-- I could draw it
shaded in-- is equal to the

181
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:34,290
transpose of this thing, is
equal to the transpose of that

182
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,000
thing right there.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,330
So, in general, each of these
submatrices when we go down

184
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,860
this row is equal to the
transpose of each of these.

185
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,950
So you keep going, so then
you're going to go all the way

186
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,440
to plus minus 1.

187
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,570
We're going to go all the way
down to the minus 1, 1 plus m

188
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,150
times the determinant of--
it's going to be this guy

189
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,530
transposed.

190
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,680
You can even do it.

191
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,560
If you go all the way to-- if
you cross that guy out and

192
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,190
that guy out, you're left with
everything else on this

193
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,800
matrix, and that's equal to the
transpose of if you cross

194
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,030
this guy out and that guy out.

195
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,770
This row turns into that column,
that row turns into

196
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,660
that column.

197
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,030
I think you see the point.

198
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,290
I don't want to beat
a dead horse.

199
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,230
So that's going to be equal
to a sub 1m transpose.

200
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,440
Now, remember, going into this
inductive proof, or proof by

201
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,120
induction, I assume that for--
remember, this is an n plus 1

202
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,630
by n plus 1 matrix.

203
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,200
But going into it, I assumed
that for an n-by-n matrix, the

204
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,330
determinant of B
is equal to the

205
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,180
determinant of B transpose.

206
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,430
Well, these guys right
here, these are

207
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,490
n-by-n matrices, right?

208
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,330
This guy right here is an
n plus 1 by n plus 1.

209
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,230
Same thing for this
guy right here.

210
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,560
But these guys right
here are n by n.

211
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,190
   

212
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,060
So if we assume for the n-by-n
case that the determinant of a

213
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,390
matrix is equal to the
determinant of a transpose--

214
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,170
this is the determinant of
the matrix, this is the

215
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,360
determinant of its transpose--
these two

216
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,300
things have to be equal.

217
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,500
So we can then say that the
determinant of A transpose is

218
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,110
equal to this term A sub 11
times this, but this is equal

219
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,040
to this for the n-by-n case.

220
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,540
Remember, we're doing the n
plus 1 by n plus 1 case.

221
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,450
But these submatrices
are one dimension

222
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,960
smaller in each direction.

223
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,700
It has one less row and
one less column.

224
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,955
So these two things are equal.

225
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,430
So instead of writing this, I
can just write this, so times

226
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,820
the determinant of a sub 11.

227
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,720
Then you keep going.

228
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,920
Minus a sub 12 times
the determinant.

229
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,730
Instead of writing this, I
could write that because

230
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,840
they're equal.

231
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,240
Determinant a sub 12, all the
way to plus minus 1 to the 1

232
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,570
plus m times the determinant
of this.

233
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,750
These two things are equal.

234
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,730
That is equal to that.

235
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,620
That was our assumption
in this inductive

236
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,230
proof, a sub 1m.

237
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,790
And then you see that, of
course, this line, this blue

238
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,450
line here, is equivalent to
this blue line there.

239
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:16,100
So we get that the determinant
of A, which is an n plus 1 by

240
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:22,240
n plus 1, so this is the n
plus 1 by n plus 1 case.

241
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,260
We get the determinant
of A is equal to the

242
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,380
determinant of A transpose.

243
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:36,310
And we got this assuming that it
is true-- let me write it--

244
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:43,950
assuming that it's true
for n-by-n case.

245
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,610
And then we're done.

246
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,230
We've now proved that this is
true in general, because we've

247
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,350
proven the base case.

248
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,300
We've proven it for the 2-by-2
case, and then we showed that

249
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,230
if it's true for the n
case, it's true for

250
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,940
the n plus 1 case.

251
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,980
So if it's true for the 2 case,
it's going to be true

252
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,570
for the 3-by-3 case.

253
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,110
If it's true for the 3-by-3
case, it's true for the 4-by-4

254
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,810
case, so on and so forth.

255
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,460
But the takeaway
is pretty neat.

256
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,020
You can take the transpose, the

257
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,160
determinant doesn't change.

258
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,333
