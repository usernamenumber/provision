1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,960
In the last couple of videos,
we've seen that if we have

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,460
some matrix C that is n by n.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,430
It's a square matrix, and is
columns, column form and

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,790
orthonormal set.

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,750
   

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,110
Which just means that the
columns each have been

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,670
normalized.

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,610
So they each have length
of 1 if you view

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,940
them as column vectors.

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,520
And they're all mutually
orthogonal to each other.

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,930
So if you dot it with
yourself you get 1.

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,480
If you dot it with any of the
other columns, you get 0.

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,670
We've seen this multiple
times.

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,520
It's orthogonal to
everything else.

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,400
If you have a matrix like this--
and I actually forgot

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,270
to tell you the name of
this-- this is called

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,520
an orthogonal matrix.

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,130
   

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,950
We've already seen that the
transpose of this matrix is

21
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,530
the same thing as the inverse
of this matrix.

22
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,320
Which makes it super, duper,
duper useful to deal with.

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,600
The transpose of this matrix
is equal to the inverse.

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,650
Now, this statement leads to
some other interesting things

25
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,160
about this.

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,400
So, so far we've been dealing
this mainly with

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,510
the change of basis.

28
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,460
I can kind of draw the
diagram that you're

29
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,580
probably tired of by now.

30
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,290
Let's say that's the
standard basis.

31
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,560
Let's say that I have
x in coordinates

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,760
with another basis.

33
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,280
We've seen I can multiply
this guy times c.

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,720
To get that up there I could
multiply that guy by c inverse

35
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,090
to get this guy right here.

36
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,600
And, in that world, we viewed
c as just a change of basis.

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,260
Were representing the same
matrix-- we're representing

38
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,280
the same vector.

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,100
We're just changing the
coordinates of how we

40
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,970
represent it.

41
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,220
But we also know that any matrix
product, any matrix

42
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,080
vector product, is also a
linear transformation.

43
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,820
So, this change of basis
is really just a linear

44
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,340
transformation.

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,890
What I want to show you in this
video, and you could view

46
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,930
it either as a change of basis
or as a linear transformation,

47
00:01:52,930 --> 00:02:00,230
is that when you multiply this
orthogonal matrix times some

48
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,170
vector, it preserves--
let me write this

49
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:13,880
down-- lengths and angles.

50
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,880
So let's have a little
touchy-feely discussion of

51
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,390
what that means.

52
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,390
Let's view it as a
transformation.

53
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,070
Let's say I have some set
of vectors in my domain.

54
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,320
Let's say they look like this.

55
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,330
Let's say that it
looks like this.

56
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,210
Well, let me do it like-- I'll
draw that one like that guy,

57
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,365
and this guy like that.

58
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:36,150
And there's some angle
between them.

59
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,610
Angles are easy to visualize
in r2, r3.

60
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,780
Maybe a little harder once we
get the higher dimensions.

61
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,820
But that's the angle
between them.

62
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,980
Now, if we're saying that we're
preserving the angles

63
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,830
and the lengths, that means if
I were to multiply these

64
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,440
vectors times c then we could
view it as a transformation.

65
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,650
Maybe I rotate them or I--
well, you can't really.

66
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,530
Maybe I rotate them or do
something like that.

67
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,490
So maybe that pink vector
will now look like this.

68
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,700
But it's going to have
the same length.

69
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,990
This length is going to be the
same thing as that length.

70
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,575
And even more, when I said it
preserves lengths and angles,

71
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:11,840
this yellow vector's going to
look something like this.

72
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,630
Where the angle is going
to be the same.

73
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,980
Where this data is going
to be that data.

74
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,200
That's what I mean by
preserves angles.

75
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,530
If we didn't have this case,
we could imagine a

76
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,460
transformation that doesn't
preserve angles.

77
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,690
Let me draw one that doesn't.

78
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,250
If this got transformed to, I
don't know, let's say this guy

79
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,460
got a lot longer, and let's say
this guy also got longer,

80
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,330
and I want to show
that the angle

81
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,235
also doesn't get preserved.

82
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:37,400
Not only did it get
longer, but it got

83
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,370
distorted a little bit.

84
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,380
So, the angle also changed.

85
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,850
This transformation
right there is

86
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:50,760
not preserving angles.

87
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,850
So when you have a change
of basis matrix that's

88
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,010
orthogonal, when you have a
transformation matrix that's

89
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,220
orthogonal, all it's essentially
doing to your to

90
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,820
your vectors, is it kind of a
rotates them around, but it's

91
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,110
not going to really
distort them.

92
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,960
So I'll write that in quotes
because that's not a

93
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,430
mathematically rigorous term.

94
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,690
So, no distortion of vectors.

95
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,570
So, I've kind of showed
you the intuition

96
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,220
of what that means.

97
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,745
Let's actually prove
it to ourselves

98
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,980
that this is the case.

99
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,180
So, I'm saying that if this
pink vector here is x, and

100
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,630
that this pink vector here is
c times x, I'm claiming that

101
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,400
the length of x is equal to
the length of c times x.

102
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,373
Let's see if that's
actually the case.

103
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:47,180
   

104
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:56,830
The length of cx squared is the
same thing as cx dot cx.

105
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,360
And here it's always useful
for me to kind of remind

106
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,940
myself that if I take
two vectors-- let

107
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,810
me do it over here.

108
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,810
Let's say I have y dot y.

109
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,593
This is the same thing as y
transpose, if you view them as

110
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:15,300
matrices, y transpose times y.

111
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:24,180
y transpose y is just y1, y2,
all the way to yn times y1,

112
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,340
y2, all the way to yn.

113
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,610
And if you were to do this 1
by n times n by 1 matrix

114
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,340
product, you're going to get a 1
by 1 matrix or just a number

115
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,770
that's going to be y1 times y1
plus y2 times y2 all the way

116
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,910
to yn times yn.

117
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,530
So, this is the same
thing as y dot y.

118
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,980
I think I did this about ten or
twenty videos ago, but it's

119
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,630
always a good refresher.

120
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,170
So let's use this property
right here.

121
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,110
So these two dotted
with each other.

122
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,300
This is the same thing is taking
one of their transpose

123
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,390
times the other one.

124
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,420
So turn this from a vector,
vector dot product to a

125
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,580
matrix, matrix product.

126
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,930
So this is the same thing
as CX transpose, CX.

127
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,480
so you can view this as a 1 by n
matrix now, times the 1 by 1

128
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,110
matrix which is just the
column vector cx.

129
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,760
These are the same thing.

130
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,330
Now, we also know that A times
B transpose is the same thing

131
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,430
is B transpose, A transpose.

132
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,240
We saw that a long time ago.

133
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,710
So this thing right here is
going to be equal to X

134
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,890
transpose, C transpose.

135
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,580
Just switch the order and take
the transpose of each.

136
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,710
X transpose times C transpose.

137
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,170
And then you have
that times CX.

138
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,180
And now we know that C transpose
is the same thing is

139
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,430
as C inverse.

140
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,600
   

141
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,690
This is where we need the
orthogonality of the matrix C.

142
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,130
This is where we need it to be
a square matrix where all of

143
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,540
its columns are mutually
orthogonal

144
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,630
and they're all normal.

145
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,630
And so this thing is just
going to become

146
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,880
the identity matrix.

147
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,370
   

148
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,240
I can write the identity matrix
there, but that's just

149
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,010
going to disappear.

150
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,680
So this is going to be equal
to X transpose X.

151
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,190
X transpose is the same thing
as X dot X which is the same

152
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,840
thing as the length
of X squared.

153
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,130
So the length of CX squared is
the same thing as the length

154
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,140
of X squared.

155
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,770
So, that tells us that the
length of X, or the length of

156
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,700
CX, is the length of x because
both of these are going to be

157
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,280
positive quantities.

158
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,750
So I've shown you that
orthogonal matrices definitely

159
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,760
preserve length.

160
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,990
Let's see if they
preserve angles.

161
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,750
So we actually have
to define angles.

162
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,260
Throughout our mathematical
careers, we understood what

163
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,520
angles mean in kind
of r2 or r3.

164
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,440
But in linear algebra, we
like to be general.

165
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,710
And we defined an angle
using the dot product.

166
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,650
We use the law of cosines and we
took an analogy to kind of

167
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,640
triangle in r2.

168
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:07,760
But we defined an angle or we
said the dot product V dot W

169
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,680
is equal to the lengths, the
products of the lengths of

170
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,310
those two vectors times
the cosine of the

171
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,720
angle between them.

172
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,350
Or you could say that the cosine
of the angle between

173
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,780
two vectors, we defined as the
dot product of those two

174
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,710
vectors divided by the lengths
of those two vectors.

175
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,289
This was the definition so that
we can extend the idea of

176
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,240
an angle to an arbitrarily
high dimension to r

177
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,610
google if we had to.

178
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,860
So let's see if it preserves.

179
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,860
Let's see what the angle is if
we multiply these guys by C.

180
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,010
So, if we wanted-- let's
say our new angle.

181
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,370
So, cosine of angle C.

182
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,740
Once we perform our
transformation.

183
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,690
We're going to perform the
transformation on all of these

184
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,230
characters.

185
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:05,270
It's going to be CV dot CW over
the lengths of CV times

186
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,370
the lengths of CW.

187
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,490
Now we already know that
lengths are preserved.

188
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,930
We already know that the length
of CW and CV are just

189
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,920
going to be W and V.

190
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,780
We just proved that.

191
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,600
Let me write that.

192
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,950
So the cosine of theta C is
equal to CV dot CW over the

193
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,450
lengths of V times W.

194
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,670
Because we've already shown
that it preserves lengths.

195
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,040
We'll see what this
top part equals.

196
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,030
So we can just use the
general property.

197
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,330
The dot product is equal to the
transpose of one guy as

198
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,010
kind of a matrix times
the second guy.

199
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:47,370
So this is equal to CW
transpose times CV.

200
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,220
And all of that over
these lengths.

201
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,060
Like the W.

202
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,150
And this is going to be equal
to-- I'm going to write it

203
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,760
down here to have some space.

204
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,040
We can switch these guys and
take their transpose.

205
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,720
So, it's W transpose times
C transpose times CV.

206
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,440
All of that over their lengths,
the product of their

207
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,990
lengths V and W.

208
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,860
And this is the identity
matrix.

209
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,930
That's the identity matrix, and
this is going to be equal

210
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,880
to W transpose times V over the
products of their lengths.

211
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,300
   

212
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,560
And this is the same
thing as V dot W.

213
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,950
This is V dot W over
their lengths.

214
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,750
Which is cosine of theta.

215
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,170
So, you notice, by our
definition of an angle as the

216
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,040
dot product divided by the
vector lengths, when you

217
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,190
perform a transformation or you
can imagine a change of

218
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:54,750
basis either way, with an
orthogonal matrix C the angle

219
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,940
between the transformed vectors
does not change.

220
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,640
It is the same as the angle
between the vectors before

221
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,980
they were transformed.

222
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,340
Which is a really neat
thing to know.

223
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,640
The change of bases or
transformations with

224
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,970
orthogonal matrices don't
distort the vectors.

225
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,300
They might just kind of rotate
them around or shift them a

226
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,540
little bit, but it doesn't
change the

227
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,700
angles between them.

228
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,074
