1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,703
So let's review how we got to where we are right now.

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:06,283
In 1789 you have the Revolution in France.

3
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:11,016
This makes the French very proud, a lot of nationalistic pride.

4
00:00:11,016 --> 00:00:13,591
It also makes the rest of Europe a little worried.

5
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:17,851
They're all monarchies, they don't like this idea of overthrowing your kings.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:22,169
And so during this revolutionary period you have a series of wars with the rest of Europe.

7
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:25,968
Revolutionary France does, essentially, the French Revolutionary Wars.

8
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:30,033
And during that period Napoleon becomes quite famous as the French

9
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:33,431
and maybe the best European military commander.

10
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:37,337
So, now Napoleon is starting to become essentialy a hero in France.

11
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:40,555
And by 1799 he is able to come to power in a coup d'état

12
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:43,709
with a couple of other people and then he outmaneuvers them

13
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:46,986
and then by 1804 he becomes the emperor Napoleon

14
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:51,157
and in this whole period he is now trying to expand the Empire

15
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:55,304
so these were the Revolutionary Wars, and these you can consider right over here

16
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:59,903
are the Napoleonic Wars and the pic of the French Empire under Napoleon

17
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:02,595
happens in 1812 and the real downfall

18
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,608
if you ask my opinion and many other people

19
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:07,181
would be when he invaded Russia

20
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:10,145
that really decimated the French Grand Armée

21
00:01:10,145 --> 00:01:13,966
and we saw in the last video that by April 1814,

22
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:18,305
the 6th coalition was finally succesfull against Napoleon

23
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:21,251
and then he was exiled

24
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:28,109
to the island of Elba where we're taking up the story

25
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:32,687
he only hung out there for a little under 10 months

26
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:34,897
he was separated from his family

27
00:01:34,897 --> 00:01:38,262
so that even though he was put in charge of this litle island

28
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:40,499
it wouldn't have been what he wanted

29
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:42,819
and he obviously was an ambitious person on top of that

30
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,843
He caught wind of what was happening in France.

31
00:01:45,843 --> 00:01:48,239
Louis the 18th was there, the nobility returned

32
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,301
they weren't treating the old Army veterans well which made him suspect

33
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:55,983
that he may be able to retake control somehow

34
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,392
On top of that the French Empire

35
00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:01,502
was being shrunken back to its original boundaries

36
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:04,835
which made many people in France a lot less proud so Napoleon

37
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:06,924
started to sense that maybe he could do something.

38
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:09,994
On top of that, he caught wind that people might not

39
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:14,287
leave him in Elba because he is Napoleon and they were afraid that he may come back

40
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:17,284
so they might banish him to someplace even more remote,

41
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:21,122
or there might be some attempts to assassinate him

42
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:25,690
So with that in mind, being who he is, and being as creative as he is

43
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,307
he's able to somehow escape from Elba, he's able to get a boat,

44
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:33,021
land on the Southern shores of France. The French

45
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:36,847
authorities are able to catch wind of this, they send the military

46
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:39,718
to engage with him, this is the French military

47
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:40,963
to essentially confront

48
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:45,669
capture, kill Napoleon on the Southern shores of France

49
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:49,326
and when he sees them, he dismounts from the horse that he's got,

50
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:52,888
he walks up to them completely unarmed and he says,

51
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:55,970
"go ahead, shoot your emperor"

52
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,908
which is in my mind a fairly gutsy move to do

53
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:02,370
And they rally around him and he's able to actually take control

54
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,427
of the army that was sent to capture or kill him

55
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:08,472
and he starts marching to Paris

56
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:13,480
He starts marching to Paris, and Louis the 18th, the brave man that he is

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,661
catches wind of this and escapes

58
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:23,635
and so by March of 1815 Napoleon is able to retake control

59
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,804
of Paris and essentially, France.

60
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:29,587
And this is the beginning of what is known as the Hundred Days.

61
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:38,235
It actually is about a 111 days, but it doesn't sound that good.

62
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:43,036
So between March 1815, and July 1815

63
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:46,502
You can imagine, even before Napoleon was able to reach Paris

64
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:51,491
word got around about what was going on

65
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,513
That Napoleon was back, they didn't like it

66
00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:58,003
They essentially announced that they wouldn't stand by there

67
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:00,521
and that were going to form a new coalition to stop him

68
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:04,001
So Napoleon had two options once he gets in Paris,

69
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:08,003
He could essentially sit and wait

70
00:04:08,003 --> 00:04:13,554
wait for the combined forces of Europe to reorganize and then attack him.

71
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:17,388
Or he could go on the offensive,

72
00:04:17,388 --> 00:04:20,800
he could attack before they had a chance to fully regroup

73
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,842
you can imagine, he viewed this as being his best shot

74
00:04:24,842 --> 00:04:30,219
so he starts going after the combined forces of Great Britain

75
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:33,454
and Prussia in what is now Belgium

76
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:36,840
And over there is where he engaged in probably some of the most

77
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,224
decisive battles, the most decisive one was the battle of Waterloo

78
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:46,810
which is possibly one of the most famous battles in history

79
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,455
maybe due to also the Abba song about it

80
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:53,833
and that is where he met the Duke of Wellington on the British side,

81
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,778
and Blücher on the Prussian side

82
00:04:57,778 --> 00:05:01,274
Napoleon had seventy or eighty thousand troops

83
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:04,758
The other side had a hundred and twenty/thirty thousand troops

84
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:10,373
A extremely bloody battle, more than forty/fifty thousand people killed,

85
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:13,352
injured, missing on and on and on.

86
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:15,655
But in the end, Napoleon lost and many historians,

87
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:18,093
there's different reasons for why he lost

88
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:20,920
he actually did a pretty good job considering the scenario

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,315
the ground because of the weather was very muddy

90
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:26,702
and actually was not good for being on the offense

91
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,651
It was very good conditions for being on the defense

92
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:32,308
And you know, Napoleon was essentially trying to take out

93
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:37,155
these somewhat remnant armies before the Coalition,

94
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:43,745
the 7th Coalition essentially had a chance to fully get back to full force

95
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:46,930
But he loses at Waterloo, there are a few skirmishes after that,

96
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,761
but the French retreat back to Paris

97
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:53,312
At this point Napoleon sees the writing on the wall

98
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,602
He's not completely delusional

99
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:58,681
He sees that if they were able to, especially if the Prussians

100
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:00,294
are able to get him again, they might not let him live

101
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,645
They might really do something crazy

102
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,830
with him, so he surrenders himself to the British

103
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,415
And then they exile him to the isle of Saint Helena

104
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:14,343
which is one of the very remote island which is afraid to be exiled to

105
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:17,228
to begin with. An just to give a sense of how remote it is

106
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:19,208
This right over here

107
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,029
is the South West coast of Africa

108
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,690
This is Africa right over here.

109
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,072
Saint Helena is right out over here

110
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:29,164
Almost in the middle of the Atlantic

111
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:31,497
between Africa and South America

112
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:33,065
And that's where Napoleon would

113
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:34,841
live out the rest of his life

114
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:36,711
In a very uncomfortable situation

115
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:39,447
much worse than what he had going on in Elba

116
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:41,303
Separated from everyone else.

117
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:44,916
And then he dies in 1821

118
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,801
The official cause and this is what many historians

119
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:48,491
do believe actually happened

120
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,443
Is that he died of stomach cancer

121
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:54,397
Bu there are many theories that there might

122
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:56,848
have been some type of assassination

123
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,350
Some slow arsenic poisoning

124
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,917
There was a lot of arsenic in his tissues

125
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:04,508
His body was unusually well preserved after his death

126
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:04,509
That's one of the things arsenic does

127
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,794
Some people think that it might have been

128
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:10,538
an inadvertent arsenic poisoning

129
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:12,081
because of the environment that he was in

130
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,061
Of the conditions he might have been in,

131
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:14,224
of the paint in the walls,

132
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:18,778
but either way, he really lived roughly

133
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:21,117
throught the last six years

134
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:24,300
in pretty unpleasant conditions, and then

135
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,054
died of stomach cancer.

136
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:32,054
And that was essentially the final end of Napoleon
