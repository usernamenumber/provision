1
00:00:00,908 --> 00:00:03,160
(piano music)

2
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:06,645
So here we're looking at the great mannerist painting

3
00:00:06,737 --> 00:00:10,384
by Parmigianino, called "The Madonna of the Long Neck".

4
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:12,145
It's a fun painting.

5
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:12,999
It's a tall painting.

6
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,734
It's big. And Madonna is big.

7
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:18,418
She's big in funny places, too.

8
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,842
Her head is really tiny.

9
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:23,702
Compared to her hips, especially.

10
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:26,016
Right, she's got really wide hips.

11
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:29,531
She comes down on tiny little toes.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,259
It's always seemed to me like her body is in the shape of a diamond.

13
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:36,838
In a sense, she is a landscape on which Christ sits.

14
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:39,675
Christ himself is also quite large.

15
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:44,017
It's not just large. 
Look at the way he splays his body.

16
00:00:44,017 --> 00:00:47,790
This is crazy kind of torsion, with his arm falling,

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,956
almost dislocated from his shoulder.

18
00:00:49,956 --> 00:00:54,270
There is a precedent for that way his left arm falls down.

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,388
If you think about Michelangelo's "Pietà"...

20
00:00:57,388 --> 00:01:04,003
and Christ here as a child but perhaps echoing when Mary would hold Christ

21
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:06,532
in images like the "Pietà" when Christ is dead.

22
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:07,032
in images like the Pietà when Christ is dead.

23
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:11,586
In fact Christ looks asleep but there's also a way that he looks dead, too.

24
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:15,953
That reference in some ways explains the mass of her lap,

25
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:20,348
because in that sculpture Mary is quite substantial in order to be able

26
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:22,185
to support the dead body of her son.

27
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:25,861
It's clear when we're looking at this that we're not in the High Renaissance anymore.

28
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:26,793
So what happened?

29
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:29,100
Mannerism happened.

30
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,097
It's almost like the artists of the High Renaissance

31
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:32,879
had done everything that could be done.

32
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,498
They had perfected the naturalism that they had sought after

33
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:38,326
since the time of Giotto.

34
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:41,879
All of the illusionism that was at the service of the High Renaissance

35
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,751
is here being used to distort and transform the body.

36
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:49,662
It's not so much an ugly deformation as a kind of deformation that accentuates

37
00:01:49,662 --> 00:01:51,566
a kind of extreme elegance.

38
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:53,651
Exactly. It takes that ideal beauty and elegance

39
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:55,233
that was in the High Renaissance

40
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:57,719
and exaggerates it.

41
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,795
When we're thinking about Mannerism, we think about it as art taken from art,

42
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:04,002
instead of art from nature.

43
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:08,534
We think about the Renaissance as being based on observation of nature

44
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:09,950
and the natural world,

45
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,651
but when you look at this you think back to works of art

46
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:17,685
like Michelangelo's "Giuliano de' Medici" and that long neck.

47
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:19,934
Or back to the "Pietà".

48
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:23,119
That makes a lot of sense - the idea that this is art that is self-referential,

49
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:25,119
that is referring to its own traditions.

50
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:27,650
The respect for human anatomy,

51
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,384
portraying that naturalistically - that's not important to Mannerists.

52
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:35,237
In fact, I think there is a letter from one Mannerist artist to another Mannerist artist

53
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:36,962
where he says something like:

54
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,885
"Take a left hand and put it on a right arm."

55
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:43,248
It's like a willful complicating of the body.

56
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:47,320
...and setting up relationships between forms that are absurd.

57
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,030
Look at the relationship between the vase that's being held by the angel

58
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,147
in relationship to his/her thigh.

59
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:58,244
Look at the relationship between the massive Virgin Mary

60
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,468
and the prophet in the lower-right corner

61
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:04,219
that is presumably impossibly far away,

62
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:07,800
but somehow just a tiny figure at the feet of the Virgin.

63
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,285
And look at the way the Virgin holds her hand to her chest,

64
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:16,996
with these impossibly long, almost boneless fingers.

65
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:21,569
There's a way in which the gesture fails to mean anything.

66
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,970
It means gesture... and drama...

67
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,553
as opposed to a specific intent of the figure.

68
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:29,503
There's a kind of dramatizing here.

69
00:03:29,503 --> 00:03:30,349
For its own sake.

70
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:31,100
Exactly.

71
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,308
...with that kind of willful compression

72
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:36,579
that creates a sense of almost the impossible.

73
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,462
If you look at the columns on the right,

74
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:41,466
there's actually a colonnade that's so deep in space,

75
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,070
it's seen at such an oblique angle,

76
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,302
that it almost seems like a wall or a single column.

77
00:03:45,302 --> 00:03:47,130
If you look closely at the base,

78
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,834
you can see the alternating light and shadow

79
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,530
that passes between those columns.

80
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,112
There is ambiguity and that's a large part,

81
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:55,950
because that part of the painting is not finished.

82
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,068
So Mannerism seems to be this intense reaction

83
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:01,696
to the perfection of the High Renaissance.

84
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:04,551
You have the Renaissance building itself

85
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:06,917
into a kind of extreme naturalism,

86
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:11,731
and then it seems to be a flailing reaction against those strictures.

87
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:15,283
Or a sense that there was nowhere to go except to do something really different.

88
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:19,734
All these ideas were very much a part of a culture of the court.

89
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:24,846
It's important to recognize that there was a very specific, learned audience

90
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,120
for these kinds of paintings.

91
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,879
These were not made for the artists' own wild interests.

92
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,799
This was considered a kind of high intellectual game.

93
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:36,718
