1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:08,370
Let's say we need to evaluate
the limit as x approaches 0 of

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:20,340
2 sine of x minus sine of 2x,
all of that over x

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,210
minus sine of x.

4
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,820
Now, the first thing that I
always try to do when I first

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,160
see a limit problem is hey,
what happens if I just try to

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,890
evaluate this function
at x is equal to 0?

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,540
Maybe nothing crazy happens.

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,090
So let's just try it out.

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,340
If we try to do x equals
0, what happens?

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,580
We get 2 sine of 0, which is 0.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,190
Minus sine of 2 times 0.

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,960
Well, that's going to be sine
of 0 again, which is 0.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,510
So our numerator is
going to be equal to 0.

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,750
Sine of 0, that's 0.

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,440
And then we have another
sine of 0 there.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,340
That's another 0, so all 0's.

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,590
And our denominator,
we're going to have

18
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,590
a 0 minus sine of 0.

19
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,200
Well that's also going to be 0.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,340
But we have that indeterminate
form, we have that undefined

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,000
0/0 that we talked about
in the last video.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,720
So maybe we can use
L'Hopital's rule here.

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,910
In order to use L'Hopital's
rule then the limit as x

24
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,880
approaches 0 of the derivative
of this function over

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,880
the derivative of this
function needs to exist.

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,060
So let's just apply L'Hopital's
rule and let's just take the

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,470
derivative of each of these and
see if we can find the limit.

28
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,620
If we can, then that's going to
be the limit of this thing.

29
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,750
So this thing, assuming that it
exists, is going to be equal to

30
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,950
the limit as x approaches 0 of
the derivative of this

31
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,600
numerator up here.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,380
And so what's the derivative
of the numerator going to be?

33
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,315
I'll do it in a new color.

34
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:51,050
I'll do it in green.

35
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,370
Well, the derivative of 2
sine of x is 2 cosine of x.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,160
And then, minus-- well,
the derivative of sine

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,150
of 2x is 2 cosine of 2x.

38
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,440
So minus 2 cosine of 2x.

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,210
Just use the chain rule
there, derivative of

40
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,000
the inside is just 2.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,060
That's the 2 out there.

42
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,405
Derivative of the outside is
cosine of 2x, and we had that

43
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:16,790
negative number out there.

44
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,610
So that's the derivative of
our numerator, maria, and

45
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,500
what is the Derivative.

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,920
of our denominator?

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,430
Well, derivative of x is just
1, and derivative of sine

48
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,870
of x is just cosine of x.

49
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,920
So 1 minus cosine of x.

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,950
So let's try to
evaluate this limit.

51
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,150
What do we get?

52
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,180
If we put a 0 up here we're
going to get 2 times cosine

53
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,610
of 0, which is 2-- let
me write it like this.

54
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,760
So this is 2 times cosine
of 0, which is 1.

55
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,040
So it's 2 minus 2
cosine of 2 times 0.

56
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,480
Let me write it this way.

57
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,580
Actually, let me just
do it this way.

58
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,150
If we just straight up evaluate
the limit of the numerator and

59
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,270
the denominator, what
are we going to get?

60
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,710
We get 2 cosine of
0, which is 2.

61
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,760
Minus 2 times cosine of--
well, this 2 times 0 is

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,620
still going to be 0.

63
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,850
So minus 2 times cosine
of 0, which is 2.

64
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:15,620
All of that over 1 minus the
cosine of 0, which is 1.

65
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,295
So once again, we get 0/0.

66
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,500
So does this mean that
the limit doesn't exist?

67
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,420
No, it still might exist,
we might just want to do

68
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,830
L'Hopital's rule again.

69
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,610
Let me take the derivative
of that and put it over

70
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,490
the derivative of that.

71
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,610
And then take the limit and
maybe L'Hopital's rule

72
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,700
will help us on the
next stage.

73
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,610
So let's see if it
gets us anywhere.

74
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,030
So this should be equal to
the limit if L'Hopital's

75
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,840
rule applies here.

76
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,050
We're not 100% sure yet.

77
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,950
This should be equal to the
limit as x approaches 0 of the

78
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,690
derivative of that thing over
the derivative of that thing.

79
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,240
So what's the derivative
of 2 cosine of x?

80
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,485
Well, derivative of cosine
of x is negative sine of x.

81
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:04,920
So it's negative 2 sine of x.

82
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,320
And then derivative of cosine
of 2x is negative 2 sine of 2x.

83
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,660
So we're going to have this
negative cancel out with the

84
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,980
negative on the negative 2
and then a 2 times the 2.

85
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,990
So it's going to be
plus 4 sine of 2x.

86
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,790
Let me make sure I
did that right.

87
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,640
We have the minus 2 or the
negative 2 on the outside.

88
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,950
Derivative of cosine of 2x
is going to be 2 times

89
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,590
negative sine of x.

90
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,270
So the 2 times 2 is 4.

91
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,780
The negative sine of x
times-- the negative

92
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,060
right there's a plus.

93
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,180
You have a positive sine,
so it's the sine of 2x.

94
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,370
That's the numerator when
you take the derivative.

95
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,260
And the denominator-- this
is just an exercise in

96
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:45,830
taking derivatives.

97
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,350
What's the derivative
of the denominator?

98
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,310
Derivative of 1 is 0.

99
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,790
And derivative negative
cosine of x is just-- well,

100
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,900
that's just sine of x.

101
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,950
So let's take this limit.

102
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,050
So this is going to be equal
to-- well, immediately if I

103
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,810
take x is equal to 0 in the
denominator, I know that

104
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,190
sine of 0 is just 0.

105
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,870
Let's see what happens
in the numerator.

106
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,700
Negative 2 times sine of 0.

107
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,740
That's going to be 0.

108
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,880
And then plus 4 times
sine of 2 times 0.

109
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,570
Well, that's still sine of 0,
so that's still going to be 0.

110
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,210
So once again, we got
indeterminate form again.

111
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:19,900
Are we done?

112
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,820
Do we give up?

113
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,730
Do we say that L'Hopital's
rule didn't work?

114
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,550
No, because this could have
been our first limit problem.

115
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,750
And if this is our first limit
problem we say, hey, maybe we

116
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,680
could use L'Hopital's rule
here because we got an

117
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,600
indeterminate form.

118
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,990
Both the numerator and
the denominator approach

119
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,660
0 as x approaches 0.

120
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,110
So let's take the
derivatives again.

121
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,870
This will be equal to--
if the limit exist, the

122
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,730
limit as x approaches 0.

123
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,685
Let's take the derivative
of the numerator.

124
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:51,410
The derivative of negative
2 sine of x is negative

125
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,100
2 cosine of x.

126
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,850
And then, plus the
derivative of 4 sine of 2x.

127
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,520
Well, it's 2 times
4, which is 8.

128
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,330
Times cosine of 2x.

129
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,320
Derivative of sine of
2x is 2 cosine of 2x.

130
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,270
And that first 2 gets
multiplied by the

131
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,840
4 to get the 8.

132
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,030
And then the derivative of the
denominator, derivative of sine

133
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,140
of x is just cosine of x.

134
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,880
So let's evaluate
this character.

135
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,620
So it looks like we've made
some headway or maybe

136
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,160
L'Hopital's rule stop applying
here because we take the limit

137
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,610
as x approaches 0
of cosine of x.

138
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,650
That is 1.

139
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,220
So we're definitely not going
to get that indeterminate form,

140
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,120
that 0/0 on this iteration.

141
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,160
Let's see what happens
to the numerator.

142
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,950
We get negative 2
times cosine of 0.

143
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,530
Well that's just negative 2
because cosine of 0 is 1.

144
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,090
Plus 8 times cosine of 2x.

145
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,590
Well, if x is 0, so it's going
to be cosine of 0, which is 1.

146
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,690
So it's just going to be an 8.

147
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,990
So negative 2 plus 8.

148
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,500
Well this thing right here,
negative 2 plus 8 is 6.

149
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,720
6 over 1.

150
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,370
This whole thing is equal to 6.

151
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,850
So L'Hopital's rule-- it
applies to this last step.

152
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,630
If this was the problem we were
given and we said, hey, when we

153
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,530
tried to apply the limit we get
the limit as this numerator

154
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,010
approaches 0 is 0.

155
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,790
Limit as this denominator
approaches 0 is 0.

156
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,980
As the derivative of the
numerator over the derivative

157
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,600
of the denominator, that
exists and it equals 6.

158
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,590
So this limit must
be equal to 6.

159
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,740
Well if this limit is equal to
6, by the same argument, this

160
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,340
limit is also going
to be equal to 6.

161
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,850
And by the same argument,
this limit has got to

162
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,090
also be equal to 6.

163
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,770
And we're done.
