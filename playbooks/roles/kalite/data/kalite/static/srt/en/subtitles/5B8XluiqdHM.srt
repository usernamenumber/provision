1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,930
Many videos ago we introduced
the idea of a projection.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,210
And in that case we dealt more
particularly with projections

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,430
onto lines that went
through the origin.

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,950
So if we had some line-- let's
say L-- and let's say L is

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,090
equal to the span of
some vector v.

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,760
Or you could say, alternately,
that L is equal to the set of

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,290
all multiples of v, such that
the scalar factors are just

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,760
any real numbers.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,090
These are both representations
of lines that

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,440
go through the origin.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,840
We defined a projection of any
vector onto that line.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,820
Let me just draw it real
fast. So let me see,

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,160
we draw some axes.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,710
So that is my-- I want to draw
it a little bit straighter

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,790
than that-- that is my vertical
axis and that is my

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,210
horizontal axis.

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,920
Just like that and let's say
I have some line that goes

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
through the origin.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,950
Let's say-- that doesn't go
through the origin-- let's say

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,210
that that line right there
goes through the origin.

22
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,180
So that is L.

23
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,560
We knew visually that a
projection of some vector x

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,680
onto L-- so let's say that
that is a vector x.

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,570
Visually, if you were to draw--
if you have some light

26
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,790
coming straight down it would
be the shadow of x onto L.

27
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:30,220
So this right here, that right
there, was the projection onto

28
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,980
the line L of the vector x.

29
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,510
And we defined it
more formally.

30
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,670
We kind of took a
perpendicular.

31
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,850
We said that x minus the
projection of x onto L is

32
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,420
perpendicular to the line
L, or perpendicular to

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,210
everything-- orthogonal to
everything-- on the line L.

34
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,900
But this is how at least
I visualize this.

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,870
It's kind of the shadow as you
go down onto the line L.

36
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,890
And this was a special case,
in general, of projections.

37
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,580
You might notice that L is going
to be a valid subspace.

38
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,710
You could prove it
to yourself.

39
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,050
It contains the zero vector.

40
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,570
It goes through the origin.

41
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,680
It's closed under addition--
any member of it plus any

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,740
other member of it is going to
be another member of it.

43
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,480
It's closed under scalar
multiplication-- you can take

44
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,600
any member of it and scale it
up or down, it's still going

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,340
to be an L.

46
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,970
So this was a subspace
when we defined this.

47
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,380
And just as a bit of a reminder
of what it was, we

48
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,980
were able to figure out what
this projection is

49
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,960
for some line L.

50
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,060
If you have some spanning
vector, the projection onto

51
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,620
this line L that goes through
the origin of the vector x, we

52
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,330
figured out was x dot your
spanning vector for your line,

53
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,070
so x dot v over v dot v,
which is really just

54
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,290
the length of v squared.

55
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,270
So all of this was a number and
you want it to be in the

56
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,480
same direction as your line.

57
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,525
It's going to be another
vector in your line.

58
00:02:57,525 --> 00:03:00,930
So it's going to be times
the vector v.

59
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,800
So it's just going to be a
scaled up or scaled down

60
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,720
version of your spanning
vector.

61
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,890
Maybe your spanning vector
is like that.

62
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,470
And really any vector
in your line could

63
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,280
be a spanning vector.

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,440
Any vector other than
the zero vector.

65
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,340
Now that was a projection onto
a line which was a special

66
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,940
kind of subspace.

67
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,390
But now we're going to broaden
our definition of a projection

68
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,480
to any subspace.

69
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,180
So we already know that if-- let
me draw a little dividing

70
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,540
line to show that we're doing
something slightly different--

71
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:51,040
if v is a subspace of Rn then
v complement is also a

72
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,130
subspace space of Rn.

73
00:03:53,130 --> 00:04:00,550
So the orthogonal complement
of v is also a subspace.

74
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,770
And let's say we have some
members, or let me

75
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,870
write it this way.

76
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,740
If we have these two subspaces--
you have a

77
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,160
subspace and you have this
orthogonal complement-- we

78
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,670
already learned that if you
have any member of Rn-- so

79
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:17,079
let's say that x is a member
of our Rn-- then x can be

80
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:25,170
represented as a sum of a member
of v and a member of

81
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,710
the orthogonal complement
of v.

82
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,490
Where-- let me write this-- the
vector v is a member of

83
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:38,670
the subspace v and the vector
w is a member of the

84
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,780
orthogonal complement
of the subspace v.

85
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,450
Just like that.

86
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,390
We saw this several
videos ago.

87
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,500
We proved that this was true
for any member Rn.

88
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,650
Now given that, we can define
the projection of x onto the

89
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:05,930
subspace v as being equal to,
just the part of x -- these

90
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,530
are two orthogonal parts of x--
we define the projection

91
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,500
onto v as a part of x
that came from v.

92
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,730
It's equal to just
that vector v.

93
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:22,710
Alternately you could say that
the projection of x onto the

94
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,260
orthogonal complement of-- sorry
I wrote transpose-- the

95
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,960
orthogonal complement of v is
going to be equal to w.

96
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,590
So this piece right here
is a projection onto

97
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,980
the subspace v.

98
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,920
This piece right here is a
projection onto the orthogonal

99
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,710
complement of the subspace v.

100
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,000
Now what I want to do in this
video is show you that these

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,060
two definitions-- that this
definition right here which is

102
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,490
then in conjunction with this
right here-- this is the

103
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,800
equivalent to what we learned up
here if the subspace v that

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,450
we're dealing with is a line.

105
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,000
Because this was a
valid subspace.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,950
But not all subspaces are
going to be lines.

107
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,490
And to see this we can revisit
an example that we saw several

108
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,050
videos ago.

109
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,140
Several videos ago we had
this matrix here A.

110
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,580
This 2 by 2 matrix.

111
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,100
And then we had this other
vector b that was a member of

112
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,770
the column space of A.

113
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,810
We did this problem to show you
that the shortest solution

114
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,880
to this right here was a unique

115
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,030
member of the row space.

116
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,600
Hopefully that gets your memory
on track for this

117
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,050
problem when we first did it.

118
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,070
But let me graph it and show you
that for the solution of

119
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,110
that problem we could have
just as easily taken a

120
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,240
projection onto a subspace.

121
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,870
Let me graph everything
in this problem.

122
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,885
This might help you remember
also about the problem.

123
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:54,370
So let me draw my axes
just like that.

124
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,060
So the first thing we learned--
you know you could

125
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,785
solve this but I already
did this in a video.

126
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:00,135
I think it was two or three
videos ago-- the null space of

127
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:04,090
A, or all of the x's that
satisfy Ax is equal to zero,

128
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,630
is a span of the vector 2, 3.

129
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,230
So you go 2 to the right.

130
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,900
1, 2.

131
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,040
And then you go 3 up.

132
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,600
1, 2, 3.

133
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,590
And so it's the span
of this vector.

134
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,430
And so the span of that vector
is just all the points.

135
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,530
Well that vector specifies
that point.

136
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,570
But if you scale this vector
up and down you're going to

137
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,850
specify all of the point
on this line.

138
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,240
All the points on that line.

139
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,210
Let me draw it like that.

140
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,940
That's good enough.

141
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,750
It shouldn't curve down
like that at the end.

142
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,480
So let me draw that a
little straighter.

143
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,860
So this is the null space.

144
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,480
That is our null space of
that matrix right there.

145
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,730
And then the row space was a
span of the vector 3, minus 2.

146
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,830
You see that right here.

147
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,660
3, minus 2 is the first row.

148
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,350
This guy is just a multiple
of that one.

149
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,020
That's why we don't have
this guy right here

150
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,530
in the span as well.

151
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,520
And if we were to graph
it, 3, minus 2.

152
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,290
You go out 3, then
you go down 1, 2.

153
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,360
it would be the span of this
vector right there.

154
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,635
Let me draw it like that.

155
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:08,930
Now you take all of the scalar
multiples of that vector and

156
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,160
you put those vectors in
standard position.

157
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,220
They're going to specify, or
their tips are going to be on

158
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,535
points along this line
right there.

159
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:18,520
Along that line right there.

160
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,060
I'm trying to make sure I
draw them orthogonally.

161
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,940
So this right here
is the row space.

162
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,040
That right there is the row
space of A which is the same

163
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,410
thing as a column space
of A transpose.

164
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,929
And we know that these guys are
each other's orthogonal

165
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,880
complements.

166
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,150
We know, we've seen this in
multiple videos, that the null

167
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:43,580
space of A is the orthogonal
complement of the row space.

168
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,990
And we also know that the
orthogonal complement of the

169
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,280
null space is equal
to the row space.

170
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,830
Everything in this
is orthogonal to

171
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,910
everything in that.

172
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,470
Everything in that
is orthogonal to

173
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,340
everything in this.

174
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,310
You can see it here
in this graph.

175
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,720
That these two spaces, which are
represented by these lines

176
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,140
that go through the origin,
are orthogonal.

177
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,250
And it makes sense that any--
we said at really the

178
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,930
beginning of the video-- that
anything in R2 in this

179
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:16,860
situation, can be represented as
some sum of a unique member

180
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,470
of our row space and a unique
member of its orthogonal

181
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:19,970
complement.

182
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,330
Let's say I have that
point right there.

183
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,740
How could I represent it as a
sum of a member of this and a

184
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,010
member of that?

185
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,120
Well if I go along this guy, I
have this vector right here.

186
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,380
I have that vector right
there along that line.

187
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,860
And then I have this
vector right here.

188
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,780
If I were to shift it-- this is
drawn in standard position,

189
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,530
but I can draw a vector
wherever I want.

190
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,795
These lines are just all of the
vectors drawn in standard

191
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:50,780
position with their tails
at the origin.

192
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,910
But we learned, in really, I
think, the first or second

193
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,030
vector videos, that I can draw
them wherever I want.

194
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,500
So if I add this vector and that
vector, I can shift this

195
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,840
vector over and this vector
will be right there.

196
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,550
And there you have it.

197
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,690
I took an arbitrary point in R2
and I can represent it as a

198
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,900
sum of a member of my row space
and a member of the row

199
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,570
space's orthogonal complement
or the null space.

200
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,740
But just to review, what we
originally did in that problem

201
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,910
is we looked at the solution
set of this.

202
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,190
We said the solution set of
this looks like this.

203
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,000
It has a particular solution
plus members of your null

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,820
space, plus homogeneous
solutions.

205
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,870
We've seen that multiple
videos ago.

206
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,190
So 3, 0-- it looks
like this-- plus

207
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,540
members of the null space.

208
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,690
So your solution set is going
to be parallel to this but

209
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,970
shifted to the right by 3.

210
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,010
So it looks-- let me draw it a
little neater than that-- Let

211
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,040
me draw it like that.

212
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,960
And then it goes down like,
the second part I didn't

213
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,630
draw-- there you go.

214
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,840
Oh that's not good either.

215
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,620
Maybe I'm being too picky.

216
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,635
OK, so this is your
solution set.

217
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:58,480
   

218
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,740
And if you remember in that
video we said, hey there's

219
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,040
some member of this solution set
that is also a member of

220
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,280
our row space and that member of
the solution set that is a

221
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,560
member of our row space
is going to be

222
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,360
the shortest solution.

223
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,170
And we saw that.

224
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,910
You can see it visually
right here.

225
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,210
Right?

226
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,730
This vector right here.

227
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,160
It is in our row space.

228
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,990
It is a member of
our row space.

229
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,510
And it also specifies a point
on our solution set.

230
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,950
And you could see visually
that it's going to be the

231
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,610
shortest solution.

232
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,930
And one way you could think
about it is, this is the

233
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:35,470
projection-- let me pick a good,
different, new color--

234
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:40,140
any solution on our solution
set-- let me see right there--

235
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,370
let's say that that is some
arbitrary solution on our

236
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,620
solution set.

237
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,210
Right?

238
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,230
That's going to be a point in R2
and any point in R2 can be

239
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,320
represented as a sum of some
vector in our row space and

240
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,420
some vector in our null space.

241
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,560
And so if I have this vector
right here, how can I do that?

242
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,980
Well, I could represent it as
a sum of this guy right here

243
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,340
and then this vector
right here.

244
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,180
That vector right here.

245
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,350
And this vector right
here is clearly a

246
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,550
member of my null space.

247
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,540
I just shifted over.

248
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,040
This line is only when I draw
in standard position.

249
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,670
This vector right here-- I'm
just showing it heads to

250
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,430
tails-- if I add this member of
my row space to this member

251
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,970
of my null space, I get an
arbitrary solution to my

252
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,070
solution set.

253
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,330
And if you think about it, the
projection of my arbitrary

254
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:32,350
solution onto my row space will
be this guy right here.

255
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,680
And that just comes from our--
well there are two ways to

256
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,030
think about it-- we could say
that this is the solution

257
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,110
right here.

258
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,480
We could say our solution right
here is equal to some

259
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,595
member of my row space plus some
member of my null space.

260
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:48,820
This is the row space.

261
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,370
That is the null space.

262
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,050
And so by the definition of a
projection onto a subspace I

263
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,740
just gave you, we know that
the projection of this

264
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,510
solution onto my-- let me write
a little bit-- onto my

265
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:09,260
row space of my solution,
is just equal

266
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,330
to this first thing.

267
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,640
It's equal to the component of
it that's in my row space.

268
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,800
It's other component, we could
call it, is in the orthogonal

269
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,290
complement of my row space.

270
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,310
Or it's in my null space.

271
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,600
So this is just going to be
equal to the R vector.

272
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,220
Now, I want to show you that
that is essentially equal to

273
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,760
the definition that
we did before.

274
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,100
That this is completely
identical to the definition of

275
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,750
a projection onto a line because
in this case the

276
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,900
subspace is a line.

277
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,090
So let's find a solution set.

278
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,820
And the easiest one, the easiest
solution that we could

279
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,370
find is if we set C as
equal to 0 here.

280
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,973
We know that x equals 3, 0 is
one of these solutions.

281
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:52,000
So x equals 3, 0 looks
like that.

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,560
So we know x equals 3,
0 is a solution.

283
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,020
And what we want to do
is we want to find

284
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,530
the shortest solution.

285
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,450
Or we want to find the
projection of x

286
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,490
onto the row space.

287
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,930
Or if we wanted, we could also
think of it is a projection of

288
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,190
x onto this line.

289
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,240
This line is equal
to the row space.

290
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,130
So let's do that.

291
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,580
And I'm doing this to show you
that this definition of a

292
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,790
projection onto a subspace that
I've just introduced you

293
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,790
to in this video, it is
completely identical to the

294
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,500
definition, or it's not
identical, it's consistent

295
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,660
with the definition of a
projection onto a line.

296
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,400
Although this is more general
because a subspace doesn't

297
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,150
have to be a line.

298
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,270
But in this case it is a line.

299
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,350
So let's do that.

300
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:45,930
So the projection of the vector
3, 0 onto our row

301
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,610
space, which is a line so we
can use that formula, it is

302
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,320
equal to 3, 0 dot the
spanning vector for

303
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,950
our row space, right?

304
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,780
Dot the spanning vector
for our row space.

305
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,600
So it's 3, minus 2.

306
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,620
There's a bunch of spanning
vectors for your row space.

307
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,460
This is just the one we
happened to pick.

308
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:12,160
So dot 3, minus 2 all
over the spanning

309
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
vector dotted with itself.

310
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,410
3, minus 2 dot 3, minus 2.

311
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,770
And then this is just going to
be one big scalar and then we

312
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,220
want to multiply that-- or
essentially scale up-- our

313
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,140
actual spanning vector
by that.

314
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,070
So this is a projection of
this solution onto my row

315
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,010
space, which should give me
this vector right here.

316
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,250
Because we're just taking a
projection onto a line,

317
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,780
because a row space in this
subspace is a line.

318
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,380
And so we used the linear
projections that we first got

319
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,170
introduced to, I think, when I
first started doing linear

320
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,560
transformations.

321
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:53,640
So let's see this is 3 times
3 plus 0 times minus 2.

322
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,230
This right here is equal to 9.

323
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:03,090
This is 3 times 3 plus minus
2 times minus 2.

324
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,840
So that's 9 plus 4.

325
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,180
That's 13.

326
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,960
So it's 9/13 times this
vector right here.

327
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,160
So it's going to be equal
to 9/13 times the

328
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,230
vector 3, minus 2.

329
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:24,590
Which is equal to the vector
27/13 and then minus 18/13,

330
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,830
which is this vector
right here.

331
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,600
   

332
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,910
We got this exact answer when
we first did it, although we

333
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,230
just didn't use the projection
onto a line.

334
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,410
But now we see that this is
exactly consistent with what

335
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,500
we did before.

336
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,480
We just used the projection
onto a line.

337
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,560
And we see that this is
consistent with our new,

338
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,655
broader definition
of a projection.

339
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,510
   

340
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,040
Here we were able to do it
because we did it onto a line.

341
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:56,350
But here I'm calling a
projection onto any subspace.

342
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,800
We know how to do it if it's a
line, but so far I've just

343
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,310
kind of defined it onto
an arbitrary subspace.

344
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,300
But I haven't giving you a nice
mathematical, I guess, or

345
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,280
computational way to figure out
what this is going to be

346
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,010
if this isn't a line.

347
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,140
In fact, I haven't even shown
you when this is general,

348
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,770
whether this is definitely
a linear transformation.

349
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,849
We know that when you take the
projection onto the line it's

350
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:17,760
a linear transformation.

351
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,810
But I haven't shown you that
when we take a projection onto

352
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,490
an arbitrary subspace that it
is a linear projection.

353
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,630
I'll do that in the
next video.
