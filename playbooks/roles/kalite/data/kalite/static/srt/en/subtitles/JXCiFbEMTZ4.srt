1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,400
Welcome back, because I
was hitting against the

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,760
YouTube 10-minute limit.

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,110
But all I was saying
is, we said, you know,

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,260
cosine of minus a.

6
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,500
So I drew a right triangle with
a, and then I showed you minus

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,160
a, and I said, well, all of the
lengths are going to be the

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,520
same, but now the direction
of-- and we're kind of assuming

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,670
this is all on the unit circle.

10
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,410
If you don't remember the unit
circle, maybe you'll want to

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,000
rewatch the videos
we have on that.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,890
But I'm just showing you that
the cosine of minus a is equal

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,140
to this side over the
hypotenuse, and this hypotenuse

14
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,350
is the same as this
hypotenuse, right?

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,250
So cosine of minus a is
adjacent over this hypotenuse,

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,290
while cosine of a is adjacent
over this hypotenuse.

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,660
But it's the same thing, so
we know that cosine of minus

18
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,640
a is equal to cosine of a.

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,430
Actually, by definition, that
makes it a-- I don't want to

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,600
confuse you too much, but that
makes cosine an even function,

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,510
and I'll show you more.

22
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,160
Actually, I should do a
whole presentation on

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,030
even and odd functions.

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,490
Now, let's see what
sine of minus a is.

25
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:06,030
Sine of minus a is equal
to-- so this is minus a.

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,100
So it's this side, so it's the
minus length of-- let's call

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,480
this x, let's call this y,
and let's call this, well,

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,030
let's leave that h, right?

29
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,880
If that is x, this is y, this
length is y, then this length

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
right here is minus x, right?

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,890
So the sine of minus
a is minus x/h.

32
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,670
   

33
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,390
What's the sine of a?

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,740
Sine of a is equal to-- this is
a-- opposite or hypotenuse,

35
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,540
x over h, right?

36
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:50,030
So sine of minus a is equal to
minus 1 times x over h, right?

37
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,960
Or this is just the same thing
as-- I mean, we could multiply

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,350
both sides of this by minus
1, minus x over h, right?

39
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,670
So sine of minus a is
equal to minus sine of a.

40
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,100
   

41
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,700
So let me clear this out
and rewrite this identity.

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,030
And as you can see, all I'm
doing is I'm just playing

43
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,010
around with triangles and
showing you that, you know,

44
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,430
just using the basic SOHCAHTOA,
you can actually discover a

45
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,590
whole set of trigonometric
identities.

46
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,300
   

47
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,300
So let's clear that.

48
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,100
And, you know, it is
useful to memorize.

49
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,680
I normally don't advocate
memorizing, but it's helpful

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,890
just to do things quickly.

51
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,940
But I'd also advocate being
able to prove it to yourself,

52
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,150
so if you ever forget it, and
you don't have a cheat sheet

53
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,170
available, you can prove it,
and if you ever have to teach

54
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,130
it, then you'll be able to
explain the underlying

55
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,020
themes a little bit better.

56
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,490
So let's clear this.

57
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,895
Let's see if we can discover
some more trig identities.

58
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:52,710
   

59
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:58,890
So we know that-- so let's
see, if we have sine--

60
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,370
what's sine of a plus pi/2?

61
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,960
   

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,980
a plus pi/2.

63
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,600
Well, we could use our handy
sine of a plus b identity,

64
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,250
which we've already proved,
so we can use it now.

65
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,580
So that tells us that it's the
sine of a-- that equals the

66
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:34,810
sine of a times the cosine of
pi/2 plus the sine of pi/2.

67
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,270
And we're in
radians, of course.

68
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,570
This could have been 90
degrees instead, if we

69
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,140
wanted to be in degrees.

70
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:47,310
sine of pi/2 times the
cosine of a, right?

71
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,890
Well, this equals the sine of
-- what's cosine sign of pi/2?

72
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,040
Or cosine of 90 degrees?

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,160
Well, that's when we're on
the unit circle, we're

74
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,350
pointing straight up.

75
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,450
And so the x-coordinate is 0.

76
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,490
I could draw it out, but I
think-- you might want to draw

77
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,310
the unit circle and figure it
out for yourself, or if you

78
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,840
don't, do it on a calculator,
but you will learn

79
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,620
that it is 0.

80
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,620
The cosine of pi/2 is 0.

81
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,690
Plus sine of pi/2, for the same
reason, we're pointing straight

82
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,470
up on the unit circle, so the
y-coordinate, or the sine

83
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,710
coordinate, is 1, right on the
unit-- is essentially at the

84
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,400
point 0, 1 on the unit circle.

85
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,300
So sine of pi/2 is 1, and
then times cosine of a.

86
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,820
So sine of a times 0 is 0.

87
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,250
1 times cosine of a
is just cosine of a.

88
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,010
So we have a new,
useful trig identity.

89
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,060
   

90
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:48,100
Sine a plus pi/2 is
equal to cosine of a.

91
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,240
Fascinating!

92
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,880
So really, this is just telling
us that cosine of a is the same

93
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,100
thing as sine of a shifted.

94
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,030
So if we were to think of this
graphically, if we were to

95
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,070
think of, you know, if we were
to draw the graph, if you shift

96
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:09,150
the sine graph to the left by
pi/2, you get the cosine graph.

97
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,960
And if you haven't learned
about shifting yet,

98
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,670
don't worry about that.

99
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,930
Or you might want to actually
graph the two, and I

100
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,860
think you'll get a sense
of what I'm saying.

101
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,900
So let's do-- I don't know.

102
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,550
And another way to rewrite this
exact same thing is the sine of

103
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:36,090
a is equal to the cosine
of a minus pi/2, right?

104
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,640
Let's say I said that b
is a plus pi/2, right?

105
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,570
Let's say I said that b is
equal to a plus pi/2, then we

106
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,770
can say that this is b, and
then this would b minus pi/2.

107
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,770
I'm just switching
around variables.

108
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,520
I'm doing this in a much more
loosey-goosey fashion than I

109
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,840
normally do a lot of videos,
but I want to show you that a

110
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,560
lot of this trigonometry can
just be-- you know, it's

111
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,960
just kind of discovery.

112
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,490
What's sine of a minus b?

113
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,400
Well, that looks like a
new one, doesn't it?

114
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,930
Well, let's try to
figure it out.

115
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:26,080
Well, that equals sine of a
cosine of minus b plus sine

116
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,940
of minus b times the
cosine of a, right?

117
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,850
Well, what do we know about
the cosine of minus b?

118
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,970
Before I cleared the screen,
we just figured out that the

119
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,660
cosine of minus b, since it's
an even function, is the same

120
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,410
thing as the cosine of b.

121
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,810
So we can rewrite that
as that equals the

122
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,900
sine of a cosine of b.

123
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,600
And then what's the
sine of minus b?

124
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,380
Well, that's the same thing
as the minus sine of b.

125
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,120
That's what we just proved,
that the sine of minus

126
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,070
b, that this is equal
to minus sine of b.

127
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,340
You could draw the triangle and
the unit circle, if you don't

128
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,060
believe me, but we
just did that.

129
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,860
So we can say that that
is equal to minus sine

130
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,270
of b cosine of a.

131
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,010
Interesting!

132
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,580
I encourage you do the
same thing with the

133
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,120
cosine of a minus b.

134
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,650
These are all just, you know,
we're using one or two or three

135
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,480
trig identities together and
trying to come up

136
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,290
with new things.

137
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,250
And I think at this point,
we've literally gone over

138
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,260
everything, that almost every
trig identity you've seen in

139
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,100
your book, you should be
able to get there somehow,

140
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,270
just by keep on playing.

141
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,990
And obviously, all of these
identities, you can invert the

142
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,130
sines and the cosines and the
tangents, and you can get

143
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,840
identities for secant and
cotangent and cosecant

144
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,750
and keep playing around.

145
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,620
And I encourage you to do so.

146
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,120
And do it graphically.

147
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,860
Draw the triangles.

148
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,490
It's also interesting to
sometimes actually draw the

149
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,420
graph on the x-y plane of, say,
you know, cosine of x plus

150
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,680
pi/2, or sine of x plus
pi/2, or sine of x.

151
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,410
And I think in the future, I'll
do a video where I really

152
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,930
do explore all of that.

153
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,370
Well, I hope I haven't
thoroughly confused you.

154
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,170
I wanted to just kind of show
you that a lot of trig-- it

155
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,990
all comes from SOHCAHTOA and
playing around with SOHCAHTOA

156
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,390
and triangles, and you can
pretty much get-- you can

157
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,740
pretty much solve for
everything you learn

158
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,240
in trigonometry.

159
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,510
And if you don't have
SOHCAHTOA, at least the unit

160
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,795
circle definition, which is
actually better, because

161
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:30,580
it's more extensive.

162
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,230
But anyway, that's all for now.

163
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,732
See you soon.

164
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:34,300
