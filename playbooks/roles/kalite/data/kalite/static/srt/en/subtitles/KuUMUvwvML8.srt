1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,540
Let's say I have a
magnetic field

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,220
popping out of this video.

4
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,010
So these little brown circles
show us the tips of the

5
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,420
vectors popping out
of our screen.

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,800
And in that magnetic field I
have this wire, this off-white

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,760
colored wire.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,630
And sitting on that off-white
colored wire I have a charge

9
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,990
of charge Q.

10
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,250
Let me write down
the other stuff.

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,940
So this is the magnetic
field B coming out.

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,520
Let's say I were to take
this whole wire.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,390
And let's say that the wire
overlaps with the magnetic

14
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,820
field a distance of L.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,760
So let's say the magnetic
field stops

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,800
here and stops here.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,650
And let's say that this distance
right here, that

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,660
distance is L.

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,300
I drew it a little bit weird
but you get the idea.

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,750
From here to here is L.

21
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,090
I have this charge sitting on
some type of conductor that we

22
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,170
can consider a wire.

23
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,770
And the magnetic field is
pushing out of the page.

24
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,720
So in this current formation,
let's say I don't have any

25
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,050
voltage across this
wire or anything.

26
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,560
What's going to happen?

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,500
Well, if I just have a
stationary charge sitting in a

28
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,200
magnetic field, nothing really
is going to happen, right?

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,920
Because we know that the force
due to a magnetic field is

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,880
equal to the charge times the
cross product of the velocity

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,770
of the charge and the
magnetic field.

32
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,480
If this wires are stationary and
there's no voltage across

33
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,620
it, et cetera, et cetera, the
velocity of this charge is

34
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,660
going to be 0.

35
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,950
So if the velocity is 0, we know
that the magnitude of a

36
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,670
cross product is the
same thing as--.

37
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,960
So Q is, that's just a scalar
quantity-- so that's just Q--

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,390
times the magnitude of the
velocity times the magnitude

39
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,140
of B times sine theta.

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,430
And in these situations where
anything that's going on in

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,780
this plane is going to
be perpendicular to

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,720
this magnetic field--.

43
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,190
So the angle between the
magnetic field and any

44
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,220
velocity-- if there were any
within this plane-- would be

45
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,710
90 degrees.

46
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,640
So you wouldn't have to worry
about the sine theta too much.

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,039
But we see if the velocity is
0 or the speed is 0, the

48
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,850
magnitude of the velocity is 0,
that there's not going to

49
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,570
be any net force due to the
magnetic field on this charge.

50
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,950
And nothing interesting's
going to happen.

51
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,650
But let's do a little
experiment.

52
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,210
What happens if I were to move
this wire, if I were to shift

53
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,320
it to the left, with
the velocity V?

54
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,020
So I take this wire and I shift
it to the left with the

55
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,935
velocity V.

56
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:37,180
All right, so the whole wire
is shifting to the left.

57
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,270
Well, if the whole wire is
shifting to the left, this

58
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,070
charge is sitting on that wire,
so that charge is also

59
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,730
going to move to the left
with the velocity V.

60
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,870
And now things get
interesting.

61
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,090
The charge is moving to the left
with the velocity V, so

62
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,340
now we can apply the
first magnetism

63
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,460
formula that we learned.

64
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,630
We could apply this formula.

65
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,490
So what's going to happen
to this charge?

66
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,950
Well, the force of the charge
is going to be the charge

67
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,300
times the magnitude of the
velocity cross the magnetic

68
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,680
field vector.

69
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,820
So we know that there's going
to be some net force.

70
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,080
This is non-zero now.

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,510
And this is non-zero,
we're assuming.

72
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,670
And we're assuming the
charge is non-zero.

73
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,170
So what direction is the
force going to be in?

74
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,350
So let's do our right hand rule
on the cross product.

75
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,420
V cross B will give
us the direction.

76
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,740
So point your index finger in
the direction of the velocity.

77
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,330
I have to look at my own
hand to make sure

78
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,450
I'm doing it right.

79
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,230
So you point your index
finger in the

80
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,440
direction of the velocity.

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,540
Point your middle finger
in the direction of

82
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,510
the magnetic field.

83
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,440
The magnetic field is popping
out of the page, so your

84
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,630
middle finger is actually
going to be

85
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,710
popping out of the page.

86
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,430
Your next two fingers
are just going to do

87
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,190
something like that.

88
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,520
So you're kind of approximating
like you're

89
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,580
shooting a gun.

90
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,030
And then what's your
thumb going to do?

91
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,500
Your thumb is going to
point straight up.

92
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,660
This is the palm of--
that's your thumb.

93
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,710
This could be your nail,
fingernail, fingernail of your

94
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,160
thumb, fingernail of
your middle finger.

95
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,940
This is the direction
of the velocity.

96
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,120
Let me get a suitable color.

97
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,960
The velocity is that way.

98
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,180
The magnetic field is popping
out of the page.

99
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,100
So the force on the particle--
on this charged particle or on

100
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,480
this charge-- due to the
magnetic field is going to go

101
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,700
in the direction
of your thumb.

102
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,005
So the direction of the force
is in this direction.

103
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:28,300
   

104
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,210
So what's going to happen?

105
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,630
There's going to be a
net force in this

106
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,330
direction on the charge.

107
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,560
And the charge is going to
move upwards, right?

108
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,830
I mean, when you start having
a moving-- you could imagine

109
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,450
also that you had multiple
charges, right?

110
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,040
If you had multiple charges
here and you're moving the

111
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,670
whole wire, all of those
charges are going

112
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,910
to be moving upwards.

113
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,670
And what is another way to call
a bunch of moving charges

114
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,010
along a conductor?

115
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,015
Well, it's a current, depending
on how much charge

116
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:56,380
is moving per second.

117
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,940
So at least in very qualitative
terms, you see

118
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,810
that when you move a wire
through a magnetic field or

119
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,140
when you move a magnetic field
past a wire, right?

120
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,450
Because they're kind of the same
thing, it's all about the

121
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,530
relative motion.

122
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,200
But if you move a wire through
a magnetic field, it is

123
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,950
actually going to induce
a current in the wire.

124
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,600
It's going to induce the current
in the wire, and

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,990
actually this is how electric
generators are generated.

126
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,080
And I'll do a whole series of
videos on how you-- you know,

127
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,410
if you're using coal or steam or
hydropower, how that turns,

128
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,700
essentially that turns these
generators around and it

129
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,530
induces current.

130
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,070
And that's how we get
electricity from all of these

131
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,040
various energy sources
that essentially just

132
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,020
make turbines turn.

133
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,310
But anyway, let's go back
to what we were doing.

134
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,240
So let me ask you a question.

135
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,070
If this particle-- and this
all has a point-- if this

136
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,760
particle starts at
the beginning.

137
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,120
Let's say the particle
is right here.

138
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,880
So it starts right where the
magnetic field starts

139
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,210
affecting the wire.

140
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,610
And how much work is going to be
done on the particle by the

141
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,340
magnetic field?

142
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,080
Well, what's work?

143
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:13,120
Work is equal to force times
distance, where the force has

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,990
to be in the same direction
as the distance, right?

145
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,770
Force times distance, I
won't mess with the

146
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,430
vectors right now.

147
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,350
But they have to be in
the same direction.

148
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,160
So how much work is going to
be done on this particle?

149
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,950
So the work is going to be the
net force exerted on the

150
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,030
particle times the distance.

151
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,690
Well, this distance
is L, right?

152
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,320
We say, once a particle gets
here there's no magnetic field

153
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,710
up here, so the magnetic field
will stop acting on it.

154
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,990
So the total work done: Work,
which is equal to force times

155
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,480
distance, is equal to-- so the
net force is this up here.

156
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,840
Q-- and I'll leave
some space-- V

157
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,060
cross B times the distance.

158
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,190
And the distance right here is
just a scalar quantity, so we

159
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,830
could put it out front, right?

160
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,010
Q times L times V
cross B, right?

161
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,400
This is-- Q V cross B is the
force times the distance.

162
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,360
That's just the work done.

163
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,550
Now how much work is being
done per charge, right?

164
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,510
This is how much work is being
done on this charge.

165
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,430
But let's say there might have
been multiple charges, so we

166
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,050
just want to know how much
work is done per charge.

167
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,810
So work per charge.

168
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,990
We could divide both
sides by charge.

169
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,350
So work per charge is equal
to this per charge.

170
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:34,390
So it is equal to the distance
times the velocity that you're

171
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:41,260
pulling the wire to the left
with cross the magnetic field.

172
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,400
This is where it gets
interesting.

173
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,240
So what is work per charge?

174
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,370
The units of work are
energy, right?

175
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,230
Joules.

176
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,240
And charge, that's
in coulombs.

177
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,595
So what are joules
per coulomb?

178
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:59,220
   

179
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,170
This is equal to volts.

180
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,350
Volts are joules per coulomb.

181
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,680
So this particle, or these
charges, are going to start

182
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,260
moving in this direction as if
there is a voltage difference.

183
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,840
As if there is a potential
difference between this point

184
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,630
and this point.

185
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,460
As if this is the positive
voltage terminal and this is

186
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,230
the minus voltage terminal.

187
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,870
So there's actually going to be
a voltage-- or a perceived

188
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,970
voltage-- difference between
this point and this point that

189
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,080
will start making the
current flow.

190
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,870
Let's say you didn't even know
that there was a magnetic

191
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,220
field here.

192
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,310
You would just see this
current flowing.

193
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,530
You'd be like, oh well, there
has to be a voltage difference

194
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,789
there, right?

195
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,940
But when we're dealing with
this-- because when we talk

196
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,840
about voltages, that was like
a potential difference.

197
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,900
That something-- that a particle
or a charge has a

198
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,990
higher potential energy and
that's why it's moving.

199
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,100
But it's hard to-- at least for
these purposes-- say, well

200
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,670
you have a higher potential
energy here.

201
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,440
It's really being created
by the magnetic field.

202
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,450
So in this context, people
have said that instead of

203
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,790
saying that this is creating a
voltage difference between

204
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,580
this point and this point, if
the magnetic field on the

205
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,220
moving wire is causing that,
people say that it's creating

206
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,050
an electromotive force,
or an EMF.

207
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,510
But EMF, the units are still
joules per coulomb or volts.

208
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,350
And it really is-- in every way
when you're analyzing the

209
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,240
circuits-- still the same
thing as a potential

210
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,040
difference or as a voltage
difference.

211
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,430
But since it seems a little bit
more proactive, it seems

212
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,940
like this magnetic field is
actually impacting a force on

213
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,030
this wire that is causing
the current to move.

214
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,260
We call it EMF.

215
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,300
So we could say that the EMF,
the electromotive force-- or

216
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,720
the voltage across from here
to here, but they're really

217
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,750
the same thing-- is equal to
the distance of the wire

218
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:47,290
that's in the magnetic field
times the velocity-- that

219
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,430
you're pulling the wire in--
cross the magnetic field.

220
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,280
So let's say, I don't know,
let's just throw out a bunch

221
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,730
of numbers.

222
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,780
Let's say that the magnetic
field is-- I'll

223
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,640
make it easy-- 2 teslas.

224
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,340
My velocity to the left is
3 meters per second.

225
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,000
And let's-- just for fun-- let's
give this a little bit

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,360
of a resistance, just so we
can figure out something.

227
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,730
So let's say this resistance is,
I don't know, let's say it

228
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,140
is 6 ohms. There's a 6
ohm resistor here.

229
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,000
So the resistance of the wire
from here to here is 6 ohms.

230
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,970
All wires have some
resistance.

231
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,920
So first of all,
what's the EMF?

232
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,650
Oh, and let's say that
this total distance

233
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:32,420
right here is 12 meters.

234
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,370
So the EMF induced on the-- or
the electromotive force-- put

235
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,950
on to the wire by the magnetic
field is going to equal the

236
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,980
distance of the wire
in the magnetic

237
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,130
field-- 12 meters-- times--.

238
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,920
Well, when we're just taking
the cross product, we know

239
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,660
that the velocity is
perpendicular to

240
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,210
the magnetic field.

241
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,930
So we don't have to worry about
sine theta because theta

242
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,240
is already 90 degrees.

243
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,870
So we just have to worry
about the magnitudes.

244
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,540
So it's going to be 12 meters
times the velocity, which is 3

245
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,660
meters per second, times the
magnetic field, or the

246
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,140
magnitude of the magnetic
field, that's 2 teslas.

247
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,390
And so the EMF is 12
times 3 times 2.

248
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,160
12 times 6.

249
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,710
Which is 72.

250
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,770
You could say 72 volts, or
72 joules per coulomb.

251
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,780
And now you have that potential
difference, or that

252
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,640
EMF, across a 6 ohm
resistor, right?

253
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,420
So that, you just go back to
voltage is equal to IR.

254
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,640
Or you could write EMF
is equal to IR.

255
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,300
So EMF divided by resistance.

256
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,440
So if we take this EMF and we
divide it by the resistance--

257
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,430
divided by 6 ohms-- we get
the current, right?

258
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,160
EMF divided by resistance
is equal to current.

259
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,550
So you divide 72 volts or 72
joules per coulomb divided by

260
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,970
6 ohms. And then you get a
current going along this wire

261
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,590
right here, due to the EMF, due
to the magnetic field-- I

262
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,770
know it's very messy at this
point-- of 12 amperes.

263
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,450
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

264
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,490
I'll see you in the
next video.
