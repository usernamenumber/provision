1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,210
So just to get us back up to
speed where I left off in the

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,740
last video, we have a bank
sitting on an asset that it

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,550
maybe originally
paid $100 for.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,320
Let's say it has
$60 liability.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,490
$40 of equity.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,570
That's when they paid for it.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,230
So this is $100.

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,640
This is $60 of debt.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,490
And they had $40 of equity.

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,910
And these are the
toxic assets.

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,570
We're just assuming
a world that only

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,360
has one set of assets.

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,180
And the problem that we said
from the beginning of the

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,020
banking crisis is, that the
banks can't sell these assets

16
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,090
to pay off its liabilities,
its deposits, or other

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,880
debtors, for the price that
it wants to sell them at.

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,200
Because obviously if they sell
this for anything less than

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,170
$60, the bank is bankrupt.

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,220
So this is the bank, and it
wants to sell for greater

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,860
than-- I'll say $60.

22
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,220
I won't say 60 cents
on the dollar, but

23
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,050
it's the same thing.

24
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,560
Wants to sell for greater
than $60.

25
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,080
While the market is willing
to pay less than

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,230
$30 for this asset.

27
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,280
And obviously if the bank went
and sold this at the market

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,220
price and only got
$30 for this.

29
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,540
If this whole thing became
$30, then the liabilities

30
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,950
become worth much more than
the asset, than the $30.

31
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,550
And the bank is bankrupt.

32
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,020
And so as I outlined at the
end of the last video, the

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,180
current incarnation is for,
you have a public private

34
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,160
partnership.

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,072
Let me draw their equity.

36
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:31,940
And let me try to draw it
a little bit better.

37
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,980
So let's say that you have--
and I'll do the number

38
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,100
slightly different--
so you have $5.

39
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,770
   

40
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,060
from a private investor.

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,360
This is a review of
the last video.

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,600
You have $5 from the Treasury.

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
These are both the
equity investors.

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,770
And then you have $50 borrowed
from the Fed.

45
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,330
And I'm doing this a little
bit differently, so the

46
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,160
numbers match up exactly
with what they're going

47
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,150
to pay for the asset.

48
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,170
So you have $50.

49
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:02,680
Let me see.

50
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,740
So if that's $10, $50 would
be something that looks

51
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,360
something like that.

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,030
So you have $50 that you borrow

53
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,264
from the Federal Reserve.

54
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,050
   

55
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,010
And so, this entity will
have $60 here.

56
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,545
When it gets capitalized.

57
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:19,795
We'll do that in green.

58
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:26,340
   

59
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,040
And what they can now
do, is they can give

60
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,530
that $60 to the banks.

61
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,200
Essentially paying a price that
the banks are willing to

62
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,480
part with the assets for.

63
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,410
And then the banks are going
to give them the assets.

64
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,530
So now the bank has $60 of cash
that it can use to keep

65
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,590
its liabilities liquid.

66
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,620
And now this entity right
here has a toxic asset,

67
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,026
we could call it.

68
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:51,340
And I addressed it in the last
video, you know, why is the

69
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,110
investor doing this?

70
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,100
Because they share

71
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,930
disproportionately in the upside.

72
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,860
They paid $60 for this thing.

73
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,990
And just as a real quick review,
if this thing ends up

74
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:04,590
being worth-- let's say it
ends up being worth $100.

75
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,800
Then they owe $50 to the
Federal Reserve.

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,490
That's this loan right here.

77
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,530
To the Fed.

78
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,670
And then they split the equity
with the Treasury.

79
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,400
So, how much equity?

80
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,230
There's a total of $50
of equity left.

81
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,490
$25 for the Treasury.

82
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,040
$25 for them, for the
private investor.

83
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,280
So their initial investment was
$5, and it went to $25.

84
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,880
That's awesome.

85
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,630
Five times your money.

86
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,500
And then in the down case.

87
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,530
What's their down case?

88
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,370
Their down case is-- let's
say that toxic asset

89
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,480
really is worth $30.

90
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,750
Let me draw that.

91
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,512
And this is a review
of the last video.

92
00:03:43,512 --> 00:03:45,610
But it's important, because
it really bears

93
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,780
into what might happen.

94
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,700
So let's say that this
is optimistic.

95
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,576
This is pessimistic.

96
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:57,960
So let's say these assets
end up being worth $30.

97
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,930
Then you have this $50
loan from the Fed.

98
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,650
And you have no equity
left over.

99
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,540
And the Fed essentially
is left taking

100
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,890
a loss on its loan.

101
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,370
But the private investor, since
there's no equity, is

102
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,370
going to be left with zero.

103
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,630
So you went from $5 to zero.

104
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,550
But this is still a pretty
good risk/reward.

105
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,670
Depending on how you weight
these probabilities.

106
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,630
But a lot of people, if you
thought that there's an equal

107
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,950
chance of this and this
happening, you

108
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,010
would take this bet.

109
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,090
If you had a 50% chance of
making five times your money,

110
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,370
and only a 50% chance of
losing your money, the

111
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,030
expected value here is, it would
be 0.5 times 25 plus 0.5

112
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,240
times zero.

113
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,170
It would be a $12
expected value.

114
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,130
So I would pay $5 for something
that has a $12

115
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,670
expected value.

116
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,390
That's a great return.

117
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,220
You're making 140%
on your money.

118
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,710
You don't see returns
like that every day.

119
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,840
Unfortunately, the probability
of these two things happening

120
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,400
aren't equally likely.

121
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,160
Because obviously right now, the
market's willing to only

122
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,650
pay $30 for these things.

123
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,580
The market, if they thought that
there was any chance that

124
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,630
these things are worth more than
$60, any chance, they'd

125
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,670
be trading at higher than $30.

126
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,670
So given where the current
market is, before government

127
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,410
intervention, clearly no-one
thinks that there's a really

128
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,000
good chance of them
being worth $60.

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,830
There's a much higher
probability of this scenario

130
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,990
occurring than this.

131
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,900
And you could do
a spreadsheet.

132
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,400
And you could weight
the probabilities.

133
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,450
And if you make this probability
high enough

134
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,840
relative to this one, then of
course the expected value is

135
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,980
still going to be
less than $5.

136
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,580
You're still expected
to lose money.

137
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,540
And so you might say, well,
who would do that?

138
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,840
Even though Paul Krugman is out
there saying, you know,

139
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,120
this is one of those heads
I win, tails you

140
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,970
lose type of scenarios.

141
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,100
And that is true.

142
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,030
In the positive scenario, the
private investor makes the

143
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,440
bulk of the money, alongside
the Treasury.

144
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,120
With the Fed just getting a very
low interest rate back on

145
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,010
this money.

146
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,520
While in the negative scenario,
most of the hit is

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,940
going to be taken by the Federal
Reserve with their

148
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,870
loan, and then the Treasury
who's an equity investor

149
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,530
alongside them.

150
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,040
So that is one of these
things that Paul

151
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,340
Krugman is talking about.

152
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,960
But I'd say, that even if that,
an intelligent investor,

153
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,120
just because the risk soon.
reward is disproportionately

154
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,100
weighted to the other guy, they
still wouldn't want to

155
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,910
invest it, if this is the
more likely scenario.

156
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,320
So the question is, who
is going to do this?

157
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,770
And this is what I mentioned
in the last

158
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,860
video, could be troubling.

159
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,560
The obvious thing is that the
banks might want to buy it

160
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,810
from themselves.

161
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,510
So let me redraw everything.

162
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,300
Because this is an important
point to make.

163
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,050
And frankly, I don't
know how you can

164
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,830
prevent this from happening.

165
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,480
If this version of Geithner's
plan ends up passing.

166
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,800
So this is the bank's
balance sheet.

167
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,480
Kind of their before
balance sheet.

168
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,300
   

169
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,330
They paid $100 for
these assets.

170
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,750
They owe $60.

171
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,390
All liabilities, deposits,
whatever.

172
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,460
And originally they have
$40 in equity.

173
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,790
What the bank does is it takes
some extra money, and they

174
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,940
could raise equity,
or for all we know

175
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,760
they could raise money.

176
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,200
I mean, the government is giving
them loans right now.

177
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,910
This isn't fiction.

178
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:21,200
So what you do is let's say
you borrow $7 from the

179
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,550
government.

180
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,360
And this is happening.

181
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,500
I mean, the government is giving
loans to these major

182
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,950
banks, to Citibank and Bank
of America, et cetera.

183
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,960
And they'll get $7 of
cash right here.

184
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,460
   

185
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,270
Now what the bank does is, they
create a separate entity.

186
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,500
They can call it whatever
they want.

187
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,920
They could put it in a hedge
fund to do this.

188
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,850
I mean, banks are great.

189
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,780
Special purpose entities
happen all the time.

190
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,530
And there's nothing to stop a
bank from putting this $7 into

191
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,780
another entity.

192
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,200
   

193
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,820
Another special purpose
entity.

194
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,330
Where the bank essentially
owns the equity.

195
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,280
And this cash went to that.

196
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,800
And then taking this $7
and using this to

197
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,830
participate in the plan.

198
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,060
In this new Geithner plan.

199
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,550
So the bank takes that $7 that
they essentially might have

200
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,170
just borrowed from
the government.

201
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,060
Participates in the plan as
the private investor.

202
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,440
And I'll put that in quotes.

203
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,660
And they could put a bunch of
layers here and obfuscate it.

204
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,760
Or even get one of their hedge
fund clients to do it, by

205
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,480
giving them good terms
on something else.

206
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,810
I mean, there's a million
and one ways you

207
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,810
could set this up.

208
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,610
And that's why I think it's
impossible to legislate

209
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,059
around, or legislate
to prevent it.

210
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,309
So they do that there.

211
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:40,090
The Treasury will participate
side by side

212
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,520
as an equity investor.

213
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,660
And then they'll borrow $86
from the Federal Reserve.

214
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,490
   

215
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,990
That's from the Treasury.

216
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,010
And now the bank is

217
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,610
essentially the private investor.

218
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,100
They're controlling
this entity here.

219
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,860
They're controlling entities
that control that entity.

220
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,430
It doesn't matter.

221
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,110
But they essentially set the
price for which this entity is

222
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,060
going to pay for
its own assets.

223
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,060
So they could pay $100
for this thing.

224
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,650
Even though everyone knows that
these things are worth

225
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,070
nowhere near $100.

226
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,600
So they pay $100 for this.

227
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,020
Take it off their
balance sheet.

228
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,070
And then they're sitting
with $100 cash.

229
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,740
And this is sitting there
with a toxic asset.

230
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,200
And why would a bank do this?

231
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,040
Well, think about it.

232
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,010
In this reality, before any of
this happened, the banks had

233
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,290
100% exposure to these
toxic assets.

234
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,420
It had this whole thing right
here, it had exposure to.

235
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,620
And for all we know, they're
only worth $30.

236
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,400
But the bank never wanted
to accept that reality.

237
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,030
While in this reality,
the bank only has

238
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,480
$7 exposure to it.

239
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,390
So even if this thing ends up
blowing up, who's going to

240
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,350
take the loss?

241
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,890
The bank's just going to
take a $7 loss here.

242
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,390
And then the rest of the loss
is going to go to the

243
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,810
taxpayer; the Treasury and
the Federal Reserve.

244
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,260
So this is an awesome
situation.

245
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,730
Because in this reality when
there was a hit, if this was

246
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,270
worth $30 the bank would
have to take a $70 hit.

247
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,690
While in this reality, if this
toxic asset now is only worth

248
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,650
$30, the bank's only going
to take a $7 hit.

249
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,210
And the bank is going
to stay solvent.

250
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,220
So this investment right here
is going to be wiped out.

251
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,640
But still, the bank
got $100 in cash.

252
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,080
So my fear is, and frankly
since there's nothing to

253
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,440
prevent it, it's almost a
self-fulfilling prophecy

254
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,830
that's going to happen.

255
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,420
You have this big question
mark, why would a private

256
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,660
investor ever participate
in this?

257
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,280
Even if the government is kind
of giving you more of the

258
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,050
upside than the downside.

259
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,510
You wouldn't participate in
it if you thought that the

260
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,520
downside scenario
is more likely.

261
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,520
But you would participate in
it, if you were the actual

262
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,070
seller of the security.

263
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,090
Because if you are the seller
of the security, you are

264
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:54,700
Citibank, you're going from
100% exposure to only 7%

265
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,960
exposure, and you're going
to be staying solvent.

266
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,710
But the net effect of this is
that the Treasury and the

267
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,970
Federal Reserve, they got
$100 for something.

268
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,920
Or I guess, if you take
out the $7, they

269
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,310
essentially got $93.

270
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,810
Because they had to spend $7
to make this thing happen.

271
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,100
But they got $100.

272
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:19,990
So they got $93 for something
that's really worth $30.

273
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,560
So the difference, the $63, it
essentially would be a check

274
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,470
that's being written from the
U.S. taxpayer to these banks.

275
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,050
And in the magnitude that
we're talking about, it

276
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,650
wouldn't be a $63 check.

277
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,020
It would be a $630
billion check.

278
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,220
So to me, this would be kind
of the biggest travesty of

279
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,190
capitalism.

280
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,870
And it would be a sad day.

281
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,900
It would frankly just make the
AIG bonuses look trivial.

282
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,580
The right answer is, you take
that $630 billion, make the

283
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,580
banks wipe out their
shareholders, and then you

284
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,430
recapitalize the banks
with the money.

285
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,920
And then you start, instead of
writing the $63 or the $630

286
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,280
billion check directly to
the management and the

287
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,370
shareholders who got us into
the mess, you essentially

288
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,930
recapitalize the new banks.

289
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,600
And I've written a paper
about that, and

290
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,580
there's a new bank plan.

291
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,270
And distribute the shares
to the American people.

292
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,230
And you get the same effect
without this hugely negative

293
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,400
repercussion of providing a huge
wealth transfer to the

294
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,340
very same people who
got us in the mess.

295
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,590
Anyway, I hope people kind of
get on this story, because

296
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,260
it's got me pretty troubled.

297
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,200
Anyway, see you

298
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,412
