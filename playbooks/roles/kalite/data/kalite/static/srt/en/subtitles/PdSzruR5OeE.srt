1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,560
Most of what we do early on
when we first learn about

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,720
calculus is to use limits.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,440
We use limits to figure out
derivatives of functions.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,720
   

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,800
In fact, the definition
of a derivative uses

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,120
the notion of a limit.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,030
It's a slope around the point
as we take the limit of

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,390
points closer and closer
to the point in question.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,110
And you've seen that many,
many, many times over.

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,790
In this video I guess we're
going to do it in the

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,630
opposite direction.

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:39,130
We're going to use derivatives
to figure out limits.

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,360
And in particular, limits that
end up in indeterminate form.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,550
And when I say by indeterminate
form I mean that when we just

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,550
take the limit as it is, we end
up with something like 0/0, or

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,450
infinity over infinity, or
negative infinity over

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,870
infinity, or maybe negative
infinity over negative

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,330
infinity, or positive infinity
over negative infinity.

20
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,190
All of these are indeterminate,
undefined forms.

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,290
And to do that we're going
to use l'Hopital's rule.

22
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:17,730
   

23
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,490
And in this video I'm just
going to show you what

24
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,010
l'Hoptial's rule says and how
to apply it because it's fairly

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,480
straightforward, and it's
actually a very useful tool

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,510
sometimes if you're in some
type of a math competition and

27
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,270
they ask you to find a
difficult limit that when you

28
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,310
just plug the numbers in you
get something like this.

29
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,270
L'Hopital's rule is normally
what they are testing you for.

30
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,290
And in a future video I might
prove it, but that gets a

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:40,975
little bit more involved.

32
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,870
The application is actually
reasonably straightforward.

33
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,780
So what l'Hopital's rule tells
us that if we have-- and I'll

34
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,940
do it in abstract form first,
but I think when I show you

35
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,080
the example it will
all be made clear.

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:11,050
That if the limit as x roaches
c of f of x is equal to 0, and

37
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:20,100
the limit as x approaches c of
g of x is equal to 0, and-- and

38
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:30,620
this is another and-- and the
limit as x approaches c of f

39
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:38,160
prime of x over g prime of
x exists and it equals L.

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,600
then-- so all of these
conditions have to be met.

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,050
This is the indeterminate
form of 0/0, so this

42
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,560
is the first case.

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:55,380
Then we can say that the
limit as x approaches c of

44
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:03,070
f of x over g of x is also
going to be equal to L.

45
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,810
So this might seem a little bit
bizarre to you right now, and

46
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,220
I'm actually going to write the
other case, and then

47
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,750
I'll do an example.

48
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,710
We'll do multiple examples
and the examples are going

49
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,580
to make it all clear.

50
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,040
So this is the first case and
the example we're going to

51
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,650
do is actually going to be
an example of this case.

52
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:24,390
Now the other case is if the
limit as x approaches c of f of

53
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:32,960
x is equal to positive or
negative infinity, and the

54
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,470
limit as x approaches c of g of
x is equal to positive or

55
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:46,280
negative infinity, and the
limit of I guess you could say

56
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,220
the quotient of the derivatives
exists, and the limit as x

57
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,200
approaches c of f prime of x
over g prime of x

58
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,410
is equal to L.

59
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,860
Then we can make this
same statement again.

60
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,070
Let me just copy that out.

61
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,220
Edit, copy, and then
let me paste it.

62
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,450
So in either of these two
situations just to kind of make

63
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,520
sure you understand what you're
looking at, this is the

64
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,300
situation where if you just
tried to evaluate this limit

65
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,880
right here you're going to
get f of c, which is 0.

66
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,990
Or the limit as x approaches c
of f of x over the limit as

67
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,480
x approaches c of g of x.

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,550
That's going to give you 0/0.

69
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,440
And so you say, hey, I don't
know what that limit is?

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,600
But this says, well, look.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,440
If this limit exists, I could
take the derivative of each

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,020
of these functions and then
try to evaluate that limit.

73
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,220
And if I get a number, if that
exists, then they're going

74
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,980
to be the same limit.

75
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,710
This is a situation where when
we take the limit we get

76
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,060
infinity over infinity, or
negative infinity or positive

77
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,070
infinity over positive
or negative infinity.

78
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,030
So these are the two
indeterminate forms.

79
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,410
And to make it all clear let
me just show you an example

80
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,610
because I think this will make
things a lot more clear.

81
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,910
So let's say we are trying
to find the limit-- I'll

82
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,610
do this in a new color.

83
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,830
Let me do it in this
purplish color.

84
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,420
Let's say we wanted to find
the limit as x approaches

85
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,160
0 of sine of x over x.

86
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,430
Now if we just view this, if we
just try to evaluate it at 0 or

87
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,410
take the limit as we approach 0
in each of these functions,

88
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,180
we're going to get something
that looks like 0/0.

89
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,370
Sine of 0 is 0.

90
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,620
Or the limit as x approaches
0 of sine of x is 0.

91
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,120
And obviously, as x approaches
0 of x, that's also

92
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,140
going to be 0.

93
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,100
So this is our
indeterminate form.

94
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,180
And if you want to think about
it, this is our f of x, that

95
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,240
f of x right there
is the sine of x.

96
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,510
And our g of x, this g of
x right there for this

97
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,070
first case, is the x.

98
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:07,170
g of x is equal to x and f
of x is equal to sine of x.

99
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,130
And notice, well, we definitely
know that this meets the

100
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,520
first two constraints.

101
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,970
The limit as x, and in
this case, c is 0.

102
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,540
The limit as x approaches 0 of
sine of sine of x is 0, and

103
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,030
the limit as x approaches
0 of x is also equal to 0.

104
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,180
So we get our
indeterminate form.

105
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,340
So let's see, at least, whether
this limit even exists.

106
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,100
If we take the derivative of f
of x and we put that over the

107
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,900
derivative of g of x, and take
the limit as x approaches 0

108
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,400
in this case, that's our c.

109
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,530
Let's see if this limit exists.

110
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,600
So I'll do that in the blue.

111
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,160
So let me write the derivatives
of the two functions.

112
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,720
So f prime of x.

113
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,590
If f of x is sine of x,
what's f prime of x?

114
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,480
Well, it's just cosine of x.

115
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,390
You've learned that many times.

116
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,215
And if g of x is x,
what is g prime of x?

117
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:02,150
That's super easy.

118
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,280
The derivative of x is just 1.

119
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:13,690
Let's try to take the limit as
x approaches 0 of f prime of x

120
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,000
over g prime of x-- over
their derivatives.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,390
So that's going to be the
limit as x approaches 0

122
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:25,620
of cosine of x over 1.

123
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,650
I wrote that 1 a
little strange.

124
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,170
And this is pretty
straightforward.

125
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:30,990
What is this going to be?

126
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,610
Well, as x approaches 0
of cosine of x, that's

127
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,290
going to be equal to 1.

128
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,320
And obviously, the limit as
x approaches 0 of 1, that's

129
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,900
also going to be equal to 1.

130
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,470
So in this situation we just
saw that the limit as x

131
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,820
approaches-- our c
in this case is 0.

132
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,590
As x approaches 0 of f
prime of x over g prime

133
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,240
of x is equal to 1.

134
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,060
This limit exists and it
equals 1, so we've met

135
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,580
all of the conditions.

136
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,500
This is the case
we're dealing with.

137
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,700
Limit as x approaches 0 of
sine of x is equal to 0.

138
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,650
Limit as z approaches 0
of x is also equal to 0.

139
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,500
The limit of the derivative of
sine of x over the derivative

140
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,490
of x, which is cosine of x over
1-- we found this

141
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,000
to be equal to 1.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,610
All of these top conditions
are met, so then we know

143
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,480
this must be the case.

144
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:34,500
That the limit as x approaches
0 of sine of x over x

145
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,690
must be equal to 1.

146
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,510
It must be the same limit as
this value right here where we

147
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,120
take the derivative of the
f of x and of the g of x.

148
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,430
I'll do more examples in the
next few videos and I think

149
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,760
it'll make it a lot
more concrete.

150
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,000
