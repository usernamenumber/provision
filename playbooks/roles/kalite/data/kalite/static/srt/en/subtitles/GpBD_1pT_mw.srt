An emulsion is a uniform mixture of oily substances and watery substances

2
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,602
which usually don't mix.

3
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:17,586
To take the most common example of salad dressing,

4
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:23,087
ah, you'll know that olive oil and vinegar don't mix unless you add the egg to it

5
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:26,234
then you can froth it up and make a uniform mixture of the two.

6
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,665
Well, in paint, emulsions work the same way

7
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:34,068
in fact, one of the same emulsifiers is used and that is egg yolk.

8
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:37,434
de Kooning among others would add egg to his oil paint

9
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:40,248
which is typically compatible with the solvent, turpentine

10
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,481
but after adding egg yolk, it was compatible with water as well.

11
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:47,574
By adding water, he then could froth up the paint to get a very

12
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:50,371
interesting texture, as well as quality of that paint.
