1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,625
A statistician for a basketball team tracked the number of points that each of the twelve players on the team had in one game

2
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:14,062
and then made a STEM and LEAF plot to show the data, and sometimes it's called a stem plot.

3
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:19,862
How many points did the team score, and when you first look at this plot right over here, it seems a little hard to understand.

4
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:23,831
Under stem, you have 0, 1, 2. Under leaf, you have all of these digits here.

5
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:29,212
How does this relate to the number of points each student or each player actually scored?

6
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:36,046
And the way to interpret a stem and leaf plot is the leafs contain -- at least the way this statistician used it --

7
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:43,166
the leaf contains the smallest digit, or the ones digit, in the number of points that each player scored,

8
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:49,200
and the stem contains the tens digit. And usually, the leaf will contain the rightmost digit,

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,000
or the ones digit, and then the stem will contain all of the other digits.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,333
And what's useful about this is it gives kind of a distribution of where the players were.

11
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,400
You see that most of the players scored points that started with a zero.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,333
Then a few more scored points that started with a one.

13
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:09,667
And then only one score scored points that started with a two, and it was actually 20 points.

14
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:15,400
So let me actually write down all of this data in a way that maybe you're a little bit more used to understanding it.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,882
So I'm going to write the zeros in purple.

16
00:01:18,882 --> 00:01:24,825
So there's, let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 players had zero as the first digit.

17
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:31,266
So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

18
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:37,151
I wrote 7 zeros. And then, this player also had a zero in his ones digit.

19
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:43,867
This player, I'm going to try to do all the colors, this player also had a zero in his ones digit.

20
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,071
This player right here had a 2 in his ones digit.

21
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:49,082
So he scored a total of two points.

22
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:54,000
This player -- let me do orange -- this player had 4 for his ones digit.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,748
This player had seven for his ones digit. Then, this player had seven for his ones digit.

24
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:08,894
And then, let me see, I'm almost using all the colors. This player had NINE for his ones digit.

25
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:15,267
So the way to read this is, you had one player with zero points, 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, and 9.

26
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:19,467
But you can see, and it's kind of silly saying that zero is the tens digit -- you could have even put

27
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:23,800
a blank there -- but the zero lets us know that they didn't score, they didn't score anything in the

28
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,133
tens place. But these are the actual scores for those seven players.

29
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:34,200
Now let's go to the next row in the stem-and-leaf plot. So over here, all of the digits start with

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,333
or all of the points start with one, for each of the players, and there's four of them

31
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:44,867
So, 1, 1, 1, and 1.

32
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:51,503
And then we have this player over here, his ones digit -- or her ones digit, is a 1.

33
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:57,067
So, this player, this represents 11. 1 in the tens place, 1 in the ones place.

34
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:02,579
This player over here also got 11, 1 in the tens place, 1 in the ones place.

35
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:08,733
This player, let me do orange, this player has three in the ones place.

36
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:15,800
So, he or she scored 13 points.1 in the tens place, 3 in the ones place. Thirteen points.

37
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,200
And then, I will do this in purple. This player has 8 in their ones place.

38
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,133
So he or she scored 18 points. 1 in the tens place, 8 in the ones place. 18 points.

39
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:36,042
And then finally, you have this player that has 2 -- the tens digit is a 2. And then the ones digit is a zero.

40
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:42,400
It is a ZERO. I'll circle that in yellow. It is a zero. So he or she scored 20 points.

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,400
So, using -- looking at the stem-and-leaf plot, we're able to extract out

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,867
all of the number of points that all of the players scored.

43
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:52,966
And once again, what's useful about this is that you see how many players scored between

44
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,867
0 and 9 points, including 9 points.

45
00:03:55,867 --> 00:04:00,733
How many scored between 10 and 19 points, and then how many scored 20 points or over,

46
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,800
and you see the distribution right over here.

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,224
But let's actually answer the question that they're asking us to answer --

48
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:09,406
how many points did the TEAM score?

49
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:12,733
So here, we just have to add up all of these numbers, right over here.

50
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:15,400
So we're going to add up -- I'll start with the largest.

51
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,605
So -- 20, plus 18, plus 13, plus 11, plus 11.

52
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:33,113
13-11-11. Plus 9 plus 7, plus 7 again, plus 4, plus 2.

53
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:38,825
Did I do that right? We have 2 11s, then a 9, then 2 7s, then a 4, then a 2.

54
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:43,575
And then these two characters didn't score anything, so et's add up all of these together.

55
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,629
Let's add them all up.

56
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:55,533
So. 0 + 8 is 8. + 3 is 11. +1 is 12. +1 is 13. +9 is 22.

57
00:04:55,533 --> 00:05:05,400
+7 is 27. 34, 38, 30-- or 40. So that gets us to 40.

58
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
Let me do that one more time.

59
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:21,800
8, 11, 11, 12, 13, 22, 29. 29, and then. Oh, 29, 36, 40, and 42.

60
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:25,452
Looks like I actually might have messed -- let me do that one more time.

61
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:28,164
This is the hardest part, adding these up. So let me try that one last time.

62
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:30,533
I'm just going to state where my sum is.

63
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:41,467
So 0, 8, add 3, 11, 12, 13, 22, 29, 36, 40, 42.

64
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:44,333
So it was a good thing that I double-checked that. I had made a mistake the first time.

65
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:49,739
4 plus 2 is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

66
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:52,409
So we get to 102 points.

67
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:57,431
The team in total scored 102 points.
