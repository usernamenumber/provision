1
00:00:00,496 --> 00:00:06,573
We are asked to find the cube root of -343
or another way to think about it

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,973
is some number that when I multiply it
by itself three times,

3
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:13,373
I am going to get -343
or another way to view it it

4
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:20,539
this is the same thing
as -343 to the 1/3 power

5
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,085
and the best way to do this is,
to really just try to factor this out

6
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:27,973
so the first thing that we could do--
so let me just factor -343

7
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:31,046
so the first thing I would like to do
is just to factor out the -1

8
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:37,249
so it is same thing as -1 times 343
and lets just think about this

9
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:39,293
is it divisible by 2? No.

10
00:00:39,293 --> 00:00:42,913
Is it divisible by 3?
See the digits do not add up

11
00:00:42,913 --> 00:00:47,103
to a multiple of 3 they add up
to 10 so it is not divisible by 3.

12
00:00:47,103 --> 00:00:49,645
Not divisible by 4 since it's odd.

13
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:52,927
Not divisible by 5
because it doesn't end with 5 or 0.

14
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,748
It is not divisible by 6
because it's not divisible by 2 or 3.

15
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:58,316
Is it divisible by 7?
Let's check this out.

16
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:02,124
So 7 goes into 343.

17
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:08,124
7 goes into 34 four times,
4 times 7 is 28.

18
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:13,671
34 - 28 is going to be 6 bring down 3.

19
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:17,340
7 goes into 63 exactly 9 times.

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,362
So then we end up...

21
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:21,587
9 times 7 is 63, no remainder.

22
00:01:21,587 --> 00:01:24,725
So this is going to be 7 times 49,

23
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:30,540
and we know that 49 is same thing
as 7 times 7 so how can we rewrite this?

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,188
This is the same thing as taking...

25
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:36,556
It is the same thing as taking
the cube root...

26
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:39,025
The cube root of -1...

27
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:45,674
of -1 times 7 times 7 times 7
which is the same thing

28
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:55,385
as the cube root of -1
times the cube root of 7 times 7 times 7

29
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:58,501
now what is the cube root of -1?

30
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:04,047
Well, -1 times itself three times is -1
so this right here is -1.

31
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:09,394
You could verify,
-1 times -1 times -1 is indeed -1

32
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:11,025
this becomes positive 1.

33
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:13,443
Multiply by -1 again you get -1.

34
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:15,102
So this is -1,

35
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:19,132
and then this over here
the cube root of 7 times 7 times 7.

36
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:21,022
Well, that's just going to be 7,

37
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:26,422
7 multiplied by itself three times
gives us 7 times 7 times 7 or 343.

38
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:31,304
So it's going to be -1 times 7
which is the same thing as -7.

39
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:35,507
So our answer is -7,
and we are done.
