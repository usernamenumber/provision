1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,055
I finished the last video
touching on the stimulus plan

2
00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:07,448
and whether it's going
to be big enough and what its intent was.

3
00:00:07,448 --> 00:00:11,224
But I was a little handwavy
about things like savings and GDP

4
00:00:11,224 --> 00:00:15,015
and I thought it would
actually be good to get a little bit more particular.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,530
This isn't just me
making up things.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,558
So a good place to start
is just to think about disposable income.

7
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:24,099
And people talk about it without
ever giving you a good definition.

8
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:26,840
It's important to understand
what disposable income is.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,780
So this box right here is GDP,
so it's all the goods and services,

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,540
essentially all the
income, that we produce.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,364
The disposable income is
essentially the amount that ends up in the hands
of people.

12
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:41,541
So the U.S. GDP, I don't know
what the exact number is.

13
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:52,581
it's on the order of I think
$15 trillion.

14
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:56,421
And so some of that money
goes to taxes. I don't know.

15
00:00:56,421 --> 00:01:00,950
Let's say $3 trillion
ends up in taxes.

16
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,985
And these are round numbers,
but it gives you a sense of the make-up.

17
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:07,835
Then maybe about another
$1 trillion is saved by businesses.

18
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,764
So let's say that I'm Microsoft
and I make a billion dollars a share.

19
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,332
Microsoft makes a lot more
than that, but I make a billion dollars.

20
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:17,170
And I just keep it in a bank
account owned by Microsoft.

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,750
I don't give it to
my employees.

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,840
I don't dividend it out
to the shareholders. I just keep that.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,591
So corporate savings,
let's say, is another trillion dollars.

24
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:26,970
These are roundabout numbers.

25
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,156
And then everything
left over is, essentially, disposable income.

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,360
I'm making some simplifications
there,

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,882
but everything left over is
disposable income. And the idea is,

28
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:41,035
what is in the
hands of households after paying their taxes:
disposable income.

29
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:44,720
That check that you get after
your taxes and everything else

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,045
that is taken out of your
paycheck, that money, that is disposable income to you.

31
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:53,710
So the interesting thing is
where this disposable income

32
00:01:53,710 --> 00:02:03,825
has been going over the
last many, many years.

33
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:12,004
So this right here, this
chart, is a plot of the percentage of disposable income
saved since 1960.

34
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,040
I got this off the Bloomberg
terminal again.

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,457
And just so you get a good
reference point, let me draw the line for 10%.

36
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:21,730
Because I kind of view that
as a reference point.

37
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,680
That's 10% personal savings.

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,850
Actually, you could go back even
further than this

39
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,710
and you can see from the 1960s all
the way until the early `80s, the go-go `80s,

40
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,076
people were
saving about 10% of their disposable income.

41
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:38,470
Of what they got on that
paycheck after paying taxes,

42
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,860
they were keeping about 10% of
it, putting it in the bank.

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,060
And, of course, that would later
be used for investment and things like that.

44
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,038
But then starting in the early
`80s, right around, let's see, about 1984,

45
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,993
you see that people
started saving less and less money.

46
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:56,518
All the way to the extreme
circumstance, to 2007

47
00:02:56,518 --> 00:03:00,888
where, on average, people didn't save money.

48
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:04,571
Where maybe I saved $5, but
someone else borrowed $5.

49
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,242
So on average, we didn't
save money.

50
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:07,810
Actually we went slightly
negative.

51
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,150
And all of this, and this is
kind of my claim-- and it can be borne out

52
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:17,630
if you look at
other charts in terms of the amount of credit we took on--is
because we took on credit.

53
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,390
I guess there's two things
you could talk about.

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,316
We took on credit and we started
having what I call perceived savings, right?

55
00:03:24,316 --> 00:03:29,567
If I buy a share of IBM a lot
of people say, oh, I saved I saved my money,

56
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:32,839
I'm invested
in the stock market. But when I bought a share of
IBM,

57
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:39,498
unless that dollar I paid for the share goes to IBM to
build new factories

58
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:41,650
And that's very seldom time.

59
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,890
Most of the time, that dollar I
gave to buy that IBM share,

60
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,010
just goes to a guy who
sold an IBM share.

61
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,955
So there's no net investment. It's only investment.

62
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:53,860
it's only
savings, when that dollar actually goes to invest in some
way,

63
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,878
build a new factory or build a new product
or something.

64
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,859
So I think you had more and more
people thinking that they were saving when they weren't.

65
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:05,224
Maybe thinking that they were
saving, as their home equity in their house grew,

66
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:07,843
or
as their stock market portfolio went up.

67
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:10,330
But there wasn't actual
aggregate savings going on.

68
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,069
In fact, if anything, they were
borrowing against those things, especially
home equity.

69
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,350
And the average savings rate
went down and down and down.

70
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:24,813
So now we're here in 2007, and
maybe you could say 2008, where this is the capacity.

71
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:26,810
We should probably talk about
world capacity,

72
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,310
because so much of what we consume really
does come from overseas,

73
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:37,534
but this is the capacity serving the
U.S. And let's say, going into 2007, this was demand.

74
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:42,970
Supply and demand was, let's
say, pretty evenly matched.

75
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:49,216
If you go to that top up here,
you see that we were at 80% utilization, which
isn't crazy.

76
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:53,657
So if anything, you could say
that demand was maybe right around here.

77
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:56,267
But that's a good level. You want to be at around
80% utilization.

78
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,322
That's the rate at which you
don't have hyperinflation, but you're utilizing things
quite well.

79
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:05,611
Now all of a sudden, the credit
crisis hit and all this credit disappears.

80
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:10,875
And I'd make the argument that
the only thing that enabled us to not save this money,

81
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,715
is more and more access to cheap credit.

82
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:16,621
Every time we went through a
recession, from the mid `80s, onwards,

83
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:19,742
the government
solution was to make financing easier.

84
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:22,242
The Fed would lower
interest rates.

85
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:24,095
We would pump more and
more money into Fannie and Freddie Mac.

86
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,024
We would lower standards
on what it took to get a mortgage.

87
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:29,890
We would create incentives
for securitization.

88
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,584
We would look the other way when
Bear Stearns is creating collateralized debt obligations,

89
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,725
or AIG is writing credit default swaps.

90
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:39,120
And all of that enabled
financing.

91
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,038
Until we get to this point right
here, where everything starts blowing up.

92
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,540
So you essentially have
forced savings.

93
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,735
When people can't borrow
anymore, the savings rate has to go to 10%

94
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:53,758
because most of
this is just from people taking on more credit.

95
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:57,058
There were a group of people
who were probably already

96
00:05:57,058 --> 00:05:59,329
always saving at 10% of their
disposable income.

97
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:02,107
But there's another group of
people who were more than offsetting that by
taking credit.

98
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:05,491
Now that the credit crisis hits,
you're going to see the savings rate--

99
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,488
and you already
see it with this blip right there--

100
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:11,365
the savings rate is
going to go back up to 10% of disposable income.

101
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:15,526
Now if the savings rate goes
back to 10% of disposable income,

102
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:18,353
that amount of money,
that 10% of disposable income,

103
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:24,032
this gap, is 10% of disposable
income that cannot be used for consumption.

104
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:26,530
And let's think about how large
of an amount that is.

105
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,480
Right now, the U.S. disposable
income,

106
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,703
if I were to draw disposable income-- this number right here,

107
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:38,649
I just looked it up-- it's around $10.7
trillion, let's say $11 trillion for roundabout.

108
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,325
So this 10% of disposable income
that we're talking about,

109
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:47,267
this gap between the normal environment,

110
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:50,660
the environment that was enabled
from super-easy credit, that's 10% of disposable income.

111
00:06:50,660 --> 00:07:00,535
10% of $11 trillion is $1.1
trillion per year of demand that will go away. That's per year.

112
00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:04,426
So all of a sudden, you're going
to have a gap where this was the demand before

113
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:06,588
and now the demand's going to drop to here.

114
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:12,755
And all of this $1.1 trillion
of demand is going to disappear, because credit
is now not available.

115
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:19,025
And then you do get a situation
where you might hit a low capacity utilization.

116
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:22,390
Unfortunately, the capacity
utilization numbers don't go back to the Great Depression,

117
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,552
and we could probably get a sense of, at what point
does a deflationary spiral really get triggered.

118
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:31,390
But because that $1.1 trillion
in demand disappears,

119
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,915
you're going to see this orange line
just drop lower and lower in terms of capacity utilization.

120
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:38,310
And that's going to
drive prices down.

121
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:44,080
And what Obama and the Fed and
everyone else is trying to do, is to try to make up this gap.

122
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,950
Now, everyone else can't
borrow money.

123
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,760
Companies can't borrow money.

124
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,210
Homeowners can't borrow money.

125
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,662
But the government can borrow
money, because people are willing to finance it.

126
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:55,794
At the bare minimum, the Fed's
willing to finance the government.

127
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,080
And so the government wants to
come in and take up the slack with this demand

128
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,038
and
spend the money themselves with the stimulus.

129
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:06,319
Now we just talked about, what's
the magnitude of this demand shock?

130
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,500
It's $1.1 trillion per year.

131
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,262
While the stimulus plan
is on the order of a trillion dollars.

132
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,850
And that trillion dollars isn't
per year,

133
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:22,029
although I have a vague feeling that we
will see more of them coming down the pipeline.

134
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:26,039
This stimulus plan that just
passed is expected to be spent over the next few years.

135
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,328
So in terms of demand created
over the next few years,

136
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:33,335
it's going to be several hundred
billion per year.

137
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:39,301
So it's not going to be anywhere
near large enough to make up for this demand shock.

138
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:42,179
So we're still going to have
low capacity utilization.

139
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:48,037
So the people who argue that
these stimulus plans are going to create hyperinflation,

140
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:51,986
I
disagree with that, at least in the near term, because in
the near term

141
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:57,144
it's nowhere near large enough to really
soak up all of the extra capacity we have
in the system.

142
00:08:57,144 --> 00:09:00,110
And if anything, it's going to
soak up different capacity.

143
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,025
So the stimulus plan might
create inflationary-like conditions in certain markets

144
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:07,261
where the stimulus plan is really focused.

145
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:12,337
But in other areas, where you
used to have demand, but the stimulus plan doesn't touch,

146
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:16,861
like $50 spatulas from Williams Sonoma or granite
countertops,

147
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:19,554
that area is going to continue to see deflation.

148
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:22,843
And I would say net-net, since
this stimulus is actually so small,

149
00:09:22,843 --> 00:09:24,300
even though we're talking
about trillion dollars

150
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:31,988
relative to the amount of demand
destroyed per year, we'll probably still
have deflation.

151
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,050
And, for anyone who's paying
close attention to it,

152
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:40,828
and I am because I care about these
things, the best thing to keep a lookout for,

153
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:45,165
to know when to
start running to gold maybe or being super-worried about
inflation, is

154
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:50,069
if you see this utilization number creeping back
up into the 80% range.

155
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:52,437
At least over the last 40 years,

156
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:55,978
that's been the best leading indicator to
say when are we going to have inflation.

157
00:09:55,978 --> 00:10:01,545
And for all those goldbugs out
there, who insist that all of the hyperinflation

158
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:06,084
or the
potential hyperinflation is caused by our not being on the
gold standard,

159
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:10,197
I just want to point out that you can very
easily have--

160
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:18,251
we went off of Bretton Woods and completely
went to a fiat currency in '73, that's right around 1969.

161
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:23,555
But our worst inflation bouts
were actually while we were on the gold standard.

162
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:26,490
And that's because we had very
high capacity utilization.

163
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,370
This is the war period.

164
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,750
What happens during a war?

165
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,700
You run your factories
all-out.

166
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,520
You run your farms all-out
to feed the troops.

167
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,470
The factories, instead of
building cars, build planes.

168
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,195
Everyone was working. Wages go up.

169
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:40,440
Everything goes up and
you have inflation.

170
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,891
A lot of people say, oh, the
war was the solution to the Great Depression.

171
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:51,122
And it is true in that it got
us out of that negative deflationary spiral
that I talked about in the last video.

172
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,690
And it did it by creating an unbelievable amount of inflation.

173
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,718
And then after the war, you
could argue what allowed-- I don't have GDP here,

174
00:10:58,718 --> 00:11:03,234
but the
U.S. GDP really did do well in the postwar period--

175
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:08,942
it wasn't
the war per se, although the war kind of did take us out of
the deflationary spiral.

176
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:13,294
So after the war, you had
all of this capacity, after World War II.

177
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:16,091
So you had all this capacity
that was being used up by the war,

178
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,310
and then, all of the sudden, the war ends.

179
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,288
And you're like, well, we don't
have to build planes anymore,

180
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:20,915
we don't have to feed
the troops anymore,

181
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:22,850
and now we have all these unemployed troops
who come back home.

182
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,540
What are we going
to do with them?

183
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,298
You'd say maybe, capacity
utilization would come back down there.

184
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:31,210
But what a lot of people don't
talk about is,

185
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,220
the rest of the industrial world's capacity
was blown to smithereens.

186
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,960
At that point in time, the U.S.
was a smaller part of GDP

187
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:46,928
and the other major players
were Germany, Western Europe and Japan.

188
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:49,750
In the U.S., we didn't have
any factories bombed.

189
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,100
The entire war took place
in these areas.

190
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,809
And whenever people go on
bombing raids, the ideal thing that they want to bomb
is factories.

191
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,200
So what you had in the postwar
period,

192
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,520
is you had all of these countries that had their
capacity blown to smithereens.

193
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,654
The U.S. was essentially the
only person left with any capacity,

194
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:10,917
and so all the demand
from the rest of the world picked up the slack
in the U.S. capacity.

195
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:14,738
And that's why, even though
there was a demand shock in the U.S. after that,

196
00:12:14,738 --> 00:12:17,230
you also
had a supply shock from the war

197
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,153
where you had all of this
capacity that was blown to smithereens.

198
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:27,898
In this situation that we
are in now, we have a major demand shock. Financing just disappears

199
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:33,164
and
the savings rate's going to skyrocket because people
can't borrow anymore.

200
00:12:33,164 --> 00:12:35,620
But there's no counteracting
supply shock.

201
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,991
Supply of factories making
widgets and all the rest is staying the same.

202
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:45,433
So the Obama administration is
trying to create a stimulus to sop some of this up,

203
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,568
but it's
not going to be enough.

204
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:50,761
And my only fear is, with all
the printing money and all that goes,

205
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:56,186
once we do get
back to the 80% capacity utilization, once we do go back
here,

206
00:12:56,186 --> 00:13:00,419
how quickly they can unwind all of this printing
press money and all of the stimulus plan.

207
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:01,470
Because that's going
to be the key.

208
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,526
Because, if we do get to 80%
capacity utilization or we start pushing up there,

209
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:08,345
and we
continue to run the printing press--

210
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:11,015
because that's what,
essentially, government's incentive is to do,

211
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:13,504
because they
always feel better when we're flush with money--

212
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:17,066
then,
and only then, you might see a hyperinflation scenario.

213
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:19,827
But I don't see that at least
for the next few years.
