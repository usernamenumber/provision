1
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:06,730
We're in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,819
and we're looking at a Caspar David Friedrich's

3
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:10,382
The Abbey in the Oakwood.

4
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:13,285
It's a large painting, and it was one of a pair

5
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:15,495
that included "The Monk by the Sea."

6
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:18,744
This is a very somber image and it really is

7
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:21,486
a perfect example of the way Friedrich used landscape

8
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:25,285
in order to represent issues of human life and

9
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:26,974
of the Divine.

10
00:00:26,974 --> 00:00:29,118
That's right, and in this painting we see

11
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,744
the ruins of an abbey, an old abbey

12
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:36,786
and a procession of figures entering this ruined abbey,

13
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,489
carrying a coffin.

14
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,512
And so immediately we have a sense of the passage of time,

15
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:43,762
of the transience of human existence...

16
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:46,999
We're also looking at, it seems, the dead of winter,

17
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:49,081
and perhaps it's sunset.

18
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,851
If you look at the remnant of architecture that's left

19
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,739
you have this, first of all, this very forlorn sense

20
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:57,066
from the ruins themselves.

21
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:00,502
You see this old lancet window that's fallen into disrepair.

22
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:01,951
No glass remains.

23
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:04,850
And you have a real sense of the grandeur of

24
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,683
the original space, but now what's left is just

25
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:11,513
the futility of human experience, the futility of human effort.

26
00:01:11,513 --> 00:01:16,884
And what we see is that nature is eternal, but what man

27
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:19,267
creates is transient.

28
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:22,269
You have the monks themselves going through their

29
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:23,500
ancient ritual of burial.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,417
But you see the cemetery that surrounds them in the snow

31
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:30,596
is not well tended, it's haphazard, and it seems to be, itself,

32
00:01:30,596 --> 00:01:32,184
falling into disrepair.

33
00:01:32,184 --> 00:01:35,720
The abbey refers back to the Medieval tradition, but that's

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,988
now fallen away.

35
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:39,666
Older than that, are the oak trees,

36
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,890
which might have represented, for Friedrich,

37
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,731
the Druidic traditions, the pre-Christian traditions,

38
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:49,185
these truly ancient oaks, gnarled, and terrifying

39
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:51,955
in their silhouettes, but that speak of a tradition,

40
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:55,165
as witnesses, that are even older than Christianity.

41
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:58,601
And then beyond that, the crescent moon, and the sky,

42
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:01,433
when you were speaking, that's the nature that I was

43
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:03,151
looking at that is permanent,

44
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,999
that is trans-historical, that moves beyond even

45
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:08,652
the growth and death of the trees.

46
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:10,748
Certainly of the architecture of Man's efforts.

47
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:14,749
The moon having no sense of the cosmos, even beyond

48
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:16,802
the seasons of the Earth.

49
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:19,679
That's right, and so you have this sense of human time,

50
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:21,929
you have this sense of nature's time,

51
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:24,601
and then you have this sense of the time of God's space.

52
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:27,880
And in fact, if there's any optimism in this image,

53
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,321
it is that moon.

54
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:32,570
It is the faintest crescent, and it might wane even more

55
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,116
and become a New Moon, but then it will regenerate

56
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:37,313
and there is this possibility for rebirth.

57
00:02:37,313 --> 00:02:39,150
You mentioned that it's the dead of winter,

58
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,649
but spring will come.

59
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:44,132
And so even if it seems quite distant now, in this sort of

60
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:47,815
bleak twilight, there is this sense that there will be renewal.

61
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:51,336
So we may have a suggestion of resurrection

62
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:55,412
in the cycles of the moon, we have the crosses that are

63
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:59,571
a part of the cemetery, we have the cross that forms part of

64
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:03,771
the ruin of the abbey, and that suggestion of resurrection.

65
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:07,037
I think what's so interesting about Friedrich is that

66
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:10,751
he's imbuing a landscape with this very,

67
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:15,262
very serious meaning, almost the way that, in the past,

68
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:18,421
people have looked to the iconography of

69
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:23,061
Christian paintings, Friedrich is looking for modern language

70
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:27,629
with which to express these trans-historical human feelings,

71
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,297
contemplating our role in the universe, and trying to make

72
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:35,237
sense of all those layers of time that you referred to before.

73
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:38,763
That's exactly right. Friedrich is finding a new way of

74
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:41,154
representing these eternal issues, and it makes sense that

75
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,280
he would have to, because this is now the beginning of the

76
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,400
19th century. Friedrich is now living in a rational culture,

77
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,985
and the idea of using the iconography of the Renaissance,

78
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:53,482
or even of the Baroque, would feel implausible.

79
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:54,579
It wouldn't make sense.

80
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:58,149
And so Friedrich, this artist who was trained in Copenhagen,

81
00:03:58,149 --> 00:04:01,252
who grew up in Greifswald, which was then part of Sweden,

82
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:03,234
on the Southern coast of the Baltic,

83
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:06,498
is looking towards the very extreme, cold

84
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:08,788
Northern lanscape, as a way of expressing

85
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:10,917
these ideas of the eternal.
