1
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:11,100
Dr. Zucker: We're in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and we're looking at the "Young Woman with a Water Pitcher"

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,191
that dates to about 1662 by Johannes Vermeer. It's one of the real treasures in New York.

3
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:23,567
Dr. Harris: It's a lovely small painting, so typically of art in Holland during the 17th century.

4
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:31,142
Small images, domestic scenes, still lifes, landscapes, family scenes, genre painting.

5
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:39,378
Images that reflected the middle class culture (Z: The Protestant culture, right?) of the 17th century republic of Holland.

6
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:43,432
Dr. Zucker: Where there was a middlle class, or what we would recognize as middle class

7
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:47,856
and where possessions were important expressions of one's place in society.

8
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:51,511
Dr. Harris: Yes, but it was also very deeply religious culture.

9
00:00:51,511 --> 00:01:00,708
Dr. Zucker: It's interesting because if this is a Protestant culture and of course, the Roman Catholic Church have, for so long in the West, been one of the primary patrons of an artist.

10
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:08,350
When the church is no longer a primary patron, artists do have to look for different, and two different kinds of subject matter.

11
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,937
Dr. Harris: Artists have to find another way to making a living, right?

12
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:17,637
Dr. Zucker: That's right! And so you have here an image that really reflects an idealized domestic life.

13
00:01:17,637 --> 00:01:23,184
Dr. Harris: And would've been commissioned or purchased by wealthy businessmen.

14
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:30,129
And although in the 1600s, the period of Baroque in Italy, Spain, and France,

15
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:37,004
this is a kind of Baroque very different in Holland because of the Prostestant culture there.

16
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:41,632
Dr. Zucker: It is different, and when I think of Baroque in Holland, I usually think of the first half of the 17th century.

17
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,034
I think of the work of Rembrandt. This is so different.

18
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:53,680
Here, there's kind of a delicacy in a kind of awareness of the light and of the fleeting. I think that is very very different

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,005
Dr. Harris: This is a very poetic moment where the simple act of opening a window,

20
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:06,001
holding a water pitcher, maybe looking to water some flowers that are out the window.

21
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:15,783
Takes on a timeless quality. You can feel the love of the domestic here, the love of small rituals, the love of the every day.

22
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:22,457
To me, in a way, Vermeer is always a reminder of the beauty of what's around us.

23
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:29,726
Every day. You know, it's not Christ on the cross. It's not something monumental and heavenly.

24
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:34,907
But in a way, the presence of the divine in the every day, which speaks to us in a modern way.

25
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:41,236
Dr. Zucker: It is absolutely poetic. You see this woman against the white background, but there's no white in that wall.

26
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:43,091
(No.) Dr. Zucker: Behind her. (That's true.)

27
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:46,823
Dr. Zucker: It's a whole prism of colors that's filtered through that leaded glass.

28
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:53,369
You have warm whites of the wall against this cool sharp blue-whites of the linen headdress that she wears.

29
00:02:53,369 --> 00:03:02,609
Dr. Harris: And,the way that she's very characteristically, for Vermeer, locked to that space. By the rectangle of the window.

30
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:04,071
Dr. Zucker: Of the map.

31
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:12,533
Dr. Harris: And the rectangles of the table and the chair behind her. There's a sense of very controlled composition

32
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:19,910
at the same time, something very spontaneous and something very caught. A caught moment in time.

33
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:27,679
Dr. Zucker: So, even as he's portraying this really beautiful, delicate kind of representation.

34
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:34,535
We also have a lot of evidence of what was valued in the 17th century in Holland. (We do.)

35
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:39,855
You know, you got as a tablecloth of this heavy carpet, which would've been a very expensive item of luxury.

36
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:44,019
You got the brass, and I'm especially taken, I have to tell you,

37
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:51,463
with the ellipse of that basin, which just is so extraordinarily convincing almost more than if I had seen that thing in person.

38
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:55,776
Dr. Harris: Yeah. Well, I think that's the thing in a way it becomes more real in Vermeer.

39
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:06,413
It's so carefully observed. Every little millimeter of the way the light plays on the reflective surfaces of the basin and the box.

40
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:10,742
Even the brass, nails in the chair behind it. I mean it's like.

41
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:16,854
It makes us see things that in our everyday vision we don't see and we don't pay attention to.

42
00:04:16,854 --> 00:04:23,638
Dr. Zucker: And I have the sense that the woman who is portrayed in this image is in fact, as visually attentive as we are

43
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:28,942
In a sense modelling for us, the audience, this kind of visually attentiveness this awareness of her place

44
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:35,298
in the world, her place in space. Vermeer is brilliant, I think in creating that kind of love

45
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:42,025
and sensuality in space, in time and light (In color). It's just so gloriously beautiful.
