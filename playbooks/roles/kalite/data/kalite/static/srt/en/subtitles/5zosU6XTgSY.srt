1
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:08,200
What I want to explore in this video is given some length of string or line or some line segment right here B

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,000
can I set up an A, so that the ratio of A to B

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,933
is equal to the ratio of the sum of these two to the longer side

4
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:24,000
so its equal to ratio of A plus B to A

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,733
so I want to sit and think about this for a little bit

6
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:30,533
I wanna see is, can I construct some A that's on this ratio, this perfect ratio

7
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:33,267
I am somehow refering to here

8
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,067
so that the ratio of the longer side, to the shorter side

9
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:40,733
is equal to the ratio of the whole thing to the longer side

10
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,067
and lets just assume we can find a ratio like that

11
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:46,467
and we'll call it, we'll call it Ï† (Phi). We'll use the greek letter phi

12
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:48,133
for that ratio over there

13
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:51,800
so lets see what we can learn about this special ratio phi.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,667
Well, phi is equal to A over B, which is equal to A plus B over A

15
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:59,600
we know that A plus B over A is the same thing as

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,667
A over A plus B over A

17
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,400
A over A is just one

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,200
and B over A is just the inverse this statement right over here

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,600
so B over A, this thing right over here is phi

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,933
so B over A is just going to be 1 over phi. This is going to be 1 over phi.

21
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:22,867
So this is interesting, we've now set up a number

22
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:24,600
which is, we're gonna call this special ratio

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:32,467
phi, is equal to 1 plus 1 over phi

24
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:36,000
well just that is kind of a neat statement over there

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,800
first of all is you subtract 1 from both sides of this

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,933
you get phi minus 1 is equal to its inverse

27
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:45,600
that seems to be a pretty neat property of any number

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,800
that if I just subtract 1 from it, I get its multiplicative inverse

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,200
And so that already that seems intriguing.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,800
but then even this statement over here is kind of interesting

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,933
because you've redefined phi in terms of 1 plus 1 over phi

32
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:00,267
so we can acutally think of it this way

33
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:07,200
we could say, that phi is equal to 1 plus 1 over

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,667
phi, but instead of writing phi, we say wait

35
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:13,995
phi is just 1 plus 1 over, 1 plus 1 over

36
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:18,856
and instead of saying phi. that's just 1 plus 1 over

37
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:22,640
and I could just write phi again, or I could just keep on going

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,451
i could just keep on going like this forever

39
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:27,563
I could say that's 1 over, 1 plus 1 over

40
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:30,628
and just keep on going on and on and on forever.

41
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:32,532
and this is a recursive definition of a function

42
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:35,225
were a func..were a recursive definition of a variable

43
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:37,640
was defined in terms of itself

44
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,427
but even this seems like a pretty neat property

45
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,820
but we want to get a little bit further into

46
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,374
we actually want to figure out what phi is

47
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:47,671
what is the value of phi this weird number this weird ratio

48
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:49,947
that we are beginning to explore

49
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:54,312
so lets see if we can turn it into a quadratic equation that we can solve

50
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:56,913
using fairly traditional methods

51
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:59,328
and the easiet way to do that is to multiply both sides

52
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:01,800
of this equation by phi

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,513
and then you get phi squared

54
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:11,400
plus, or phi squared is equal to phi

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,000
phi plus 1

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,733
phi squared is equal to phi plus 1

57
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,200
and then, actually im going to take a little bit of a side here

58
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,467
because even this is interesting

59
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,333
because of then if we take the square rot of both sides

60
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:28,400
of this, you get, scroll down a bit, you get phi is equal to

61
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,267
the square root of, and ill just switch the order here

62
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:34,867
the square root of 1 plus, the square root of 1 plus

63
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:35,733
phi

64
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,133
so once again we can set up another recursive definition

65
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:43,067
phi is equal to the square root of 1 plus phi

66
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:44,733
and i could write phi there, but hey

67
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:46,000
phi is equal to the square root of

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,600
1 plus, is equal to the square root of 1 plus

69
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,000
and i could write phi there, but hey phi is just equal to

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,733
the square root of 1 plus

71
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,067
square root of 1 plus

72
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,333
and you could just keep on going on and on like this forever

73
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,600
so even this is neat

74
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,400
the same number that can be expressed this way

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,333
the same number were if i just subtract one from it

76
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,667
you get it's inverse

77
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:07,667
it can also be expressed in this kind of recursive square roots

78
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,533
underneath each other

79
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,267
so this is already seeming, starting to get very very intriguing

80
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:14,400
well lets get back to business

81
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:17,333
lets actually solve for this, this magic number

82
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,600
this magic, this magic ratio that we started thinking about

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,933
and, and really from a very simple idea

84
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:24,467
that the ratio of the longer side

85
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:28,333
to the shorther is equal to reatio of the sum of the two

86
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,200
to the longer side

87
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,467
so lets just solve this as a traditional quadratic

88
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,067
lets get everything on the left hand side

89
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,533
so we are going to subtract phi plus 1 from both sides

90
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,400
and we get phi squared

91
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,995
minus phi, minus 1

92
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:43,667
is equal to zero

93
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:47,800
and we can solve for a phi now using the quadratic formula

94
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,333
which we've proven in other videos

95
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,533
you can prove using completing the square

96
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,733
but the qaurdatic formula

97
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:56,467
you say negative B, negative B is the coefficient

98
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:57,733
on this term right here

99
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,067
so let me just write down

100
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,000
A is equal to 1

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
that's the coefficient on this term

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,267
B is equal to negative 1

103
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:04,933
that's the coefficient on this term

104
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,600
c is equal to negative 1

105
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,467
that's the coefficient that's really the constant term right over there

106
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:12,133
so the solutions to this - phi

107
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,400
we are actually only gonna care about the positive solution

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,667
cause we're thinking about a positive

109
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:18,133
both of, if we go to our original problem here

110
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,333
we're assuming that these are both positive distances

111
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,200
so we care about the positve value over here

112
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:26,267
we get phi is equal to

113
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,067
I'll do it in orange

114
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,867
negative B, well negative negative 1 is 1

115
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,490
plus or minus the square root of

116
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:35,400
B squared, B squared is going to be 1

117
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:38,663
minus 4AC

118
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:41,200
A is 1, C is negative 1

119
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,333
so negative 4 times negative 1 is positive 4

120
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:47,267
so 1 plus 4 all of that over 2A

121
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:50,200
so A is 1, so all of that over 2

122
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,933
so phi is equal to 2, and once again we only care about

123
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,333
the positve solution here

124
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,400
this is going be the square root of 5

125
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,800
you've have 1 minus the square of 5

126
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,025
you're gonna get a negative in the numerator

127
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,071
so we only care about the positive solution

128
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:04,308
1 plus the square root of 5

129
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:04,810
over 2

130
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,600
so this seems like a pretty

131
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,354
pretty interesting, interesting number

132
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:11,000
lets actually take a calculator out

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,759
and see if we can get the first, the first few places

134
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:16,590
of this magic number phi

135
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:19,333
so let me get my calculator out

136
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,133
and lets just actually evaluate it

137
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,867
and you might recognize that square root of phi

138
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,400
is an irrational number

139
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,800
and so this actually, this whole thing is going to be an irrational number

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
but I'll prove that in another video

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,467
which means its never repeats,

142
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:31,933
it goes on and on and on forever

143
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,067
but lets actually evaluate it

144
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:36,667
so its 1 plus the square root of 5

145
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,067
1 plus the square root of 5

146
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:42,000
divided by 2

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,500
so it this

148
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,933
1,6180339

149
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:49,667
so let me put that aside, put that aside

150
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,533
and let me write it down

151
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,133
and this is where it starts to get really interesting

152
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,067
and mysterious

153
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,733
so this number right over here

154
00:06:55,733 --> 00:07:02,867
is 1,618033988....

155
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,867
and it just keeps on going on and on and on

156
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:07,667
keeps on never terminating, never repeating

157
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,333
so that by itself, hey its this cool number

158
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,133
its this ratio that has all of this neat properties

159
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,400
which are pretty crazy

160
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,867
any way that you express it

161
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,533
but whats really neat is if we revisit this thing right over here

162
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,533
because what is 1 over phi going to be?

163
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:27,102
so, 1 over phi, 1 over phi. which we sometimes denote

164
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:30,498
with a capital phi (Î¦)

165
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:32,225
we already know, 1 over phi

166
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:33,400
is just phi minus 1

167
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,600
so we actually, we can do this in our heads

168
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,400
one over this is just going to be

169
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,000
0,618033988

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,600
It don't know, there something wacky about that

171
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,133
that the inverse of the number is really just the decimals

172
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,400
left over after you get rid of the one

173
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,667
that by itself is kind of a crazy idea

174
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,000
but it gets even crazier!

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,067
because this number is showing up everywhere

176
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,800
and as you might imagine from the title of this video

177
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
this phi right over here

178
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,467
this is called the golden raito

179
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:04,933
this is the golden ratio

180
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:06,600
and it shows up everywhere

181
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,200
"Golden Ratio"

182
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,333
it shows up in art, it shows up in music

183
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,333
it shows up in nature

184
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,533
and just as to get an idea of were it shows up in nature

185
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,867
it shows up in very pure ideas

186
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,533
so if I were to just draw

187
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,600
if I were to draw a perfect star

188
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,267
if i were to draw a regular star like this

189
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:26,333
let me just draw it like this

190
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,600
draw it right over here

191
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,115
so this is just a regular star

192
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:31,267
all the lengths are equal

193
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:35,267
all the, let me draw it a little bit better than that

194
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:38,000
so if I just draw a star like this right over here

195
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
or sometimes this would be called a pentagram

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,933
some amazing things start to happen here

197
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:49,800
the ratio of this pink side to this blue length

198
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,667
right over here, thats the golden ratio

199
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:58,400
the ratio of this magenta to this pink, is the golden raito

200
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,200
as it should, by definition

201
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,533
now the ratio of this magenta to this orange

202
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,200
is also the golden raito

203
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,600
it just keeps on showing up in a ton of different ways

204
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
when you look at a pentagram like this

205
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,667
if you look at something like a pentagon

206
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,333
a regular pentagon

207
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,000
were all the angles are the same and all the sides are the same

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,267
a regular pentagon

209
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:22,733
if you take any of the diagonals

210
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:25,667
of a regular pentagon

211
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:29,000
so right over here, so if you take this diagonal right over here

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,333
the ratio of this green side to

213
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,733
and what I am talking about the diagonals

214
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,400
the ones that actaully aren't one of the edges

215
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,267
the ratio of any of the diagonals

216
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:39,200
to any of the sides, is once again

217
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,933
this golden ratio

218
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,200
so it keeps showing up, on and on and on

219
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,333
and we can do interesting things

220
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,800
with the golden ratio

221
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,533
let's say we had a rectangle

222
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,544
were the ratio of the width to the height is the golden ratio

223
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:53,590
so lets try that out

224
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,467
so lets say this is its height

225
00:09:56,467 --> 00:09:58,133
this is it's width

226
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,733
and that the ratio

227
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,533
so lets call this A, lets call this B

228
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:06,200
and the ratio of A to B is equal to phi

229
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,133
it's that 1,61.. so on and so forth

230
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,800
and let me scroll down a little bit

231
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
so that is going to be equal to phi

232
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,000
so thats, you know maybe thats something

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,867
interesting to do, maybe thats a nice looking rectangle

234
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,067
of some sort

235
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,533
but let me put out a square here

236
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:23,667
so let me separate this into a B by B square

237
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:26,200
so this is a B by B square right over here

238
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,513
and then, actually let me do a little bit

239
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,333
let me draw it a little bit differently

240
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:35,867
this rectangle, it isn't exactly the way I would want to draw it

241
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:39,267
so the ratio might look a little bit like this

242
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:42,400
so the ratio of the width to the length

243
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,867
or the width to the height, is going to be the golden ratio

244
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:48,267
so A over B is going to be

245
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:49,800
that golden ratio

246
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,200
and let me separate out a little B by B square

247
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,733
over here

248
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:56,600
a little B by B square

249
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,667
this has width B as well

250
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,267
and so this distance right over here

251
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:03,400
is going to be A minus B

252
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,000
so now it is a B by A minus B square

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,267
so we have a...actually I should say

254
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:11,600
we have a B by B square

255
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,533
right over here

256
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:13,733
this is B by B

257
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:16,733
and then were left with a B by A minus B rectangle

258
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:18,800
now wouldnt it be cool if this is also

259
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,267
this was also the golden ratio?

260
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:23,492
and so lets try it out

261
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:27,400
lets find the ratio of B to A minus B

262
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,933
So the ratio of B to A minus B

263
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:32,267
well that is going to be equal to

264
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:36,333
1 over the ratio of A minus B to B

265
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,600
I just took the reciprocal of this right over here

266
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,533
and this is just going to be equal to

267
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:45,575
1 over A over B minus 1

268
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:48,000
right, I just rewrote this right there

269
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,133
and that is just going to be equal to 1 over

270
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:55,000
phi, the ratio of A to B we said by definition was phi

271
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,733
phi minus 1

272
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,600
but what is phi minus 1?

273
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,533
Well phi minus 1 is 1 over phi!

274
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,800
It's this cool number

275
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
So this is equal to 1 over

276
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,333
1 over 1 over phi

277
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,133
which is once again just equal to phi

278
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:10,867
So once again, the ratio of this smaller rectangle

279
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:12,600
of it's height to it's width

280
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,800
is once again, this golden raito

281
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
this number that keeps showing up

282
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,400
and then we can do the same thing again

283
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,667
we can separate this into an A minus B by A minus B square

284
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:24,867
Just like that

285
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,867
and then we'll have another "Golden Rectangle"

286
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,267
sometimes it's called, right over there

287
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:29,667
and then we can separate that in to

288
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,000
a square

289
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,933
and another golden rectangle

290
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:35,000
and we can separate that in to a square

291
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,954
and then another golden rectangle

292
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:39,667
actually, let me do it like this

293
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,600
it will be better

294
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,533
so let me separate, let me do the square up here

295
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:50,400
so this is an A minus B by A minus B square

296
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,267
and then we have another golden rectangle right over here

297
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:57,267
I could put a square right in there, we'll have another golden rectangle

298
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,267
that we can put in another square right over there

299
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:01,333
you have another golden rectangle...I think you see

300
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,333
were this is going

301
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,133
another square and another golden rectangle

302
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,933
Which by itself starts to create a cool design that we can keep

303
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,667
kind of circling in and in and in

304
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,000
and then if we actually draw an arc here

305
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,600
something kind of cool happens

306
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,200
if we have an arc that kinda traces these things out

307
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,933
We have something, a pattern that you might have seen

308
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:20,400
many times before

309
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,867
and that pattern does not look too different from

310
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,000
what you might see in something like

311
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,467
a nautilus shell

312
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:28,133
and it shows up all over the place in nature

313
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:28,800
and that makes sense

314
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,600
because just the way cells construct themselves

315
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,400
it kinda makes sense to be the same

316
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,067
at different scales, and the ratio from one scale

317
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,800
to the next is maybe the same as

318
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,933
kinda the constituent ratios

319
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:41,533
This right here, and it shows up all over art

320
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,067
a lot of Leonardo da Vinci's paintings

321
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:46,533
He never, well, not explicity stated it but there's a lot of

322
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:47,733
interesing ratios in them.

323
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,400
But Salvador Dali, this painting right here

324
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,000
"The sacrement of the last supper"

325
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,400
he explicity used the golden ratio

326
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,267
So the actual ratio of the width to the height

327
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:58,400
is the golden ratio

328
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,133
so this is a golden rectangle

329
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:02,733
And also there's all sort of ratios and I'll invite you

330
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:04,600
to explore it, the ratios of the different parts in the tables

331
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,467
to were it sits in the painting

332
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:07,667
is the golden ratio

333
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,800
it shows up a ton in this painting

334
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,067
and then he does have the pentagons over here

335
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:15,400
and we know that the ratio of the diagonal to the sides of the pentagon

336
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,800
are also the golden ratio

337
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,000
and so he just tought it was a really cool thing

338
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,200
and theres all sort of neat things

339
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,933
that if you find, you know where these two

340
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,000
guys are bowing down are

341
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,733
if you draw that line right over here

342
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,467
this is the golden ratio

343
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,133
the ratio of this length right over here

344
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:33,000
to that length over there, once again the golden ratio

345
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,333
It just keeps showing up in this painting

346
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,733
So it's a really really really cool thing

347
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:39,333
and I really encourage you to explore this further

348
00:14:39,333 --> 99:59:59,999
cause it's kind of exciting
