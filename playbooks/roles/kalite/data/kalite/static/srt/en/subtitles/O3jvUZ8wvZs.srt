We're asked to convert 150 degrees and -45 degrees to radians

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets think about the relationship between degrees and radians

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and to do that, let me just draw a little circle here so that's the center of the circle and then

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
do my best shot to

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
best attempt to draw a reasonable looking circle

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
eh, thats not, i've done worse...i've done worse than that

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
alright. Now if we were to go in degrees

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if we were to go one time around the circle like that. How many degrees is that?

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well we know that, that would be 360 degrees.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well if we did the same thing, how many radians is that?

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we were to go all the way around the circle. Well we just have to remember

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when we're measuring in terms of radians we're really talking about the arc that subtends that angle

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if we go all the way around, you really talking about the arc length of the entire circle or essentially the
