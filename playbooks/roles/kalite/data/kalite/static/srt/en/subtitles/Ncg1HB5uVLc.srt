1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870
   

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,760
We're on 41.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,890
Lea made two candles in the
shape of right rectangular

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,810
prisms. So I'm assuming when
they say right rectangular

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,670
prisms, they mean
a kind of three

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,570
dimensional rectangular shape.

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,370
The first candle is 15
centimeters height, 8

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,300
centimeters long and
8 centimeters wide.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,990
So let's see, it's 15
centimeters high.

10
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,090
So that's 15.

11
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,640
8 centimeters long.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,420
So maybe that's 8.

13
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,030
And 8 centimeters wide.

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,740
So maybe it goes back 8.

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,710
So it looks something
like that.

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,030
That's candle number one.

17
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,540
The second candle is 5
centimeters higher, but the

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,950
same length and width.

19
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,400
So the second candle is just
5 centimeters higher.

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,900
So it looks something
like this.

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,410
Where this is still 8 and 8.

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,220
But the height is 5 more
than 15, so it's 20.

23
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,030
Fair enough.

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,040
How much additional
wax was needed to

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,590
make the taller candle?

26
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,280
So if you think about it, we
just have to think about how

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,430
much incremental volume did we
create by making that section

28
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,990
five centimeters higher?

29
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,620
So this candle, you can
kind of view it

30
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,430
as going up to here.

31
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,560
It's 15 centimeters high.

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,610
And then we added
5 right here.

33
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,980
So what's the volume of this
volume right there?

34
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,195
So it's 8 by 8 by 5.

35
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:28,660
   

36
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,900
So 5 times 8 times 8.

37
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,670
5 times 8 is 40 times
8 is 320.

38
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,450
So we have to add 320 cubic
centimeters more of wax to

39
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,460
make the taller candle.

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,900
Problem 42.

41
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,450
Two angles of a triangle have
measures of 55 and 65.

42
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,220
Which of the following could
not be a measure of an

43
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,160
exterior angle of
the triangle?

44
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,740
So I think this is a good time
to introduce what an exterior

45
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,270
angle even is.

46
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,390
So if I draw any polygon, and
I'll draw a triangle since

47
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,983
that's what this question
is about.

48
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:09,449
   

49
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,060
So let's say that that's
my triangle.

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,520
An exterior angle of one
of the vertices is, you

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,820
essentially extend one of the
lines of the vertices out.

52
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,140
So this is an interior
angle right here.

53
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,640
The exterior angle is if you
extend this line out, so if I

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,406
were to draw a dotted
line that extends

55
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:27,650
out this bottom line.

56
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,770
This is the exterior
angle right here.

57
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,510
As you can see, it's going to
be the supplement to this

58
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,800
interior angle.

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,040
And we could have extended
the line out there.

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,170
Or we could have extended
this line this way.

61
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,580
And we could have
used this one.

62
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,590
But we wouldn't add these two
if we wanted to find all of

63
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,415
the exterior angles.

64
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,490
The exterior angle of this
vertex right here is either

65
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,640
this one or this one.

66
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,960
And they are the same because
both of these are supplements

67
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,910
of this angle.

68
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,740
This angle plus either of this
angle or that one will add up

69
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,230
to 180 degrees.

70
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,590
So that's what an exterior
angle is.

71
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,290
So let's go back to
the question.

72
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,190
Two angles of a triangle have
measures of 55 and 65.

73
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,960
So let's say this is
55 and this is 65.

74
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,820
Which of the following could
not be a measure of an

75
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,430
exterior angle of
the triangle?

76
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,920
Well we can figure out all
of the exterior angles.

77
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,720
So first of all what's
this third interior

78
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,220
angle going to be?

79
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,600
Well they all have
to add up to 180.

80
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,160
So let's call that x.

81
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:35,790
So we know that x plus 65
plus 55 is equal to 180.

82
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,870
65 plus 55 is 120.

83
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,700
120 is equal to 180.

84
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,170
So x is equal to 60 degrees.

85
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,340
So this angle right here, I'll
do it in another color, this

86
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,710
is 60 degrees.

87
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,430
So what are all the possible
exterior angles.

88
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,370
So if I extended this line out
like I did in the example of

89
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,070
when I defined what an exterior
angle is, this

90
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,840
exterior angle would
be 120 degrees.

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
If were to do it here, if I
would extend this out right

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,250
here, what would this
exterior angle be?

93
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,130
Let's see, this plus
65 is 180.

94
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,890
What's 180 minus 65.

95
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,870
180 minus 60 is 120, so this
would have to be 115.

96
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,970
So that exterior angle is 115.

97
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,990
And then this one, let's
see if I extend it out.

98
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,700
One of the two lines that
form the vertex.

99
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,160
This is going to be
supplementary to 55.

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,760
So 180 minus 55 is 125.

101
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,010
180 minus 60 would be 120, and
then it's only 55 so 125.

102
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,120
So the three supplementary, or
the three exterior angles of

103
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,100
this triangle are 125.

104
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,110
And they want to know what
could not be a measure.

105
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,430
So 125 is a measure of
an exterior angle.

106
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,950
So is 115.

107
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,400
And so is 120.

108
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,830
So our answer is D.

109
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,200
None of the exterior angles
are equal to 130 degrees.

110
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:09,320
Problem 43.

111
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,050
OK, they say the sum of the
interior angles of a polygon

112
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,060
is the same as the sum of its
exterior angles, what type of

113
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,130
polygon is it?

114
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,650
And this is an interesting
question.

115
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,810
And it's something to experiment
with for yourself.

116
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,340
But I want you to draw random
polygons with angle measures,

117
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,140
because you know what the angles
all have to add up to

118
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,230
in a polyogon.

119
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,500
And I think you'll find, that
no matter what polygon you

120
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,540
draw, all of the exterior angles
are going to add up to

121
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,360
360 degrees.

122
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,120
In fact, in that example we just
did, what were they they

123
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,780
were, for that triangle.

124
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:49,510
If I remember, it's
115, 125, and 120.

125
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,370
This was for a triangle.

126
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,800
If you added them up, you
get 5 plus 5, 10.

127
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,380
And then that's 6.

128
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,670
360 degrees.

129
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,110
For that triangle, which had
kind of strange angles.

130
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,890
It wasn't like an equilateral

131
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,440
triangle or anything beautiful.

132
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,300
And it's also the same if I
were to draw a rectangle.

133
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,075
Well let me not draw
a solid rectangle.

134
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:11,750
   

135
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,090
So if I have a rectangle
like that.

136
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,280
What are the exterior
angles here?

137
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,380
Well, I can continue this
line right here.

138
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,210
This angle right here
is going to be 90.

139
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,640
I could go either way, I could
continue this up, but you can

140
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,970
only do it once though for
each of the vertices.

141
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,280
Well that exterior
angle is 90.

142
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,125
I could go like that, that
exterior angle is 90.

143
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,050
I could go like that.

144
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,830
That exterior angle is 90.

145
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,740
So once again, 90 plus 90 plus
90 plus 90 that's 360 degrees.

146
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,740
So it's a good thing to know
that the sum of the exterior

147
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,490
angles of any polygon is
actually 360 degrees.

148
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,910
And maybe we'll prove that in
another video for a polygon

149
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,030
with n sides.

150
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,910
But now that we know that, so
they say that the sum of the

151
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,930
interior angles of a polygon is
the same as the sum of its

152
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,000
exterior angles, this is the
same as saying the sum of the

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,060
interior angles is
equal to 360.

154
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,510
Because this is always going
to be 360 degrees no matter

155
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,910
what the polygon is.

156
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,560
So they're essentially saying
what polygon's interior angles

157
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,180
add up to 360 degrees.

158
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,390
And that of course is
a quadrilateral.

159
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,980
My mouth got ahead of me.

160
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,410
And if you think in a
quadrilateral you have 90, 90,

161
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,910
90, 90 and they add
up to 360 degrees.

162
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,270
Next question.

163
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,080
Let me copy and paste a couple
of them so I don't have to

164
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,330
keep doing this.

165
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:42,120
   

166
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,940
OK.

167
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,390
All right.

168
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,140
What is a measure of angle x.

169
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,760
So this is an exterior angle
to the vertex B.

170
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,510
So how do we figure this out?

171
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,160
Well there's kind of a fast
way and a slow way.

172
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,690
And the slow way is to figure
out this angle.

173
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,310
Because you know that the sum
of the angles add up to 180.

174
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:12,430
And you say oh, x is going
to be 180 minus that.

175
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,100
Let's just do it the slow way
and I think you'll see the

176
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,440
intuition of a slightly faster
way you could have done it.

177
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:23,370
This plus 60 plus 25
is 85 degrees.

178
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,270
Let's call this angle y.

179
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:32,020
So we know that y plus 85
degrees is equal to 180.

180
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,730
I got this 85 just by
adding 60 to 25.

181
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,840
So this is just saying that
the interior angles of a

182
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,080
triangle add up to
180 degrees.

183
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,380
And we could figure
out y right now.

184
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,990
You could subtract 85 from both
sides and you'd get y is

185
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,100
equal to 95.

186
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,480
And then we could figure out
x from y, because x is the

187
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,400
supplement of y.

188
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,090
So then you could say x is
equal to 180 minus 95 and

189
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,850
you'd get 85.

190
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,185
And that would be fine, it
didn't take you too long, C is

191
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:06,840
the answer.

192
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,710
But a slightly faster
way of saying it.

193
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,460
OK, y plus 85 is equal to 180.

194
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,930
And you also know that y
plus x is equal to 180.

195
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,490
So clearly, x is equal to 85.

196
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,600
If you add 85 to y, you
get 180, if you add x

197
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,720
to y you get 180.

198
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,630
So x would be 85.

199
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,930
That would be a slightly
faster way of

200
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,650
thinking about it.

201
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,260
But either way is
fine if you're

202
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,220
not under time pressure.

203
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,010
OK, problem 45.

204
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,960
If the measure of an exterior
angle of a regular polygon.

205
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,770
Regular polygon, so that
means that all of

206
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,950
the angles are congruent.

207
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,980
Of a regular polygon is 120
degrees, how many sides does

208
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,230
the polygon have?

209
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,700
   

210
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,320
So this is the vertex in
question, let's say that's the

211
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,870
vertex of this polygon
we're thinking about.

212
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,510
We want to measure its
exterior angles.

213
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,240
So I'd extend one side
of the vertex.

214
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,190
And they're saying that
that is 120 degrees.

215
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,370
That tells me that the interior
angle at that vertex

216
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,250
is 60 degrees.

217
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,910
It's the supplement to
the exterior angle.

218
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,860
So what regular polygon
has all of its

219
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,970
sides equal to 60 degrees?

220
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,170
Well, the equilateral
triangle.

221
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,890
Regular polygon, all
the angles and all

222
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,410
the sides are congruent.

223
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,360
So an equilateral triangle
looking something like that

224
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,470
would do the trick.

225
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,200
It's a regular polygon, all
the sides are the same.

226
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,780
And its angles are
60, 60 and 60.

227
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,020
So when they say how many sides
does the polygon have?

228
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,510
It has three, it's a triangle.

229
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,600
I'm out of time.

230
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,740
I'll see you in the
next video.

231
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:52,900
