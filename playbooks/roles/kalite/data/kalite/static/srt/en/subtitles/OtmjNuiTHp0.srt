1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,060
Let's

3
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:06,420
continue on with our study of
rotation of functions around

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,375
the x, and we'll soon
see the y-axis as well.

5
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:12,040
So let's do a slightly harder
example than what we've been

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,360
doing, but I think it might be
obvious how to approach it.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,300
So there's my y-axis, there's
my x-axis, and in a couple of--

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,290
I think it was two problems
ago-- we figured out if we had

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,530
the function y is equal to
square root of x-- let me try

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,210
to draw it-- so this is y
equals square root of x-- if we

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,460
were rotate that around the
x-axis, what the volume would

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,410
be between two points, let's
say 0 and some other point.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,940
Now let's just pick an
arbitrary point 1.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,390
I think you know how to
do that at this point.

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,320
Now let's make it a slightly
more difficult problem.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,785
Let's say I were to also
draw the function y is

17
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:52,760
equal to x squared.

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,115
So that looks-- if this is 1,
they both meet at 1, right?

19
00:00:56,115 --> 00:01:00,900
Because square root of 1 is 1,
and 1 squared is 1, so that

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,380
would look something like this.

21
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,150
   

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,750
They should be actually
symetric around y

23
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,650
equals x, but anyway.

24
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,010
So say y equals x squared
looks like that.

25
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,940
So my question now is, what
is the volume if I were to

26
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,490
take this figure and
rotate it around?

27
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,530
So what do I mean?

28
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:33,940
So this area here, if I were to
rotate that about the x-axis,

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,150
what would the volume be?

30
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,350
So now, what we did just with
the square root of x, we had

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,730
like a solid cup, right?

32
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,840
It would look
something like this.

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,200
It would be like a cup, and it
was solid, we were just trying

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,500
to figure out the volume of it.

35
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,730
Hopefully that made
sense to you.

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,610
Now it's going to be kind of a
hollowed-out cup, because we

37
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,400
have this inside function, and
so the inside of the cup

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,940
is going to be empty.

39
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,910
Hopefully that makes
a little sense.

40
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,250
Remember you're just taking
this and then you're rotating

41
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,290
it around the x-axis.

42
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,390
Well, the way to think about
it-- especially if you having

43
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,590
trouble visualizing--
actually, the solution might

44
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,040
help you visualize it.

45
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,640
The volume of this figure,
which I'm having trouble

46
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,180
drawing, it will be the
volume formed by the

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,885
outside rotation of this y
equals square root of x.

48
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:20,980
We'll do that in the yellow.

49
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,630
   

50
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,740
It'll be the volume formed when
that is rotated around, and

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,770
then the whole solid volume
minus the volume when

52
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,950
minus this volume.

53
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:43,420
So if we took the y equals x
squared, y equals x squared

54
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,060
would look something like that,
and then if you rotated it

55
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,780
around the axis, it would
look something like that.

56
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,870
I don't know if you've ever
been to Morocco, but they have

57
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,020
these tajin plates that the
tops look a lot like that.

58
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,730
Well, you probably haven't.

59
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,920
Well, anyway.

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,230
It would look
something like that.

61
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,200
So if we subtract out this
volume when it's rotated around

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,480
from the volume of y equals
square root of x, when that's

63
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,340
rotated, we'll get this figure
that we're trying to figure

64
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,230
out, this area when
it's rotated around.

65
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,070
And that should be intuitive
for you, hopefully, because

66
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,260
when we just did area under a
curve, that's how we would

67
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,660
figure out the area
of this green area.

68
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,140
We would figure out the area
under square root of x, and

69
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,900
we'd subtract out the area
under y equals x squared.

70
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,400
   

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,690
This time, we're going to say
the volume of the revolution of

72
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,950
y equals square root of x minus
the volume of the revolution

73
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,340
of y equals x squared.

74
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,260
So let's do the problem.

75
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:52,280
So the total volume-- let me do
a good color, that looks good--

76
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,250
total volume is going to be
equal to the volume formed when

77
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,810
we rotate y equals square
root of x around the x-axis.

78
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,010
I said from 0 to 1, and
that's because I picked

79
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,440
where they meet.

80
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,570
Sometimes in a book, or on an
exam, they'll just say, oh, you

81
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,350
know, the area between y equals
x squared and y equals square

82
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,980
of x, we're going to rotate
that around and you have

83
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,880
to figure out, well they
intersected at 1, and you can

84
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,270
just set the equations equal to
each other to figure that out.

85
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,960
We're going from 0 to
1, because they also

86
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,550
intersect at 0.

87
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,910
0 squared is the same thing
as square root of 0.

88
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,150
We're going from 0 to
1, and so what's the

89
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,280
volume of the larger?

90
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,720
Or I guess the y equals square
root of x rotated around?

91
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,800
I always forget the formula,
that's why I always redraw a

92
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,660
disk, so if that's the radius
of my disk, the disk is going

93
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,700
to come around like that, so
we know that the radius is a

94
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,910
function of the disk, and
that's, of course, the dx

95
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,160
is the depth of the disk.

96
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,290
So the radius is the function
which, for the outside one, is

97
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,360
square root of x, and we know
area of this disk is pi r

98
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,010
squared, so we square the
radius, take a pi outside, and

99
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,990
then we multiply that times the
width, so that's where we

100
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,750
get our dx, and of course we
sum them all up and that's

101
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,510
where we get the integral.

102
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,520
I'm going to do it as
two separate integrals.

103
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,870
Some people will put them both
within the same integral, but I

104
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,420
really want to hit the point
home that this is the volume of

105
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,410
the outside surface, formed by
the outside surface or the cup,

106
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,800
minus the volume formed by
the the inside function.

107
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:42,840
It's going to be minus pi--
still going to be from 0 to 1--

108
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,950
I drew fairly huge integral
signs, I don't know why-- and

109
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,655
what's the inside function?

110
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:49,740
It's x squared, and that's
going to be the radius of its

111
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,030
own disks, if that's the
radius that's the disk, dx

112
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:01,520
is the width, so it'll be x
squared, squared, times dx.

113
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,800
So let's see if we
can figure that out.

114
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,940
So, volume equals--
let's take the pis out.

115
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,290
I think you'll see that that
pi is applying to everything,

116
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,920
so we can take the pi out.

117
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,310
And then, times the integral,
and now we can merge them

118
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,170
back, because integrals
are additive like that.

119
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,600
You'll see what I'm
talking about.

120
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,720
This integral is
the same thing.

121
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,090
So what's square
root of x squared?

122
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,800
Well that's just x.

123
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,390
And what's x squared, squared?

124
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,780
That's x to the fourth, right?

125
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,760
You multiply the exponents,
exponent rules.

126
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,520
We have a minus sign here.

127
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,070
Minus x to the fourth, all that
times dx, we've got that pi on

128
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,430
the outside, that equals--
let's keep our pi

129
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,040
on the outside.

130
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,310
We're going to have to evaluate
the antiderivative at 1 and 0.

131
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,360
So what's the
antiderivative of x?

132
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:07,230
Well, that's x squared over
2, minus-- what's the

133
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,730
antiderivative of
x to the fourth?

134
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,140
Well, it's x to
the fifth over 5.

135
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,010
That's hopefully
second nature to you.

136
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,640
x to the fifth over 5, and
we're going to evaluate

137
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,530
that at 1 and 0.

138
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,122
1 and 0.

139
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:23,100
We're going to subtract them.

140
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,260
Fundamental theorem
of calculus.

141
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,700
So that equals-- I'm going to
switch colors to avoid

142
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:34,520
monotony-- that equals pi
times, let's evaluate it at 1,

143
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:42,960
so it's 1/2 minus 1/5 and when
you evaluate it at 0, it's 0

144
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,710
minus 0, so when you evaluate
0, you get nothing.

145
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,940
And so what's 1/2 minus 1/5?

146
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:57,250
That's pi times 2, get a common
denominator of 10, 5/2 is 1/2

147
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:03,690
minus 2/10 is 1/5, so this
equals, this would be 3,

148
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,190
so we get 3pi over 10.

149
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,710
That's the volume formed.

150
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,660
So it's almost easier to
figure out the volume of

151
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,660
this figure than to draw it.

152
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,670
Anyway, I think I'll leave you
there with this video, and in

153
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,610
the next video, we're
going to start rotating

154
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,510
around the y-axis.

155
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,110
See you soon.

156
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,400
