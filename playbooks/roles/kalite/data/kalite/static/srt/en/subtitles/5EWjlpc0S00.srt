1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
   

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,740
In the last video, we showed
that any external pressure on

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,490
a liquid in a container
is distributed

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,000
evenly through the liquid.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,340
But that only applied to-- and
that was called Pascal's

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,950
principle-- external pressure.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,670
Let's think a little bit about
what the internal pressure is

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,620
within a liquid.

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,760
We're all familiar, I think,
with the notion of the deeper

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,930
you go into a fluid or the
deeper you dive into the

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,350
ocean, the higher the
pressure is on you.

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,619
Let's see if we can think about
that a little bit more

13
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,420
analytically, and get a
framework for what the

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,270
pressure is at any depth
under the water, or

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,730
really in any fluid.

16
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,680
Here I've drawn a cylinder, and
in that cylinder I have

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,620
some fluid-- let's not assume
that it's water, but some

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,160
fluid, and that's
the blue stuff.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,250
I'm also assuming that I'm doing
this on a planet that

20
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,670
has the same mass as Earth, but
it has no atmosphere, so

21
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,630
there's a vacuum up here--
there's no air.

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,590
We'll see later that the
atmosphere actually adds

23
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,940
pressure on top of this.

24
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,800
Let's assume that there's no
air, but it's on a planet of

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,770
the same mass, so the
gravity is the same.

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,530
There is gravity, so the
liquid will fill this

27
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,810
container on the bottom
part of it.

28
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,840
Also, the gravitational constant
would be the same as

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,040
Earth, so we can imagine this is
a horrible situation where

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,020
Earth has lost its magnetic
field and the solar winds have

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,820
gotten rid of Earth's
atmosphere.

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,300
That's very negative, so we
won't think about that, but

33
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,000
anyway-- let's go back
to the problem.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,640
Let's say within this cylinder,
I have a thin piece

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,340
of foil or something that
takes up the entire

36
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,000
cross-sectional area
of the cylinder.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,290
I did that just because I want
that to be an indicator of

38
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,150
whether the fluid is moving
up or down or not.

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,760
Let's say I have that in the
fluid at some depth, h, and

40
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,650
since the fluid is completely
static-- nothing's moving--

41
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,335
that object that's floating
right at that level, at a

42
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:02,440
depth of h, will
also be static.

43
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,060
In order for something to be
static, where it's not

44
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,490
moving-- what do we
know about it?

45
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,060
We know that the net forces on
it must be zero-- in fact,

46
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,050
that tells that it's
not accelerating.

47
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,470
Obviously, if something's not
moving, it has a velocity of

48
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,170
zero, and that's a constant
velocity-- it's not

49
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,000
accelerating in any direction,
and so its net

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,830
forces must be zero.

51
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:32,810
This force down must be
equal to the force up.

52
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,050
So what is the force down
acting on this cylinder?

53
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,860
It's going to be the weight of
the water above it, because

54
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,780
we're in a gravitational
environment, and so this water

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,030
has some mass.

56
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,310
   

57
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,470
Whatever that mass is, times
the gravitational constant,

58
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,170
will equal the force down.

59
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,240
Let's figure out what that is.

60
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,960
The force down, which is the
same thing is the force up, is

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:12,860
going to equal the mass of
this water, times the

62
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,490
gravitational constant.

63
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,020
Actually, I shouldn't say
water-- let me change this,

64
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,760
because I said that this is
going to be some random

65
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,140
liquid, and the mass
is a liquid.

66
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,360
The force down is going to be
equal to the mass of the

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,500
liquid times gravity.

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,220
What is that mass
of the liquid?

69
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,565
Well, now I'll introduce you to
a concept called density,

70
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:38,460
and I think you understand what
density is-- it's how

71
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,150
much there is of something in
a given amount of volume, or

72
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,290
how much mass per volume.

73
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,560
That's the definition
of density.

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,670
The letter people use for
density is rho-- let me do

75
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,440
that in a different
color down here.

76
00:03:50,440 --> 00:04:01,476
rho, which looks like a p to
me, equals mass per volume,

77
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:03,940
and that's the density.

78
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:12,380
The units are kilograms per
meter cubed-- that is density.

79
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,170
I think you might have an
intuition that if I have a

80
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:24,930
cubic meter of lead-- lead is
more dense than marshmallows.

81
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,690
Because of that, if I have a
cubic meter of lead, it will

82
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,320
have a lot more mass, and in a
gravitational field, weigh a

83
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,100
lot more than a cubic meter
of marshmallows.

84
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,050
Of course, there's always that
trick people say, what weighs

85
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,740
more-- a pound of feathers,
or a pound of lead?

86
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,600
Those, obviously, weigh the
same-- the key is the volume.

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,010
A cubic meter of lead is going
to weigh a lot more than a

88
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,180
cubic meter of feathers.

89
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,890
Making sure that we now know
what the density is, let's go

90
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,360
back to what we were
doing before.

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,330
We said that the downward force
is equal to the mass of

92
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,300
the liquid times the
gravitational force, and so

93
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,390
what is the mass
of the liquid?

94
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,250
We could use this formula right
here-- density is equal

95
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,490
to mass times volume, so we
could also say that mass is

96
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,660
equal to density times volume.

97
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,130
I just multiply both sides of
this equation times volume.

98
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,240
   

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,570
In this situation, force down is
equal to-- let's substitute

100
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,430
this with this.

101
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,300
The mass of the liquid is equal
to the density of the

102
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,910
liquid times the volume of the
liquid-- I could get rid of

103
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,110
these l's-- times gravity.

104
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,110
What's the volume
of the liquid?

105
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,150
The volume of the liquid
is going to be the

106
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,685
cross-sectional area of the
cylinder times the height.

107
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:53,110
So let's call this
cross-sectional area A.

108
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,290
A for area-- that's the area
of the cylinder or the foil

109
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,290
that's floating within
the water.

110
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,820
We could write down that the
downward force is equal to the

111
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,460
density of the fluid-- I'll stop
writing the l or f, or

112
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,800
whatever I was doing
there-- times the

113
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,310
volume of the liquid.

114
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,870
The volume of the liquid is just
the height times the area

115
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,390
of the liquid.

116
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:27,110
So that is just times the height
times the area and then

117
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,360
times gravity.

118
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,920
   

119
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,560
We've now figured out if we knew
the density, this height,

120
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,840
the cross-sectional area, and
the gravitational constant, we

121
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,100
would know the force
coming down.

122
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,800
That's kind of vaguely
interesting, but let's try to

123
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,610
figure out what the pressure
is, because that's what

124
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,180
started this whole discussion.

125
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,720
What is the pressure when you go
to deep parts of the ocean?

126
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,903
This is the force-- what is the
pressure on this foil that

127
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:01,190
I have floating?

128
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,060
It's the force divided by the
area of pressure on this foil.

129
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,400
So I would take the force and
divide it by the area, which

130
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,780
is the same thing as A,
so let's do that.

131
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,470
Let's divide both sides of this
equation by area, so the

132
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,850
pressure coming down--
so that's P sub d.

133
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,610
   

134
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,900
The downward pressure at that
point is going to be equal

135
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,460
to-- keep in mind, that's going
to be the same thing as

136
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,950
the upward pressure, because the
upward force is the same.

137
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,680
The area of whether you're going
upwards or downwards is

138
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,380
going to be the same thing.

139
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,130
The downward pressure is going
to be equal to the downward

140
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,430
force divided by area, which is
going to be equal to this

141
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,260
expression divided by area.

142
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,630
Essentially, we can just get
rid of the area here, so it

143
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:57,550
equals PhAg divided by A-- we
get rid of the A's in both

144
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,580
situations-- so the downward
pressure is equal to the

145
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,480
density of the fluid, times the
depth of the fluid, or the

146
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,040
height of the fluid above it,
times the gravitational

147
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,400
constant Phg.

148
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,430
As I said, the downward pressure
is equal to the

149
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,910
upward pressure-- how
do we know that?

150
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,360
Because we knew that the upward
force is the same as

151
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,230
the downward force.

152
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:26,170
If the upward force were less,
this little piece of foil

153
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,480
would actually accelerate
downwards.

154
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,050
The fact that it's static-- it's
in one place-- lets us

155
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,250
know that the upward force is
equal to the downward force,

156
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,390
so the upward pressure
is equal to

157
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,520
the downward pressure.

158
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,640
Let's use that in an example.

159
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,650
If I were on the same planet,
and this is water, and so the

160
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:53,330
density of water-- and this is
something good to memorize--

161
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,805
is 1,000 kilograms
per meter cubed.

162
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,710
   

163
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,400
Let's say that we have no
atmosphere, but I were to go

164
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,230
10 meters under the
water-- roughly 30

165
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,000
feet under the water.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,980
What would be the
pressure on me?

167
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,840
My pressure would be the density
of water, which is

168
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,760
1,000 kilograms per meter
cubed-- make sure your units

169
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,750
are right, and I'm running out
of space, so I don't have the

170
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,110
units-- times the height,
10 meters, times the

171
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,970
gravitational acceleration, 9.8
meters per second squared.

172
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,440
It's a good exercise for
you to make sure

173
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,210
the units work out.

174
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,000
It's 10,000 times 9.8, so the
pressure is going to be equal

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,200
to 98,000 pascals.

176
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,500
This actually isn't that
much-- it just

177
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,960
sounds like a lot.

178
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,100
We'll actually see that this
is almost one atmosphere,

179
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,450
which is the pressure at sea
level in France, I think.

180
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,380
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

181
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:53,900
