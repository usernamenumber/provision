1
00:00:00,616 --> 00:00:04,529
Let's think about how a tax on a product might affect it,

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:10,879
if the demand for it is very, very, very elastic.

3
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:13,259
So what I've done here -- We're going to think about flags --

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,519
the market for a certain type 
of flag that's made in China.

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,650
And to think about this flag -- think about it this way.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,859
If the price -- the price right now -- the equilibrium price between

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,880
where the supply and the demand intersect --

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,880
the supply curve and the demand curve intersect --

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,416
is right about seventy dollars per flag.

10
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,682
So this is a pretty nice flag. It's right at seventy dollars per flag.

11
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:39,530
And the quantity demanded, in thousands per year,

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,450
it looks like it's about twenty five thousand

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,820
flags are demanded per year.

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,550
Now if at the price were to go slightly above

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,490
that equilibrium price,what's going to happen?

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,484
Well, if the price goes slightly above that

17
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:55,812
equilibrium price, people are going to say,

18
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:57,140
"Well, I can go by the American flags made in Taiwan,

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,420
or even the ones made in America, or made in Mexico,

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,810
or made some place else. [Because...]

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,439
"People won't be able to tell the difference from a distance."

22
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,140
So I'm going to buy one of the substitutes --

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,380
[because] especially the ones from Taiwan or Mexico

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,893
or wherever else. are identical to the ones made in China.

25
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:15,761
So if the price for slightly -- even slightly higher,

26
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:19,068
the quantity demanded would be much, much, much lower.

27
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:23,320
And if the price were even a little bit lower,

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,828
then people say, "I'm not going to buy the Mexican flag--

29
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:27,979
or the Taiwanese [or] American flags.

30
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:29,130
I'm going to buy the ones that were made in China."

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,060
And then the quantity demanded would be much larger.

32
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,030
And so what you have here is a very large,

33
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,194
a high elasticity of demand.

34
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:41,359
So this right over here, this is almost perfectly elastic.

35
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,329
If it was perfectly elastic, it would be completely horizontal.

36
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:48,020
So this is almost almost almost perfectly --

37
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:55,020
perfectly elastic -- elastic demand.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,630
A very small change in price leads to a huge change in quantity.

39
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,159
In particular a very small percentage change in price

40
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,399
leads to a huge percent change in quantity.

41
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:08,679
So let's say that -- that some government

42
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:09,960
official decides, "You know what? [I] don't like the

43
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,930
idea of American flags being made in China."

44
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,770
So they decide to tax American flags made in China.

45
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,610
So what they do is that they place a tax, they place a tax --

46
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,170
And once again I'll do a fixed dollar tax.

47
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,060
It could be a percentage and if a percentage
then it'll change the sup -- the supply

48
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,310
plus tax curve
It'll be -- the shift will will be a percentage change

49
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,500
instead of a fixed change.

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,180
But the fixed change
is a little bit easier to draw,

51
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,580
so I'll do that.

52
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,750
So let's say that there is a tax --

53
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,920
Let me do that in a different color
Let's say that there's a tax placed of ten dollars --

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,620
ten dollars per flag.

55
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,430
Ten dollars, actually --
Let's do an even a smaller amount.

56
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,100
Let's say that there is a tax placed of
of one dollar per flag -- one dollar per flag.

57
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,290
I'll make it a little bit larger.
Let's say it's five dollars per flag --

58
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,040
five dollars per flag.

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,080
So now what is the supply plus tax curve?
So the supplier / just to make the flags in

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,120
China and ship them to United States and get the

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,840
story here even to get that first flag done

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,510
even if is that in the most efficient way
possible

63
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,590
looks do you need at least looks like around
fifty to fifty three dollars now

64
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,670
Now they're going now 
they're still going to need that

65
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,750
plus there's going to be a five dollar tax

66
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,830
on it
So supply plus tax is going to be that plus

67
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,440
five dollars is going to be right around there

68
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,950
Over here, you add five dollars.

69
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,310
So at any given point, we're gonna add fivedollars
to essentially what the consumer would have to see.

70
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,500
\\So you would have a curve that looks something

71
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,060
like this you would have a curve that looks
something

72
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,780
like this
you would have a curve that looks something

73
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,200
like this.
That dotted line right over there is our supply

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,690
is our supply plus tax.

75
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,810
This right over here was just our supply --was
just our supply.

76
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,550
So you're essentially --
So let's think about what happens here.

77
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:57,300
Your equilibrium price was at seventy before.
Now our equilibrium price is still --

78
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,320
Our equilibrium price is still pretty much
at seventy.

79
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,820
But our equilibrium quantity has gone down
dramatically.

80
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,890
Our equilibrium quantity has gone down to
--

81
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,380
our equilibrium quantity has gone down to
--

82
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,020
I don't know.
It looks like about eighteen thousand.

83
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,219
Eighteen thousand flags per year.

84
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:21,159
So who bore -- who bore the bulk of this right
over here?

85
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:25,810
So let's think about the tax revenue
So the tax revenue in this situation is going

86
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,219
to be eighteen thousand
times the five dollars.

87
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:33,020
So this is the five dollars right over here.
That is five dollars -- and then times eighteen

88
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,289
thousand --
times eighteen thousand.

89
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:40,719
So this right over here is the tax revenue.
That right over there is a tax revenue.

90
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:45,349
Actually, let me draw a little bit more carefully
so the tax revenue is

91
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:50,030
This is going to be between this line right
over here and five dollars.

92
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,889
So just like that.
So that's all the tax revenue.

93
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:55,810
And notice.
It all came out of the producer surplus.

94
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,210
The original producer surplus -- the original
producer surplus was --

95
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,039
Especially if we assume perfect elasticity
--

96
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:08,889
The original producer surplus was this green
rectangle plus this and plus this.

97
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:12,249
Now this is going to be --
This little area right over here is going

98
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:15,599
to be dead weight loss --
dead-weight loss.

99
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:18,669
And all of that came from the producer's
surplus.

100
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:22,629
And then the all the tax revenue, also --
If you especially if you assume this top-line

101
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:27,430
was horizontal --
also came out of the producer surplus.

102
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,520
So in this situation where you had almost
where you

103
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,240
We could say, if if you do have perfect elasticity
if you have perfect elasticity of demand for

104
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,819
the product,
The person who's going to bear the the brunt

105
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:41,960
of the tax --
so -- is going to be the producer.

106
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,419
The producer surplus is going to be eaten
into from the tax.

107
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,069
Bears -- bears the
Actually that's not -- that's not

108
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:51,949
(I'm not talking about the animal, "bears.")
The producer, --

109
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:56,629
You know -- I'm not -- well --
The producer gets the burden the producer

110
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:00,219
The producer gets the burden in that situation.

111
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:02,349
And this is an interesting thing to think
about.

112
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:05,650
Because when you have almost perfectly elastic
demand --

113
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,650
so a -- almost -- or if you said perfectly
elastic demand --

114
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,050
a flat -- a flat demand curve right over here
--

115
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,110
there's -- there's actually no consumer
surplus,

116
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,520
because the marginal benefit, even the incremental
marginal or --

117
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,539
(I'm -- I'm being redundant with the words
incremental and marginal.)

118
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,259
But the marginal benefit at any point for
the consumer for -- that -- for that next

119
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,069
unit is equal to
the price they're paying, when you have --

120
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:32,689
There's no -- There's --
Especially if the the especially if the demand

121
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:35,610
curve is perfectly elastic -- and it's perfectly
horizontal --

122
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,969
There is no area between the demand curve
and the price paid.

123
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:42,719
So there's actually --
There's isn't any -- even any consumer surplus

124
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:46,639
to take any --
to take any of the -- to take -- to eat into.

125
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,349
It all gets eaten out of the out of the producer
surplus.
