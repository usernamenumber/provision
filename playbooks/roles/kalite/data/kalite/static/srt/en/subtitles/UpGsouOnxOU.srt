1
00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:09,163
Oh Hi, Arthuro Petori here

2
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:11,113
But you can call me Art.

3
00:00:11,113 --> 00:00:13,063
This is explorations in Art History

4
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:16,964
Starring: Me! and The Hand!.

5
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:19,513
What about rest of me?

6
00:00:19,513 --> 00:00:28,667
Oh people watching from arround the world, stuck lanes, or some five fingered primadona

7
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:31,242
Oh, oh that's better, right? see?

8
00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:39,797
It looks like we will be talking about

9
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:42,146
the Medieval and Byzantine periods

10
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:44,496
It had taken many lifetimes and countless battles

11
00:00:44,496 --> 00:00:46,032
to conquer and maintain the vast regions of the Roman Empire

12
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:51,168
When Emperor Theodosius the first took power,

13
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:53,871
he ruled over lands that stretched from Portugal to Palestine

14
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:58,187
The question of succession of power

15
00:00:58,187 --> 00:01:00,334
had always been a problem in the Empire and

16
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,482
for Theodosius it came down to a choice beetwen two sons.

17
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:07,780
Or did it?

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,679
In 395 AD, Theodosius, instead, split the Empire in half.

19
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:14,405
The Western half became domain of his son Honorius

20
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:17,000
We call it the 'Western Roman Empire'

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,400
The Eastern half was awarded to his son Arcadius

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,411
and became known as the Byzantine Empire

23
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:31,422
The two kingdoms both considered themselves Roman,

24
00:01:31,422 --> 00:01:34,045
though they spoke Latin in the West and Greek in the East

25
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:36,669
Honorius and the Western Roman Empire were besieged

26
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:39,536
by barbarian hordes from the beginning.

27
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:42,404
Huns,Goths, Vandals and Franks all took turns

28
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:43,865
invading Western territories.

29
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:45,326
Sacking Rome became a barbarian pastime.

30
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:54,567
And the Vandals, thanks to their exceptional

31
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:59,632
act of destruction and violence gave us the world the 'vandalism.'

32
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:04,068
It was a rough and tumble time.

33
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:08,890
Only 81 years after the death of Theodosius,

34
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,301
the Western Roman Empire ceased to exist.

35
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,713
With the Empire spindled into separate countries, the one unifying force to remain is the Catholic church and the Pope

36
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:19,255
The Byzantine Empire, on the other hand, would last another thousand years

37
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:25,550
In 730 AD, Emperor Leo the third initiated the movement called the Iconoclasm

38
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:31,847
based on strict interpretation of ten commandments which forbade the making and worshipping of the grave images

39
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:40,935
and perhaps due to rising influence of Islamic culture. The Iconoclasm sacked the removal or destruction of paintings subsculptures

40
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:42,187
There's one.

41
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:43,550
This way man arhhh

42
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:52,137
Get him, I got that one, There's one, there's another one go and get it. Ohh we are too late

43
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:56,595
Yea, stop him. Stop him now! Hurry!

44
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:09,715
After Iconoclasm ended, the Byzantine artists were limited to copying approved images from the past

45
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:19,785
I'm a copy, of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy

46
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:25,582
Back in Rome, Pope Gregory the second rejected iconoclasm and denounced it as heretical.

47
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:30,639
He even sent a letter excommunicating Iconoclasm

48
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,454
It's byzantine blasphemy. Excommunicate them!

49
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:45,519
As a result, artist in the West had more creative freedom. The church was the major patron of the art and so most medieval art had reliogious themes

50
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,594
Western artists of the later middle ages were interested in visionary experiences.

51
00:03:50,594 --> 00:04:00,687
Over time, in the search to create more convincing and powerful images. Their art became more realistic in its patrial of people and natural world

52
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:07,008
I have dimension

53
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:17,364
This is Art saying thanks for sharing another fascinating exploration into... heyy.. I am not finished
