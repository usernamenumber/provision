Art historians generally like to discuss things that

2
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:08,821
they do know, things that they've discovered,

3
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:12,126
things that they're sure of, but so often we don't

4
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:15,275
know much. And that's certainly the case with this

5
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:18,393
stunning portrait by Petrus Christus called only,

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,588
"Portrait of a Young Woman [Girl]"

7
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:23,501
So let's start with what we do know: we know that this

8
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:25,508
is a young woman, we know who the artist is, we

9
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:27,439
know that the artist is Flemish and the portrait was

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,039
made around 1470. We of course know it's

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,686
dimensions: it's quite small, and it's made out of oil

12
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:36,285
and it's on panel, and we know that it's exquisite.

13
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:39,275
And we also know that this portrait is somewhat

14
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:42,110
revolutionary. Petrus Christus was the first artist in

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,623
Flanders to place his subjects in an actual space,

16
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:49,161
and although there's not much, we do see a bit of

17
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:53,539
molding, a rear wall, and it does place her in space.

18
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:56,527
So, what do we want to know that we don't know

19
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:59,006
about her? I'm really hungry for information; I want

20
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:01,736
to know so much. I want to know who she is.

21
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:04,469
I want to know what she's thinking about.

22
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:06,573
I want to know where she's looking.

23
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:08,804
I want to know what, if anything, she's holding in her

24
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:12,543
hands. [laughs] I want to know who this portrait

25
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:15,409
was made for, who commissioned it, and what was

26
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,209
it's purpose. I want to know if this is the first time

27
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:20,693
she's ever worn this fabulous dress. I want to know

28
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:23,994
what that little loop is just over her forehead that

29
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:27,009
peeks out from under her hat. I want to know what

30
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,804
she dreams about at night. I want to know if she

31
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:32,953
has any ambitions. I want to know how old she is.

32
00:01:32,953 --> 00:01:35,702
But you know what, even though we know so little

33
00:01:35,702 --> 00:01:38,641
about this, I still love looking at it.
