1
00:00:08,886 --> 00:00:14,540
Let’s say I’m forty years old

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,907
I'm married

3
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:20,637
I have two children

4
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:25,429
and I’m the main income earner for my family

5
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:29,157
so I earn most of the income for my family

6
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:33,116
And we also have a mortgage

7
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:40,812
And I’m hoping that my kids go to college and that I will be able to pay for college

8
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:45,042
And I also want to make sure that my spouse if anything were ever happened.

9
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:46,765
Can retire

10
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:52,766
Cause maybe my spouse, does not have the income generating ability or maybe

11
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:52,766
maybe you know even

12
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:58,832
If here she does ...They would have to a large degree have to take care of the children if anything were to happen to me

13
00:00:58,832 --> 00:01:04,168
So because of all of these things that I want to make sure. Get paid off or get funded

14
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:09,112
In the event that I die... I think about getting a life insurance

15
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,958
Uhh think about getting life insurance

16
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:15,181
I think most of us understand the general idea about life insurance

17
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:18,450
You pay certain amount on regular basis

18
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:25,978
and in the event that you were to die your relations wherever you uhh whoever you put as the beneficiaries

19
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:29,505
of your life insurance policy

20
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:32,545
And those people we'll get some money

21
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:34,946
but life insurance isn't quite that simple

22
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:39,389
In one version of live insurance is ... the other one is less simple

23
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:42,094
So there's two types of life insurance

24
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:45,700
One is: term life insurance

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,436
and the other is whole life insurance....whole

26
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:56,737
I will talk about term because frankly: term life insurance is simpler.

27
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:59,409
So I go to the insurance agent and the insurance agent says

28
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,770
look if you pay a premium

29
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,022
if you pay a premium

30
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:08,273
every year of five hundred dollars of the ....

31
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:14,476
the word premium litterally just means the amount that you would pay every year

32
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:20,327
If you pay a premium of five hundred dollars every year for ten years

33
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:23,256
so the term here is ten years

34
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,904
ten years

35
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:32,369
if you are to die at any point over dose ten years we will give you

36
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:37,893
We will give you five hundred thousand dollars... I guess it's

37
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:42,519
more exactly we will give your family, or we will give the beneficiaries of your policy

38
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,914
five hundred thousand dollars.

39
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:49,415
the beneficiaries are the people who would benefit from your policy who would get the payout

40
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:52,178
If ... In the event that you were to die

41
00:02:52,178 --> 00:03:01,196
over the next ten years 
You will pay about five thousand dollars if you were to die your family will get 500 000 dollars

42
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:05,314
and the reason why this works out for the insurance company is that

43
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:08,651
the insurance company figures it out … ok if you don’t smoke, you have good health

44
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:13,005
It’s unlikely that you’re going to die in the next ten years and so

45
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:16,967
if the average over many many thousands of people, they’re going to make money.

46
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:20,929
Some people are going to randomly die but they were gonna to get premium from everyone else.

47
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:23,788
And that’s going to more than offset the payoffs that they need to give for the people

48
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:29,109
who are just randomly ran accident or who die for whatever reason

49
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,721
The reason why this is called term life is that

50
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:35,519
if you don’t die after those ten years

51
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,355
You have to then get a new insurance policy

52
00:03:38,355 --> 00:03:40,231
if you don’t get a new insurance policy

53
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:43,610
After those ten years that you didn’t die, nothing really happens

54
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,592
you just keep on living

55
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,157
All of these money that you have put it in, kind of goes away

56
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:50,116
just goes to insurance company you gave it to them

57
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:54,538
in the event that you might have died in those ten years.

58
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:56,998
You didn’t. All is fine now

59
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:59,710
What’s unfortunate, well this is probably good enough for you

60
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,171
because ten years you know for … forty to fifty years old.

61
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:06,788
Maybe that’s the time your kids can start go to college

62
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,553
but not give you enough time to save more money for retirement or

63
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:14,242
to give you time to pay off more of the mortgage and maybe save up some more money for college..

64
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:16,786
hey ten years was perfect for me

65
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:19,914
if you think when you’re forty years old and [hey] I want more time

66
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:21,958
I want more time to

67
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,251
uhh pay off the mortgage

68
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:24,335
uhh save money for college

69
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:26,254
save money for retirement

70
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:28,465
than you can make this a twenty-year policy

71
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:31,718
then you could make this a twenty-year policy

72
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:36,730
and if you make this 20year than .. your premium is going to be a little bit higher.

73
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,044
You’re gonna pay every year

74
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:42,521
but the reason why this premium is going to be a little bit higher is that you have a higher chance of dying from ages,

75
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,565
from ages

76
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:51,213
uhh ffifty to sixty than you did for ages forty to fifty. So the insurance company will figure out those probabilities

77
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:54,348
and charge you slightly more a larger amount

78
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:58,193
but regardless anyway you look like, anyway you look at it…

79
00:04:58,193 --> 00:05:01,456
at a term policy fade fix premium for fixed term.

80
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:06,211
If you pass away over that term, your family gets the payoff, if they,

81
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:09,214
if you don’t … then the policy just expires

82
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:12,502
and you have to get another term life policy

83
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:16,596
and at some point maybe by the time that you’re seventy years old and if you haven’t...

84
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:18,849
if you haven’t passed away and hopefully you haven’t

85
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:22,352
it’s actually very hard to get term life policy when you’re 70 because

86
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:26,982
insurance companies would say that you have high probability of passing away between the age of seventy and eighty

87
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:29,734
and we don’t want to take that risk

88
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:34,447
so term life is really good if you feel that there’s a set amount in your life

89
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:38,159
where you just want to make sure im around for the next ten or twenty years to

90
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:42,747
take care of a lot of obligations if anything were to happen.

91
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:48,795
then my family can use the payoff from the policy to take care of these obligations for themselves

92
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:53,508
and this is actually what I have. I have a term life policy cause I am

93
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:56,011
I am right now thirty four years old and

94
00:05:56,011 --> 00:06:00,835
I have mortgage and I have young child 
and I want to make sure that if anything were to happen to me over the next...

95
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:04,521
I believe my policy term is the twenty years

96
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:07,171
If … were to happen over the next twenty years

97
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:14,177
that my family will get enough money that to pay off the mortgage and have money for college and that maybe some money for my wife’s retirement

98
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:16,263
The other type of policies is whole life

99
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:21,393
and whole life is the motivation for whole life policies.

100
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:24,879
Comes from the idea that people did not like the id...

101
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,697
people did not like this notion

102
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:31,673
That you pay money in a term life policy year after year after year

103
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:36,761
but if you don’t die which is frankly good thing, but if you don’t die

104
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:39,013
then all that money just went, went for nothing 
You don’t get it back..

105
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:42,350
.. you didn’t save it in any way or anything like that

106
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,018
And another issue is

107
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:47,480
Is that term life is only valid for a certain term.

108
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:54,439
10 years, 20 years whatever it might be. Some people want the idea that [hey] I wanna keep gaining a premium my entire life

109
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,920
and
when I die, and all we know all of us will die.

110
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,744
when I die there will be a payoff so... uhhh

111
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:05,664
if I'm forty years old, I might be paying that premium for the next forty years

112
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:08,908
but what If I’m eighty and I pass away at my eighty

113
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:13,538
then my family will still get something for all of this insurance that I paid.

114
00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:18,701
So whole life can kind of appeal to all of these notions that

115
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:23,290
that you’re saving some of these premium but your family definitely will get a payoff

116
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:26,490
but the insurance company aren't silly people. They're very ughh scrutinize probabilities.

117
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:26,490
They want to make sure

118
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,830
that it’s a profitable thing for them

119
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:39,465
so really what they do is a whole life policy... is it that they charge you more so that you get a lot of what’s kind of in the term life policy.

120
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:41,362
a lot of the insurance aspects of it

121
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:44,910
and you also get at saving part but they charge you a lot for that

122
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,162
for that ... so it comes out to be a good deal for them.

123
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:50,623
so the whole life policy for the same forty-years old.

124
00:07:50,623 --> 00:07:55,878
and I'm just making up the same numbers, you should contact it in insurance agents 
if you want more accurate numbers.

125
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:57,380
your premium

126
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,383
your premium let’s say … it’s also for five hundred thousand dollar pay off.

127
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:05,805
Your premium in the situation could be a lot higher than in the term life policy

128
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:12,436
so it could be maybe it is five thousand dollars. Five thousand dollars per year

129
00:08:12,436 --> 00:08:14,814
and the term is your whole life

130
00:08:14,814 --> 00:08:17,358
the term .... so there’s no term.

131
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:23,273
I shouldn’t even write term cause is no term, it’s your whole life

132
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:26,818
That’s the name of the policy, and if you were to die.

133
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:31,415
At any points we’ll just keep paying this policy until you die and then your family will get the pay off

134
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:34,702
will get the five. so upon death...

135
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:41,592
the beneficiares are the people, who will benefit from you policy. Will get $500 000

136
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:46,224
so you might be say where this is a complete rip off. I'm paying ten times more

137
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,602
but the same it’s the same death benefit

138
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:52,481
and there is a couple things to think about
why it’s not quite that much of a rip off.

139
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:58,362
Being always a little bit more 
less financially savvy than the term life is that…

140
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:00,610
this is going to this

141
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,638
as long as you continue to pay this premium this is guarantee,

142
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:08,265
cause you will die one day unless you know something the rest of us don’t know.

143
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:09,872
You will die some day so

144
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:14,657
In the term life case once you become sixty or seventy

145
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:18,172
and insurance companies charge you a lot higher of premium to insure you for this amount,

146
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:19,841
because they think there is a high probability that they would have to pay it off.

147
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:22,218
In the whole live

148
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:28,850
You pay the same.. I would call it very high premium your entire life and so earlier on in your life

149
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,439
when you’re thirty or forty or fifty. This premium is definitely going to be higher than a term life premium

150
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:37,527
But maybe when you become seventy

151
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:42,699
if you were seventy years old and you were asked for term life policy what you might not even be able to get one or

152
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:49,202
if you if you were able to get one their will charge you huge premium. Maybe it would be 6 000 dollars a year or

153
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:53,582
maybe it will be 10 000 dollars a year and at that point here this would be a little bit cheaper

154
00:09:53,582 --> 00:10:02,465
the other thing that the whole life policy does for you is that the insurance companies implicitly
setting aside some of this money to just purely insure you life,

155
00:10:02,465 --> 00:10:05,385
but they’re also setting aside some of this money

156
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:10,265
so there’s some kind of putting it aside as cash

157
00:10:10,265 --> 00:10:14,561
and that cash does build up over time 
not all of your premium goes into this cash,

158
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:16,938
but some of your premium does.

159
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:22,068
Early on the first year premium using of that kind of just goes to the insurance company

160
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:28,492
And that every year a fraction of your premium 
does go into a kind of savings account within the insurance company

161
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:32,974
and you get so let me call it: cash savings

162
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:41,147
where you can get interest.. get interest while… it is with the insurance company is getting interest on a tax- deferred basis

163
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:46,201
So someone try to sell you whole life and say hey this is a good deal

164
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:52,362
you pay a premium, you’re guaranteed this premium, you’re whole life you will and you family will eventually get the death benefit as long as you continue to pay the premium and

165
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:56,311
rebuildling up this cash savings for you

166
00:10:56,311 --> 00:11:02,209
at some point you decide.. hey look all of these risks are there for my family anymore

167
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:04,070
I don’t wanna pay this premium anymore

168
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,413
Maybe you’re sixty five years old.

169
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:11,702
You’ve paid off your mortgage. You’ve saved up bunch of money and you say…. look I'm going to stop paying this

170
00:11:11,702 --> 00:11:16,916
when I’m sixty five so this will kind of go out of the picture 
but then you can get the cash payout

171
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:22,337
so all of this extra cash in interest you will be able to get that for yourself what

172
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:27,677
they won’t tell you until you feel good about it, it’s like a lot like life insurance it’s like savings at the same time

173
00:11:27,677 --> 00:11:33,724
what they might not clarify as much is that they’re taking huge fees on this cash savings

174
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:36,936
So you probably would have been back definitely would have been better off

175
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:40,475
and if this was your point if you wanted to save some

176
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:44,819
and stil have life insurance for a fixed amount of time. Until you were able to take care of these obligations,

177
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:52,410
you probably would have been better off, paying by a term life policy and paying this lower premium

178
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,498
And then taking the difference if this really is the difference, I just made up these numbers for simplicity,

179
00:11:57,498 --> 00:12:02,543
but taking the difference maybe the difference is forty five hundred dollars each year and

180
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:07,758
putting this into a savings account or investing it 
Or putting it in a mutual fund whatever you do.

181
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:13,846
It’s overtime, over the terms party, that you will probably save more money and get more interest doing this

182
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:18,277
Because you won't be implicitly paying all of these fees to the insurance company.

183
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:22,771
I just realized that I didn’t answer a question that might be burning in your brain

184
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:26,274
because in whole life we talk about the scenario

185
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:29,412
Where you can pay this premium your whole entire life and in the event and

186
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:31,236
you can just all the way until the day you die,

187
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:37,034
so that when you die your family will definitely get the pay off.

188
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:41,163
They will get $500k upon your death.

189
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:48,794
And we also talked about the scenario where any time before that you decide that I don’t need life insurance anymore,

190
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:50,922
you can stop paying your premium.

191
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:55,589
You’re family wont get the death benefit in the event that you die

192
00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:00,784
but you would get cash payout or whatever is left after the insurance company has taken their fees

193
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:06,032
and set side for the insurance component of what they’re selling you,

194
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:07,936
but the question you might ask –

195
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:12,147
is what happens to the cash amount?

196
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:15,901
Because before you die you can cash it out,

197
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:19,238
if you die, you definitely get the payoff, but what happens to the cash amount.

198
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:22,283
And the answer is you don’t get it.

199
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:23,951
you don't get it!

200
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:28,747
It's kind of viewed as what’s backing up your death benefit and

201
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:37,088
what’s kind of unfortunate if for whatever reason this cash amount is even larger than the death benefit.

202
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:45,596
Maybe you know, you live unusually long amount of time, you live fifty years and you’re paying or you live to 90s

203
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,849
so you live fifty years from the day that you start the policy.

204
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:55,231
So you pay two hundred fifty thousand dollars but you have to remember compound interest, you’re getting returnes on that year after year.

205
00:13:55,231 --> 00:14:01,992
Maybe this cash payout becomes six hundred thousand dollars when you accrue

206
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:03,849
all the interests and everything else in it.

207
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:07,995
Regardless of that fact, although this would be kind of silly thing for you to do.

208
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:14,293
Regardless of that fact if you were to die your family would only get the five houndred thousand dollars.

209
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:16,170
Which really makes you ask the question,

210
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:23,076
if you know your cash payout is larger than the amount of that is going to be paid off when you die.

211
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:29,577
Then the best thing to do is just stop paying premium and get the cash payout and give that to your family.

212
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,101
While rather than waiting around to die.

213
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:33,519
This is worse in two ways.

214
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,316
One you die and in the second way you’re actually getting less money.

215
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:45,032
But just answer your question, in the event of your death your family does not see the savings portion,

216
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:49,109
they only get this payout right over here.
