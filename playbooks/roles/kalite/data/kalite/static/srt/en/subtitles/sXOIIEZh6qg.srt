1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,720
I said I would get you a more
interesting mass composition

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,100
to empirical formula problem,
one that doesn't just have a

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,590
straight-up 2:1 ratio.

5
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:09,880
And so here it is.

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,350
I have a bag of stuff.

7
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,160
Or let's call this a
bottle of stuff.

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,930
Maybe it's in its liquid form.

9
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:21,930
And it happens to be 2.04%
hydrogen, 65.3% oxygen, and

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,070
32.65% sulfur.

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,950
What is the empirical formula,
what's our best stab at the

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,240
empirical formula, of
this substance?

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,479
So what we would do, like we
do in all these problems,

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,690
let's just assume we've got
100 grams of the stuff.

15
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,840
So we have 100 grams
of the stuff.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,400
So we assume 100 grams. Let me
do that in a good yellow.

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:52,110
So let's say, assume I have 100
grams. How many grams of

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,180
hydrogen do I have?

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,080
If I have 100 grams total, 2.04%
of that is hydrogen, so

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,360
I have 2.04 grams of hydrogen.

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,349
I have 65.3 grams of oxygen.

22
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:13,030
And I have 32.65 grams
of sulfur.

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,280
Now, what we need to do now is
figure out how many moles of

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,100
hydrogen is this.

25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,580
How many moles of oxygen.

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,900
And how many moles of sulfur.

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,570
Then we can compare the ratios
and we should be able to know

28
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,820
the empirical formula.

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,060
   

30
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,080
What is the mass of 1
mole of hydrogen?

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,370
Let me write that.

32
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:36,130
So 1 mole of hydrogen.

33
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,160
Well we know what the mass
number for hydrogen is.

34
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,100
It's 1.

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,400
And especially, the atomic
weight, also for hydrogen, if

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,800
we were to take it on Earth.

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,120
The composition, you
pretty much just

38
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,340
find hydrogen nucleuses.

39
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,520
If it's neutral, it
has an electron,

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,250
but it has no neutrons.

41
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,220
So it has an atomic mass of
one atomic mass unit.

42
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,520
So one mole of hydrogen.

43
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,470
If you have a ton of hydrogens
together, or a mole of them,

44
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:07,930
not a ton, I shouldn't say, you
have 6.02 times 10 to the

45
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,360
23 hydrogens.

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,590
Then you take hydrogen's atomic
mass number in atomic

47
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,050
mass units.

48
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,250
And you say, well, it'll
be that many grams

49
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,360
of hydrogen, right?

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,230
So if you immediately look up
here, if we have 2.04 grams of

51
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,680
hydrogen, how many moles
of hydrogen do we have?

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,110
Well, one mole is one
gram, so we have

53
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,720
2.04 moles of hydrogen.

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,460
Notice, this said what the
mass of the hydrogen is.

55
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,100
This tells us how many hydrogen
molecules we have.

56
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,000
Remember, this is 2.04 times
6.02 times 10 to the 23

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,050
hydrogen atoms. Moles
of hydrogen.

58
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,410
Maybe I should write
that down.

59
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,450
So one mole of hydrogen.

60
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,890
There you go.

61
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,210
And then oxygen.

62
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,200
One mole of oxygen.

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,560
Oxygen's mass number, in
case you forgot, is 16.

64
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,110
Right there.

65
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,270
Oxygen's mass number is 16.

66
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,740
So one mole of oxygen has a mass
of 16 grams. 6.02 times

67
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,650
10 to the 23 oxygen atoms
has a mass of 16 grams.

68
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,490
So how many moles
do we have here?

69
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,850
Let's see.

70
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:30,850
So if we take 65.3
grams of oxygen.

71
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,220
And we have 16 grams per mole,
so you divide by 16.

72
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,180
It equals 4.08125.

73
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,760
I don't want to get
too precise here.

74
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,540
But let me just write that.

75
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,810
4.08 moles of oxygen.

76
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,920
So I'm going to write that
in oxygen color.

77
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,870
So I have 4.08 moles
of oxygen.

78
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,410
And then finally, sulfur.

79
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,755
What is sulfur's atomic mass?

80
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,630
The one thing I'll never
forget about

81
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,460
sulfur is its smell.

82
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,540
There's a city in Louisiana
which we used to drive to all

83
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,170
the time -- I think we had some
family friends there--

84
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,790
called Port Sulfur.

85
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,640
And they did a lot of sulfur
processing there.

86
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,130
And lucky for the residents,
at least at the time-- I

87
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,160
apologize if they fixed the
issue-- it smelled like

88
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,940
sulfur, which smells
like rotten eggs.

89
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,390
But anyway, one mole
of sulfur.

90
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:28,480
   

91
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,680
So sulfur's atomic mass
is 32 atomic mass

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,310
units per sulfur atom.

93
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,630
So a whole mole of it is going
to have a mass of 32 grams. So

94
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,650
a mole of sulfur-- not a mule.

95
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,410
Maybe I should invent a new
unit called the mule.

96
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,230
So a mole of sulfur is
32 grams. So how

97
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,380
many moles do we have?

98
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,730
We have a little bit more than
one, but let's be precise

99
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,600
here, because everything else is
a little bit of a decimal.

100
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:09,050
So if we have 32.65 grams of
sulfur and we divide by the

101
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,170
number of grams per mole--
divided by 32 grams per mole--

102
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:25,280
we have 1.02 moles of sulfur.

103
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,590
This was hydrogen up here.

104
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,320
So here, you should hopefully
see a pretty good ratio, here.

105
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,690
For every one sulfur atom-- I
mean, the ratio worked exactly

106
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,640
out and that's because I did
this problem before.

107
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,250
I actually made up this problem
before we worked, so I

108
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,860
made it so the numbers
worked out.

109
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,210
But one mole of sulfur, for
every mole of sulfur, so for

110
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,380
every 6.02 times 10 to the 23
sulphur atoms, you have two

111
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,290
moles of hydrogen, right?

112
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,840
This ratio is 1:2.

113
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,240
Two times 1.02 is 2.04.

114
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,430
And then, for every one mole
of sulfur, you have

115
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,930
four moles of oxygen.

116
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,380
Right?

117
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,380
Literally, if you multiply this
times four you get 4.08.

118
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:09,960
So the ratio of hydrogen to
sulfur to oxygen is for every

119
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,620
one sulfur, we have
two hydrogens and

120
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,930
we have four oxygens.

121
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:25,110
So the empirical formula
of this is H2.

122
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,200
And then we have one sulfur.

123
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,290
And then we have four oxygens.

124
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,770
And this is sulfuric acid, one
of the things you would least

125
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,500
like poured on you
most of the time.

126
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,230
Anyway, hope you found
that useful.

127
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,743
