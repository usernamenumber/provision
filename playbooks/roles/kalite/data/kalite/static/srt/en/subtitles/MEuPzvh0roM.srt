Write the following numbers as complex numbers.

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:05,858
And just as a little review.

3
00:00:05,858 --> 00:00:10,398
A complex number is a number that has a real part or an imaginary part.

4
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:11,854
Actually, let me make that clear--

5
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:15,334
has a real part and an imaginary part.

6
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:24,188
So if I have a plus bi, where a is real and b is real, this is a complex number.

7
00:00:24,188 --> 00:00:28,832
This part right here is the real part.

8
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:32,305
And this part right here is imaginary.

9
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:37,566
And why is it imaginary? Because it is a scaled up version of this special number.

10
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:44,725
The imaginary unit. This special number "i." Scaled up by b, in this case.

11
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:48,449
And you may or may not already be familiar with it--I know it's kind of whacky.

12
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:53,860
But, the definition of i says that i squared is equal to negative one.

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,201
Hey, we didn't have any numbers before where if we took the square, we get negative one.

14
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:00,643
Now, if you take i squared, you get negative one.

15
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:05,155
So what's neat about imaginary numbers is that their squares are negative.

16
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:08,491
And what's useful about them is that it allows us to solve a bunch of equations

17
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:12,430
that we couldn't have solved if you're only looking for real solutions.

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,622
It has all sorts of implications. In Engineering, especially.

19
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:19,612
And other things, like physics, and all the rest.

20
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:25,218
So right now, you really just have to go with this definition.

21
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,621
And as we do more numbers, and especially as you start to see some more engineering applications,

22
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:34,697
hopefully you'll realize the value of imaginary numbers.

23
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:38,589
So going back to the problem, write the following numbers as complex numbers.

24
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:43,841
So this number is just a plain vanilla negative 21.

25
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:45,765
Well how do I write it as a complex number?

26
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:49,003
I write it as a combination of a real and an imaginary number.

27
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:57,010
So I could just write this as negative twenty-one plus zero times i.

28
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,658
Zero times i is zero, so it's still just going to be negative twenty-one.

29
00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:04,003
We have no imaginary part, really. So this is just a complex version of it.

30
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:05,818
Very straightforward.

31
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:07,786
Same thing down here.

32
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:10,830
Seven times i is in imaginary number, so there's no real part to this.

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,863
The real part is just zero.

34
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:23,108
This is zero plus seven i.
