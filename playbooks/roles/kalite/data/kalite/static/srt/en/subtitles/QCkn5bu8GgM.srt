1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,403
Adolf Hitler got his start in the military during World War I.

2
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:06,737
He's a dispatch runner on the Western Front;

3
00:00:06,737 --> 00:00:09,146
he actually gets fairly decorated.

4
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:12,206
And, by most accounts, this is where he finds meaning.

5
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:14,338
He finds meaning in being part of the military;

6
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:16,559
he finds meaning in, frankly, the war itself.

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,780
But, then, in 1918, we, of course, have the end of the war.

8
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:25,405
Well, first you have the abdication of the Kaiser;

9
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:28,405
you have a Republican government,

10
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:30,737
people who want to form a republic take control,

11
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:34,237
and then they sign an armistice with the Allies in November.

12
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:37,338
And this is not well received by Hitler.

13
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:40,005
And frankly, it's not well received by many in the military.

14
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,898
From their point of view, they somewhat delusionally believed

15
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:46,003
that Germany would have won World War I,

16
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:48,566
if they weren't stabbed in the back by these "November Criminals,"

17
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:52,315
by the folks who had taken over after the Kaiser.

18
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:54,482
So you have this whole "stabbed in the back" theory.

19
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:56,982
. . . "stab in the back" . . .

20
00:00:56,982 --> 00:01:00,237
by those who had taken over and signed the armistice.

21
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:02,235
And this wasn't just believed by folks like Hitler.

22
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:05,538
This was believed even by very senior people in the military.

23
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:08,605
This right over here is General Ludendorf, one of two people -

24
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:09,738
the other gentleman, Hindenberg -

25
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:13,670
who are in charge of the entire German military.

26
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,400
He believed in the "stab in the back" theory.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,004
He thought that they would have won if they didn't sign the armistice,

28
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:21,898
if these "November Criminals" - these people who had taken control of the government -

29
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:25,342
did not sign this with the Allies.

30
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:26,938
And then you go to 1919.

31
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:28,817
From the point of view of people like Hitler,

32
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:30,066
things only got worse.

33
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,899
You have the Treaty of Versailles,

34
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:34,149
that applied all the war guilt to the Germans.

35
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:37,403
You have these huge reparations that would even be paid in resources.

36
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:39,671
You have the former German Empire.

37
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:43,944
A significant amount of its territory is given over to the Allies,

38
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:45,900
or to form new states.

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,982
Then you also have the establishment - the formal establishment -

40
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:55,148
of the Weimar Republic. It's called the Weimar Republic

41
00:01:55,148 --> 00:02:00,004
because the new German constitution is drafted in the town of . . .

42
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:02,270
is drafted in the town of Weimar.

43
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,604
And it sets it up as a parliamentary democracy -

44
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:08,536
that's why we now call it - that's why it's called a republic.

45
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:11,404
But it's a little bit bizarre of a parliamentary democracy.

46
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:13,603
It actually gave a good bit of power to a directly elected president

47
00:02:13,603 --> 00:02:16,566
that had a reasonable amount of power, especially in emergencies,

48
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,816
and that would become relevant later on,

49
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:23,004
when Hitler actually comes to power over a decade later.

50
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:27,605
But then in 1919, Hitler was still looking, you know,

51
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,671
he was very upset about the war ending;

52
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,649
he stays part of the military.

53
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:35,481
And part of the military, he's assigned to start infiltrating,

54
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,337
or spying on the German Workers Party.

55
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:43,815
So, "spy on -" and the acronym in German is the DAP.

56
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:47,181
But the English translation would be the German Workers Party.

57
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:52,453
But he actually gets quite impressed by the German Workers Party,

58
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:54,788
which is really ultra-nationalist.

59
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:56,720
And when we talk about ultra-nationalist,

60
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,121
it's all about German race superiority,

61
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:05,321
it's in line with this whole idea that they would have won the war

62
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:07,521
if they weren't stabbed in the back,

63
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,932
and it's also anti-communist . . .

64
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:13,788
"anti-communist . . . "

65
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:21,885
it's anti-capitalist, and it's anti- ethnic minorities and in particular, anti-Jewish.

66
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,921
And all of these ideas, Hitler found very impressive.

67
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:29,348
And just to be clear, you know, a lot of times when people talk about ultra-nationalist groups,

68
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:35,388
they often will call them as ultra right-wing. "ultra-right-wing."

69
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:37,787
And this bears some clarification.

70
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:43,098
Because the right wing is also often viewed as very capitalist.

71
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,855
But ultranationalists really put the nation,

72
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:50,182
and kind of the race that they view as indicative of the nation,

73
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:52,654
above all other concerns.

74
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:54,388
So yes, they were anti-communist,

75
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:57,321
they were anti-distribution of wealth - you know,

76
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:01,521
communists believe in no classes, as little private property as possible,

77
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:05,253
the German Workers Party didn't believe in that.

78
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:06,016
They were anti that.

79
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,455
But they were also anti unfettered capitalism,

80
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:13,598
especially capitalism that might get in the way of the nation's interests.

81
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,188
But, he becomes very impressed with them,

82
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:20,599
and he actually joins. He actually joins, as the 55th member.

83
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,721
So you can imagine, this is a very - at this point -

84
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,597
is a very, very small party.

85
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:29,389
But, then we fast-forward to 1920.

86
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:34,098
By 1920, the party leadership has taken note of Hitler.

87
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:37,453
They find that - they actually notice him when he's arguing with people,

88
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:38,599
and that other people are listening.

89
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:40,683
He's actually a really great orator.

90
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:43,264
And so they allow him to give more and more talks,

91
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:44,122
he has more and more authority.

92
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:46,599
And in order for the party to have more of an appeal,

93
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:49,597
especially to nationalists in general, they change their name.

94
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:51,854
They add to German Workers Party, they add

95
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:59,271
the "Nationalist Socialist.". . . "Nationalist Socialist German Workers Party."

96
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:06,130
DAP, German Workers Party, or the "NSDAP."

97
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,919
And if you pronounce "Nationalist" in German,

98
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,230
it sounds something like - and I'm going to butcher it right now -

99
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,813
"Nazionalist"- and so if you were going to shorten it,

100
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,147
they called themselves the "Nazis."

101
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:18,980
"They called themselves the Nazis . . . "

102
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,479
and Hitler actually designed the logo for the Nazis,

103
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,811
which included this symbol right over here, the swastika.

104
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,813
And the swastika is worth talking about,

105
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:31,813
because it is really this bizarre corruption of a very ancient symbol.

106
00:05:31,813 --> 00:05:36,253
The - Hitler and the Nazis created this entire mythology

107
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:40,320
around the Germans being the descendants of the Aryans,

108
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,253
or being the purest example of the Aryans.

109
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:48,053
And the Aryans are the superior race that's responsible for all of civilization's advancement.

110
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:51,900
It was a delusion, because frankly, there was an ancient Aryan race,

111
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,400
but the best - the most indicative descendants of them

112
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,229
are frankly the Persians, or the Indians.

113
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,986
And actually, the swastika symbol here,

114
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,988
you might actually even see it at a Hindu temple.

115
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,186
It does not mean all of what we associated with Nazism now.

116
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:10,900
It actually is an ancient Hindu symbol of auspiciousness, of good luck,

117
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,054
but the Nazis usurped it.

118
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:15,900
But for them, this was a very important idea,

119
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,813
to create this mythology around race superiority,

120
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,480
and to even have a symbol like this,

121
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,987
as opposed to, say, something like a cross that's a religious symbol,

122
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:27,653
anyone can have a belief in say, Christianity,

123
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,853
and say "Hey, I'm a Christian,"

124
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:31,987
but the swastika, at least in Hitler's mind and the Nazis' mind,

125
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:33,653
was a racial symbol.

126
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:38,787
So it represented their superior race.

127
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:41,313
And obviously, if their race was superior,

128
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:45,780
a lot of what they considered the "ills" of Germany

129
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,063
were caused by being infiltrated with what they considered less pure races,

130
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:57,230
like Jews, and also infiltrated with less pure ideas, like the ideas of communism.

131
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,653
But Hitler gets more and more recognition with the party,

132
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,653
party membership continues to grow,

133
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:08,229
and by 1921, you have a - you have some disagreements in the party

134
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:09,654
some people threaten to splinter off,

135
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:15,121
and when Hitler says, "Hey look, if this is gonna happen, I'm gonna leave the party,"

136
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:17,479
they realize that he has so much value to the party

137
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,387
that the party would just dissolve if Hitler leaves.

138
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:21,045
And so they make him the chairman.

139
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:29,253
Hitler takes control. "Hitler is the chairman of the Nazi party. . . chairman."

140
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:33,207
And by this point, Hitler is well known or,

141
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:36,321
he's becoming more and more well known on the speaking circuit,

142
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:41,263
and we now have several thousand members of the Nazi Party.

143
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:43,597
Although it's still a fairly small group.

144
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:48,451
But then things start to get a lot worse in Weimar Germany.

145
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:50,950
You start having hyperinflation.

146
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:56,117
The government keeps printing more and more currency,

147
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:59,164
a lot of it in order - the economy's weak,

148
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:00,410
it's trying to pay reparations . . .

149
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,919
and so what you have here, this is actually one of the most famous cases of hyperinflation in world history.

150
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,854
You see the value of their currency,

151
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:11,585
it devalues from 1919 to 1923,

152
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:13,743
not by a factor of a thousand or a million or a billion,

153
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,326
but nearly a trillion!

154
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:20,253
So the currency becomes, frankly, worthless.

155
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:25,354
Then in 1922 - or, this - the hyperinflation is happening this entire time,

156
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:28,479
and you can see it accelerates through 1922 and then 1923,

157
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,143
but then in 1922 you have Mussolini comes to power in Italy,

158
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:34,728
and he comes to power through his March on -

159
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:39,321
"March on Rome." And Mussolini is a Fascist.

160
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:40,451
That's where the word comes from.

161
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:42,143
He's a member of the Fascist Party.

162
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:45,728
And the Fascists' ideas were very similar to the Nazis'.

163
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:47,653
It was all about extreme nationalism,

164
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:51,561
all about racial superiority, a very strong government.

165
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:53,856
And this is - Hitler finds quite inspiring.

166
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:58,519
You have the Weimar Republic is having difficulty, economic difficulty.

167
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,121
You have many other groups, including the Communists,

168
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:03,522
attempt their own coup détats. They fail.

169
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:05,894
But things are getting less and less stable.

170
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:09,187
Then you fast-forward to 1923.

171
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:12,320
The inflation is getting super bad,

172
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,650
about as bad as inflation can get.

173
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,921
The currency is worthless.

174
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:19,654
The economy is going into a tailspin.

175
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:23,054
And on top of that, because Germany can't pay the reparations to France any more,

176
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,452
France occupies the Ruhr.

177
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:30,149
So the Ruhr region is occupied - "occupied by France."

178
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:32,854
And you might remember from the terms of the Treaty of Versailles,

179
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:35,251
the Sahr region was already being occupied,

180
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,587
and all that coal was being shipped out to France.

181
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:41,919
The Ruhr region was another significant region of coal and steel production,

182
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,187
and now the French are fully occupying this,

183
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:46,812
they're forcing a lot of the civilians out of the region,

184
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:51,587
they're forcing a lot of the workers to work in the mines and the factories,

185
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:55,320
and then they're shipping all of that supply out to France.

186
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,787
So, this adds further -it further debilitates the economy,

187
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:00,561
but it's a huge humiliation.

188
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:02,522
The Treaty of Versailles, in the minds of Germans,

189
00:10:02,522 --> 00:10:04,186
especially the minds of nationalists,

190
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:10,120
was bad enough, but now you have this huge humiliation by the French.

191
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,794
And this isn't just amongst the nationalists.

192
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,650
The general German population is getting very, very, very, very upset about this.

193
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,986
And so, this gives a lot of fuel to extreme nationalist groups like the Nazis.

194
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:26,318
So this fuels the Nazis, and based on the estimates I've seen,

195
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:30,586
entering into the year, they're starting to have in excess of 10,000 members,

196
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,452
starting to be several tens of thousands, and by -

197
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:34,253
as we get into the later part of the year,

198
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:36,393
we're approaching, I've seen estimates of,

199
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:41,987
40,000 to 55,000 members of the Nazi Party

200
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:44,452
And that's just formal members, and then on top of that

201
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:48,228
you might have non-members who are growing increasingly sympathetic.

202
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:49,813
And so what we'll see in the next video

203
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:53,560
at the end of 1923, Hitler sees this as his chance.

204
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,654
He's inspired by Mussolini, the economy's in a tailspin,

205
00:10:56,654 --> 00:11:00,519
the Germans have been further humiliated by the French,

206
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,519
and they're starting to get - the Nazis in particular are starting to get quite popular.
