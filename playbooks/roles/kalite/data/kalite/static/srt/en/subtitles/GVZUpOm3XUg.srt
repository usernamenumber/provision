00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:06,170
What I want to do in this video is introduce the idea of a universal set or the universe that we care about

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,171
and also the idea of a complement, or an absolute complement.

3
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:16,061
If we're doing it as a Vien Diagram, the universe is usually depicted as some type of a rectangle right over here.

4
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:20,971
It itself is a set and it is usually denoted with the capital U

5
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:24,979
U for universe, not to be confused with the union set notation

6
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:29,903
and you could say that the universe is all possible things that could be in a set

7
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:39,770
including farm animals, and kitchen utensils, and emotions, and types of Italian food or even types of food

8
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:46,503
but then that just becomes somewhat crazy because you're literally thinking of all possible things.

9
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:51,369
Normally when people take about a universal set, they're talking about a universe of things that they care about.

10
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:55,684
So the set of all people, or the set of all real numbers, or the set of all countries

11
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:57,955
whatever the discussion is being focused on

12
00:00:57,955 --> 00:01:00,224
but we'll talk about it in abstract terms right now.

13
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:08,435
Let's say you have a subset of that universal set, set A.

14
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:12,956
Set A contains everything that I have just shaded in.

15
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:19,620
What we're going to talk about now is the idea of a complement, or the absolute complement of A.

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:34,456
The way you could think about this is this is the set of all things in the universe that aren't in A.

17
00:01:34,456 --> 00:01:37,042
We've already looked at ways of expressing this.

18
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:39,288
The set of all things in the universe that aren't in A.

19
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:42,767
We could also write as the universal set minus A.

20
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:47,901
Once again this is the capital U, this is not the union symbol over here.

21
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:55,633
Or we could write this as U slash A.

22
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:58,633
How do we represent that in the Vien Diagram?

23
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:05,166
It would be all the stuff in U that is not in A.

24
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:09,707
One way to think about it is as the relative complement of A that is in U

25
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:13,874
but when you're taking the relative complement of something that is in the universal set

26
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:15,965
you're really talking about the absolute complement.

27
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:18,767
When people talk about the complement, that's what they're saying.

28
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:24,710
What's the set of all the things in my universe that are not in A?

29
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,623
Let's make things a little bit more concrete by talking about sets of numbers.

30
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:35,040
Once again, we could have been talking about sets of TV personalities, or animals, or whatever it might be

31
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,207
but numbers are a nice simple thing to deal with

32
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:44,099
and let's say that our universe that we care about is the set of integers.

33
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,767
Our universe is the set of integers.

34
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,965
I'll write captial U is the set of integers.

35
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:56,832
This is a little bit on the side, but the notation for the set of integers tends a bold Z.

36
00:02:56,832 --> 00:03:01,376
It's Z for "zol" from German for integer.

37
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:04,767
The bold is this kind of weird looking "blackboard bold".

38
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:08,007
it's what mathematicians use for different types of sets of numbers.

39
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:10,617
I'll do a little on the side here.

40
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:19,837
They might write R like this for the set of real numbers.

41
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:30,633
They'll write a Q in that blackboard bold font (it looks something like this), this is the set of rational numbers.

42
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,718
You might say, "Why Q for rational?"

43
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:33,310
Well, there's a couple of reasons:

44
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,060
One, the R is already taken up

45
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,322
and Q for quotient, a rational number can be expressed as a quotient of integers

46
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:50,295
and we just saw the Z for zol or integers, the set of all integers.

47
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:53,360
So our universal set, the universe that we care about right now is integers

48
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:02,704
and let's define a subset of it, let's call that subset C (a letter that I haven't been using a lot).

49
00:04:02,704 --> 00:04:09,123
The set C is equal to -5, 0, and +7.

50
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,960
I'm obviously not drawing it to scale

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,789
the set of all integers is infinite while the set C is a finite set

52
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:19,560
but just to draw it, that is our set C right there.

53
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,893
And let's think about what is a member of C and what is not a member of C.

54
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:30,790
We know that -5 is a member of our set C.

55
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:40,124
This little symbol right here denotes membership, it looks a lot like the Greek letter epsilon, but it is not

56
00:04:40,124 --> 00:04:42,963
it just means membership of a set.

57
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:54,815
We know that 0 is a member of our set, and 7 is a member of our set.

58
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:56,297
We also know some other things.

59
00:04:56,297 --> 00:05:04,496
We know that the number -8 is not a member of our set.

60
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:12,162
We know that the number 53 is not a member of our set.

61
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:14,148
53 is sitting some place out here.

62
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:22,030
We know the number 42 is not a member of our set, 42 might be sitting some place out there.

63
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,982
Now let's think about C complement, or the complement of C.

64
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:30,497
C complement, which is the same thing as our universe minus C

65
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:37,300
which is the same thing as universe relative complement C.

66
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,162
These are all equivalent notation.

67
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:47,952
What is this in our diagram? It's all the stuff outside of our set C.

68
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:54,762
And now we know that -5 is a member of C, so it can't be a member of C complement

69
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:59,553
so -5 is not a member of C complement.

70
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:06,359
0 is not a member of C complement. 0 sits in C, not in C complement.

71
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:16,684
53 is a member of C complement. It's in the universe, but outside of C.

72
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:22,196
42 is a member of C complement.

73
00:06:22,196 --> 99:59:59,999
Hopefully that helps clear things up a little bit.
