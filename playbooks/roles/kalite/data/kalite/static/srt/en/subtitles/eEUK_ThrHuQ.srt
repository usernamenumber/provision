1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,980
I've got a 2 by 2 matrix here.

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,430
Let's say A is equal
to a, b, c, d.

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,990
So I'm going to keep
it really general.

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,570
So this is really any
2 by 2 matrix.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,070
What I want to do is use our
technique for finding an

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,920
inverse of this matrix to
essentially find a formula for

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,610
the inverse of a
2 by 2 matrix.

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,170
So I want to essentially find a
inverse, and I want to do it

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,390
just using a formula that it
just applies to this matrix

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,960
right here.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,020
So how can I do that?

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,300
Well, we know a technique.

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,690
We just create an augmented
matrix.

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,330
So let's just create an
augmented matrix right here.

16
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:43,110
So we have a, b, c, d, and then
we augment it with the

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,920
identity in R2, so 1, 0, 0, 1.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,410
And we know if we perform a
series of row operations on

19
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,680
this augmented matrix to get the
left-hand side in reduced

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,880
row echelon form.

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,500
The right-hand side, if the
reduced row echelon form here

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,790
gets to the identity, then the
right-hand side is going to be

23
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,710
the inverse.

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,780
So let's do it in this general
case, not dealing with

25
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,310
particular numbers here.

26
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,990
So the first thing I want to do,
or I would like to do, is

27
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,050
I would like to zero
this guy out.

28
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,060
What we want to do is we want
to zero that out, zero that

29
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,860
out, and then these two terms
have to become equal to 1.

30
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,810
So the best way to zero this
out, let's perform a little

31
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,470
transformation here.

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,790
So if I perform the
transformation on the columns,

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,560
C1, so those are the entries
of a column-- this would be

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,780
one column right here, that
would be another column right

35
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,440
there, that's the third column,

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,210
that's the fourth column.

37
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,170
But the transformation I'm going
to perform on each of

38
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,940
these columns, and we know this
is equivalent to a row

39
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,800
operation, is going to be equal
to-- since I want to

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,580
zero this one out, I'm going to
keep my first row the same,

41
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,000
so it's going to be C1, and I'm
going to replace my second

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,430
row with a times my second row
minus c times my first row.

43
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,790
Now why am I doing that?

44
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,240
Because a times c minus c times
a is going to be 0.

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,820
So this guy's going to be 0.

46
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,890
That's the row operation
I'm going to perform.

47
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,259
And I'm doing this so we can
kind of keep track, account

48
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,110
for what we're doing because
the algebra's going to get

49
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,305
hairy in a little bit.

50
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:15,920
So let me perform
this operation.

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,920
So if I perform that operation
on our matrix, what do we

52
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,950
have.

53
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,320
So our first row's going
to be the same.

54
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,010
Let me start with our second
row because that's a little

55
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,570
bit more complicated.

56
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:31,030
So I'm going to replace c with
a times c minus c times a.

57
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,710
That's ac-- so let me put it
this way-- so that's going to

58
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,930
be 0 right there.

59
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:45,820
I'm going to replace d with d
times a or a times d minus c

60
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,200
times C1 in this
column vector.

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,360
So minus c times b.

62
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,940
Let me write this as bc.

63
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,220
And then let me augment it.

64
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,830
And then this guy's going to be
a times 0, because he's C2

65
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,480
minus c times C1.

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,580
So it's going to be minus c.

67
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,340
And then finally, this guy right
here is going to be a

68
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,450
times 1-- a times this 1 right
here-- minus c times 0.

69
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,870
So that's just going
to be an a.

70
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,330
And then the first row is
pretty straightforward.

71
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,980
We know that the first row or
the first entries in our

72
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,820
column vectors just stay
the same through this

73
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,450
transformation.

74
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,790
So it's a, b, 1, 0.

75
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,000
And just to make sure you're
clear what we're doing, when

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
you perform this transformation
on this column

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,100
vector right here, you
got this column

78
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,550
vector right there.

79
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,450
When you perform the
transformation on this column

80
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,490
vector right there, you
get this column

81
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,560
vector right there.

82
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,020
Now I just want to make that
clear because I did all of the

83
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,200
second entries of all of the
column vectors at once because

84
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,080
we all were essentially
performing the same row

85
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,800
operation, so that just helped
me simplify at least my

86
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,570
thinking a little bit.

87
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,460
Let me stay in this mode.

88
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,180
So let's continue to get this
in reduced row echelon form.

89
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,020
The next thing we want to do
is, let's make another

90
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,020
transformation, we'll
call this T1.

91
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,780
That was our first
transformation.

92
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,180
Let's do another
transformation.

93
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,350
T2, or another set of
row operations.

94
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,490
So if I start with the column
vector C1, C2, what I want to

95
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,790
do now is I want to keep my
second row the same and I want

96
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,019
to zero out this character
right here.

97
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,760
I want to zero him out.

98
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,490
I know I'm going to keep my
second row the same, so C2 is

99
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,680
just going to still be C2.

100
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,470
But in order to zero this out,
what I can do is I can replace

101
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,000
the first row with this scaling
factor times the first

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,250
row minus this scaling factor
times the second row.

103
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,970
So it'll be ad minus bc times
your first entry in your

104
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,260
column vector minus b times
your second entry.

105
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,000
And the whole reason why I'm
doing that is so that this guy

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,820
zeroes out.

107
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,730
So if we apply that to this
matrix up here-- let's do the

108
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,610
first row first.

109
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,680
So this first entry right here
is going to be ad minus bc

110
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,725
times a, because that's C1--
let me write that down.

111
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:20,330
So it's ad minus bc times a
minus b times C2 minus 0.

112
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,210
So it's just going to be--
that second term

113
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,050
just becomes 0.

114
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,020
Fair enough.

115
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,310
Now what is this guy
going to be?

116
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,800
He's going to be-- I'll
write it out.

117
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:40,440
He's going to be ad minus bc
times b minus b times your C2

118
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,330
in this column vector, minus
b times ad minus bc.

119
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,040
   

120
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,070
And you can see immediately that
these two guys are going

121
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,370
to cancel out and you're
going to get a 0 there.

122
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,340
And then we've got
to augment it.

123
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,140
I want to make sure I don't run
out of space, I should've

124
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,050
started to the left
a little bit more.

125
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,640
So what's this guy
going to be?

126
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,316
Well I'm going to have this guy
times ad minus bc-- I'll

127
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:07,940
do it in pink-- so you're going
to have ad minus bc

128
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,950
times 1, which is just ad minus
bc minus b times C2, so

129
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,810
minus b times minus c.

130
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,060
So that's plus bc.

131
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,450
   

132
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:25,350
So 1 times ad minus bc
minus b times minus

133
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,620
c is equal to that.

134
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,460
And you can immediately see
that these two guys will

135
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:28,990
cancel out.

136
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,570
You're just [INAUDIBLE]

137
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,590
ad.

138
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,660
And then this guy over here,
you're going to have 0 times

139
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,440
ad minus bc, which is just
a 0, minus b times a.

140
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,070
So you have minus ab-- just
squeeze it in there.

141
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,240
And we know that our second
row just stays the same.

142
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,680
Our second row just stays the
same in this transformation.

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,580
So we had a 0 here, we're
still going to have a 0.

144
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,740
We had an ad minus bc.

145
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,880
We'll still have
an ad minus bc.

146
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,950
We had a minus c.

147
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,300
Then we had an a.

148
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,470
Just like that.

149
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,640
Now let me re-write this matrix
just so it gets cleaned

150
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,430
up a little bit.

151
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,100
So let me re-write
it right here.

152
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,150
I'll do it in my orange--
well, let me

153
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,910
do it in this yellow.

154
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:21,310
So I have ad minus bc times a.

155
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,490
And then this term right
here just became a 0.

156
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,200
This term right here is a 0.

157
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,010
This term right here
is an ad minus bc.

158
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,890
   

159
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,800
And then our augmented part,
this part was just an ad.

160
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,860
This was a minus ab.

161
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,660
This is a minus c.

162
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,310
And then this is an a.

163
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,460
Now we're almost at reduced row
echelon form right here.

164
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,550
These two things just have to be
equal to 1 in order to get

165
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,850
reduced row echelon form.

166
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,190
So let's define a transformation
that'll make

167
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,910
both of these equal to 1.

168
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,680
So if this was T2 let me define
my transformation T3.

169
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,570
   

170
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,170
You give it a column
vector, C1, C2.

171
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,740
And it's just going to scale
each of the column vectors.

172
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,650
So what I want to do is I want
to divide my first entries by

173
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,990
this scaling factor right here
so that this becomes a 1.

174
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:25,450
So I'm essentially going to
multiply 1 over ad minus bc

175
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,870
times a, so 1 over ad, bc, a
times my first entry in each

176
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,020
of my column vectors.

177
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,809
And then my second one I
want to divide by this.

178
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,600
So that this guy becomes a 1.

179
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,120
So I'm doing two scalar
divisions in one

180
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,020
transformation.

181
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:47,700
So this one's going to be 1
over ad minus bc times C2.

182
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,810
So I'm just scaling everything
by these two scaling factors.

183
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,840
So if you apply this
transformation to that right

184
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,820
there, what do we get?

185
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,960
We get a matrix.

186
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,920
And this guy, I'm going to
divide him by ad minus bc

187
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,010
times a, so I'm dividing
it by itself, so that

188
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,810
guy's going to be 1.

189
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,340
I'm going to divide 0 by
this, but 0 divided by

190
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,360
anything is just 0.

191
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,940
Then we're in an
augmented part.

192
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,340
ad divided by-- so let me
write it like this.

193
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,120
So ad-- I'm going to divide by
this-- so it's going to be ad

194
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,060
minus bc times a-- you
immediately see that the a's

195
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,450
cancel out.

196
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:34,180
This is going to be minus
ab divided by ad

197
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,640
minus bc times a.

198
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,900
Once again, the a's
cancel out.

199
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,150
And then in my second row are my
second entries in my column

200
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,940
vectors, 0 divided
by anything is 0.

201
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,290
So 0 divided by this thing is
going to be 0, assuming we can

202
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,020
divide by that, and we're
going to talk

203
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,050
about that in a second.

204
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,840
This guy divided by this guy,
we're just dividing by

205
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,180
himself, so it's going
to be equal to 1.

206
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:06,190
Now we have minus c divided
by this, or ad minus bc.

207
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,470
And then we have an a.

208
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,370
a divided by ad, ad minus bc.

209
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,280
And we're done.

210
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,740
We put the left-hand side of
our augmented matrix into

211
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,410
reduced row echelon form.

212
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,080
And now this is going
to be our inverse.

213
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,260
So let me clean it
up a little bit.

214
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,270
So, so far we started off with
a matrix-- I'll do it in

215
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,830
purple-- we started off
with a matrix a is

216
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,830
equal to a, b, c, d.

217
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,510
And now just using our technique
we figured out that

218
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,740
a inverse is equal to this
thing right here.

219
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,020
And just to simplify-- well let
me just write it the way I

220
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,705
have it there, because I don't
want to skip any steps-- this

221
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:52,920
is equal to d over
ad minus bc.

222
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,670
Right, this guy and that
guy canceled out.

223
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:02,290
And then we have a minus b over
ad minus bc because that

224
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,110
guy and that guy canceled out.

225
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,080
Then you have a minus
c over ad minus bc.

226
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,100
And then finally you have
an a over ad minus bc,

227
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,430
which is our inverse.

228
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,460
But one thing might just pop out
at you immediately is that

229
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,760
everything in our inverse is
being divided by this.

230
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,640
So maybe an easier way
to write our inverse.

231
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,290
We could also write our
inverse like this.

232
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,950
We could just write it as 1
over ad minus bc times the

233
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:38,800
matrix d minus b
minus c and a.

234
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,550
And just like that we have come
up with a formula for the

235
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,290
inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix.

236
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,320
You give me any real numbers
here and I'm going to give you

237
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,970
its inverse.

238
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,280
That straightforward.

239
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,510
Now one thing you might be
saying, hey, but not all 2 by

240
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,620
2 matrices are invertible.

241
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,390
How can this be the case
for all of them.

242
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,740
And I'll give you a question,
when will this thing right

243
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,940
here not be defined?

244
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,520
When is this thing
not defined?

245
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,710
Every operation I did, I can do
with any real numbers, and

246
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,930
this applies to any
real numbers.

247
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,240
But when is this thing
not defined?

248
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,230
   

249
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,160
Well it's not defined
when I divide by 0.

250
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,900
And when would I divide by 0?

251
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,650
Everything else you can multiply
and subtract and add

252
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,330
a zero to anything, but you
just can't divide by 0.

253
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,980
We've never defined what it
means when you divide

254
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,000
something by 0.

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,060
So it's not defined if ad
minus bc is equal to 0.

256
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,530
So this is an interesting
thing.

257
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,470
I can always find the inverse of
a 2 by 2 matrix as long as

258
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,590
ad minus bc is not equal to 0.

259
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,510
We came up with all of these
fancy things for

260
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,120
invertability, you've got to
put it into reduced row

261
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,410
echelon form, and before
that we talked being

262
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,150
onto and 1 to 1.

263
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,870
For at least a 2 by
2 matrix we've

264
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,440
really simplified things.

265
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:07,220
As long as ad minus bc does not
equal 0, we can use this

266
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,960
formula and then we know that
A-- and it goes both ways-- A

267
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,470
is invertible.

268
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,930
And not only is it invertible,
but we can just apply this

269
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,200
formula to it.

270
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,900
So immediately something
interesting might-- you might

271
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,000
say hey, this is an interesting
number.

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,990
We should come up with
some name for it.

273
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,620
And lucky for us, we have come
up with a name for it.

274
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,870
This is called the
determinant.

275
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,410
   

276
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,650
Let me write it in pink.

277
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,900
Determinant.

278
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,220
   

279
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:45,670
So the determinant of A, and
it's also written like this

280
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,580
with these little straight lines
around A, and you could

281
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,700
also write it like
this, a, b, c, d.

282
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,040
But most people kind of think
this is redundant to have

283
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,830
brackets and these lines.

284
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,070
So then they just write it like
this, this is equal to

285
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,650
just, they just write the
lines, a, b, c, d.

286
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,670
I want to make this
very clear.

287
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,250
If you have the brackets you're
dealing with a matrix.

288
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,410
If you have just these straight
lines you're talking

289
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,740
about the determinant
of the matrix.

290
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,930
But this is defined for
the 2 by 2 case to be

291
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,920
equal to ad minus bc.

292
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:28,050
This is a definition
of the determinant.

293
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,100
So we can re-write, if we have
some matrix here, we have some

294
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,730
matrix A which is equal
to a, b, c, d.

295
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:43,690
We can now write its inverse,
A inverse is equal to 1 over

296
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,920
this thing, which we've defined
as the determinant of

297
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:54,570
A times-- and let's just
see a good way of kind

298
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,500
of memorizing this.

299
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,940
We're swapping these two
guys, right, the a

300
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,000
and the d get swapped.

301
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,390
So you get a d and an a.

302
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,050
And then these two guys
stay the same,

303
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,130
they just become negative.

304
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,800
So minus b and minus c.

305
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,890
So that's the general
formula for the

306
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,600
determinant of a 2 by 2 matrix.

307
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,350
Let's try to do a couple.

308
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,500
Let's try to find the
determinant of the

309
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,270
matrix 1, 2, 3, 4.

310
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,190
Easy enough.

311
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,750
So the determinant of-- let's
say this is the matrix B.

312
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,040
So the determinant of B, or we
could write it like that,

313
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,270
that's equal to the
determinant of B.

314
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,320
That is just equal to-- that's
this thing right here-- 1

315
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:49,300
times 4 minus 3 times 2, which
is equal to 4 minus 6, which

316
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,480
is equal to minus 2.

317
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,760
So the determinant is minus
2, so this is invertible.

318
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,430
   

319
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,810
Not only is it invertible, but
it's very easy to find its

320
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,330
inverse now.

321
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,990
We can apply this formula.

322
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,020
The inverse of B in this case--
let me do it in this

323
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,635
color-- B inverse is equal to
1 over the determinant, so

324
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:12,650
it's 1 over minus 2 times the
matrix where we swap-- well,

325
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,725
this is the determinant of B.

326
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:15,720
I want to be careful.

327
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,980
B is the same thing,
but with brackets.

328
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,190
1, 2, 3, 4.

329
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,410
So B inverse is going to be 1
over the determinant of B,

330
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,510
which is equal to minus 2.

331
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,880
So 1 over minus 2.

332
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,430
We swap these two guys, so they
get a 4 and a 1, and then

333
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,150
these two guys become
negative-- minus 2

334
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,970
and then minus 3.

335
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,010
And then if we were to multiply
this out it would be

336
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,920
equal to minus 1/2 times
4 is minus 2.

337
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,980
Minus 1/2 times minus 2 is 1.

338
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,220
Minus 1/2 times minus
3 is 3/2, minus 1/2

339
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,610
times 1 is minus 1/2.

340
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,010
So that there is the
inverse of B.

341
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,780
Now let's say we have
another matrix.

342
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,060
Let's say we have the
matrix C, and C is

343
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,400
equal to 1, 2, 3, 6.

344
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,390
What is the determinant of C?

345
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,710
It is equal to-- we could write
this way-- 1, 2, 3, 6.

346
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,540
   

347
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:21,280
And it is equal to 1 times 6
minus 3 times 2, which is

348
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,079
equal to 6 minus 6, which
is equal to 0.

349
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,110
And there you see it's equal to
0, so you cannot find-- so

350
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,360
this is not invertible.

351
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,090
   

352
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,170
So we can't find its inverse
because if we would try to

353
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,550
apply this formula right here
you'd have a 1 over 0.

354
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,180
But we know this formula just
comes out-- that attempt to

355
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,570
put it into reduced row echelon
form, and in that last

356
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,600
step we just had to essentially
divide everything

357
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,540
by these terms. So these terms
would be 0 in this matrix C

358
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,430
that I just constructed
for you.

359
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,510
And the reason why I knew-- I
just pulled this out of my

360
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,810
brain-- I knew this wasn't going
to be invertible because

361
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,410
I constructed a situation where
I have columns that are

362
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,820
linear combinations
of each other.

363
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,950
I have 1, 3-- you multiply that
by 2 you get 2 and 6.

364
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,900
So I knew that these aren't
linearly independent columns.

365
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,250
So you know that its rank wasn't
going to be equal to,

366
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,800
so I knew it wasn't going to be
invertible, but we see that

367
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,640
here by just computing
its determinant.
