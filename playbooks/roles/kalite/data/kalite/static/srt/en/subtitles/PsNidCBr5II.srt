1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,490
In the last video, we showed
you the Cauchy-Schwarz

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,740
Inequality.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:12,690
   

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,395
I think it's worth rewriting
because this is something

6
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:16,530
that's going to show up a lot.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,570
It's a very useful tool.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,220
And that just told us if I have
two vectors, x and y,

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,120
they're both members of Rn.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,390
And they're both nonzero
vectors.

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,650
And that was an assumption we
had to make when we did the

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,970
proof, otherwise there was a
potential of dividing by one

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,530
of their magnitudes.

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,500
So that would've been
a big no-no.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,830
But if we assume that they're
both nonzero, then we can say

16
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,990
that the absolute value of their
dot products is going to

17
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,970
be less than or equal
to the products of

18
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,740
their individual lengths.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,760
So that's the length of vector x
and we defined that a couple

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,730
of videos ago.

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,890
And then this is the
length of vector y.

22
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,870
And of course, this is just a
regular number and then each

23
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,209
of these are just
regular numbers.

24
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,190
They're not vectors once
you take a length.

25
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,780
The length of a 50 dimensional
vector could just

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,940
be the number 3.

27
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,340
It's just a scalar value.

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,190
So this is just scalar
multiplication here.

29
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,710
And we also learned that the
only time that this inequality

30
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:25,310
turns into an equality is the
situation where x is equal to

31
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,040
some scalar multiple of y.

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,040
And so in some textbooks you'll
say-- and this has to

33
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,240
be a nonzero scalar multiple.

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,190
But that's a bit obvious.

35
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,800
I told you that x and
y are nonzero.

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,910
So if this was 0 then
x would be 0.

37
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,800
And we already said
that x is not 0.

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,180
But if you want to say there you
could say that you know c

39
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,440
also is going to be nonzero.

40
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,170
   

41
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,040
But that essentially
just falls out of

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,050
this information there.

43
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,770
But if this is the case and if
and only if this is the case,

44
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,550
then we can say that the
absolute value of the dot

45
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,490
product of the two vectors
is equal to the

46
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,110
product of their lengths.

47
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,220
Now, this is all just
a review of what I

48
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,729
did in the last video.

49
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,850
Now what else can we do
that's useful with it?

50
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,030
So let's just play around
a little bit.

51
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,890
I can't claim to be
experimenting, I know where

52
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,560
this is going to go.

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,710
Let's see what happens
if I were to take the

54
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:29,690
length of x plus y.

55
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,240
So I'm going to add the two
vectors and then take the

56
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,910
length of that vector squared.

57
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,420
Well we know from a couple of
videos ago that the length

58
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,650
squared can also be rewritten as
the dot product of a vector

59
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,140
with itself.

60
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,880
This right here, x
plus y, I know it

61
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,860
looks like two vectors.

62
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,820
But it's two vectors added
to each other.

63
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,700
So it's really a vector. x
plus y is a real vector.

64
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,560
I could graph x plus y.

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,980
So the length of x plus y
squared, I can rewrite it as

66
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,010
the dot product of that
vector with itself.

67
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,870
So x plus y dot x plus y.

68
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,940
And all of these are vectors.

69
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,240
These aren't just numbers.

70
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,320
And this is the dot product.

71
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,220
It's just not normal
multiplication.

72
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,320
But we saw two videos ago that
the dot product has the

73
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,920
distributive and the
associative and the

74
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,210
commutative properties just
like regular scalar

75
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,280
multiplication.

76
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,930
So you can kind of FOIL this out
if that's how you remember

77
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,940
multiplying your binomials.

78
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,150
Or I will think of it more as
just doing the distributive

79
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,370
property twice.

80
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,230
So this can be rewritten
as x dot x.

81
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,160
Actually, let me write it as
the distributive property

82
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,690
because that's sometimes not
obvious to a lot of people.

83
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,640
So let me write this x as a
yellow x and let me write this

84
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,790
whole term as x plus y.

85
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:53,550
So this right here can be
rewritten as x dot-- so this x

86
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,620
dot this x plus y.

87
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,270
And then it would be plus
this y dot-- I want

88
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,470
to just switch colors.

89
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:11,440
Plus this y dot x plus y.

90
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,100
It's good to see that when
you're multiplying these,

91
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,650
you're just applying the
distributive property.

92
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,630
All I did is I distributed this
term along each of these

93
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,430
terms into sum right here.

94
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,780
So then I got this.

95
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,240
And then I can distribute each
of these into the sum.

96
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,990
So then this becomes-- I'll be
careful with the colors-- x

97
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:38,580
dot x plus x dot y.

98
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,070
Maybe this was a little bit
overkill, but I think it's

99
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,030
good to see that this isn't
just some magic here.

100
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,560
And we're just using the exact
properties that we proved with

101
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,680
the dot product.

102
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,190
So that's that right there.

103
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,655
And then it's plus y dot x.

104
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:57,850
   

105
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:06,350
Plus this yellow y
dot the yellow x.

106
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,100
Sorry, dot the blue y.

107
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,200
So the magnitude or the length
of our vector x plus y squared

108
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,780
can be rewritten like this.

109
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,390
And I'll just switch
back to one color.

110
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,300
So this equals that and all of
that-- what does this equal?

111
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,850
This is equal to x dot x.

112
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,300
What's x dot x?

113
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,216
x dot x is just the magnitude.

114
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:35,490
So let me write this is just
equal to the magnitude

115
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,740
of our vector x.

116
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,200
I should stop using the
word magnitude.

117
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,100
The length of our vector
x squared.

118
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,930
And then I have two
terms here.

119
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,100
I have an x dot y
and a y dot x.

120
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,830
We know that x dot y and y dot
x are really the same thing.

121
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,150
We showed that order doesn't
matter when you take the dot

122
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,750
product, just like it doesn't
matter with regular

123
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,830
multiplication.

124
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,400
So these are really the same
terms. So we could write plus

125
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,430
2 times x dot y.

126
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,830
And then finally, we have that
last term sitting here.

127
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,640
We have this y dot y.

128
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,800
y dot y is the same thing
as the length of

129
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,080
our vector y squared.

130
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,530
Now, let's see if we can break
out our Cauchy-Schwarz

131
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,010
Inequality.

132
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,360
Or maybe Schwarz, I don't know
if I'm pronouncing it right.

133
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,972
But x dot y.

134
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:39,250
t We have the absolute value
of x dot y here.

135
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:46,100
But we know that just x dot y is
going to be-- it has to be

136
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,760
less than or equal to the
absolute value of x dot y.

137
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,620
   

138
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,780
Why is that?

139
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,370
Well this could be negative.

140
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,910
I could show you
examples of dot

141
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,050
products that are negative.

142
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,620
In fact, if x has all positive
terms and y has all negative

143
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,740
terms, you're going to have
a negative dot product.

144
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,170
So this could be negative
or it could be positive.

145
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,650
If it's positive the absolute
value-- their

146
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,750
equal to each other.

147
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,130
If this is negative, than this
absolute value is definitely

148
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,690
going to be greater than it.

149
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,040
We can add to the Cauchy-Schwarz
Inequality and

150
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,300
this is a bit obvious.

151
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:27,310
We could say look, we could add
a little x dot y is less

152
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,890
than or equal to the absolute
value of x dot y.

153
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,890
Which is less than or equal to
the length of x times the

154
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,160
length of y.

155
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,580
So x dot y is definite-- this,
the dot product of x with y is

156
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,940
definitely less than it's
absolute value of that.

157
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,740
Which is definitely less than
the lengths of those two

158
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,900
multiplied.

159
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,870
So if I rewrite this, this
statement right here is

160
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:02,830
definitely less than or equal
to this exact statement.

161
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,430
But if I replace these with the
lengths of the vectors.

162
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,720
So that is definitely less than
or equal to-- I'm just

163
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,470
rewriting this x squared and
I'll write the plus 2 there.

164
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,200
Plus 2.

165
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,110
But I want to make it very clear
what I'm replacing here.

166
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,790
And then I have the
plus length of my

167
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,280
vector y there squared.

168
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,610
Now this I'm saying, this is
definitely less than the

169
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,100
absolute value of x dot y.

170
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,400
Which is definitely less, by the
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality,

171
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,770
definitely less than the product
of the two lengths.

172
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,880
So I'm just replacing this
with the product

173
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,740
of their two lengths.

174
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:55,730
So I'm going to put the length
of x times the length of y.

175
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,420
And since this is the
same as that, this

176
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,310
is the same as that.

177
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,740
But this is definitely
less than this.

178
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,140
This whole term has to be less
than this whole term.

179
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,510
Now let me just remind you
what we were doing.

180
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,860
I said that this thing that I
wrote over here, this is the

181
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,100
same as that.

182
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,690
So this thing up here, which is
the same as that, which is

183
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,050
less than that also.

184
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:23,030
So we can write that the
magnitude of x plus y squared

185
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,500
and not the magnitude, the
length of the vector x plus y

186
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,030
squared is less than
this whole thing

187
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,240
that I wrote out here.

188
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,850
Or less than or equal to.

189
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,220
Now, what is this thing?

190
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,900
Remember, I mean this might look
all fancy with my little

191
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,840
double lines around
everything.

192
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,210
But these are just numbers.

193
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,070
This length of x squared,
this is just a number.

194
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,440
Each of these are numbers and I
can just say hey, look, this

195
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,770
looks like a perfect
square to me.

196
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,680
   

197
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,510
This term on the right-hand side
is the exact same thing

198
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,913
as the length of x plus
the length of y.

199
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:03,850
   

200
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,690
Everything squared.

201
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,000
If you just squared this out
you'll get x squared plus 2

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,325
times the length of x times the

203
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:12,580
length of y plus y squared.

204
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:23,450
So our length of the vector x
plus y squared is less than or

205
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,500
equal to this quantity
over here.

206
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,020
And if we just take the square
root of both sides of this,

207
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,820
you get the length of our vector
x plus y is less than

208
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:42,560
or equal to the length of the
vector x by itself plus the

209
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,800
length of the vector y.

210
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,470
And we call this the triangle
inequality, which you might

211
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,865
have remembered from geometry.

212
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:56,030
   

213
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,270
Now why is it called the
triangle inequality?

214
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,430
Well you could imagine
each of these to be

215
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,520
separate side of a triangle.

216
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,600
In fact, let's draw it.

217
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,190
We can draw this in R2.

218
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,225
Let me turn my graph paper on.

219
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:10,710
Let me see where the
graphs show up.

220
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,170
If I turn my graph paper
on right there, maybe

221
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,420
I'll draw it here.

222
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,540
So let's draw my vector x.

223
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,260
So let's say that my vector x
look something like this.

224
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,730
Let's say that's my vector x.

225
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,610
It's a vector 2, 4.

226
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,860
So that's my vector x.

227
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,810
And let's say my vector y-- well
I'm just going to do it

228
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,130
head to tail because I'm
going to add the two.

229
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,420
So my vector y-- I'm going to do
it in nonstandard position.

230
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,690
Let's say it's look something
like-- let's say my vector y

231
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,330
looks something like this.

232
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,430
Draw it properly.

233
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,680
That's my vector y.

234
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,500
   

235
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,060
What does x plus y look like?

236
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,330
And remember, I can't
necessarily draw any two

237
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,020
vectors on a two-dimensional
space like this.

238
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,470
I'm just assuming that
these are in R2.

239
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,986
But this is just to
give you the idea.

240
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,650
   

241
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,500
So then this is their
sum, right?

242
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,490
You took from the tail of
x to the head of y.

243
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,260
So this vector right here
is the vector x plus y.

244
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,000
And that's why it's called
the triangle inequality.

245
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,340
It's just saying that look, this
thing is always going to

246
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,370
be less than or equal to-- or
the length of this thing is

247
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,680
always going to be less than or
equal to the length of this

248
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,160
thing plus the length
of this thing.

249
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,980
And that's kind of obvious
when you just learn

250
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,250
two-dimensional geometry.

251
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,880
That look, this is a much more
efficient way of getting from

252
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,860
this point to this point
than going out here and

253
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,200
then going out here.

254
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,850
And then, what's the case in
which this length is equal to

255
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,880
these lengths?

256
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,280
Well if you keep flattening this
triangle out and you go

257
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,510
to the extreme case where
maybe the vector

258
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,760
x looks like this.

259
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,950
   

260
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,870
And if the vector y is just
kind of going in the exact

261
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,630
same-- vector y is going in
the exact same direction,

262
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,880
maybe it's going a little
bit further.

263
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,470
   

264
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,790
This is vector x, this
is vector y.

265
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,120
Now x plus y will just
be this whole vector.

266
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,770
Now that whole thing
is x plus y.

267
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:27,070
And this is the case now where
you actually-- where the

268
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,330
triangle inequality turns
into an equality.

269
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,480
That's why that little
equal sign is there.

270
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,460
The extreme case where

271
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,560
essentially, x and y are collinear.

272
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,780
And why does that work out?

273
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,225
We can even go back to our
math and understand that.

274
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:41,950
So let me turn my graph off.

275
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,220
We can go back to
our math here.

276
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,050
If I go back to this point,
remember, right here I made

277
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,760
the statement, look, this thing
is definitely less than

278
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,180
this thing over here.

279
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,050
But what if I made
an assumption?

280
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:04,480
What if I said that x is equal
to some scalar times y?

281
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,930
And actually, I have to be
careful because just some

282
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:12,420
scalar times y-- remember, our
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality said

283
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,290
that look, the inequality turns
into an equality if x is

284
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,810
some nonzero scalar of y.

285
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,070
And then we can apply this.

286
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,300
We can say that the absolute
value of x dot y is the same

287
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,440
as this over here.

288
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,600
But I don't have the absolute
value of x dot y here.

289
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,960
I don't know that this
is positive.

290
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,340
I can say definitively that this
is a positive quantity

291
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,280
because I took the absolute
value of it.

292
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,090
No absolute value here.

293
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,450
So the only way that I can
assure that this is a positive

294
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,430
quantity, that this is the same
thing as the absolute

295
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,500
value of x dot y is to enforce--
if I'm kind of going

296
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,370
to go down this road, is to
enforce that this term right

297
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,740
here, that c be positive.

298
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:58,890
Because if c is positive, then
x dot y, if x dot y then that

299
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:04,840
would be the same thing
as cy dot y.

300
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,720
Which we know is just the same
thing as c times the magnitude

301
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,440
of y squared.

302
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,770
And the only way that I can
ensure that this expression

303
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:18,340
right here is equal to the
absolute value of x dot y, the

304
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,830
only way I can assure this
is that c is positive.

305
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,280
If c is negative, then this is
going to be a negative number

306
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,270
while this is a positive.

307
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:30,690
So if I assume that this is
positive, then I can say that

308
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,590
x dot y is equal to the absolute
value of x dot y.

309
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,170
And since it's a scalar
multiple, then I could say

310
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,820
that that term is equal to, not
just less than or equal

311
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,490
to, the magnitude
of x's and y's.

312
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,660
So hopefully I'm not
confusing you.

313
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,650
So all I'm saying is, if I can
assume that x is some positive

314
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,430
scalar multiple of y,
that this wouldn't

315
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,730
be a less than sign.

316
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,300
Then I could say that x dot
y is the same thing as the

317
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,500
absolute value of x dot y
since this is positive.

318
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,470
And if it's the same thing as
the absolute value of x dot y

319
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,480
and it's some scalar multiple
of each other, than we could

320
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,430
go down this other route.

321
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,850
We could say that this
thing here-- I don't

322
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,700
want to get too messy.

323
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,980
We could say that this
is equal to that.

324
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,350
If this is equal to that, then
this would have become an

325
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,460
equal sign, not a less than
or equal to sign.

326
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,770
And then we would have had the
limiting case-- I don't want

327
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,560
to call it the limiting case.

328
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,920
But we could say that x plus y--
we would've done the same

329
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,080
work, but we would've had an
equal sign the whole way.

330
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,620
Would equal the length of x.

331
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,070
The length of x plus y would
equal the length of x plus the

332
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:42,030
length of y in the situation
where x is equal to some

333
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,930
positive scalar times y.

334
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,480
So c is greater than 0.

335
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,200
These two imply each other.

336
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,060
And we saw that geometrically.

337
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,820
I lost my axes here, but we see
that the only time that

338
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,795
the length of x plus y is equal
to the length of x plus

339
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:02,550
the length of y is when
they're collinear.

340
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,720
Over here this plus this is
clearly-- you can just

341
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,079
visually look at it-- longer
than this right there.

342
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,930
So you might be saying Sal,
once again, this linear

343
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,440
algebra's a little bit silly.

344
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,250
We learned the triangle
inequality in

345
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,700
eighth or ninth grade.

346
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,300
Why did you go through all of
this pain to redefine it?

347
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,800
And this is the interesting
thing.

348
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,750
What I just drew here and this
is what you learned in ninth

349
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,290
grade geometry.

350
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,890
This is just in R2.

351
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,085
This is just your Cartesian
coordinates, or I don't want

352
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,120
to use the word dimension too
much because we're going to

353
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,870
define that formally.

354
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,290
But this is kind of your
two-dimensional space

355
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,900
that's going on.

356
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,440
What's interesting or what's
useful about linear algebra

357
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,890
is, we've just defined the
triangle inequality for

358
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,930
arbitrarily large vectors,
or vectors that have an

359
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,810
arbitrarily high number
of components.

360
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,170
Each of these, these don't
have to be in R2.

361
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:00,830
This is true if we're in R100
where every vector has a

362
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,500
hundred components to it.

363
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,270
We've just defined some notion
of the triangle inequality.

364
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,790
We've abstracted well beyond
just our two-dimensional

365
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,800
Cartesian coordinates.

366
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,380
Well beyond even our three
dimensions to essentially, n

367
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,210
dimensional space.

368
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,770
And I haven't defined dimensions
yet, but I think

369
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,400
you're starting to appreciate
what they are.

370
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,400
But anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

371
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,165
We can now take this result.

372
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:26,795
   

373
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:31,190
And actually, that result with
this result and define what

374
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,910
the notion of an angle between
two vectors are.

375
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,010
Once again, you know, on some
levels you're like well, why

376
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,640
do we have to define an angle?

377
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,480
Isn't an angle just-- isn't
that just an angle?

378
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,510
Well yeah, we know what an angle
is in two dimensions,

379
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,510
but what does an angle mean when
you abstract things to n

380
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,270
dimensions?

381
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,580
Or when you're in Rn.

382
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,550
So that's what we'll talk
about in the next video.
