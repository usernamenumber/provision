1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,050
We're on problem 245.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:14,310
If x plus y is equal to a, and x minus y is equal to b,

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,000
then what is-- they want to know what 2xy is equal to.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,660
Let's solve for x and y in terms of a and b,

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,490
and then just figure out what this equals to.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,200
So we have two equations with two unknowns.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,990
Let's just add them together to solve for x.

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,340
We get x plus x is 2x-- the y's cancel out--

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,860
is equal to a plus b.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,090
Or x is equal to a plus b over 2.

11
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,710
Now if we had x plus y is equal to a-- I just re-wrote this.

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,000
And now if we multiply both sides of this by negative 1,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,570
so we get minus x plus y is equal to minus b.

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,550
And now add these two equations.

15
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,930
So I'm essentially subtracting this equation from that one.

16
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,290
That cancels out, so I get 2y is equal to a minus b,

17
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:09,650
or y is equal to a minus b over 2.

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,840
And now we can figure out what 2xy is equal to.

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,900
2xy is equal to 2 times a plus b over 2,

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,520
times a minus b over 2.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,000
This 2 will cancel out with one of these 2's.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,630
And we're left with-- and what's a plus b times a minus b?

23
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,020
It's a squared minus b squared over 2.

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,100
Which is choice A.

25
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,820
Problem 246.

26
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,050
Let me do it in magenta.

27
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,990
246.

28
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,650
A rectangular circuit board is to have width w inches--

29
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,030
let me draw it.

30
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:59,540
So let's say it has width w inches, perimeter of p inches--

31
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,210
Ok. so let me just put that at the side right here--

32
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,480
perimeter of p inches, and area of k square inches.

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,660
Which of the following equations must be true?

34
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,270
And so they want us to relate this width

35
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,020
to the area to the perimeter.

36
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,470
Let me introduce another variable.

37
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,000
Let's call this, right here,

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,040
let's call this the height of the circuit board.

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,150
So now we can do some interesting things.

40
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,010
If that's the height, then that's also the height.

41
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,460
If that's the width, then this is also the width.

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,470
So let's see what the perimeter would be.

43
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,370
It will be 2 times the width,

44
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,040
plus 2 times the height is equal to the perimeter.

45
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,270
And then we could also say

46
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,000
width times height is equal to area.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,720
But if we can solve for height

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,840
in terms of the perimeter and the width,

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,580
then we could use that to get an expression

50
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,450
that doesn't involve this variable.

51
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,690
So let's do that.

52
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,850
So if you divide both sides of this by 2,

53
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,750
you get width plus height is equal to perimeter over 2.

54
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,360
And then you get height is equal to

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
perimeter over 2 minus width.

56
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,970
And so the area, k,

57
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,610
will be equal to the width times the height.

58
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,370
Instead of writing an h there,

59
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,030
let's write what we just figured out.

60
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,550
p over 2 minus w.

61
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:38,000
And then that is equal to pw/2 minus w squared.

62
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,780
Let's see, when I look at the solution,

63
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,600
they don't have any fractions in it,

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,360
so let's multiple both sides of the equation by 2.

65
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,570
We can ignore this. k is equal to pw/2 minus w squared.

66
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,120
Multiply both sides by 2,

67
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,660
you get 2k is equal to pw minus w squared.

68
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,660
Let's add w squared the both sides.

69
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,530
You get w squared plus 2k is equal to pw.

70
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,880
Let's subtract,

71
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,510
because all of the choices have them setting equal to 0.

72
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,370
So then we could subtract pw from both sides, and you get--

73
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,890
oh wait, I made a mistake.

74
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,680
If we multiply both sides of this by 2, 2 times k is 2k.

75
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,630
2 times pw/2 is pw.

76
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,030
2 times minus w squared is minus 2w squared.

77
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,000
So in this step we have to add 2w squared to both sides.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,060
Sorry about that.

79
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,560
So we have 2w squared plus 2k is equal to pw.

80
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,000
Subtract pw from both sides, you get 2w squared minus pw,

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,610
plus 2k is equal to 0.

82
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,000
And that is choice E, right?

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,920
2w squared minus pw plus 2k.

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,060
That is choice E.

85
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,040
Next question.

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,070
Problem 247.

87
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,480
An arithmetic sequence is a sequence

88
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,260
in which each term after the first

89
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,440
is equal to the sum of the preceding term and a constant.

90
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,950
If the list of letters shown above is an arithmetic sequence

91
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,560
so they wrote p, r, s, t, u.

92
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,070
So all they're saying is that,

93
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,650
the difference between p and r is going to be some number.

94
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,680
And the difference between r and s

95
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,580
is going to be that same number.

96
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,700
And the difference between s and t

97
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,690
is going to be that same number.

98
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,120
So an example of an arithmetic sequence,

99
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,020
this could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

100
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,050
Because every number is one more than the one before it.

101
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,680
So anyway, they say which of the following

102
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,000
must also be an arithmetic sequence?

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:45,020
So choice one, they write 2p, 2r, 2s, 2t, 2u.

104
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,720
Well, let's just use our example.

105
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,050
If this was p, r, s, t, and u, what is 2 times all of that?

106
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,720
Well, then it'll be 2, 4-- no no, sorry--

107
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,050
it'll be, yeah, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

108
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,670
So now instead of incrementing by one every time,

109
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,160
we're incrementing by two every time.

110
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
But it's still an arithmetic sequence

111
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,190
because the difference between each number

112
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,610
and the number before it is a constant.

113
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,290
It's always equal to 2.

114
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,030
So choice number one is definitely an arithmetic sequence.

115
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,060
Choice two.

116
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,600
And if you say, well, that works for that example,

117
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,840
how do I know it'll work for all examples?

118
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,710
So the other way to think about is,

119
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,080
whatever the difference is between p and r,

120
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,050
now you're going to have twice the difference

121
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,370
between 2p and 2r.

122
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,020
And it was the same distance between r and s,

123
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,260
now you're going to have twice that distance

124
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,780
between 2r and 2s.

125
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,860
So here in our particular example, we went from 1 to 2,

126
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,570
but it could have been something else.

127
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,340
OK, Statement two says, p minus 3, r minus 3--

128
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,630
so they're just shifting everything;

129
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,020
I don't even have to write them alll--

130
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,040
all the way to u minus 3.

131
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,380
So they just took everything in this sequence

132
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,040
and made them three less.

133
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,990
But if r minus p is equal to some number, r minus 3,

134
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,720
minus p minus 3 is going to be the exact same thing.

135
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,510
I can even prove that to you, right?

136
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:11,480
r minus p-- sorry, r minus 3, minus p minus 3.

137
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,540
That's equal to r minus 3, minus p plus 3.

138
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,090
And so these cancel out.

139
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,770
So the difference between this and this

140
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,990
ends up to be r minus p, the difference between that and that

141
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,250
And that should make sense intuitively,

142
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,850
we're just shifting all the numbers down by three.

143
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,000
So that shouldn't change the difference between the numbers.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,500
So two is still an arithmetic sequence.

145
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,020
Statement three.

146
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,880
p squared, r squared-- so we're just squaring all the numbers

147
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,980
t squared, and u squared.

148
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,530
So let's just use our particular example.

149
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,030
If p was 1, then p squared is 1, 2 squared is 4,

150
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,680
s squared is 9-- right, 3 squared is nine, 4 squared is 16.

151
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,480
Now what's the difference between the numbers?

152
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,030
The difference here is three.

153
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,940
The difference here is five.

154
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,810
The difference here is seven.

155
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,520
well, first of all, let's just answer our question.

156
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,490
The difference is now not constant.

157
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,780
We have a different difference

158
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,830
between each successive number, right?

159
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,900
At the beginning, the difference is two every time.

160
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,780
Here it's three, then it changes to five,

161
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,010
then it changes to seven.

162
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,800
So three is not an arithmetic sequence.

163
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,060
So the answer is D, one and two.

164
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,930
This is something interesting.

165
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,780
And if you've never experimented with it,

166
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,170
this is something to look at.

167
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,380
I've always been fascinated by the distance

168
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,440
between the perfect squares increases by increasing odd numbers,

169
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,020
which is just something to think about.

170
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,070
Anyway, next problem.

171
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,850
Actually, I have two problems left

172
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,430
out of all of the problem-solving problems,

173
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,200
so instead of just doing one problem and going over time,

174
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,150
let me do two of them in the the next video.

175
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,050
See you soon.
