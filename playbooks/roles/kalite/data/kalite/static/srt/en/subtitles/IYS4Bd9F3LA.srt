1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say you and I are playing a game

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where we're trying to figure out how

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
far a ball is being thrown into the

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
air, or how fast we're throwing

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that ball into the air, and what we do

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is one of us has a ball, and the other

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one has a stopwatch over here

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so, this is my best attempt, it looks

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
more like a cat than a stopwatch,

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but I think you get the idea.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what we do is one of us throws the

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ball, and the other one times how

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
long it's in the air.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, what we do is we're going

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to use that time in the air to figure

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
out how fast the ball was thrown straight

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
up, and how long it was in the air

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and how high it got.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There is going to be one assumption

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I make here, and in fact this is an assumption

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we're going to make in all of these

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
projectile/motion type problems, is that

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
air resistance is negligible.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And for something like – if this is a

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
baseball or something like that –

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's a pretty good approximation,

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we're not going to get the

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
exact answer and I encourage you

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to experiment on your own – or even

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to see what air resistance does

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
relative to your calculations,

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but we're going to assume for this type of

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
projectile/motion, and really all of the

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
future ones, or at least in the

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
basic physics playlist, we're going

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to assume that air resistance

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is negligible.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what that does for us, is that we can

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
assume that the time up – that the time

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for the ball to go up to its peak hight –

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the same thing as the time

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that it takes to go down.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you look at this previous video,

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where we plotted displacement versus

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
time, you see after two seconds,

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the ball went from being on the ground,

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or, I guess, the thrower's hand,

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
all the way to it's peak hight,

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in the next two seconds,

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it took that same amount of time

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to go back to the ground, which

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
makes sense: whatever the

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
initial velocity is, it takes half the

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
time to go to zero, and then

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it take that same amount of time to

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now be accelerated in the downward

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
direction, back to that same magnitude

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of velocity, but now in the downward

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
direction.

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's play around with some numbers

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here, just so we get a little

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
bit more of a concrete sense.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let's say I throw a ball in the air,

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you measure, using the

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
stopwatch, that the ball

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is in the air for five seconds.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So how do we figure out how fast

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I threw the ball?

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, the first thing we can do

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is that we can say, look, if the

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
total time in the air was five seconds,

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that means that the time, let me write it,

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well, that means that the

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
change in time to go up during the

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
first half of, I guess, the ball's time in

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the air, is going to be 2.5 seconds.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And which tells us that over this

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2.5 seconds, we went from our

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
initial velocity, whatever it was,

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we went from our initial velocity

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to our final velocity, which is the

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
velocity of zero meters per second.
