1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,050
We're on problem 30.Let's see,they've drawn a circle there.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,280
If o is the center of the circle above,

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,960
what fraction of the circle is shaded? Let me draw that.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,470
They draw a circle.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,080
And then they have two lines that go through the center,

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,810
essentially.And one line looks like that.

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,840
Another line looks something like that.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,610
So they tell us that this is the center,o.

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,790
They tell us this is 150 degrees.So the question is,

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,020
what fraction of the circular region is shaded?

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,200
And the shaded region is this.This is the shaded region.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,730
So we just have to figure out what percentage of the total

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,560
degrees of the circle are shaded.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,060
So let's think about it this way.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,200
If this is 150 degrees,what is this angle right here?

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,910
Well,this angle and 150 degrees are supplementary,right?

17
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,960
So this angle plus this angle is going to be equal to 180.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,070
So 30 plus 150 is equal to 180.

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,690
And then you could either say,oh,these are opposite angles,

20
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,360
so they're equal.

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,730
Or you can make the same argument here,

22
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,130
that 150 plus this angle has to be equal to 180,

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,000
so this angle is also equal to 30.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,740
So what is the total angle measure of the shaded region?

25
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,970
You have 30 degrees here.And you have 30 degrees here.

26
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,230
So a total of 60 degrees.

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,820
And the whole circle is how many degrees?

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,360
If you run it all the way around the circle,

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,420
how many degrees is that? Well,that's 360 degrees.

30
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,330
So 60/360.That's 1/6 of the circle is shaded.

31
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:42,500
And that is choice C.Question 31.This was question 30.

32
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,820
Question 31.

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,080
If Juan takes 11 seconds to run y yards--

34
00:01:50,950 --> 00:02:00,070
so y yards for every 11 seconds.

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,330
Well,another way you could think about it is,

36
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,430
y/11 yards per second.Fair enough.

37
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,450
How many seconds will it take him to run x

38
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,340
yards at the same rate?

39
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,450
So he is going at y yards per second.

40
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,520
So how long will it take him to go x yards?

41
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,150
Well,if I said that I'm going at 5 miles per hour,

42
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,230
how long will it take me to go 10 miles?

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,320
Let's say I go 5 miles per hour.

44
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,250
Or let's say 5 meters per hour.

45
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,900
How long will take me to go 10 meters?

46
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,510
You would say 10 divided by 5 is equal to 2.2 hours.

47
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,780
So likewise,we have his speed.

48
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,760
That's his speed we're talking about,how fast he runs.

49
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,430
His speed is y/11 yards per second.

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,210
And we want to know how long will it take him to run x yards.

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,130
So we could just take x divided by the speed,

52
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:06,770
divided by y/11,and we'll get the answer in seconds.

53
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,000
And you could work out the units,but x divided by y/11,

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,610
that's the same thing as x times 11/y,equals 11x/y.

55
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,710
Another way to view it is this is equal to the rate.

56
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,230
And we know,from probably the first day in physics,

57
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,210
that distance is equal to rate times time.

58
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,920
This might be an easier way for you to think about it.

59
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,690
However it best forms connections in your brain.

60
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,250
Distance is equal to rate times time.

61
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,770
They tell us that the distance is x,

62
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,880
and that the rate is y/11 yards per second.

63
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,050
So y/11 times t is equal to x.

64
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,190
So if you want to find t,you do x divided by y/11.

65
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:54,710
Anyway,and you get 11x/y,which is choice A.Question 32.

66
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,890
John has 10 pairs of matched socks.

67
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,190
If he loses 7 individual socks,what is the greatest

68
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,160
number of pairs of matched socks he can have left?

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,710
So he loses 7.He loses 7 socks.So think about it.

70
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,130
If you wanted to optimize the number of matched pairs,

71
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,130
what's the worst case scenario?

72
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,620
The worst case scenario is if every one of

73
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,790
these socks came out of a different pair.

74
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,900
Because then he'd be left with 7 socks that had their brother

75
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,130
socks,or whatever you want to call it,

76
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,800
their twin socks are gone.So that's the worst case.

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,190
But we want to think of what the best case--

78
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,280
what's the best case if you want to preserve the number of

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,170
pairs you have left?

80
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,780
If you want to preserve the number of pairs you have left,

81
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,800
the 7 should have as many pairs as possible in it.

82
00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:00,280
So if 7 could be made of 3 pairs and 1 lone socks.

83
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,280
This is kind of the best case scenario if he wants to have

84
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,840
the greatest number of matched socks left.

85
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,510
So 7 could be 3 pairs and 1 lone socks,

86
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,160
in which case he'd be left with what?

87
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,580
So these 3 pairs would be gone.Remember,he has 10 pairs.

88
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,450
Let's keep in mind,those aren't 10 socks.He has 10 pairs.

89
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,760
Let's say that he just loses 3 pairs.

90
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,700
Then he'll just have 7 pairs left,right?

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,590
But then if he loses 1 more sock,then he's only going to

92
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,330
have 6 pairs left.He's going to have 6 pairs and one sock.

93
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,840
So he's going to have 6 matched pairs left,

94
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,920
and that's choice B.Question 33.

95
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,330
The worst case,if the question was the other way--

96
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,160
maybe I'm just overly fascinated with this

97
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,820
question--but if the question was the other way,

98
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,580
what's the worst case if--

99
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,670
what's the minimum number of pairs that he has left?

100
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,450
You could say,well,each of these socks exactly destroy 1

101
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,820
pair,so losing 7 socks destroys 7 pairs.

102
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,250
So at the worst case,if each of these were a different sock

103
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,480
from a different pair,he would have 3 pairs left.

104
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,470
But anyway,that's not what they ask,

105
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,030
so I shouldn't focus on it.23.

106
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,580
What is the lowest positive integer that is divisible by

107
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,760
each of the numbers 1 through 7,inclusive.

108
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,640
1 through 7,including 1 and 7.

109
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,830
So let's think of a number that's divisible by all of these.

110
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,790
So it has to be divisible by 7,right?

111
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,260
7's a prime number,so it has to be divisible by 7.

112
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,700
It has to be divisible by 6.

113
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,620
And 7 and 6 share no common factor,

114
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,830
so the number is going to be at least 7 times 6.

115
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,020
It has to be divisible by 5,because 5 is a prime number,

116
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,330
and because that doesn't share any factor with

117
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,640
any of these numbers.It has to be divisible by 4,right?

118
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,060
Think about it.6 is 2 times 3.So to make it divisible by 4,

119
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,190
you only have to multiply it by another 2.

120
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,750
So it has 2 times 2 in its prime factorization.

121
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,130
Maybe that's how I should be writing it.

122
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,920
It has to be divisible by 7.

123
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,080
It has to be divisible by 6,which is the same way as

124
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,210
saying it has to be divisible by 2 times 3.

125
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,860
It has to be divisible by 5.It has to be divisible by 4.

126
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,600
But we already have one of 4's factors here?

127
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,530
It's 2,so we just have to multiply it by another 2.

128
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,480
So this is to say it's divisible by 4.

129
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,510
It has to be divisible by 3.

130
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,190
Well,it's already divisible by 3.

131
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,120
It has to be divisible by 2.

132
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,600
It's already divisible by 2,actually,twice.

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,150
It has to be divisible by 1,and that's already the case.

134
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,360
So this is the number.And notice,

135
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,120
I was very careful not to have extra prime factors.

136
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,500
If I just did 7 times 6,times 5,times 4,times 3,times 2,

137
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,180
times 1,I would have gotten a number that is divisible by

138
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,060
all of them,but it wouldn't have been the smallest one.

139
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,030
So anyway,what is this number?

140
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,790
Let's do the small numbers first.

141
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,840
Well,I'll do the big number first.7 times 5 is 35.

142
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:05,520
2 times 3 is 6,times 2 is 12.So 35 times 12.

143
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:15,930
35 times 2 is 70--0,1 times 35--is 350.And then I have 0.

144
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,090
7 plus 5 is 12.420.That is choice A.

145
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,150
And you can feel good about it,

146
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,130
because it's also the lowest number on their list.

147
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:37,810
Next question.34.What percentage of 30 is 12?

148
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:43,730
So 12 is equal to some decimal times 30.

149
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,380
And we could convert that decimal,eventually,to a percent.

150
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,500
We just multiply it by 100.

151
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,730
So x is equal to 30--sorry,is equal to 12/30,

152
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:04,620
which is the same thing as 4/10,which equals 0.4.

153
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,910
And if you wanted to write a decimal as a percent,

154
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,230
you just multiply it by 100.That is equal to 40%.

155
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,610
And that is choice D.And these can be confusing,

156
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,030
so it's very important to write it that way.

157
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:22,300
What percentage of 30 is 12? So 12 is what percentage of 30?

158
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,850
It's going to be a smaller number.

159
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,800
You can kind of think,12 is what fraction of 30?

160
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,430
Or you could say 12/30 equals what as a percentage?

161
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,080
It equals x percent.You could think of it that way,too.

162
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,750
It's all the same thing.

163
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,470
The important thing is to be able to parse

164
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,070
the language correctly.Anyway.35.

165
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:52,740
If 1.5 over 0.2 plus x is equal to 5,

166
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,880
then x is equal to--let's just solve it.

167
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,550
Multiply both sides of this equation by 0.2 plus x.

168
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,240
On the left-hand side,it cancels out.We just have 1.5.

169
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,150
On the right-hand side,what's 5 times 0.2?

170
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,090
It's 1,right? 0.2 is the same thing as 20% or 1/5.

171
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,250
So it's 5 times 1/5.

172
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,290
That's 1--you can think of it a bunch of ways--plus 5x.

173
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,580
Subtract 1 from both sides.

174
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,630
You have 0.5--1.5 minus 1 is 0.5--is equal to 5x.

175
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,590
So x is equal to 0.5 divided by 5.

176
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,140
Well,that's just equal to 0.1.The answer is B.

177
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,880
