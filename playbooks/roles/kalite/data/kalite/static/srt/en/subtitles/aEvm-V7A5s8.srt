1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,200
All right, this is a fun problem,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,280
so it'll get a video on its own.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,730
I started in the last video,

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,580
but I'm going to start over

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,390
just so we get it all in one take.

6
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,420
So they say, in the figure above,

7
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:17,360
arc SBT is 1/4 of a circle with center R and radius 6

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,500
And they actually tell-- they draw this distance,

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,010
which is the radius.

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,040
This distance is 6, right?

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,070
So this distance would also be 6, right?

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,560
If the length plus the width of rectangle ABCR is 8

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,020
so this is ABCR.

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,340
So the length plus the width is 8.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,260
So let's call this L and this is W.

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,920
Actually, this should be-- well, it doesn't matter,

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,010
this should be height, but whatever.

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,010
We know that these two sides are equal to 8.

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,000
So we know that L plus W is equal to 8.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,890
Fair enough.

21
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,990
Then the perimeter of the shaded region is--

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,150
that's this perimeter right here,

23
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,050
so there's a lot of pieces to it.

24
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,130
So let's start with

25
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,000
what I would call he low hanging fruit.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,020
So the low hanging fruit, in my opinion,

27
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,070
is the length of this arc.

28
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,000
Arc SBT.

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,040
What's the length of that?

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,990
Well, it's going to be

31
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,350
1/4 the circumference of the entire circle, right?

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,730
Because this arc represents--

33
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,190
what we drew is 1/4 of the circle,

34
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,050
so this length is going to be 1/4 of the circumference

35
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,540
So the length of the circumference--

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,920
so the circumference of, let me see,

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,050
the circumference of the circle, is what?

38
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,070
It's 2 pi r.

39
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,670
r is 6, right?

40
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,070
So 2 pi times 6, is equal to 12 pi.

41
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,170
If the circumference of the circle is 12 pi,

42
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,380
then we could call the length of the arc, right--

43
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,000
let's call this LA--

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,020
the length of the arc is going to be what?

45
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,330
It's going to be 1/4 the circumference

46
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,030
of the whole circle.

47
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,000
1/4 times 12 pi is equal to 3 pi.

48
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,060
Good enough.

49
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,000
Now what else can we try to figure out?

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,130
Well, the second lowest hanging fruit is actually

51
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,060
the length of this line.

52
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,050
Which you're probably saying, well,

53
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,610
they give me no information, maybe

54
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,680
I have to use the Pythagorean theorem with W and L,

55
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,330
but it's really just a visual trick,

56
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:32,950
because I'll tell you that

57
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,180
you could actually just look at this graph

58
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,000
and figure out what the length from A to C is.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,050
And I'll give you a hint.

60
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,080
What is the length from R to B?

61
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,070
What is that length?

62
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,040
Well isn't R to B a radius of the circle?

63
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,150
It's going from the center to the edge of circle,

64
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,000
so it's a radius.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,050
So RB has length 6.

66
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,560
And RB is a diagonal of this rectangle just like AC is

67
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,450
so they're symmetric,

68
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,950
so this is also going to be equal to 6.

69
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,250
And you could look at it a bunch of different ways,

70
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,000
you could say that W squared plus L squared is

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,020
equal to this, AC squared.

72
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,740
Well, W squared, this is W as well, right,

73
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,020
you could also say that W squared plus L squared is

74
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,470
equal to this side squared.

75
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,020
So that's why they're equal to each other.

76
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:21,060
So we know length of AC is equal to 6, as well.

77
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,020
Right?

78
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,010
We figured out that.

79
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,010
So we have two pieces left.

80
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:31,010
We just have that piece, and that piece.

81
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,070
What's the length of this piece?

82
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,270
Well, this whole distance is 6.

83
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,010
We figured that out because that's a radius.

84
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,020
And this piece is L, right?

85
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,080
That's L.

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,010
So that piece is 6 minus L.

87
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,480
Similarly, what's this piece?

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,240
By the same logic, that's 6 minus W, right?

89
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,560
This is W, the whole thing is 6,

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,000
so this leftover is 6 minus W.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,190
So if we want

92
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,260
the perimeter of this entire shaded region,

93
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,010
it's this perimeter of this brown arc, which is 3 pi.

94
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,000
So let me say, perimeter is equal to 3 pi.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Plus the length of AC, plus 6.

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,020
Plus this piece, plus 6 minus L.

97
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:22,010
Plus this piece, plus 6 minus W.

98
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,000
And let's simplify that a bit.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,830
So let's see, that equals 3 pi,

100
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,310
and then we have three 6's,

101
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,060
so plus 18, minus L, minus W.

102
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,880
And this is the same thing

103
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:41,010
as 3 pi plus 18 minus L plus W.

104
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,040
Fascinating.

105
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,240
And really, I kind of just bumbled my way here.

106
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,790
You know the problem is solvable,

107
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,530
and that's better than most mathematicians have going for them,

108
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,890
and so you just kind of have to

109
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,890
bumble away with whatever information they give you.

110
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,950
The real trick here, I think,

111
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,040
is recognizing that AC is the same length as RB.

112
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,630
But once you get to this point,

113
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,690
you have to now employ the second trick.

114
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,640
You have to realize that minus L minus W,

115
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,380
well that looks a lot like this L plus W up here.

116
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,730
And this is really kind of

117
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,090
what separates the adults from the children, I guess.

118
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,720
So we know that L plus W is 8,

119
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,480
so just substitute here, 8.

120
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:19,390
So the perimeter is 3 pi, plus 18, minus 8.

121
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:27,000
That equals 3 pi plus 10, and that is choice B.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,090
That was exciting.

123
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,090
I'll see you in the next section.
