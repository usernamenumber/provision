1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,280
Let's say you were in a orange stand

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,150
And this right here is the demand curve for your orange stand or your marginal benefit curve

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,550
or really called the willingness to pay

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:18,370
that very hundredth pound, someone would be willing to pay 3 dollars per pound

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,180
but the 101st pounds would be a little less than that

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,030
So that's the willingness to pay, or the marginal benefit of that incremental pound

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,890
But let's say you decide to set the price at 2 dollars

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:36,160
and you are able to sell 300 oranges in that week

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,890
I want think about what is the total consumer surplus that your consumers got

10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,460
The way to think about consumer surplus is how much benefit above and beyond what they paid

11
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,220
So for example, the person who bought--let's just think about the exact hundredth pound

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,770
The hundredth pound, they paid two dollars

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:05,800
but their benefit looks like $3.30

14
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,410
but they only paid two dollars, so their benefit on that 1 pound

15
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:15,780
or their consumer surplus is 3.30 minus [2]

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,430
So that person that bought 100th pound--

17
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,600
not all of the 100 lbs, just that 100th pound--

18
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,820
got a consumer surplus of 3.30-2 dollars

19
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,690
which is a $1.30 consumer surplus

20
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,240
So if you want to figure out the entire consumer surplus

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,840
you just have to do it for all of the pounds

22
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,450
So that was the 100th pound, you would find--

23
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,770
you could do this as the area of this little thing here

24
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,810
Let me zoom in to make sure that you understand what was going on

25
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,550
That thing that I just drew if I zoom in will look something like this

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:00,370
It was one pound wide

27
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,530
and this here was two dollars

28
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:13,090
Then we had our marginal benefit curve or demand curve sloping down like that

29
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,350
This point right over here was $3.30

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,850
So to figure out the consumer surplus for that pound, we say, for that pound

31
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,960
they were willing to pay $3.30, the benefit to them was $3.30, but they only had to pay $2

32
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,700
So the height of this here was $1.30

33
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,130
So consumer surplus is $1.30 per pound times 1 pound

34
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,150
and so that's what we got, the $1.30 consumer surplus

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,280
Now we can do that for every one of the pounds

36
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:51,690
So we can do that for the 101st pound. We would do it like that

37
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,720
Then the 102nd pound, you would do it like that

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,030
103rd pound, like that; you do it for the 99th pound, like that

39
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,230
You can imagine if you want to find the total consumer surplus what are we doing

40
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,700
We're essentially just finding the area between our demand curve

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,470
and this line where the price is 2

42
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,420
So we're just to sum up this area

43
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,530
And if you're familiar with calculus you might know

44
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,800
that you can actually make these things arbitrarily small

45
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,190
you can take smaller and smaller--you don't have to take a 1-pound wide rectangle

46
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,170
You can take a half-pound wide rectangle, a quarter-pound wide rectangle

47
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,890
then you'll just have more rectangles

48
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,890
It doesn't matter so much if you have a linear demand curve

49
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,340
but if you have a nonlinear demand curve

50
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,570
then it would matter. You want to get thinner and thinner and thinner rectangles

51
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,020
so you can get better and better approximations for the consumer surplus

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,970
But needless to say what you're really doing especially if you get unbelievably thin

53
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,310
rectangles and you have unbelievably high number of them

54
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:03,000
you're really just estimating the area under the demand curve and above the price equals $2

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,840
And so if you want to know the consumer surplus--

56
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,060
I really want you to understand why this was. Just think about it for each pound

57
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,080
just whoever bought that pound, how much more value they get, relative to what they paid

58
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,880
and we're just summing that up across all of the pounds

59
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,520
So to really figure the total consumer surplus

60
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:26,080
we just have to find the area, this blue area. That's just finding the area of a triangle

61
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:35,330
So this here, you have a base of 300. This length here is 300 lbs

62
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,970
And our height over here--we can just use this as the area of a triangle

63
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,240
because this is a simple linear demand curve

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,050
You would actually have to use a little bit of calculus if this was a nonlinear curve

65
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,780
but the height here is 2

66
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:00,720
So our area, the area between the demand curve and our price equals two is equal to

67
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:21,840
1/2 times base times height which is 1/2 times 300 lbs times two dollars / lb

68
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:28,220
The pounds cancel out; 1/2 times 2 is 1, times 300 is 300

69
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,630
So we get 300 dollars

70
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,000
So the total consumer surplus in this case is $300

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,190
This really is the area between the demand curve and this price=2 line right over there
