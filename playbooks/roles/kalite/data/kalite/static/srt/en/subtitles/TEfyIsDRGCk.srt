00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:08,475
We see that an investment bank can buy a bunch of mortgages which essentially makes them the lender to the home owners and then it can stick those mortgages

2
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:13,677
inside of a special purpose entity and then it can sell the shares in that special entity and that these

3
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:18,274
shares will be called mortgage back securities. Lets just say just for the sake of argument when it

4
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:27,144
sells these shares it sells them at $10 a share and it promises dividend at $10 a share the equivalent

5
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:36,711
of an 8% yield so maybe the home owners are paying higher than 8% interest some of them default once

6
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:41,215
you average everything out and the invesmtnet bank keeps a little bit for itself and to do the operations

7
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:48,739
and the overhead and so it can actually give the investor an 8% yield. This might be good for a whole class of investors

8
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:54,358
they might like the safety profile, the risk profile of the special purpose entity of this mortgage back

9
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:59,513
security and they might like the return and they might go for it. But there might be a class of investors,

10
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:09,265
maybe very risk-adverse investors like pensions that says that this mortgage back security is too risky.

11
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:12,423
They have looked at what we are holding and they are like hey some of these are sub-prime mortgages,

12
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:17,949
some of these are shady, some of these are to risky borrowers, I don't like where this is going and even if they can't look under the hood to see

13
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:29,466
what this is the investment bank may have hired a ratings agency to essentially look under the hood

14
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:35,782
and tell investors what's there. The rating agency might look at this special purpose entity and look at

15
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:42,609
these securities and say look, I would say that these securities should be rated double B.

16
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:48,739
So not super safe but not super risky either, but for pensions that is not safe enough.

17
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:54,451
Now, on the other hand you might have people who want more risk so you might have a risky hedge fund,

18
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:59,699
not all hedge funds are risky, but lets say that there are some risky hedge funds and they say this yield is too low

19
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:09,126
and the investment bankers they are very creative people they say well look here are people

20
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:14,002
who want to buy securities but these securities are too risky for them and there are people who want

21
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:19,157
to buy securities who are able to take on more risks but they say the yield is too low so instead of

22
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:24,498
losing out on these investors why don't I split up this special purpose entity in a different way.

23
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:31,557
Why don't I split it up into tranches so instead of all of the securities being the same why don't I

24
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:48,136
put them into classes and there so often called the senior tranche, the mezzanine tranche then the equity tranche.

25
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:51,108
and the way it works in a mortgage back security everyone gets paid the same amount.

26
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:57,935
In this situation when you split it this way the owner of the senior tranche securities are going to get paid first

27
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:02,811
only when they are made whole are the owners of the mezzanine security tranche securities

28
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:08,476
are going to get paid and only when they are made whole will the owners of the equity tranche securities get paid.

29
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:16,093
This scenerio right here is called the collateralized debt obligation

30
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:18,879
CDO and it's really a derivative security from the mortgages

31
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,498
We sliced it and diced it in a slightly different way.

32
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:30,814
How does this solve the problem? Well, now the ratings agency will say if the senior people are going

33
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:35,319
to get paid before everyone else then I'm going to give them a higher rating and they can even get insurance

34
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,452
on this and get a credit default swap and maybe give it a triple A rating

35
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:47,347
which means that the pensions can now buy the senior rated CDO and they'll pay them less interest

36
00:03:47,347 --> 00:03:52,919
maybe they'll pay them 5% the mezzaninie they'll get paid next and they'll get maybe a still a double B rating

37
00:03:52,919 --> 00:04:01,557
and they'll get the 8% and then the equity tranche they'll get a higher interest so they'll get

38
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:06,526
say a 15% interest in exchange for being the last person to get paid and maybe they don't get any rating

39
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:09,963
at all so you can almost view this as a junk rating if you want to view it that way.

40
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:11,774
That makes both people happy.

41
00:04:11,774 --> 99:59:59,999
Pensions get safe, lower yield, hedge funds get something risky but it has a higher yield.
