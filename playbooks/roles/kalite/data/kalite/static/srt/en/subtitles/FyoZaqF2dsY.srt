1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,450
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,590
We're now in the final
test, test eight.

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,660
And we'll start in Section
2, problem one.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,790
The total cost of three equally
priced mechanical

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,770
pencils is $4.50.

7
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,210
If the cost per pencil is
increased by $0.50, how much

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,260
will five of these
pencils cost?

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,600
So three pencils, three times
the cost of the pencil is

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,290
equal to $4.50.

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,150
So pencil is equal to
$4.50 divided by 3.

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,810
Just divide both sides
of that equation by 3

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,710
and that equals $1.50.

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,340
Then they say the cost per
pencil is increased by $0.50.

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,050
So we're going to go from $1.50
plus $0.50, so that'll

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,880
get us to $2,00 per pencil.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,990
How much will five of these
pencils cost at the new rate?

18
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,636
So it's $2.00 per pencil, times
5, and that's $10.00.

19
00:00:58,636 --> 00:01:01,980
And that's choice E.

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,230
Problem two.

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,140
   

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,140
OK, the table above represents
a relationship

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,510
between x and y.

24
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:17,555
So x can be-- x and y,
so it's 1, 2, 3, 4.

25
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:20,280
   

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:28,870
And then y, when x is
1, is 3, 7, 11, 15.

27
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,510
Which of the following linear
equations describes the

28
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,725
relationship?

29
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:36,530
So let's see if we can think of
something here on our own.

30
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,710
   

31
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,510
Let's see, this looks like--
well, I don't know how you

32
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,410
would get to 4 times-- let's see
the choices, actually, see

33
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,230
which ones work.

34
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,660
So A is y is equal
to x plus 1.

35
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,160
Try this out, x plus 1.

36
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,640
1 plus 1 is 2, so that's
not right.

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,180
They've got 3 here.

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,670
So that fails.

39
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,900
B, y is equal to x plus 4.

40
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,020
When x is 1-- if it was x plus
4, then this would be 5.

41
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,750
But this is 3, so that's
not right.

42
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,120
Choice C, y is equal to 3x.

43
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,410
That works here, right? x
is 1, y is 3 times 1.

44
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,250
But it fails here, because
when x is 2, then

45
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,190
this should be 6.

46
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,340
But it's 7, so this
isn't right.

47
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,040
These are all wrong.

48
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,440
Choice D, y is equal to 4x.

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,710
Well, that fails on
this first one.

50
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,320
When x is 1, if it was
4x, this would be 4.

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,110
But it's not, so that fails.

52
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,630
Choice E is probably going
to be our answer.

53
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,720
Let's try.

54
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,620
y is equal to 4x minus 1.

55
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,360
So when x is 1, 4 times
1 is 4 minus 1 is 3.

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,950
4 times 2 is 8 minus 1 is 7.

57
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,920
4 times 3 is 12,
minus 1 is 11.

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,395
4 times 4 is 16,
minus 1 is 15.

59
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:00,370
So it works.

60
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,830
Next problem, soon. problem 3.

61
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,250
OK, they drew two circles.

62
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,710
They look tangent
to each other.

63
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,420
One circle looks like that.

64
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,790
Let me see if my skills of
drawing tangent circles, how

65
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,350
good they are.

66
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,606
You got one circle, and
not bad, not bad if I

67
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:23,180
have to say so myself.

68
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,140
And then they draw a line that
looks like from the center of

69
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,140
one circle to the other.

70
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,520
I'll do it in a different
color.

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:38,020
So we are going from here
roughly to there.

72
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,020
I know it doesn't look like
center to center, but I think

73
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,820
you get the idea.

74
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,080
They're saying this
point here is A.

75
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,300
This point right here is B.

76
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,040
And then this point
right here is C.

77
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,380
In the figure above, the two
circles are tangent at the

78
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,125
point B, and AC is equal to 6,
so this whole distance is

79
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,920
equal to 6, and they're tangent
right here, so these

80
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,130
circles just touch point B.

81
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,210
If the circumference of circle
with center A is twice the

82
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,250
circumference of the circle
with center C, what is the

83
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,700
length of BC?

84
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,260
So we want to know what BC is.

85
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,200
So this circumference is twice
the length of this

86
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,529
circumference.

87
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,260
So what's the formula
for circumference?

88
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,650
Circumference is equal
to 2 pi r, right?

89
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,660
So let's say that this is r.

90
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,030
Let's call this distance r.

91
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,690
   

92
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,580
What do we know about
this distance?

93
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,320
Let's call that x,
I guess, right?

94
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,180
So if this distance is r, the
radius of the large circle is

95
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,220
r, its circumference is going
to be 2 pi r, right?

96
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,640
So what's the circumference
of the smaller circle?

97
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,940
Well, it's 1/2 of that.

98
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:57,450
So c/2 is equal to 1/2 of the
big circle circumference is

99
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,765
equal to the circumference of
the smaller circle, which is 2

100
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:02,320
pi x, right?

101
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,375
Because the radius is x.

102
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,650
But what's c/2?

103
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,760
That's this divided by 2.

104
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,050
So c/2 is the same thing
as this divided

105
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,020
by 2, which is what?

106
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,480
The 2 would just disappear,
so it equals pi r.

107
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:23,080
You could take both pi's away,
and you get 2x is equal to r,

108
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,350
or x is equal to r/2.

109
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,100
And you really didn't
have to do that.

110
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,920
You could just know that
circumference is directly

111
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,540
proportional to radius, unlike
area, which is proportional to

112
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,490
the square.

113
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,750
So circumference is directly
proportional to radius.

114
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,900
So if this circle has twice
the circumference as this

115
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,860
circle, its radius is also going
to be twice the radius

116
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,230
of this circle.

117
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,350
But that's interesting now.

118
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,660
So now we know that if this is
x, this distance here is x, BC

119
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,460
is x, this distance here is
going to be 2x, right?

120
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,440
It's going to be 2 times
the small radius.

121
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,580
And we know that when you add
all of them together, 2x plus

122
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,200
x, you get the whole length from
AC, A to C, and you so

123
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,590
that equals y.

124
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,990
So you get 3x is equal
to 6 and then you get

125
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,460
x is equal to 2.

126
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,830
And that's our answer,
because we wanted to

127
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,190
know just what x is.

128
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,610
And so the really fast way of
doing this is, if you said,

129
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,040
well, this is going to be
twice-- let's define x as this

130
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,480
small radius.

131
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,140
And if this circle has twice the
circumference, it's going

132
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,000
to have twice the radius.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,490
So this would be 2x.

134
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,530
And then you could just go
straight to this step without

135
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,620
having to do all of this.

136
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:34,200
Next problem, problem 4.

137
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,835
OK, they drew a bunch
of points.

138
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:38,730
Let's see, a lot of
drawing for me.

139
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,600
I'm a little tired.

140
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,570
My goal is to finish these
problems this weekend, and

141
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,740
it's midnight and
past my bedtime.

142
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,010
But I'm hanging in there and
trying to finish all of these.

143
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,175
OK, so let's see, they have
point C, which is up here.

144
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:57,120
And I don't know if I have
to be accurate with the

145
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,110
coordinates yet.

146
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,610
Point B is roughly here.

147
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,090
Point A is here.

148
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,542
So then you have point E that's
right around here.

149
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:16,950
And then you have point D,
which is right there.

150
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,310
What are they going to ask us?

151
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,550
Which of the letter points
in the figure above has

152
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,480
coordinates x, y, such that the
absolute value of x minus

153
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,600
the absolute value of
y is equal to 3?

154
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,570
So we could just try out the
points, but they're really

155
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,250
just saying that no matter what
the x and y-- they say it

156
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,410
doesn't matter what
quadrant it is.

157
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,850
We want the difference between
the x and the y to be 3.

158
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,210
So the intuition here is that
the x is going to be larger

159
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,460
than the y, right?

160
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,800
Or the distance that x is away
from the origin is going to be

161
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,030
larger by 3 than the distance
that y is away from the

162
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,720
origin, right?

163
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,840
Because the absolute value of x,
you kind of view it as the

164
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,800
distance x is from the origin,
and absolute value of y is the

165
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,790
distance y is from the origin.

166
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,980
So which ones have a larger
distance x from the origin

167
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,910
than a y from the origin?

168
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,200
Well, it looks like D, right?

169
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,920
D looks further in
this direction.

170
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,360
Let me switch colors.

171
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,110
D is further in this direction
than it is in this direction.

172
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,370
And if we look at the other
choices, B also is like that.

173
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,660
And so let's look at
the coordinates.

174
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,970
Those are my prime
coordinates.

175
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,920
If I actually look at the
graph, B looks like

176
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,700
it's 1, 2, 3, 4.

177
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,419
So this looks like minus
4 and minus 1.

178
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,282
So B looks like minus
4, minus 1.

179
00:08:38,282 --> 00:08:40,049
And actually, that looks
like our answer, right?

180
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,049
Because what's the absolute
value of 4?

181
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,720
That's the absolute value of
minus 4 minus the absolute

182
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,440
value of minus 1.

183
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,040
That equals 4 minus
1, which equals 3.

184
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,170
So that is choice B.

185
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,020
We didn't have to try D.

186
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,870
Next problem.

187
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,370
Actually, I'm coming
up on nine minutes.

188
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,450
So I'll do the next problem
in the next video.

189
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,870
I'll see

190
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,300
