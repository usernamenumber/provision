1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,140
In the last video we learned
what it meant to take the

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,900
product of two matrices.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,330
So if we have one matrix A, and
it's an m by n matrix, and

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,120
then we have some other
matrix B, let's say

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,270
that's an n by k matrix.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:26,040
And we've defined the product
of A and B to be equal to--

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,080
And actually before I define the
product, let me just write

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,610
B out as just a collection
of column vectors.

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,460
So we know that B can be written
as a column vector b1,

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,050
another column vector b2, and
all the way it's going to have

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,230
k of them because it has exactly
k columns, so bk.

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,540
So the last video we defined the
product of A and B , and

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,390
they have to have the columns
of A have to be the same as

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,120
the rows of B in order for
this to be well-defined.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,960
But we define this product to
be equal to A times each of

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,310
the column vectors of B.

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,640
So it's equal to-- let me switch
back to that color--

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,160
it's equal to A times-- do it in
the color that I did it-- A

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,830
times b1, and then the second
column of our product is going

21
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,590
to be A times b2.

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,160
   

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:30,840
Our third product is going to be
A times b3, all the way to

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,120
A times bk.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:41,630
   

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,930
Right there.

27
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,280
And the whole motivation for
this, you've probably you've

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,110
seen this before, maybe in your
Algebra II class-- it

29
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,330
might have not been defined
exactly this way, but this is

30
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,315
the equivalent to what you
probably saw in your Algebra

31
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:55,040
II class-- but the neat thing
about this definition is that

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,480
the motivation came from the
composition of two linear

33
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,390
transformations whose
transformation matrices were

34
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,670
the matrices A and B.

35
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,600
And I showed you that
in the last video.

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,975
With that said, let's actually
compute some matrix-matrix

37
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:11,510
products just so you
get the hang of it.

38
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,310
So let's say that I
have the matrix A.

39
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:25,490
Let's say that A is equal to the
matrix 1, minus 1, 2, 0,

40
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,050
minus 2, and 1.

41
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,900
I keep the numbers low to keep
our arithmetic fairly

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,100
straightforward.

43
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,900
And let's say that I have the
matrix B, and let's say that

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:49,520
it is equal to 1, 0, 1, 1,
2, 0, 1, minus 1, and

45
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,200
then 3, 1, 0, 2.

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,220
So A is a 2 by 3 matrix,
2 rows, 3 columns.

47
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,530
And B is a 3 by 4 matrix.

48
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,140
So by our definition, what
is the product AB

49
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,380
going to be equal to?

50
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,980
Well, we know it's well-defined
because the

51
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,590
number of columns here is equal
to the number of rows,

52
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,900
so we can actually take these
matrix vector products--

53
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:27,280
you'll see that in a second-- so
AB is equal to the matrix A

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,970
times the column vector,
1, 2, 3.

55
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,720
That's going to be the first
column in our product matrix.

56
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,160
And the second one is going to
be the matrix A times the

57
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,910
column 0, 0, 1.

58
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,190
The third column is going to
be the matrix A times the

59
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,260
column vector 1, 1, 0.

60
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,190
And then the fourth column in
our product vector is going to

61
00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:00,680
be the matrix A times the column
vector 1, minus 1, 2.

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,770
And this, when we write it like
this, it should be clear

63
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,620
why this has to be, why the
number of columns in A have to

64
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,460
be the number of rows in B,
because the column vectors in

65
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,500
B are going to have the same
number of components as the

66
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,470
number of rows in B, so all of
the column vectors in B-- so

67
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,540
if we call this B1, B2, B3, B4,
all of my bi's-- let me

68
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,020
write it this way-- all of my
bi's where this i could be 1,

69
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,470
2, or 3, or 4, are all
members of R3.

70
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,530
So we only have matrix vector
products well-defined when the

71
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,270
number of columns in your
matrix are equivalent to

72
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,690
essentially the dimensionality
of your vectors.

73
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,810
That's why that number
and that number

74
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,150
has to be the same.

75
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,280
Well, now we've reduced our
matrix-matrix product problem

76
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,200
to just four different matrix
vector product problems, so we

77
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,550
can just multiply these.

78
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,690
This is nothing new to
us, so let's do it.

79
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,740
   

80
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,060
And so what is this equal to?

81
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,140
So AB,-- let me rewrite it--
AB, my product vector, is

82
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,320
going to be equal to-- so this
first column is the matrix A

83
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,030
times the column
vector 1, 2, 3.

84
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,250
And how did we define that?

85
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,550
Remember, one way to think about
it is that this is equal

86
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,760
to the-- you can kind of think
of it as the-- each of the

87
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,890
rows of A dotted with the column
here of B, or even

88
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,420
better, this is the transpose
of some matrix, right?

89
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,330
Let me write this this way.

90
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,650
If a is equal to-- sorry-- the
transpose of some vector,

91
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,110
let's say that a is equal to the
column vector 0, minus 1,

92
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,710
2, then a transpose-- and
I haven't talked about

93
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,630
transposes a lot yet, but I
think you get the idea.

94
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,240
You just changed all of the
columns into rows-- so a

95
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,550
transpose will just be equal
to 0, minus 1, 2.

96
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,760
You just go from a column
vector to a row vector.

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,270
So if we called this thing here,
a transpose, then when

98
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,810
we take the product of our
matrix A times this vector, we

99
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,960
essentially are just taking A
and dotting with this guy for

100
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,420
our first row and our
first column.

101
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,450
So let me do it that
way, so let me

102
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,650
write it in that notation.

103
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,610
So this is going to be the
matrix-- or sorry-- the vector

104
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,880
1, minus 1, 2.

105
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,090
That's essentially, that row
right there represented as a

106
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,650
column dotted with 1, 2, 3.

107
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,420
Actually, let me do it in that
color just so I can later

108
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,040
switch to one color to make
things simple-- but dotted

109
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,020
with 1, 2, 3.

110
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,520
So we just took that row, or, I
guess the column equivalent

111
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,280
of that row, and dotted
with this.

112
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,620
And I wrote it like this because
we've only defined dot

113
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,800
products for column vectors.

114
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,410
I could do it maybe for row
vectors, but we don't need to

115
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,330
make a new definition.

116
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,530
So that's going to be the first
entry in this matrix

117
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,210
vector product.

118
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,370
The second entry is going to
be the second row of A

119
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,810
essentially dotted with this
vector right there, so it's

120
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:23,270
going to be equal to 0, minus 2,
and 1, dotted with 1, 2, 3.

121
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,820
   

122
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,230
And we just keep doing that--
and I'll just switch maybe to

123
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,430
one neutral color now-- so
that A times 0, 0, 1.

124
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,510
That's going to be the first row
of A expressed as a column

125
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,420
vector, so we can write
it like this, 1, minus

126
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,890
1, 2 dot 0, 0, 1.

127
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,640
And then, actually, and then
we have our and then the

128
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,770
second row of A dotted with this
column vector, so we have

129
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:01,830
0, minus 2, 1, dotted
with 0, 0, 1.

130
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,800
Two more rows left.

131
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,090
This can get a little tedious
and it's inevitable that I'll

132
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,390
probably make a careless
mistake, but as long as you

133
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,560
understand the process, that's
the important thing.

134
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,900
So the next one, this row of A
expressed as a column vector,

135
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,990
1, minus 1, 2, and we're going
to dot it with this vector

136
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,630
right there, 1, 1, 0.

137
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,830
And then this row of A-- I can
just look over here as well--

138
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:33,730
0, minus 2, 1, dotted
with 1, 1, 0.

139
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,380
And then finally the last two
entries are going to be the

140
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,690
top row of A, 1, minus 1, 2,
dotted with this column

141
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,840
vector, 1, minus 1, 2-- a little
dot there, remember

142
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,630
we're taking the dot product--
and then finally this second

143
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:57,460
row of A, so 0, minus 2, 1,
dotted with this column

144
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,100
vector, 1, minus 1, 2.

145
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,250
And that is going to be our
product matrix-- and this

146
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,190
looks very complicated right
now but now we just have to

147
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,270
compute it, and dot products
tend to simplify things a good

148
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,320
bit-- so what is our matrix--
our product-- going to

149
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,690
simplify to?

150
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,750
I'll do it in pink.

151
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,370
AB is equal to-- draw the
matrix right there.

152
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,190
So what is the dot product
of these two things?

153
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,140
It's 1 times 1.

154
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,820
I'll just write it out.

155
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:31,040
It's 1 times 1, I'll just write,
1 times 1 is 1, plus

156
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,270
minus 1 times 2, so minus 2,
plus 2 times 3, plus 6.

157
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,470
Now we'll do this term right
here, 0 times 1 is 0, plus

158
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,290
minus 2 times 2, so that's
minus 4, plus 1

159
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,730
times 3, plus 3.

160
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,490
Now we're on to this term, 1
times 0 is 0, plus minus 1

161
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,400
times 0, plus 0, plus 2 times
1 is equal to plus 2.

162
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,980
This term, 0 times 0 is 0, plus
minus 2 times 0-- let me

163
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,530
write it 0 plus minus 2 times
0 is 0, plus 1 times 1.

164
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,340
So plus 1, and here you have 1
times 1 is 1, plus minus 1

165
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,360
times 1 is minus 1, plus
2 times 0, so plus 0.

166
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,880
Here 0 times 1 is 0, 2 minus 2
times 1 is minus 2, and then 1

167
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
times 0 is plus 0.

168
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,400
Almost done.

169
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:33,880
1 times 1 is 1; minus 1 times
minus 1 is 1; 2 times 2 is 4.

170
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,740
Finally, 0 times 1 is 0; minus
2 times minus 1 is 2.

171
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,870
1 times 2 is also 2.

172
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,210
And we're in the home stretch,
so now we just have to add up

173
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,360
these values.

174
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,570
So our dot product of the two
matrices is equal to the 2 by

175
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:58,190
4 matrix, 1 minus 2 plus 6.

176
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,200
That's equal to 5.

177
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,960
Minus 4 plus 3 is minus 1.

178
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,700
This is just 2.

179
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,450
This is just 1.

180
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:11,090
Then we have 1 minus 1 plus 0
is just 0, minus 2, right?

181
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:15,110
We just have a minus 2 there, 1
plus 1 plus 4 is 6, and then

182
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,680
2 plus 2 is 4.

183
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,580
And we are done.

184
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,210
The product of A B is equal
to this matrix right here.

185
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,290
Let me get my A and B back.

186
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,525
We can talk a little bit more
about what this product

187
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:28,386
actually represented.

188
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:30,650
So let me copy and paste this.

189
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,950
   

190
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,160
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

191
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,870
Go down here, paste.

192
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,120
There you go.

193
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,190
So this was our A and our B.

194
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,150
And when we took the product
we got this matrix here.

195
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,990
Now there is another couple of
interesting things to notice.

196
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,900
Remember, I only said that
this product is only

197
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,500
well-defined when the number
of columns in A is equal to

198
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,350
the number of rows in B.

199
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,480
So that was the case
in this situation.

200
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,610
And then notice, we got a 2 by
4 matrix, which is the number

201
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:11,300
of rows in A times the number
of columns in B.

202
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,470
So we got a 2 by 4 matrix.

203
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,890
So another natural question is,
could we have found, or is

204
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,760
it even equal, if we were
to take the product BA?

205
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,250
If we were to even take
the product BA.

206
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,320
So if we tried to apply our
definition there, what would

207
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,195
it be equal to?

208
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:33,610
It would be equal to the matrix
B times the column 1,

209
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:39,090
0, then the matrix B times the
column minus 1, minus 2.

210
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,150
And then it would be
the matrix B times

211
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,740
the column 2, 1.

212
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,070
Now, can we take this matrix
vector product?

213
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:52,350
We have a 3 by 4-- this right
here is a 3 by 4 matrix, and

214
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,390
this guy right here
is a member of R2.

215
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,440
So this is not well-defined.

216
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,910
We have more columns here than
entries here, so we have never

217
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,950
defined a matrix vector
product like this.

218
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,680
So not only is this
not equal to this,

219
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,920
it's not even defined.

220
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:16,520
So it's not defined when you
take a 3 by 4 matrix, and you

221
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,130
take the product of that
with a 2 by 4 matrix.

222
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,740
It's not defined because
that number and that

223
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,410
number is not equal.

224
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,030
And so obviously since this
is defined and this isn't

225
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,600
defined, you know that AB is
not always equal to BA.

226
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,240
In fact, it's not usually equal
to BA, and sometimes

227
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,160
it's not even defined.

228
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,610
And the last point I want to
make is, you probably learned

229
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,550
to do matrix-matrix products in
Algebra II, but you didn't

230
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,150
have any motivation for what you
were doing, but now we do

231
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,450
have a motivation.

232
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,690
Because when you're taking the
product of A and B, we learned

233
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:54,710
in the last video that if we
have two transformations,

234
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:00,390
let's say we have the
transformation, S is a

235
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:12,590
transformation from R3 to R2,
and that S is represented by

236
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,710
the matrix.

237
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,700
So S, given some matrix in
R3, if you'd apply the

238
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,340
transformation S to it, it's
equivalent to multiplying

239
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,000
that, or given any vector
in R3, applying the

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,350
transformation S is equivalent
to multiplying that

241
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,320
vector times A.

242
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,460
We can say that.

243
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,380
And I used R3 and R2 because the
number of columns in A is

244
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,580
3, so it can apply to a
three-dimensional vector.

245
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,890
And similarly, we can imagine
B as being the matrix

246
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,450
transformation of some
transformation, T, that is a

247
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:58,660
mapping from R4 to R3, where if
you give it some vector x

248
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,190
in R4, it will produce-- you
take the product of that with

249
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,420
B, and you're going to get
some vector in R3.

250
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,140
Now, if we think of the
composition of the two-- so

251
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,570
let's think about it a little
bit-- if we have R4 here-- let

252
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:25,560
me switch colors-- we have R4
here, we have R3 here, and

253
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:32,020
then we have R2 here.

254
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,360
T is a transformation
from R4 to R3.

255
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,390
So T would look like that.

256
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,150
T is a transformation
and it's B times x.

257
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,740
That's what T is equal to, so
T is this transformation.

258
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,710
And then S is a transformation
from R3 to R2.

259
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,650
So S looks like that.

260
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,480
And S is equivalent to
A times any vector in

261
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,660
R3, so that is S.

262
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,420
So now we know how to visualize,
or how to think

263
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,140
about, what the product
of A and B are.

264
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,480
The product of A and B is
essentially, you apply the

265
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,770
transformation B first-- so
let me think of it-- the

266
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:19,870
composition of S-- let me write
it this way-- so what is

267
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,270
the composition of S with T?

268
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:31,830
This is equal to-- of x-- this
is equal to S of T of x.

269
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,300
So you take a transformation
from R4 to R3, and then you

270
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,780
take the S transformation from
R3 to R2, so this is S of T.

271
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:47,150
S of T is a transformation from
R4 all the way to R2.

272
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,340
And then the neat thing about
this, if you were to just

273
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,710
write this out in its matrix
representations-- we did this

274
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,150
in the last video-- this would
be equal to the S matrix A

275
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:03,200
times this vector right
here, which is Bx.

276
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,390
But now we know that the
matrix-- by our definition of

277
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,700
matrix vector products-- that
this guy right here is going

278
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,972
to have a transformation.

279
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:17,930
It's going to be equal to-- So
the composition S of T of x is

280
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:23,180
going to be equal to the
matrix AB, based on our

281
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,050
definition, so the
transformation AB

282
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,190
times some vector x.

283
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,960
So the reason why I'm going all
this is because we just

284
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,820
did a matrix-matrix
product up here.

285
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,680
We took the pain of multiplying
the matrix A times

286
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,060
the matrix B and we got this
value here-- and hopefully I

287
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,880
didn't make any careless
mistakes.

288
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,150
But the big idea here, the idea
that you probably weren't

289
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,910
exposed to in your Algebra II
class, is that this is the

290
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:51,650
matrix of the composition of the
transformations S and T.

291
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,780
So right here, it's the matrix
of the composition of S and T.

292
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,970
So you're not just blindly doing
some-- matrix-matrix

293
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,260
products can be pretty tedious,
but now you know what

294
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,900
they're for.

295
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,240
They're actually for the
composition of two

296
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,940
transformations where each of A
and B are the transformation

297
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,440
matrices for each of the
individual linear

298
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,490
transformations.

299
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,920
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
