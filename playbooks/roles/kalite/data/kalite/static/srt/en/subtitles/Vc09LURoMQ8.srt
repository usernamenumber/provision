00:00:00,927 --> 00:00:03,248
In the video on triangle medians and centroids

2
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:08,398
I did essentially the proof that the centroid is 2/3 along the way of the median.

3
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:14,611
I did it using a two-dimensional triangle in three dimensions, and I mentioned that I thought at least it made the math a little simpler

4
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:18,713
Ah, but someone mentioned that they'd be interested in seeing the two dimensional version of the proof,

5
00:00:18,713 --> 00:00:21,918
so, so why not do that. So let's just draw an arbitrary triangle,

6
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:25,946
and I'll make one, I'll make one side of the triangle right along the x- axis

7
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:28,943
just to make, I think it'll make the math a little bit easier,

8
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:30,788
maybe there's easier ways of doing it.

9
00:00:30,788 --> 00:00:35,136
So that's one side of the triangle, that's the other side of the triangle.

10
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:40,802
And let's put, let's put kind of the height of the triangle, let's put it on the y-axis.

11
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:48,806
So this triangle right here, this is y-axis, that is the y-axis, and then

12
00:00:48,806 --> 00:01:00,017
this right here. This right here,is our x-axis. Now, we said that this is an arbitrary triangle.

13
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:12,270
So let's make, let's just make this distance equal to A, so this point right here, this vertex would be the point (A,0), so that distance is A, let's make

14
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:19,885
this distance, let's make this distance right here be equal to, I don't know let's make it equal to B

15
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:24,223
so this is the point (-B,0)

16
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:35,894
and then let's make this distance, this is the point Y=Z, so this is the point (0,Z) So this is an arbitrary triangle, any triangle can be represented this way

17
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:43,278
Now let's think about it's medians, let's think about medians and the centroid And I'm only gonna do for two of the medians, because we know

18
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:49,529
that the third median will also intersect at the same centroid

19
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:52,888
So let's just find, so we have a median on this, we have a midpoint,

20
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:54,901
I should say, on this side of the triangle

21
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:56,930
And it's coordinates are just gonna be

22
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,799
midpoint of those two points or,

23
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,032
zero plus A over 2, which would just be A over 2

24
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:06,773
And then C plus 0 over 2, which would just be C over 2

25
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:08,643
And let's do the same thing over here

26
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:12,373
The midpoint of this side, right over here, is going to be,

27
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:14,588
negative B plus 0 over 2

28
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:16,632
So it's negative B over 2

29
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:19,431
And then, 0 plus C over 2

30
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:24,327
So it's just going to be, it's just going to be C over 2

31
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:27,837
Now that we know all the coordinates for the vertices

32
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:28,968
and the midpoints,

33
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:31,028
at least for this two sides, we can find the equations

34
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:34,650
for the lines that the medians are part of

35
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,660
So we could find the equation for this line, we could find

36
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,335
the equation in this line in purple, then we could find the equation

37
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:45,055
for the other lines that connect this 2 dots, find the intersection,

38
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:48,828
and we'll essentially have the coordinates of our centroid,

39
00:02:48,828 --> 00:02:50,439
of the intersection of the medians

40
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,740
And we could do it for this one too,

41
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,960
but that would be redundant because

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,387
it's going to intersect in the same point

43
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:57,000
So what would be, what would be the equation

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,600
for this line right over here?

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,374
Well our slope, our slope is going to be changed in Y,

46
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:04,015
so C over 2 minus 0,

47
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:08,411
so that's just C over 2, over changing in X

48
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:13,056
So, A over 2 minus, minus B, minus B

49
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:17,109
So it's a minus -B I should say

50
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:20,237
So, it's plus B, could write a plus B over here,

51
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:21,880
but just to make the math simple,

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,578
I'll write plus 2B, plus 2B over 2, right?

53
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:28,673
I just subtracted a -B, which is the same thing as adding a B,

54
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:31,941
and I just, and adding B is the same thing as adding a 2B over 2

55
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:34,076
And I did that so these have the same,

56
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:36,042
these have the same denominator

57
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:38,349
I could add them, or I could just multiply the numerator

58
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:39,851
and the denominator both by 2,

59
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:45,096
and I'll get the slope is equal to C over A plus 2B

60
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:47,465
So that's the slope of this line, right over here

61
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:51,520
And then, we know some points here, we could just use

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,925
the point slope formula for the equation of a line

63
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:58,345
We know the point -B comma 0 is on the line,

64
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:01,210
so we know that the equation of this line in purple,

65
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,489
let me state in the purple is going to be, Y minus 0

66
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,628
is equal to, is equal to X minus negative B,

67
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:13,192
or I could say X plus B times our slope,

68
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:17,012
times C over A plus 2B, A plus 2B

69
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:22,757
And obviously, this would just simplify that Y

70
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:24,905
is equal to all of these business over here

71
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:28,219
So this is essentially the equation of this median right here,

72
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:30,251
if the line just kept going, or this line

73
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:33,465
The median is a line segment that is part of this line

74
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,572
Now let's do the same thing for, let us do the same thing for

75
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:40,182
this line right over here

76
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:42,551
This median right over here

77
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:45,912
So once again, its slope is changed over,

78
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,680
change in Y over change in X

79
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,879
So the change in line C over 2 minus 0

80
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,183
So the slope here is equal to C over 2 minus 0,

81
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:56,220
which is just C over 2,

82
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,518
over -B over 2, -B over 2 minus A

83
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:06,313
Or I could say, minus 2A over 2,

84
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:07,906
that's the same thing as minus A

85
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,702
And do the same thing, multiply the numerator

86
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:10,970
and the denominator by 2

87
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:20,664
We get C over, C over -B minus, -B minus 2A

88
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:23,092
So the equation of this line right here, the other median,

89
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:27,520
the equation of this other median right over here is,

90
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,343
we have this point over here so, we could use the point slope again

91
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:37,812
We get Y minus 0, Y minus 0, is equal to X minus A,

92
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:41,746
is equal to X minus A times the slope

93
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:48,758
Time C over -B minus, -B minus 2A

94
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:52,085
So we have the 2 equations for these lines, we can now use

95
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,795
that information to find their intersection

96
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:56,849
which is going to be, the centroid

97
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:00,070
Well to do that, we have both of these in terms of Y right?

98
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,600
Y minus 0 is the same thing as Y, Y minus 0 is the same thing as Y

99
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,404
So we could just set this as being equal to that

100
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:10,627
So let's do that

101
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:21,479
We get, X plus B times C over A plus 2B is equal to, is equal to

102
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:28,351
X minus A times C over -B minus 2A

103
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,440
Well both sides are divisible by C,

104
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,243
we could assume that their C is non-zero,

105
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:35,025
so this triangle actually exist

106
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,355
It actually exist in 2 dimension

107
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,800
So we can divide both sides by C and we get that

108
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,930
Now let's see, now we can cross multiply,

109
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,694
we can multiply X plus B times this quantity right here

110
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:48,722
and that's going to be equal to A plus 2B

111
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:50,197
times this quantity over here

112
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:53,211
And so we can just distribute it, so it's going to be

113
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,852
X times all of this business,

114
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:58,862
so it's going to be X times -B minus 2A

115
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:01,312
plus B times all of these

116
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:05,427
So that gonna be minus B squared, minus 2AB

117
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:07,112
So i just multiplied that times that,

118
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:10,100
is going to be equals to that times that

119
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,742
So it's gonna be X times all of this business

120
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:17,222
X times A plus 2B, minus A times that

121
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:23,306
So minus, distribute the A, minus, A squared minus to AB,

122
00:07:23,306 --> 00:07:25,471
see if we can simplify this

123
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:28,790
So it's, we have a negative 2AB on both sides,

124
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,146
so let's just subtract that out

125
00:07:30,146 --> 00:07:32,997
And then if we, let's, so we cancel things out,

126
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:35,595
let's subtract this from both sides of the equation,

127
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:40,798
so we'll have a minus, minus X times A minus 2B do,

128
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:42,903
and I'll subtract that from here,

129
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:44,204
but I'll write it a little different,

130
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:45,162
it'll simplify things

131
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:49,527
So this will become, this will become a X times, I'll distribute

132
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,123
the negative inside the A plus 2B

133
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:54,868
So negative A minus 2B

134
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:58,102
And let's add a B squared to both sides

135
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:02,530
So plus B squared, plus B squared

136
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,666
I want to collect all the X terms on one side

137
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,428
and all the the constants on the other

138
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:10,518
And so this becomes, this becomes

139
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:13,769
On the left hand side the coefficient on X,

140
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,971
I have negative B minus 2B is,

141
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:25,115
negative 3B, negative 2A minus A is, negative 3A times X,

142
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:29,869
is equal to, these guys cancel out,

143
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,415
these guys cancel out, is equal to

144
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:32,669
B squared minus A squared

145
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,852
Is equal to B squared minus A squared

146
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:36,104
Let's see if we can fact,

147
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:38,969
this already looks a little suspicious in a good way

148
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,364
Something that we should be able to solve

149
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:43,060
This can be factored, we can factor our negative 3

150
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,334
or we can actually factor out a 3,

151
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:52,962
we'll get 3 times B minus A, 3 times, actually,

152
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:54,809
let's factor a negative 3

153
00:08:54,809 --> 00:09:00,334
So negative 3, negative 3 times B plus A times X is equal to,

154
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:04,663
now this is the same thing as B plus A, times B minus A!

155
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:12,315
So we can divide both sides by B plus A, we have negative 3 times X

156
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:16,663
is equal to B minus A, we'll just divide both side by negative 3

157
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:22,264
We get X is equal to B minus A over negative 3,

158
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:29,773
which is the same thing asA minus B, A minus B over 3

159
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:31,460
So we have the X coordinate,

160
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:37,297
we have the X coordinate so far for our centroid

161
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:38,272
It is A minus B over 3

162
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:41,706
It is A minus B over 3

163
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,703
And you kinda see hints of the solution over here

164
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:50,529
A minus B is its entire distance

165
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:51,414
It's one third of this entire distance, although,

166
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:52,697
I don't want to jump the gun too much because

167
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:54,724
it complicates it just thinking about, just the X coordinated

168
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,010
Let's figure out the Y coordinate

169
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,527
To do that, we could just substitute back

170
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,645
into one these equations up here

171
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:03,317
This was the, this was the equation of this median,

172
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:05,171
the gray median that we had done

173
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,470
So let's substitute back in, we have Y is equal, Y, I did over here

174
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:14,585
Y is equal to X minus A times C

175
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:16,471
X is this thing over here

176
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:21,736
So it's A minus B over 3 minus A

177
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:24,070
So I'm gonna subtract this, instead of just writing

178
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,961
a minus A over here, I'm gonna write negative 3 over 3

179
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,271
So minus 3A over 3

180
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:33,022
So that's just minus A right over here

181
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:35,744
I just multiplied it and divided it by 3

182
00:10:35,744 --> 00:10:42,757
It's gonna be all of that times C over, over negative B minus 2A

183
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:45,684
So this is going to be equal to C

184
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:49,196
In the numerator up here, we have an A minus 3A,

185
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:53,778
so this equal to negative B, negative B

186
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,022
We have a negative B there

187
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,656
And then we have aA minus 3A is minus 2A

188
00:10:59,656 --> 00:11:05,140
So this becomes negative B minus 2A times,

189
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,764
we could factor out the one third,

190
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:10,432
times C over 3, so that's what the numerator is

191
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:13,068
All of that over negative B minus 2A

192
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:14,501
Well that's going to cancel with that

193
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:18,449
And so, our Y coordinate is going to be equal to C over 3

194
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:23,295
So our Y coordinate here is C over 3

195
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:25,505
Now could just use the distance formula now

196
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:29,781
We know all the coordinates and,

197
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:30,680
and you feel free to do it if you like

198
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,662
But there's a slight simplification,

199
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:33,188
or at least in my mind, a slight simplification

200
00:11:33,188 --> 00:11:37,536
We know, we know that the height, we know that the Y coordinate,

201
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:43,264
we know that the Y coordinate of the centroid is C over 3

202
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:47,258
So this right here, this point over here is C over 3

203
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:51,347
So we could actually use, maybe an easier argument, cause remember,

204
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:53,870
our whole point was to show, our whole point was to show

205
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,595
that this point is two thirds along the median away from the vertex

206
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,345
So let me draw this vertex now here

207
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,575
Our whole point of this video as we said,

208
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:05,666
this is the midpoint of this side over here,

209
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,509
is to show that this, this right here is

210
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:10,276
two thirds along the way

211
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:12,521
Or that this length is twice this length

212
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:15,942
Or that this length, this length is two thirds

213
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:19,115
of the entire length of the median

214
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:20,696
So how can we do that?

215
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:22,397
Well that simplest way I can do that, I mean you actually,

216
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:24,364
you could actually just use the coordinates

217
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:26,483
and use the the distance formula

218
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:27,630
But a simpler way, just the way that we've arranged this,

219
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,036
is just to use an argument

220
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:30,231
of similar triangles

221
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:34,305
Cause this right here, this right here is,

222
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:38,176
we know that this entire height right here in blue is C

223
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:42,784
We know this entire height over here in blue is C

224
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:45,216
We know that, we know that this height

225
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:48,296
right over here is C over 3 or,

226
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:49,998
you could do that as one third times C

227
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:52,569
And so, we know that this height,

228
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:54,566
we know that this height over here,

229
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,539
we know that, that distance is two thirds

230
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:00,603
Is two thirds, is two thirds C

231
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:02,937
So we can use a similar triangle argument

232
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:07,320
Let's say, let's say that this entire thing right here

233
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,160
is the length of the median

234
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,250
And let's just call that, I dunno, let's call that L

235
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,846
And let's say we wanna figure out how far along the median away

236
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:17,194
from the vertex that is

237
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:18,648
And let's just call that, I dunno,

238
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,015
let me use another, another,

239
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:23,106
let me just call that distance right over,

240
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,621
let me do, use a different color

241
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:29,191
Let's call, let's call this distance right over here,

242
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:31,404
you see, I've already used A, B's, and C's,

243
00:13:31,404 --> 00:13:32,858
let's call that D

244
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:35,228
So I, if we can show that the ratio

245
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:38,138
of D to L is two thirds

246
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:39,546
So this is two thirds of the distance then, we're done!

247
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:42,240
And use that by similar triangles

248
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,362
we have two similar triangles

249
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:46,171
We have this, lemme use a new color

250
00:13:46,171 --> 00:13:50,661
We have this triangle, which is kind of embedded inside

251
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,659
of this larger triangle right over here

252
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:55,180
The both share the same vertex, this angle over here

253
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,059
They both have right angles over here

254
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,291
It's as they have two of the same angles,

255
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,558
the third angle has to be the same

256
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,432
So they're definitely similar triangles

257
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:05,398
so we could just set up a ratio here

258
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:09,406
Two thirds C, which is this length right over here

259
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:12,132
That's the, that's just kind of the,

260
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:14,393
the vertical side of the smaller triangles

261
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:18,757
We could write two thirds C over this entire length,

262
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,559
over the length of the larger that's D

263
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,663
This corresponding side of the larger similar triangle

264
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:28,150
over C is equal to, is equal to

265
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,022
The hypotenuse of the smaller similar triangle D

266
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:34,469
over the hypotenuse of the longer,

267
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:37,628
of the longer similar triangle, or the bigger similar triangle

268
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,406
D over L

269
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:41,451
Well this is clearly, just divide the numerator and denominator by C

270
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:44,421
this clearly becomes two thirds

271
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:48,231
So the ratio from, of this, of this, of this length

272
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:50,598
to this larger length, is two thirds

273
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,353
Or this is two thirds a long way,

274
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:57,005
a long the median away from the vertex

275
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:57,975
So there you go

276
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:00,800
That's the two dimensional proof that the centroid

277
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,392
is two thirds along the way

278
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:06,651
of any median from the vertex, or one third along the way,

279
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,631
along the median

280
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,459
Or one third of the distance of the median

281
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:12,701
from the opposite midpoint

282
00:15:12,701 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that
