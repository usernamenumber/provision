1
00:00:00,095 --> 00:00:01,372
What I want to do in this video

2
00:00:01,372 --> 00:00:02,566
is think about the demand curve

3
00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:04,164
for two different products.

4
00:00:04,164 --> 00:00:05,880
So this is some laptop

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,878
that's on the market.

6
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:08,370
And this, let's just say,

7
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,371
is the cheapest car

8
00:00:09,371 --> 00:00:10,656
that happens to be on the market

9
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,583
this is actually a picture of a 1985

10
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,302
assuming this is the cheapest car on the market.

11
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:17,817
So let's just think about

12
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,287
their hypothetical demand curves right now

13
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,002
So once again, on the vertical axis,

14
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:24,671
we're going to put price,

15
00:00:24,671 --> 00:00:25,417
and on the horizontal axis,

16
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:29,545
we put quantity,

17
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:30,949
and then over here

18
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,635
let me do it for the same thing

19
00:00:32,635 --> 00:00:36,160
So this is price,

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,995
and this right over here is quantity.

21
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:42,314
And both of them satisfy the law of demand

22
00:00:42,314 --> 00:00:44,815
if the price is really high

23
00:00:44,815 --> 00:00:48,210
the quantity demanded is going to be really low for the laptop

24
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,128
and so it might be right over there

25
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:51,578
and if the price is low

26
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:53,588
the quantity demanded is going to increase.

27
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:57,426
So, the demand curve might look something like that.

28
00:00:57,426 --> 00:00:59,301
And it doesn't have to be a curve,

29
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:00,814
or doesn't have to be a line,

30
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:02,364
it could be a curve or anything like that.

31
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:09,762
So that is the current demand for the laptop

32
00:01:09,762 --> 00:01:10,839
All else equal,

33
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:13,158
so we're not talking about shifting any of those other factors

34
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:15,758
that we've been talking about in the last few videos.

35
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:18,154
Now we can draw a similar demand curve

36
00:01:18,154 --> 00:01:20,205
for this very cheap automobile.

37
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,116
If the price is high,

38
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,283
very few people are going to want to buy it,

39
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:26,451
and I'm not going to specify what the price is,

40
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:27,583
but this is a general idea

41
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,956
if the price is higher,

42
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,317
fewer people are going to want to buy it

43
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:31,782
If the price is lower,

44
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:33,025
more people are going to want to buy it

45
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:36,195
So this demand curve will also have the same shape

46
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,024
from the top left to the bottom right

47
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:40,895
it satisfies the law of demand.

48
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:46,037
So once again, that is the current demand.

49
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:47,247
Now let's think about

50
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:50,809
how the demand for each of these goods might change

51
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:54,593
depending on changes in income.

52
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:57,410
So we're going to focus on the income factor

53
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,125
the income effect, for this video

54
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,157
and see how these 2 products might change.

55
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:05,340
So let's just assume that

56
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,154
income in the general population goes up.

57
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:12,816
So for something like a laptop, wow,

58
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:14,085
if more people are making more money

59
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:16,149
especially in real terms

60
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:17,989
they have more money to spend well

61
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:18,489
for any given price point,

62
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,973
at any given price point,

63
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:25,299
there's going to be a higher quantity

64
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:26,075
that's demanded.

65
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:26,741
At any given price point,

66
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:30,227
higher quantity demanded.

67
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:33,389
And so if income goes up for this laptop,

68
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,947
the demand will increase.

69
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,401
And the way we show demand increasing

70
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:39,933
is the whole curve shifts to the right

71
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,819
so this right over here demand increased

72
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:46,276
demand went up when income went up.

73
00:02:46,276 --> 00:02:48,266
And this makes complete sense

74
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,768
and if income were to go down,

75
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:51,316
demand would go down

76
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:52,787
because people would have less money

77
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:54,795
to buy something like a laptop.

78
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:56,173
And this is the case for most goods

79
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:57,897
we call things like this,

80
00:02:57,897 --> 00:02:59,580
when income goes up, demand goes up,

81
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,053
whole curve shifts to the right

82
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:02,879
income goes down, demand goes down,

83
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,299
whole curve shifts to the left

84
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:06,504
We call this a normal good.

85
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:11,650
So this right over here is a normal good.

86
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,787
Now let's think about

87
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:16,730
what happens with the cheapest car on the market.

88
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,687
And let's assume we're in a developed country

89
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:21,788
where almost everyone has some form of a car.

90
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:25,427
Now, what happens when income goes up?

91
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:27,673
So people have more money

92
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:29,545
but are they going to spend that money

93
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,766
buying the cheapest car on the market?

94
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:35,172
Well, in most cases, if income goes up generally,

95
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:36,631
people say, well I have a little bit more money,

96
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:39,254
maybe I'll buy a slightly nicer car.

97
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:40,876
So, and maybe in particular

98
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:42,892
the people who were going to buy this car

99
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:44,176
at any given price point

100
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:45,661
So this price point,

101
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:47,507
the people who were going to buy the car will say

102
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:49,738
Wait! I can now afford a better car!

103
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:51,131
Why should I you know,

104
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,181
this is not safe

105
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,939
maybe or not as safe as the other cars,

106
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,269
and I want to impress my friends

107
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,352
from high school and all that,

108
00:03:57,352 --> 00:04:00,527
so something very strange might happen for this car,

109
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,195
the demand for this car.

110
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:04,493
It actually will decrease

111
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:11,330
so the whole curve could shift to the left.

112
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:14,338
So income is a very strange thing for this good

113
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,337
because income increasing maybe people say,

114
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:17,355
hey you know what,

115
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:18,162
I could trade out of this good

116
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:19,246
I could get a good that

117
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:23,282
I'd rather have than just getting more of this thing right over here

118
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:24,733
Demand went down.

119
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:30,804
And goods like this, we call them inferior goods.

120
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,317
And the general way to think about

121
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:33,558
inferior goods are the goods

122
00:04:33,558 --> 00:04:36,876
that people will want to not own if they had more money

123
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,687
they would want to buy, I guess, less inferior goods.

124
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:41,541
Or another way to think about it is,

125
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,057
if income were to go down,

126
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:46,603
and more people are budget strapped

127
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:47,838
and they can't afford

128
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:49,692
the Mercedes-Benz or the BMW

129
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:51,654
or even the mid-sized sedan anymore,

130
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:52,938
so if income were to go down

131
00:04:52,938 --> 00:04:54,330
and things were getting tighter,

132
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,269
more people would want this car

133
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:57,468
more people would have to trade down to this

134
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,591
because they're strapped,

135
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,855
they're tightening their belts

136
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:04,072
and so you'll have this strange situation

137
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:06,451
where if income goes down,

138
00:05:06,451 --> 00:05:09,009
demand would go up for this thing

139
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,198
So income goes down,

140
00:05:12,198 --> 00:05:13,541
demand goes up.

141
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,161
Remember, we're talking about demand,

142
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:17,172
we're talking about the entire shifting of the curve.

143
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:18,818
At any given price point,

144
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,395
the quantity demanded will go up.

145
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:23,850
Because, this is, or we're assuming,

146
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,207
is the cheapest car on the market.

147
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,641
So, and likewise,

148
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:30,215
if income were to go down for a normal good,

149
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:31,297
it'll do what you'll expect,

150
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,524
demand would go down.

151
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:33,644
So this, an inferior good,

152
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:35,761
does the opposite of a normal good

153
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:40,678
when we're talking about the income effect,

154
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:44,272
the inferior good will do the opposite of a normal good

155
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,280
and that's because people want to trade out of it

156
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,415
when their income goes up

157
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:48,642
or they don't want to buy it

158
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:49,961
or they want to buy something nicer.

159
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,923
And when their income goes down,

160
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:51,453
they'll say

161
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:52,215
I have to buy this thing,

162
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:55,123
so you know, let me just do it.
