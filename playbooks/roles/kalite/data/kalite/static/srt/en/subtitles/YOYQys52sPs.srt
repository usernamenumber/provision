1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now know how to find the areas of rectangles.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want to do in this video, is think about how we can find the areas of triangles.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we are starting here with a right triangle. It has 90 degree angle. Triangle A B C

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets think about how we can find its area. Maybe we can construct a rectangle out of triangle ABC

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if we can construct a reactangle out of it, maybe we can somehow

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
find our area of part of that rectangle and the best way to construct our rectangle is to really duplicate

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ABC

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then flip it over and put it right on top this. So just to verify that it will definitely be a rectangle

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we know that this is 90 degrees right over here. Let's say that this is x degrees right over there

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have x plus 90 plus this thing have to be equal to 180.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this thing and this thing have to add up to 90 so let's just call this 90-x.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now lets flip this thing and rotate it around.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that it will look like this.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that you would have another triangle that would look just like this:

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where now this right angle on the flip version, is that right angle right over there

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this right angle right over here, this angle right over here, this x is now this angle right over there

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this 90-x is now this angle right over there. now you can see x+90 -x that will give you a right

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
angle

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that will gives you a right angle, and you have four sides and four right angles you are definitely

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
dealing with a rectangle.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this rectangle has two of our original triangles in it.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we can write that the area of triangle of ABC.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the area of triangle ABC, thats what the brackets mean. Area of triangle ABC

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be equal to 1/2 times the area of our entire rectangle

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me add another point here, let me call this: D, its going to be 1/2 the are of the rectangle.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ABCD, and we know how to find the area of rectangle ABCD, its going to be equal to.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Its going to be equal to the base of the rectangle. So this is going to be equal to 1/2 times this par.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me use this in a different color, the area of ABCD is equal to the base of the width of the rectangle

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so thats just the length of BC, I'm just putting this in parenthessis.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
BC is just the length of this length segment and I'm just putting it into parenthesis.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that we don't get the letters jumbled up. So its going to be this width or this base right here

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times the height of the rectangle. So times AD, sorry, times AB.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this base times this height is gives us the area of our entire rectangle

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the area of our right triangle is half of that. So there we have it, 1/2 times times this base, times t

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this height.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the area of a right triangle. So in general if you ever have a right triangle and this is a right

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
angle right over there. You need one right angle in order for it be a right triangle and this

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
base has length B and this side over here has side h, so you know that the area

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the area is going to be equal to 1/2 times the base times the base of the triangle

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thats the base of the triangle bc.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times the height of the triangle. so you can view it this way if you look at the actual letter points

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or just view these mesasures as the base times the height. 1/2 base times height

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we only know if this works for a right triangle. now let's think about it for other types of triangle that aren't

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
necessarily right triangles.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So here I have a kind of a arbritrary triangle bc. and to approach figure out its area

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what I want to do is split this up into two right triangles. so what I'm going to do is drop

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a perpendicular from b. so i'm just going to literally, and if this was an actual structure you would just literally drop something straight down from here, and that line is

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to be perpendicular to this base right over here. to ac let me call that point

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me call that point d, and whats useful here is that now that we have constructed we turned that one

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
triangle into two right triangles. So, we can say that the area

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of triangle ABC thats what we want to figure out is equal to the area of this character

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right here. So its equal to the area of triangle ABD.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ABD plus the area of triangle, plus the area of this magenta triangle, of BCD.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
BCD

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this is useful becuase we know how to find the area of right triangles

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is 90 degrees, this is also going to be 90 degrees.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the area of ABD is 1/2 Base times Height.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So its going to be 1/2 times AD times the height

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is going to be the length of BD right over here, assuming that we can figure this out

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this times that length. So BD, thats the area of the blue triangle.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and now if and now I can find the lengrth of the magenta triangle.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well once again its a right triangle its going to be 1/2, times the length of this base,

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here which is DC

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the length of segment DC times the length of BD again.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Times the length of segment bd. Now you can factor out a 1/2
