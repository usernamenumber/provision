1
00:00:00,538 --> 00:00:05,803
The following table contains the first five terms of the given pattern "A".

2
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:09,073
Generate pattern "B" according to this rule:

3
00:00:09,073 --> 00:00:13,069
For every term of pattern "A"... so they give us the terms of pattern "A" here...

4
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:18,534
Multiply the term by 3, and add 1 to get the corresponding term of pattern "B".

5
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:21,867
Then Graph the pairs of corresponding terms.

6
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:26,406
So for every term in pattern "A", we want to multiply by 3 and add 1.

7
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:31,136
So if we multiply 0 by 3, we get 0, and you add 1, you get 1.

8
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:37,114
You multiply 1 by 3, you get 3... and you add 1, and you get 4.

9
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:42,139
2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

10
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:47,472
3 times 3 is 9, plus 1 is 10.

11
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:49,873
Remember, we're just multiplying by 3 and adding 1.

12
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:53,456
4 times 3 is 12, plus 1 is 13.

13
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:56,469
So those are the corresponding terms for pattern "B".

14
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,945
Then they ask us to graph them... so let's try to graph these points.

15
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:07,776
So when Pattern "A" is 0, pattern "B" is 1.

16
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:13,006
So this is pattern "A" equaling 0... that's our horizontal axis: the value for pattern "A".

17
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:18,868
Pattern "B" is the value of our vertical axis. Pattern "B" is 1.

18
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:24,805
When pattern "A" is 1, pattern "B" is 4. So... (1, 4).

19
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:29,334
So when pattern "A" is 1, pattern "B" is 4. Pattern "B" is on the vertical axis.

20
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:37,075
When pattern "A" is 2, pattern "B" is 7. (2, 7).

21
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:45,204
When pattern "A" is 3, pattern "B" is 10. So: (3, 10).

22
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:50,741
So 3 in the horizontal direction, that's our Pattern "A" value, and our pattern "B" value is 10.

23
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:59,532
And then finally, when pattern "A" is 4, pattern "B" is 13.

24
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:04,620
Also let's look at these patterns. We see that pattern "A" is increasing by 1 each time.

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:11,205
While pattern "B" is increasing by... Well... pattern "A" starts at 0, and increases by 1.

26
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:17,619
While pattern "B" starts at 1, and increases by 3. Which makes complete sense.

27
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:21,603
It makes sense that it starts at 1... because all of these you multiply by 3 and add 1.

28
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:30,368
So you started with 1, and the fact that you're multiplying by 3... that's what's leading to the distance between these points being 3.

29
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:34,368
So let's check our answer and make sure we got this right... and we did.
