1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:09,319
We have the equation -16= (x/4) + 2

2
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,968
and we need to solve for X.

3
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:15,818
So we really just need to isolate the X variable on one side of this equation;

4
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:21,993
and the best way to do that is first to isolate it -- isolate this whole X/4 term from all the other terms.

5
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:26,036
So in order to do that, let's get rid of this 2; and the best way to get rid of that 2 is to subtract it.

6
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:30,929
But if we want to subtract it from the right hand side, we also have to subtract it from the left hand side:

7
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,359
because, this is an equation.

8
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,954
If "this" is equal to "that," anything we do to "that," we also have to do to "this."

9
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,423
So let's subtract 2 from both sides.

10
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:46,954
So you subtract 2 from the right... subtract 2 from the left... and we get, on the left hand side:

11
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:57,159
-16 - 2 = -18, and then that is equal to x over 4 (X/4) -- x over 4

12
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:05,712
and then we have +2 -2, which is just going to be zero, so we don't even have to write that. I could write just a "+0", but I think that is just a little unnecessary.

13
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:10,078
And so we have -18 = X/4.

14
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:13,764
... and our whole goal here is to isolate the X... to solve for the "X"

15
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:19,539
and the best way we could do that is we have X/4 over here -- If we multiply that by 4, we're just going to have an "X".

16
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:23,035
So we can multiply that by 4,

17
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:28,422
But once again, this is an equation, Anything you do on the right hand side you have to do to the left hand side, and vice versa.

18
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:34,691
So if we multiply the right hand side by 4. we also have to multiply the left hand side by 4.

19
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:47,323
So we get 4 * (-18) = (X/4) * 4, the (X/4) * 4 ... that cancels out ... you divide something by 4 and multiply by 4, you're just going to be left with an "X".

20
00:01:47,323 --> 00:02:09,737
And on the other side... 4 X (-18) ... well let's see that's 40... well, let's just write it out. ... so 18 X 4 ... if we were to multiply 18 X 4 ... 4 X 8 = 32, 4 X 1 = 4, plus 1 is 72 -- but this is (-18) X 4, so it's (-72).

21
00:02:09,783 --> 00:02:12,957
So X = -72.

22
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:18,484
And if we want to check it, we could just substitue it back into that original equation, so let's do that, let's substitute...

23
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:22,756
Let's substitute this ... into the original equation

24
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:38,639
so the original equation was -16 = ... instead of writing X, I'm going to write -72 ... = (-72 /4) + 2 ... let's see if this is actually true...

25
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:50,481
So, this right hand side simplifies to -72/4 ... we already know, that that is (-18) so this is equal to ... (-18) + 2 ... this is what the equation becomes...

26
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:54,243
and then the right hand side, (-18)+2, that's (-16)

27
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:55,967
so it all comes out true.

28
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:03,529
This right hand side, when x= (-72) does indeed equals -16.
