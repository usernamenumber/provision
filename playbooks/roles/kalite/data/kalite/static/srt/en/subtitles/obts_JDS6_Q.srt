1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,100
I will now show you my preferred
way of finding an

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,770
inverse of a 3 by 3 matrix.

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,220
And I actually think it's
a lot more fun.

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,150
And you're less likely to
make careless mistakes.

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,020
But if I remember correctly from
Algebra 2, they didn't

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,760
teach it this way
in Algebra 2.

8
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,900
And that's why I taught the
other way initially.

9
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,170
But let's go through this.

10
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,140
And in a future video, I will
teach you why it works.

11
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,310
Because that's always
important.

12
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,780
But in linear algebra, this is
one of the few subjects where

13
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,670
I think it's very important
learn how to do the operations

14
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,790
first. And then later,
we'll learn the why.

15
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,430
Because the how is
very mechanical.

16
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,880
And it really just involves
some basic arithmetic

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,380
for the most part.

18
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,070
But the why tends to
be quite deep.

19
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,170
So I'll leave that
to later videos.

20
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,820
And you can often think about
the depth of things when you

21
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,550
have confidence that you at
least understand the hows.

22
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,730
So anyway, let's go back
to our original matrix.

23
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,090
And what was that original
matrix that I

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,280
did in the last video?

25
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:03,850
It was 1, 0, 1, 0,
2, 1, 1, 1, 1.

26
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,160
And we wanted to find the
inverse of this matrix.

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,910
So this is what we're
going to do.

28
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,710
It's called Gauss-Jordan
elimination, to find the

29
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,720
inverse of the matrix.

30
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,840
And the way you do it-- and it
might seem a little bit like

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,860
magic, it might seem a little
bit like voodoo, but I think

32
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,370
you'll see in future videos that
it makes a lot of sense.

33
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,770
What we do is we augment
this matrix.

34
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,560
What does augment mean?

35
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,440
It means we just add
something to it.

36
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,830
So I draw a dividing line.

37
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,486
Some people don't.

38
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:31,290
So if I put a dividing
line here.

39
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,080
And what do I put on the other
side of the dividing line?

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,640
I put the identity matrix
of the same size.

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,140
This is 3 by 3, so I put a
3 by 3 identity matrix.

42
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:51,600
So that's 1, 0, 0,
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1.

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,870
All right, so what are
we going to do?

44
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,670
What I'm going to do is perform
a series of elementary

45
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,620
row operations.

46
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,940
And I'm about to tell you what
are valid elementary row

47
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,610
operations on this matrix.

48
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,440
But whatever I do to any of
these rows here, I have to do

49
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,360
to the corresponding
rows here.

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,690
And my goal is essentially to
perform a bunch of operations

51
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,150
on the left hand side.

52
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,830
And of course, the same
operations will be applied to

53
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,690
the right hand side, so that I
eventually end up with the

54
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,320
identity matrix on the
left hand side.

55
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,310
And then when I have the
identity matrix on the left

56
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,400
hand side, what I have left on
the right hand side will be

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,690
the inverse of this
original matrix.

58
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,680
And when this becomes an
identity matrix, that's

59
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,950
actually called reduced
row echelon form.

60
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,320
And I'll talk more about that.

61
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,200
There's a lot of names and
labels in linear algebra.

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,480
But they're really just fairly
simple concepts.

63
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,790
But anyway, let's get started
and this should become a

64
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,180
little clear.

65
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,290
At least the process
will become clear.

66
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,460
Maybe not why it works.

67
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,610
So first of all, I said I'm
going to perform a bunch of

68
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,280
operations here.

69
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,950
What are legitimate
operations?

70
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,720
They're called elementary
row operations.

71
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,920
So there's a couple
things I can do.

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,970
I can replace any row
with that row

73
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,680
multiplied by some number.

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,960
So I could do that.

75
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,260
I can swap any two rows.

76
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,850
And of course if I swap say the
first and second row, I'd

77
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,450
have to do it here as well.

78
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,410
And I can add or subtract one
row from another row.

79
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,590
So when I do that-- so for
example, I could take this row

80
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,790
and replace it with this
row added to this row.

81
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,520
And you'll see what I
mean in the second.

82
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,500
And you know, if you combine it,
you could you could say,

83
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,880
well I'm going to multiple this
row times negative 1, and

84
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,580
add it to this row, and replace
this row with that.

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,690
So if you start to feel like
this is something like what

86
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,290
you learned when you learned
solving systems of linear

87
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,510
equations, that's
no coincidence.

88
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,990
Because matrices are actually
a very good way to represent

89
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,130
that, and I will show
you that soon.

90
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,430
But anyway, let's do some
elementary row operations to

91
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,100
get this left hand side into
reduced row echelon form.

92
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,780
Which is really just a fancy way
of saying, let's turn it

93
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,610
into the identity matrix.

94
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,660
So let's see what
we want to do.

95
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,290
We want to have 1's
all across here.

96
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,750
We want these to be 0's.

97
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,870
Let's see how we can do
this efficiently.

98
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,560
Let me draw the matrix again.

99
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,350
So let's get a 0 here.

100
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,445
That would be convenient.

101
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:19,769
So I'm going to keep the
top two rows the same.

102
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,209
1, 0, 1.

103
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,000
I have my dividing line.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,370
1, 0, 0.

105
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,450
I didn't do anything there.

106
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm not doing anything
to the second row.

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,875
0, 2, 1.

108
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:33,460
   

109
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,700
0, 1, 0.

110
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,120
And what I'm going to do, I'm
going to replace this row--

111
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,260
And just so you know my
motivation, my goal

112
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,490
is to get a 0 here.

113
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,540
So I'm a little bit closer
to having the

114
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,200
identity matrix here.

115
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,080
So how do I get a 0 here?

116
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,750
What I could do is I can replace
this row with this row

117
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,280
minus this row.

118
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
So I can replace the third
row with the third row

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,630
minus the first row.

120
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,040
So what's the third row
minus the first row?

121
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,340
1 minus 1 is 0.

122
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,670
1 minus 0 is 1.

123
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,860
1 minus 1 is 0.

124
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,150
Well I did it on the left hand
side, so I have to do it on

125
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,900
the right hand side.

126
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,300
I have to replace this
with this minus this.

127
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,010
So 0 minus 1 is minus 1.

128
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,610
0 minus 0 is 0.

129
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,810
And 1 minus 0 is 1.

130
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,270
Fair enough.

131
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,800
Now what can I do?

132
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,830
Well this row right here, this
third row, it has 0 and 0-- it

133
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,530
looks a lot like what I want
for my second row in the

134
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,720
identity matrix.

135
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,470
So why don't I just swap
these two rows?

136
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,360
Why don't I just swap the
first and second rows?

137
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,740
So let's do that.

138
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,590
I'm going to swap the first
and second rows.

139
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,950
So the first row
stays the same.

140
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,790
1, 0, 1.

141
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,760
And then the other side stays
the same as well.

142
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,830
And I'm swapping the second
and third rows.

143
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,020
So now my second row
is now 0, 1, 0.

144
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,990
And I have to swap it on
the right hand side.

145
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,520
So it's minus 1, 0, 1.

146
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,540
I'm just swapping these two.

147
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,450
So then my third row now
becomes what the

148
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,450
second row was here.

149
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,920
0, 2, 1.

150
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,990
And 0, 1, 0.

151
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,160
Fair enough.

152
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,770
Now what do I want to do?

153
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,910
Well it would be nice if
I had a 0 right here.

154
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,070
That would get me that much
closer to the identity matrix.

155
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,260
So how could I get as 0 here?

156
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,390
Well what if I subtracted 2
times row two from row one?

157
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,360
Because this would be,
1 times 2 is 2.

158
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,920
And if I subtracted that from
this, I'll get a 0 here.

159
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,140
So let's do that.

160
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,250
So the first row has
been very lucky.

161
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,260
It hasn't had to do anything.

162
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,580
It's just sitting there.

163
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,670
1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0.

164
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,120
And the second row's not
changing for now.

165
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,430
Minus 1, 0, 1.

166
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,110
Now what did I say I
was going to do?

167
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:13,240
I'm going to subtract 2 times
row two from row three.

168
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,960
So this is 0 minus
2 times 0 is 0.

169
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,990
2 minus 2 times 1,
well that's 0.

170
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,150
1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

171
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:38,210
0 minus 2 times negative 1 is--
so let's remember 0 minus

172
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,880
2 times negative 1.

173
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,520
So that's 0 minus negative
2, so that's positive 2.

174
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,970
1 minus 2 times 0.

175
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,810
Well that's just still 1.

176
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,240
0 minus 2 times 1.

177
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,490
So that's minus 2.

178
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,190
   

179
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,130
Have I done that right?

180
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,810
I just want to make sure.

181
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:04,800
0 minus 2 times-- right, 2
times minus 1 is minus 2.

182
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,910
And I'm subtracting
it, so it's plus.

183
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,150
OK, so I'm close.

184
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,140
This almost looks like the
identity matrix or reduced row

185
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,680
echelon form.

186
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,950
Except for this 1 right here.

187
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,740
So I'm finally going to have
to touch the top row.

188
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,450
And what can I do?

189
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:23,170
well how about I replace the top
row with the top row minus

190
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,060
the bottom row?

191
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,480
Because if I subtract
this from that,

192
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,550
this'll get a 0 there.

193
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,790
So let's do that.

194
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,720
So I'm replacing the top
row with the top row

195
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,790
minus the third row.

196
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,570
So 1 minus 0 is 1.

197
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,659
0 minus 0 is 0.

198
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,000
1 minus 1 is 0.

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,559
That was our whole goal.

200
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,000
And then 1 minus 2
is negative 1.

201
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,490
0 minus 1 is negative 1.

202
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,950
0 minus negative 2., well
that's positive 2.

203
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,460
And then the other rows
stay the same.

204
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,590
0, 1, 0, minus 1, 0, 1.

205
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:15,550
And then 0, 0, 1, 2,
1, negative 2.

206
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,640
And there you have it.

207
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,650
We have performed a series
of operations on

208
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,720
the left hand side.

209
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,380
And we've performed the
same operations on

210
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,960
the right hand side.

211
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,670
This became the identity
matrix, or

212
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,410
reduced row echelon form.

213
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,530
And we did this using
Gauss-Jordan elimination.

214
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,180
And what is this?

215
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,570
Well this is the inverse of
this original matrix.

216
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,960
This times this will equal
the identity matrix.

217
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:46,750
So if this is a, than
this is a inverse.

218
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,580
And that's all you have to do.

219
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,700
And as you could see, this took
me half the amount of

220
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,260
time, and required a lot less
hairy mathematics than when I

221
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,310
did it using the adjoint and
the cofactors and the

222
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,110
determinant.

223
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,990
And if you think about it, I'll
give you a little hint of

224
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,420
why this worked.

225
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,910
Every one of these operations
I did on the left hand side,

226
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,570
you could kind of view them as
multiplying-- you know, to get

227
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,370
from here to here,
I multiplied.

228
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,500
You can kind of say that
there's a matrix.

229
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,240
That if I multiplied by that
matrix, it would have

230
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,670
performed this operation.

231
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,250
And then I would have had to
multiply by another matrix to

232
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,550
do this operation.

233
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,250
So essentially what we did is
we multiplied by a series of

234
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,440
matrices to get here.

235
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,500
And if you multiplied all
of those, what we call

236
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,410
elimination matrices, together,
you essentially

237
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,070
multiply this times
the inverse.

238
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,590
So what am I saying?

239
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:43,470
So if we have a, to go from
here to here, we have to

240
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,300
multiply a times the
elimination matrix.

241
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,630
And this might be completely
confusing for you, so ignore

242
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,990
it if it is, but it might
be insightful.

243
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,250
So what did we eliminate
in this?

244
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,470
We eliminated 3, 1.

245
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,120
We multiplied by the
elimination matrix

246
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,670
3, 1, to get here.

247
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,740
And then, to go from
here to here, we've

248
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,220
multiplied by some matrix.

249
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,970
And I'll tell you more.

250
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,160
I'll show you how
we can construct

251
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,940
these elimination matrices.

252
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,830
We multiply by an elimination
matrix.

253
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,150
Well actually, we had
a row swap here.

254
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,070
I don't know what you
want to call that.

255
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,240
You could call that
the swap matrix.

256
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,730
We swapped row two for three.

257
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,830
And then here, we multiplied
by elimination

258
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,110
matrix-- what did we do?

259
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,030
We eliminated this, so
this was row three,

260
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,270
column two, 3, 2.

261
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,320
And then finally, to get here,
we had to multiply by

262
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,470
elimination matrix.

263
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,740
We had to eliminate
this right here.

264
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,220
So we eliminated row
one, column three.

265
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,200
   

266
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,590
And I want you to know right
now that it's not important

267
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,420
what these matrices are.

268
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,210
I'll show you how we can
construct these matrices.

269
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,530
But I just want you to have kind
of a leap of faith that

270
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,600
each of these operations could
have been done by multiplying

271
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,040
by some matrix.

272
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,510
But what we do know is by
multiplying by all of these

273
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,760
matrices, we essentially got
the identity matrix.

274
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,930
Back here.

275
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,450
So the combination of all of
these matrices, when you

276
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,600
multiply them by each
other, this must

277
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,370
be the inverse matrix.

278
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,420
If I were to multiply each of
these elimination and row swap

279
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,420
matrices, this must be the
inverse matrix of a.

280
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,680
Because if you multiply
all them times

281
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,130
a, you get the inverse.

282
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,630
Well what happened?

283
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,780
If these matrices are
collectively the inverse

284
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,400
matrix, if I do them, if I
multiply the identity matrix

285
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,620
times them-- the elimination
matrix, this one times that

286
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,270
equals that.

287
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,970
This one times that
equals that.

288
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,510
This one times that
equals that.

289
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,360
And so forth.

290
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,870
I'm essentially multiplying--
when you combine all of

291
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,050
these-- a inverse times
the identity matrix.

292
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,520
So if you think about it just
very big picture-- and I don't

293
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,470
want to confuse you.

294
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,910
It's good enough at this
point if you just

295
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,370
understood what I did.

296
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,500
But what I'm doing from all of
these steps, I'm essentially

297
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,800
multiplying both sides of this
augmented matrix, you could

298
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,450
call it, by a inverse.

299
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,080
So I multiplied this by a
inverse, to get to the

300
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,300
identity matrix.

301
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,740
But of course, if I multiplied
the inverse matrix times the

302
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,130
identity matrix, I'll get
the inverse matrix.

303
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,990
But anyway, I don't want
to confuse you.

304
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,410
Hopefully that'll give you
a little intuition.

305
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,130
I'll do this later with some
more concrete examples.

306
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,850
But hopefully you see that this
is a lot less hairy than

307
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,115
the way we did it with the
adjoint and the cofactors and

308
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:32,540
the minor matrices and the
determinants, et cetera.

309
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,290
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
