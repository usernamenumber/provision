1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,740
[music playing]

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,600
[Speaker 1] Let's talk about Campin's Merode Altarpiece

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,596
Which is in the Cloisters in New York

4
00:00:09,596 --> 00:00:11,801
[Speaker 2] And, in fact, we're not really sure it's by Campin. We're guessing but usually

5
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:16,768
there's a little question mark after his name and, so artists do this funny thing where

6
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:18,528
they'll make up a name if they're not sure.

7
00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:22,464
So, we definitely know it's this person we've invented called the Master of Flomal.

8
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:24,663
[Speaker 1] We have a triptych. Three panels on the left.

9
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:28,240
The donors on, in the center panel, a scene of the annunciation

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,241
on the right, Joseph

11
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,938
[Speaker 2] It's such a great example of the North.

12
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:33,462
It's relatively small.

13
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:35,044
This is a portable object.

14
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:38,218
[Speaker 1] It's small because it was made for someone's private home.

15
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:41,762
[Speaker 2] As opposed to the sort of the public art that we're used

16
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:42,675
to seeing in Italy.

17
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:46,162
[Speaker 1] Right, giant altarpices. So, it's a good inidication

18
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:50,933
of a change in who's buying art to a sort of new upper-middle class,

19
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:54,801
who is very affluent who want to buy art for their private altar pieces

20
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:55,802
in their homes.

21
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:57,260
[Speaker 2] And that's beautifully reflected in

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,239
this very odd decision of the artist

23
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,662
to represent the annunciation in the middle, in

24
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:05,171
what was then a modern interior environment.

25
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:06,930
In other words, this is the kind of house that you would

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,429
see an altar piece like this in.

27
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:11,217
[Speaker 1] Right, so it's sort of the equivalent of doing the

28
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:13,129
annunciation in Brooklyn.

29
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:14,272
[Speaker 2] She could be reading it,

30
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:15,766
[Speaker 1] Maybe, she could be reading it on her

31
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:16,547
ipod.

32
00:01:16,547 --> 00:01:18,377
[Speaker 2] That's right or she's looking at wikipedia. [laugh]

33
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:19,606
[Speaker 1] [laugh]Could be. Maybe she's

34
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:20,432
sitting in front of her laptop.

35
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:21,432
[Speaker 2] So this would have looked that odd to people in

36
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:23,549
the 15th century. In other words,

37
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,266
that this was sort of that out of time.

38
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:28,000
[Speaker 1] But it was something that was that appealing

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,697
to them that out of time. It made them feel

40
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:31,222
that these figures were

41
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:34,543
closer to them and that they could relate more

42
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:38,499
emotionally to what this must have been like

43
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,438
for Mary as a woman to have been told this.

44
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:43,552
To sort of get inside those feelings

45
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:45,965
which was an important, I think, way

46
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:48,510
in the early 15th century that people

47
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,799
were connecting to God.

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,603
[Speaker 2] It's interesting, because that you say feelings,

49
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:53,218
because other important aspects

50
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:54,938
are so different in Northern painting,

51
00:01:54,938 --> 00:01:55,887
and I think are beautifully

52
00:01:55,887 --> 00:01:57,390
examined here, which is that

53
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,884
there's such attention to the material.

54
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:01,716
Such attention to the materialilty,

55
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:03,718
to material culture. You know, everything

56
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,666
is so specific. The brass of the, of the candle

57
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,294
or the wood of the table and the way

58
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:11,098
it was constructed and the carving and the

59
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,384
claw, and the beams of the ceiling.

60
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,166
[Speaker 1] Or Joseph's work table with the grain

61
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,220
in the wood.

62
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,699
[Speaker 2] Oh, and all of the tools.

63
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:19,630
I mean, and that's actually sort of a

64
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,000
wonderful aspect. I've always imagined

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,432
that one of the reasons that

66
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:23,872
there was such attention to those

67
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,935
tools is because Campin himself was the person,

68
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:29,050
was a craftsman. Was somebody who would've

69
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,794
made this object, and so Joseph is

70
00:02:31,794 --> 00:02:34,678
[cut off by first speaker] And probably got the wood ready and prepared

71
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:37,243
his paints and made his brushes and things like that.

72
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:39,510
[Speaker 2] And so, this is kind of love of that,

73
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,887
that material culture.

74
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:42,802
[Speaker 1] But of course those things are also symbols.

75
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:43,766
[Speaker 2] All symbols.

76
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:44,712
[Speaker 1] Yes.

77
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:48,094
[Speaker 2] And, in fact, there are a tremendous amount of symbols in here.

78
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:49,969
[Speaker 1] Yeah, more than we can recount, I think.

79
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,052
[Speaker 2] Yeah. Although there are a couple of little details

80
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:53,803
that we probably should sort of point out.

81
00:02:53,803 --> 00:02:58,468
One of my favorites is the little teeny image of Christ

82
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:01,934
surfing down on the little golden rings.

83
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:02,938
[Speaker 1] Yeah.

84
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:05,968
[Speaker 2] Or the cross on, on his back, heading back

85
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:06,996
to Mary, by the way.

86
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:09,099
[Speaker 1] Right, right, right to her womb, actually.

87
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,172
[Speaker 2] And then there's that fabulous almost starburst

88
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:12,740
as her knee projects forward.

89
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,740
[Speaker 1] Um huh.

90
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,432
[Speaker 2] And look how beautifully rendered all of that

91
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:18,510
light and shadow is. And it's sort of so odd

92
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,795
because the artist is so technically proficient

93
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:24,218
in rendering textures and forms.

94
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:25,963
[Speaker 1] And, of course, it's because they have oil paint.

95
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:28,216
[Speaker 2] Ah, and it's so luminous as a result.

96
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:32,381
[Speaker 1] Right, and so we can get the reflections on the

97
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,671
reflective surfaces like the brass candlestick

98
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:37,211
or the brass pot in the background, or the

99
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,104
[interrupted by speaker 2] the porcelain

100
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:40,766
[interrupted by speaker 1] porcelain of the vase or the heavy

101
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:43,303
wool fabric, I imagine of, of Mary's dress.

102
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:45,432
[Speaker 2] But then, at the same time, there's

103
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:46,708
some real structural problems

104
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,137
because in Italy by this time,

105
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:49,889
Brunelleschi is doing his thing, and

106
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,469
linear perspective is being understood

107
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:52,196
[interrupted by speaker 1] Yeah

108
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:53,598
[Speaker 2] And this, this floor

109
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:54,765
[interrupted by speaker 1] Now Masaccio would've

110
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,218
cut his hands off if he had painted this.

111
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:57,432
[laughter]

112
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:59,001
He would have been very unhappy with himself.

113
00:03:59,001 --> 00:03:59,799
[interrupted by speaker 2] That's right

114
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,165
[Speaker 1] He would have thought he made a big mistake.

115
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:03,008
[Speaker 2] Well, that's absolutely, look at the tabletop

116
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:04,545
and look at how it disagrees with the floor,

117
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,797
which is still too steep, and there are

118
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:07,996
just too many multiple, sort of, perspectives here.

119
00:04:07,996 --> 00:04:10,869
[Speaker 1] Right, and the room looks narrower

120
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:12,608
in the back than it does in the front, and

121
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:13,887
the floor looks like it tilts upward,

122
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,272
we're looking at the top of the table and the

123
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:17,164
side of things at the same time.

124
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:18,938
The, the space is all wrong. In fact, the

125
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:21,272
figures are too, too large for the room,

126
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:24,467
and the, the room is not, it's packed with objects

127
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,804
there's no room for anyone to walk around in.

128
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:29,239
So, it's not, it's not a real space.

129
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:32,138
[Speaker 2] And, and it's fabulous, in information

130
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,217
that it conveys. I have to tell you,

131
00:04:34,217 --> 00:04:36,876
I'm especially in love with the most

132
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,739
distant views. If you look in the donor panel

133
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,721
all the way on the left, and you look through

134
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,303
the open door, you can actually see the streetscape

135
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:44,262
[interrupted by speaker 1] Yep, Yep

136
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:46,339
[Speaker 2] And, you can see a horse and you can

137
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:47,099
see actually a shop

138
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:47,883
[interrupted by speaker 1] and people by a window

139
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:48,720
[Speaker 2] That's right

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,302
people in the window. And on the opposite

141
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:51,605
side, in back of Joseph,

142
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:52,665
and back of

143
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:54,163
[interrupted by speaker 1] a whole Flemish city back there.

144
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:55,162
[Speaker 2] Oh, it's incredible.

145
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,052
[Speaker 1] Yep

146
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:58,389
[Speaker 2] And, so it's all this, this important

147
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,241
religious symbolism placed within

148
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:02,405
this modern mercantile environment.

149
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:05,329
[Speaker 1] You know with all this sort of

150
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:06,366
mundane things of everyday life,

151
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:07,884
I mean my favorite part are the shutters

152
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:09,597
above Joseph on the ceilings, little hooks

153
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:11,372
that hold the shutters to get up

154
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:13,479
and then you can imagine them coming down,

155
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,430
and you can see how the bolts in the wood there

156
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,071
and how rust is stripped down and

157
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:21,651
this attention to things that are seemingly mundane

158
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:24,317
and unimportant next to this, very, very,

159
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:25,838
uh sacred moment.
