1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,900
We've already made a few
definitions of operations that

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,080
we can do with vectors.

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,620
We've defined addition in
the context of vectors

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,460
and you've seen that.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,440
If you just have two vectors,
say a1, a2, all the

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,330
way down to a n.

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,600
We defined the addition of this
vector and let's say some

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,180
other vector, b1, b2,
all the way down to

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,300
bn as a third vector.

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,390
If you add these two, we defined
the addition operation

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,360
to be a third-- you will result
in a third vector where

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,230
each of its components are
just the sum of the

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,020
corresponding components of the
two vectors you're adding.

15
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,780
So it's going to be a1 plus b1,
a2 plus b2, all the way

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,900
down to a n plus bn.

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,170
We knew this and we've done
multiple videos where we use

18
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,900
this definition of
vector addition.

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,710
We also know about scalar
multiplication.

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,455
   

21
00:00:57,455 --> 00:01:00,107
Maybe we should just call it
scaling multiplication.

22
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:04,129
   

23
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,070
And that's the case of look, if
I have some real number c

24
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,170
and I multiply it times some
vector, a1, a2, all the way

25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,600
down to a n, we defined scalar
multiplication of a vector to

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,820
be-- some scalar times its
vector will result in

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,020
essentially, this vector were
each of its components are

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,260
multiplied by the scalar.

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,990
ca1, ca2, all the way
down to c a n.

30
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,540
And so after seeing these two
operations, you might be

31
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,950
tempted to say, gee, wouldn't
it be nice if there was some

32
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,440
way to multiply two vectors.

33
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,280
This is just a scalar times a
vector, just scaling it up.

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,990
And that's actually the actual
effect of what it's doing if

35
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,100
you visualize it in three
dimensions or less.

36
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,260
It's actually scaling the
size of the vector.

37
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,820
And we haven't defined size,
very precisely just yet.

38
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,810
But you understand at least
this operation.

39
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,440
For multiplying vectors or
taking the product, there's

40
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,450
actually two ways.

41
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,620
And I'm going to define one
of them in this video.

42
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,000
And that's the dot product.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,570
   

44
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:13,750
And you signify the dot product
by saying a dot v.

45
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,150
So they borrowed one of the
types of multiplication

46
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,680
notations that you saw, but you
can't write across here.

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,390
That'll be actually a different
type of vector

48
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,650
multiplication.

49
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,810
So the dot product is-- it's
almost fun to take because

50
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,475
it's mathematically pretty
straightforward, unlike the

51
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:29,540
cross product.

52
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,040
But it's fun to take and it's
interesting because it

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,860
results-- so this is a1, a2,
all the way down to a n.

54
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:47,550
That vector dot my b vector: b1,
b2, all the way down to bn

55
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,330
is going to be equal to the
product of each of their

56
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,020
corresponding components.

57
00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:03,780
So a1 b1 added together plus a2
b2 plus a3 b3 plus all the

58
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,750
way to a n, bn.

59
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,370
So what is this?

60
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,640
Is this a vector?

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,740
Well no, this is
just a number.

62
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,950
This is just going to
be a real number.

63
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,580
You're just taking the product
and adding together a bunch of

64
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,160
real numbers.

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,720
So this is just going to be
a scalar, a real scalar.

66
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,440
So this is just going to be
a scalar right there.

67
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,300
So in the dot product you
multiply two vectors and you

68
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,890
end up with a scalar value.

69
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,090
Let me show you a couple of
examples just in case this was

70
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,040
a little bit too abstract.

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,590
So let's say that we take the
dot product of the vector 2, 5

72
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,740
and we're going to dot that
with the vector 7, 1.

73
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,490
Well, this is just going to be
equal to 2 times 7 plus 5

74
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,640
times 1 or 14 plus 6.

75
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,820
No, sorry.

76
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,980
14 plus 5, which
is equal to 19.

77
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,980
So the dot product of this
vector and this vector is 19.

78
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,790
Let me do one more example,
although I think this is a

79
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,200
pretty straightforward idea.

80
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,920
Let me do it in mauve.

81
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,540
OK.

82
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,500
Say I had the vector 1, 2, 3 and
I'm going to dot that with

83
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,000
the vector minus 2, 0, 5.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:23,120
So it's 1 times minus 2 plus
2 times 0 plus 3 times 5.

85
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,620
So it's minus 2 plus
0 plus 15.

86
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,020
Minus 2 plus 15 is
equal to 13.

87
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,620
That's the dot product
by this definition.

88
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,795
Now, I'm going to make
another definition.

89
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:39,100
I'm going to define the
length of a vector.

90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:46,710
   

91
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,050
And you might say, Sal,
I know what the length

92
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,730
of something is.

93
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,520
I've been measuring things
since I was a kid.

94
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,860
Why do I have to wait until a
college level or hopefully

95
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,300
you're taking this before
college maybe.

96
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,830
But what is now considered a
college level course to have

97
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,280
length defined for me.

98
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,110
And the answer is because we're
abstracting things to

99
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,270
well beyond just R3 or just
three-dimensional space is

100
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,990
what you're used to.

101
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,540
We're abstracting that these
vectors could have 50

102
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,110
components.

103
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,740
And our definition of length
will satisfy, will work, even

104
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,720
for these 50 component
vectors.

105
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,240
And so my definition of length--
but it's also going

106
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,990
to be consistent with what
we know length to be.

107
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,240
So if I take the length of a
and the notation we use is

108
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,610
just these double lines
around the vector.

109
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,770
The length of my vector a is
equal to-- and this is a

110
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,290
definition.

111
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:46,150
It equals the square root of
each of the terms, each of my

112
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,820
components, squared.

113
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,020
Add it up.

114
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,740
Plus a2 squared plus all the
way to plus a n squared.

115
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,140
And this is pretty
straightforward.

116
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:03,240
If I wanted to take let's
call this was vector b.

117
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,310
If I want to take the magnitude
of vector b right

118
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,680
here, this would be what?

119
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,350
This would be the square root
of 2 squared plus 5 squared,

120
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,200
which is equal to the square
root of-- what is this?

121
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,460
This is 4 plus 25.

122
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,820
The square root of 29.

123
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,180
So that's the length
of this vector.

124
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,210
And you might say look,
I already knew that.

125
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,010
That's from the Pythagorean
theroem.

126
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,050
If I were to draw my vector
b-- let me draw it.

127
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,800
Those are my axes.

128
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,510
My vector b if I draw
it in standard

129
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,510
form, looks like this.

130
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,570
I go to the right 2.

131
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,580
1, 2.

132
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,600
And I go up 5.

133
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,650
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

134
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,660
So it looks like this.

135
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,030
My vector b looks like that.

136
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,090
And from the Pythagorean theorem
you know look, if I

137
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,650
wanted to figure out the length
of this vector in R2,

138
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,390
or if I'm drawing it in kind
of two-dimensional space, I

139
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,330
take this side which is length
2, I take that side which is

140
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,380
length 5; this is going to be
the square root from the

141
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,650
Pythagorean theorem of 2
squared plus 5 squared.

142
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,340
Which is exactly what
we did here.

143
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,690
So this definition of length is
completely consistent with

144
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,310
your idea of measuring things
in one-, two- or

145
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,900
three-dimensional space.

146
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,580
But what's neat about it is that
now we can start thinking

147
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,950
about the length of a vector
that maybe has 50 components.

148
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,630
Which you know, really to
visualize it in our

149
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,580
traditional way,
makes no sense.

150
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,920
But we can still apply this
notion of length and start to

151
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,010
maybe abstract beyond what
we traditionally

152
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,500
associate length with.

153
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,230
Now, can we somehow relate
length with the dot product?

154
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,350
Well what happens if I
dot a with itself?

155
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,550
What is a dot a?

156
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,990
So that's equal to-- I'll
just write it out again.

157
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:57,250
a1, all the way down to a n
dotted with a1 all the way

158
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,590
down to a n.

159
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,290
Well that's equal to a1 times
a1, which is a1 squared.

160
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,960
Plus a2 times a2.

161
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,970
a2 squared.

162
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,760
Plus all the way down, keep
doing that all the way down to

163
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,990
a n times a n, which
is a n squared.

164
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,810
But what's this?

165
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,090
This is the same thing
as the thing you

166
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,220
see under the radical.

167
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,080
These two things
are equivalent.

168
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,540
So we could write our definition
of length, of

169
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,010
vector length, we can write it
in terms of the dot product,

170
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,650
of our dot product definition.

171
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,929
It equals the square root of the
vector dotted with itself.

172
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,820
Or, if we square both sides,
we could say that our new

173
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:45,240
length definition squared is
equal to the dot product of a

174
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,310
vector with itself.

175
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,280
And this is a pretty neat--
it's almost trivial to

176
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,300
actually prove it, but this is
a pretty neat outcome and

177
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,850
we're going to use this
in future videos.

178
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,720
So this is an introduction
to what the dot product

179
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,360
is, what length is.

180
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,670
In the next video I'm going
to show a bunch of

181
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,500
properties of it.

182
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,230
It will almost be mundane, but
I want to get all those

183
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,680
properties out of the
way, so we can use

184
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,040
them in future proofs.

185
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,726
