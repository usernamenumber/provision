00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,040
Welcome to the presentation on
systems of linear equations.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,970
So let's get started and
see what it's all about.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,110
So let's say I had
two equations now.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,740
The first equation let
me write it as 9x minus

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,760
4y equals minus 78.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,950
And the second equation
I will write as 4x plus

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,390
y is equal to mine 18.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,411
Now what we're going to do now
is we're actually going to

9
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:39,700
use both equations to
solve for x and y.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,900
We already know that if you
have one equation, it has one

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,280
variable, it is very easy to
solve for that one variable.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,790
But now we have to equations.

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,340
You can almost view them
as two constraints.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,340
And we're going to solve
for both variables.

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,790
And you might be a
little confused.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,520
How does that work?

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,910
Is it just magic that two
equations can solves

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,900
for two variables?

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,800
Well it's not.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,850
Because you can actually
rearranged each of these

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,840
equations so that they
look kind of in normal y

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,700
equals mx plus b format.

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,200
And I'm not going to draw these
actual two equations because I

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,860
don't know what they look like,
but if this was a coordinate

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,620
axis-- and I don't know what
that first line actually does

26
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,010
look like, we could do another
model where we figured it out

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,500
--but lets just say for sake of
argument, that first line all

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,540
the x's and y's that satisfy 9x
minus 4y equals negative

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,690
78, let's say it looks
something like that.

30
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,400
And let's say all of the x's
and y's that satisfy that

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,340
second equation, 4x plus y
equals negative 18, let's say

32
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,680
that looks something like this.

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,620
Right?

34
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,050
So, on the line is all of the
x's and y's that satisfy this

35
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,555
equation, and on the green
line are all the x's and y's

36
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:44,275
that satisfy this equation.

37
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:48,170
But there's only one pair of
x and y's that satisfy both

38
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,430
equations, and you can guess
where that is, that's

39
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,560
right here right.

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,660
Whatever that point is-- I'll
do it in pink for emphasis.

41
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,800
Whatever this point is,
notice it's on both lines.

42
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,260
So whatever x and y that is
would be the solution to

43
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,670
this system of equations.

44
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,860
So let's actually figure
out how to do that.

45
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,080
So what we want to do is
eliminate a variable, because

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
if you can eliminate a variable
then we can just solve for

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,430
the one that's left over.

48
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,930
And the way to do that-- let's
see, I want to eliminate, I

49
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,210
feel like eliminating this y,
and I think you'll get

50
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,630
an intuition for how we
can do that later on.

51
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,620
And the way I'm going to do
that is I'm going to make

52
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,250
it so that when I had this
to this, they cancel out.

53
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,340
Well, they don't cancel out
right now, so I have to

54
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,380
multiply this bottom equation
by 4, and I think it'll be

55
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,520
obvious why I'm doing it.

56
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,810
So let's multiply this
bottom equation by 4.

57
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:50,820
And I get 16x plus 4y is equal
to 40 plus 32 minus 72.

58
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,130
Right?

59
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,950
All I did is I multiplied
both sides of the

60
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,620
equation by 4, right?

61
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,210
And you have to multiply
every term because

62
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,500
it's the distributive
property on both sides.

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,050
Whatever you do to one side
you have to do to the other.

64
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,300
Let me rewrite top
equation again.

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,230
And I'll write in the same
color so we can keep

66
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,340
track of things.

67
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:13,360
9x minus 4y is
equal to minus 78.

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,580
OK, well now, if we were to add
these two equations, when you

69
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,430
add equations, you just add
the left side and you

70
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,270
add the right side.

71
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,440
Well when you add, you
have 16x plus 9x.

72
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,590
Well that equals 25x.

73
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:28,950
Right?

74
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,450
16 plus 9.

75
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,910
4y minus 4, that just equals 0.

76
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:43,680
So that's plus 0 equals, and
then we have minus 72 minus 78.

77
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:51,490
So, let's see that's minus
150, minus 150, right?

78
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,060
Just adding them all together.

79
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,820
So we have 25x equals 150.

80
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,420
Well, we could just divide both
sides by 25 or multiply both

81
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,380
sides by 1/25, it's
the same thing.

82
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,470
And you get x equals--
that's a negative 150

83
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,500
--x equals minus 6.

84
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,870
There we solved
the x-coordinate.

85
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,950
Now to solve the y-coordinate
we can just use either one of

86
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,500
these equations up at top.

87
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,810
So let's use this one,
it seems a little bit,

88
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,020
marginally simpler.

89
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,090
So we just substitute the x
back in there and we get

90
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:34,716
4 time minus 6 plus y
is equal to minus 18.

91
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:35,730
Go up here.

92
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:42,565
4 times minus 6 we get minus 24
plus y is equal to minus 18.

93
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:47,406
And then get y is
equal to 24 minus 18.

94
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:50,510
So y is equal to 6.

95
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,100
So these two lines or these two
equations, you could even say,

96
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,300
intersect at the point x is
m inus six and y is plus 6.

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,520
So they actually intersect
someplace around here instead.

98
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,640
I drew these, the line probably
look something more like that.

99
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,950
But that's pretty cool, no?

100
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,830
We actually solved for two
variables using two equations.

101
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,640
Let's see how much time I have.

102
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,470
I think we have enough time
to do another problem.

103
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:20,200
105
00:05:20,2 --> 00:05:23,02
So let's say I had the points--
and I'm going to write them in

104
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:32,940
two different colors again
--minus 7x minus 4y equals 9,

105
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,150
and then the second equation is
going to be x plus

106
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,460
2y is equal to 3.

107
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,140
Now if I were doing this as
fast as possible, I'd probably

108
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,990
multiply this equation times 7
and it would automatically

109
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,020
cancel out.

110
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,850
But that's easy way.

111
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,290
I'm going to show you that
sometimes you might have to

112
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,780
multiply both equations--
actually, not in this case.

113
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,800
Actually let's just do it
the fast way real fast.

114
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,380
So let's multiply this
bottom equation by 7.

115
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,830
And the whole reason why I want
to the, multiply it with 7,

116
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,440
because I want this to
cancel out with this.

117
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,150
If you multiply it by 7 you get
7x plus 14y is equal to 21.

118
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,930
Let's write that first
equation down again.

119
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:19,065
Minus 7x minus 4y
is equal to 9.

120
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:20,330
Now we just add.

121
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,260
This is a positive 7x, it just
always looks like a negative.

122
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,900
OK, so that's 0.

123
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:32,460
14 minus 4y plus 10y
is equal to 30.

124
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,750
y is equal to 3.

125
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,350
Now we just substitute back
into either equation,

126
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,980
lets do that one.

127
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,110
x plus 2 times y, 2 times 3.

128
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,880
x plus 6 equals 3.

129
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,900
We get x equals negative 3.

130
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,470
That one was super easy.

131
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,550
The intercept.

132
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,210
Hope I didn't do it to fast.

133
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,430
Well, you can pause it and
watch it again if you have.

134
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,270
OK, so these two lines
intersect at the point

135
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,182
negative 3 comma 3.

136
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:04,250
Let's do one more.

137
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,456
140
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:10,71
Hope this one's harder.

138
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,510
I think it will.

139
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:20,300
OK, negative 3x minus
9y is equal to 66.

140
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:27,200
We have minus 7x plus 4y
is equal to minus 71.

141
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,370
So here it's not obvious.

142
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,540
What we have to do is, let's
say we want to cancel

143
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,980
out the y's first.

144
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,500
What we do is we try to make
both of them equal to the least

145
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,660
common multiple of 9 and 4.

146
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,340
So, if we multiply the top
equation by 4 we get--

147
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,520
I'll do it right here.

148
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,870
Let's multiply it by 4.

149
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,960
Times 4.

150
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:59,200
We'll get minus 12x minus
36y is equal to 4 times

151
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,400
240 plus 24 is 264.

152
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,930
Right, I hope that's right.

153
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,220
We multiply the second
equation by 9.

154
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:25,420
So it's minus 63x plus 36y is
equal to, let's see, 639.

155
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,030
Big numbers.

156
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,350
639.

157
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,540
OK, now we add the
two equations.

158
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:43,570
Minus 12 minus 63 thats minus
75x-- these cancel out --equals

159
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:50,130
264, let's see what's
639 minus 264.

160
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,160
See I do this in real time.

161
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,100
I don't use some kind of
solution manual or something.

162
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,710
13 and 5, 70.

163
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,260
I don't know if I'm
right, but we'll see.

164
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,360
Since it's actually the
negative 639, this is minus

165
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,440
375, and I know that seventy
five goes into 300 4

166
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,450
times, so x is equal to 5.

167
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,515
75 times 5 is 375.

168
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:22,460
We just divided
both sides by 75.

169
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,367
So if x is 5 we just substitute
it back into-- let's

170
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,890
use this equation.

171
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:36,380
So we get minus 3 times 5
minus 9y is equal to 66.

172
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,920
We get minus 15
minus 9y equals 66.

173
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,880
Minus 9y is equal to 81.

174
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,840
And then we get y is
equal to minus 9.

175
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,530
So the answer is
5 comma minus 9.

176
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,530
I think you're ready to do some
systems of equations now.

177
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,090
Have Fun.
