1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,170
Welcome to this first video, and
actually the first video

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,800
in the playlist on differential
equations.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,810
I know I touched on this before
when we did harmonic

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,170
motion, and I think I
might have touched

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,450
on it in other subjects.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,400
But now, because of your
request, we'll do a whole

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,180
playlist on this.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,490
And that's a fairly useful
thing, because differential

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,730
equations is something that
shows up in a whole set of

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,660
different fields.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,490
I've been requested by someone
who's starting an economics

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,050
PhD program to do this; I've
been requested by some people

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,660
who are going into physics, some
people who are going into

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,180
engineering.

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,300
So it's a widely applicable
area of study.

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,350
So let's just get started,
before I keep going off on

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,080
useless stuff.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,130
So the differential equations.

19
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,370
So the first question is: what
is a differential equation?

20
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,730
You know what an equation is.

21
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,740
What is a differential
equation?

22
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,670
Well, a differential equation
is an equation that involves

23
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,680
an unknown function and
its derivatives.

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,590
So what do I mean by that?

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:10,290
Well, let's say that I said that
y prime plus y is equal

26
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,180
to x plus 3.

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,010
Here, the unknown
function is y.

28
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,430
We could have written it as y of
x, or we could have written

29
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:25,100
this as dy dx, the derivative
of y with respect to x plus

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,010
this unknown function y
is equal to x plus 3.

31
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:35,440
We also could have written f
prime of x plus f of x is

32
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,170
equal to x plus 3.

33
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,850
All of these would have been
valid ways of writing this

34
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,080
exact same differential
equation.

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,100
And what's interesting here,
and how this is a departure

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,890
from what we've learned before
about just regular equations

37
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,020
is that-- let me write down
a regular equation just to

38
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,500
remind you what they
look like.

39
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,050
So a regular equation, if we had
one variable, would look

40
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,310
something like this.

41
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,480
I don't know, x squared plus
the cosine of x is equal to

42
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,570
the square root of x.

43
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,970
I just made that up.

44
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,110
Here, the solution is a number,
or sometimes it's a

45
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,770
set of numbers.

46
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,030
Sometimes there's more
than one, right?

47
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,760
If you have a polynomial, you
could have more than one

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,260
values of x that satisfy
this equation.

49
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,870
Here, for a differential
equation, the

50
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,290
solution is a function.

51
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,600
Our goal is to figure out what
function of x, and here I

52
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,400
wrote f of x explicitly, but
what function of x explicitly

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,980
satisfies this relationship
or this equation.

54
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,680
So let me show you what
I mean by that.

55
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,380
And I have my differential
equations book from college,

56
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,310
so I'm going to use
that as we go.

57
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,290
So let's say that-- I'm
just writing now.

58
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,120
See, they have this as a
differential equation.

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,710
And I'm not going to show you
necessarily how to solve them

60
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,890
just yet, because we have to
learn some tricks first. But I

61
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,650
think a good place to start is
just so you understand what a

62
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,620
differential equation is, so
you don't get confused with

63
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,460
the traditional equation.

64
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,900
So, they have this differential
[? derivative. ?]

65
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,050
y prime prime.

66
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,280
So the second derivative of y
with respect to x, plus 2

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,090
times the first derivative of y
with respect to x, minus 3 y

68
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,910
is equal to 0.

69
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,990
And they give us the solutions
here, and what they want us to

70
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,210
do is show that these
are solutions.

71
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,020
And I think this is a good
place to just at least

72
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,930
understand what a differential
equation is, and what its

73
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,970
solution means.

74
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,000
So they say y1 of x is equal
to e to the minus 3x.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,310
So they claim that this
is a solution of this

76
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,040
differential equation.

77
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,170
So let me show to you
that this is.

78
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,590
Well, if this is soon. y1,
what's y-- well, let

79
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,570
me just write y1.

80
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,080
What's y1 prime?

81
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,010
What's the derivative of this?

82
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,690
Well, just do the chain rule.

83
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,180
The derivative of the whole
function, with respect to this

84
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,420
part of it, is just
e to the minus 3x.

85
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,350
And then you take the derivative
of the inside.

86
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,080
So that's just the derivative
of the outside, e

87
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,550
to the minus 3x.

88
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:08,160
And the derivative of the
inside is minus 3.

89
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,020
And the second derivative of
y1 is equal to-- we'll just

90
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,190
take the derivative of this, and
that's just equal to plus

91
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,100
9-- minus 3 times minus
3-- e to the minus 3x.

92
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,060
Now, let's verify that if
we substitute y1 and its

93
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,930
derivatives back into this
differential equation, that it

94
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,520
holds true.

95
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,730
So y prime prime, that's this.

96
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:39,130
So we get nine e to the minus
3x, plus 2y prime.

97
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,110
Plus 2 times y prime.

98
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,620
Well, this is y prime.

99
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:49,810
So 2 times minus 3 e to the
minus 3x plus-- oh sorry,

100
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,010
minus-- 3 times y.

101
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,430
Well, y is this.

102
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,440
So minus 3 times e
to the minus 3x.

103
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Well, what does that equal?

104
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:09,260
We get 9 e to the minus 3x,
minus 6 e to the minus 3x,

105
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,670
minus 3 e to the minus 3x.

106
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,980
Well, what does that equal?

107
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,160
We have 9 of something
minus 6 of

108
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,290
something minus 3 of something.

109
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,460
So that just equals 0.

110
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,550
It doesn't matter
of 0 whatever.

111
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,140
So that equals 0.

112
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,780
So we verified that for this
function, for y1 is equal to e

113
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,870
to the minus 3x, it satisfies
this differential equation.

114
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,080
Now there's something
interesting here, and you've

115
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,340
kind of touched on this with
regular equations, is that

116
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,320
this might not be the
only solution.

117
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,520
In fact we'll learn, in maybe a
video or two, that often the

118
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,760
solution is not just
a function.

119
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,210
It could be a class of functions
where usually

120
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,900
they're all kind of the same
function, but you have a

121
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,980
difference of constants.

122
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,200
But I'll show you that
in a second.

123
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,850
But here, they actually show
us that there's another

124
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,960
solution, that this will
actually work with, we could

125
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,800
try the equation y2 of x
is equal to, well, just

126
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,020
simple e to the x.

127
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,550
And we could verify
that, right?

128
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,900
What's the first and second
derivatives of e to the x?

129
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,470
Well, they're just e to the x.

130
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,270
So the second derivative of y2
is just e to the x plus 2

131
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,730
times the first derivative
is what?

132
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,710
Well the first derivative of e
to the x is still e to the x,

133
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,970
2 e to the x, minus 3
times a function.

134
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,320
Minus 3e to the x.

135
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,010
Well, 1 plus 2 minus 3, well
that equals 0 again.

136
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:41,690
So this was also a solution to
this differential equation.

137
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,510
Now before we go on, in the next
one I'll show you some

138
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,920
fairly straightforward
differential

139
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,650
equations to solve.

140
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,860
I think it's a good time now,
now that you hopefully have a

141
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,570
grasp of what a differential
equation is, and what its

142
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,370
solution is.

143
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,610
And its solution isn't a number,
its solution is a

144
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,760
function, or a set
of functions,

145
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,380
or a class of functions.

146
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,820
It's a good time to just
go over a little bit of

147
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,100
terminology.

148
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,820
So there's two big
classifications.

149
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,580
Well actually, there's a first
big one, ordinary and partial

150
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,900
differential equations.

151
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,590
I think you might have already
guessed what that means.

152
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,290
An ordinary differential
equation is what I wrote down.

153
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,550
It's one variable with respect
to another variable, or one

154
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,990
function with respect you to,
say, x and its derivatives.

155
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,350
Partial differential equations
we'll get into later.

156
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,190
That's more complicated.

157
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,700
That's when a function
can be a function of

158
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,740
more than one variable.

159
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,120
And you can have the derivative
with respect to x,

160
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,950
and y, and z.

161
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,570
We won't worry about
that right now.

162
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,570
If your functions and their
derivatives are a function of

163
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,630
only one variable, then we're
dealing with an ordinary

164
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,490
differential equation.

165
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,730
That's what this playlist
will deal with, ordinary

166
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:50,230
differential equations.

167
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,620
Now within ordinary differential
equations,

168
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,710
there's two ways of
classifying, and

169
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,280
they kind of overlap.

170
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,300
You have your order, so what
is the order of my

171
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,180
differential equation?

172
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,820
And then you have this notion
of whether it is linear or

173
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,100
non-linear.

174
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,640
And I think the best way to
figure this out is just to

175
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,250
write down examples.

176
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,735
So let me write down one.

177
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,760
And I'm getting this
from my college

178
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,060
differential equations book.

179
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,050
x squared times the second
derivative of y with respect

180
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:33,189
to x, plus x times the first
derivative of y with respect

181
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:40,720
to x, plus 2y is equal
to sine of x.

182
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,250
So the first question here
is: what is the order?

183
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,270
All the order is is the highest
derivative that exists

184
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,600
in your equation.

185
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,360
The highest derivative
of the function

186
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,150
under question, right?

187
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,650
The solution of this is going to
be a y of x, that satisfies

188
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,880
this equation.

189
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,750
And the order is the highest
derivative of that function.

190
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,080
Well, the highest derivative
here is the second derivative.

191
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,500
So this has order 2.

192
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,960
Or as you could call this,
a second order ordinary

193
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,360
differential equation.

194
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,780
Now the second thing we have to
figure out: is this linear

195
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,640
or is this a non-linear
differential equation?

196
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,600
So a differential equation is
linear if all of the functions

197
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,480
and its derivatives are
essentially, well for lack of

198
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,110
a better word, linear.

199
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,830
What do I mean by that?

200
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,510
I mean you don't have a y
squared, or you don't have a

201
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,750
dy over dx squared, or you
don't have a y times the

202
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,080
second derivative of y.

203
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,100
So this example I just wrote
here, this is a second order

204
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,530
linear equation, because you
have the second derivative,

205
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,580
the first derivative, and y, but
they're not multiplied by

206
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,910
the function or the
derivatives.

207
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:59,600
Now if this equation were-- if
I rewrote it as x squared d,

208
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,260
the second derivative of y with
respect to x squared, is

209
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,470
equal to sine of x, and let's
say I were to square this.

210
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,660
Now, all of the sudden,
I have a non-linear

211
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,690
differential equation.

212
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,860
This is non-linear.

213
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,030
This is linear.

214
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:21,190
Because I squared, I multiplied
the second

215
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,410
derivative of y with respect--
I multiplied it times itself.

216
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,740
Another example of a non-linear
equation is if I

217
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:35,230
wrote y times the second
derivative of y with respect

218
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,390
to x is equal to sine of x.

219
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,800
This is also non-linear, because
I multiplied the

220
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,140
function times its second
derivative.

221
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,340
Notice here, I did multiply
stuff times the second

222
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,010
derivative, but it was the
independent variable x that I

223
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,200
multiplied.

224
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,690
But anyway, I've run out of
time, and hopefully that gives

225
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,690
you a good at least
survey of what a

226
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,270
differential equation is.

227
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,840
In the next video, we'll start
actually solving them.

228
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,090
See you soon
