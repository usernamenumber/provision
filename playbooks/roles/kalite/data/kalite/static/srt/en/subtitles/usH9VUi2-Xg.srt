1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:02,515
Now that we hopefully have a conceptual understanding...

2
00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:05,350
...of what a surface integral like this COULD represent,

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,073
...I want to think about how we can actually construct...

4
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:10,009
...a unit vector...

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,669
...a unit normal vector, at any point on the surface.

6
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:15,483
And to do that, I will assume...

7
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:18,221
...that our surface can be parametrized...

8
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:21,282
...by the position vector function, r...

9
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:23,432
...and r is a function of two parameters.

10
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:27,569
It's a function of u, and it is a function of v.

11
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,529
You give me a u and a v and...

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,489
...that will essentially specify...

13
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,002
...a point on this two-dimensional surface right over here.

14
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,931
It could be bent, so it kind of exists in three-dimensional space...

15
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:42,738
But a u and a v will specify a given point on this surface.

16
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:46,865
Now, let's think about what the directions of r...

17
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:48,983
...the partial of r with respect to...

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,188
...the partial of r with respect to u looks like...

19
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:54,524
...and what the direction of the partial of r...

20
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:57,692
...the partial of r with respect to v looks like.

21
00:00:57,953 --> 00:00:59,989
So let's say that we're at some...

22
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:01,289
...we're at some point.

23
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,729
We're at some point, (u,v).

24
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:06,635
So for some (u,v), if you'd find the position vector...

25
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:09,457
...it takes us to that point on the surface right over there.

26
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:12,651
Now let's say that we increment u just a little bit.

27
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:14,423
And as we increment u just a little bit,

28
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:16,655
...we're going to get to another point on our surface,

29
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:18,417
...and let's say that other point on the surface...

30
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:19,461
...is right over there.

31
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,826
So what would r...

32
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:23,121
What would this r_u vector look like?

33
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:24,881
Well its magnitude is essentially going to be..

34
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:26,598
...dependent on how fast it's happening,

35
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:28,929
...how fast we're moving towards that point,

36
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:31,261
...but its direction is going to be in that direction.

37
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:32,806
It's going to be towards that point.

38
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:34,251
It's going be along the surface.

39
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,217
We're going from one point on the surface to another.

40
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:38,760
It's essentially going to be tangent to the surface at that point.

41
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,240
And I could draw a little bit bigger.

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,181
It would look something like that.

43
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:45,057
r... r_u.

44
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:46,510
So I just zoomed in right over here.

45
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,003
Now let's go back to this point.

46
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:51,585
And now let's make v a little bit bigger.

47
00:01:51,585 --> 00:01:53,448
And let's say if we make v a little bit bigger,

48
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:55,101
...we go to this point right over here.

49
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:58,625
So then our position vector, r, would point to this point.

50
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,970
And so what would r_v look like?

51
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,817
Well its magnitude, once again, would be dependent on...

52
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:05,634
...how fast we're going there, but the direction is what's interesting.

53
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:09,078
The direction would also be tangential to the surface.

54
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:11,090
We're going from one point on the surface to another...

55
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,416
...as we change v.

56
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,356
So r_v might look something like that.

57
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,853
And they're not necessarily...

58
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:19,759
These two aren't necessarily perpendicular to each other.

59
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,481
In fact, the way I drew them, they're not perpendicular.

60
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:25,869
So r_v is like this, but they're both tangential to the plane.

61
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:28,266
They're both essentially telling us, right at that point,

62
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:31,139
...what is the tangent? What is the slope in that...

63
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:34,138
...in the u direction, or in the v direction?

64
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:35,720
Now, this is...

65
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,067
When you have two...

66
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,668
When you have two vectors that are...

67
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:40,267
...that are tangential to the plane,

68
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:42,125
...and they're not the same vector, these are actually...

69
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,435
...already specifying...

70
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:45,784
...these are already kind of determining a plane.

71
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:48,417
And so you can imagine a plane that looks something like this.

72
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,868
If you took linear combinations of these two things,

73
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:54,099
...you would get a plane that both of these would lie on.

74
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,437
Now, we've done this before, but I'll re-visit it.

75
00:02:57,437 --> 00:02:59,669
What happens when I take the cross product...

76
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:02,684
...of r_u and r_v?

77
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:05,673
What happens when I take the cross product?

78
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:08,573
Well first, this is going to give us another vector.

79
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:10,384
It's going to give us a vector...

80
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:15,082
...a vector that is perpendicular to both...

81
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:19,051
...to r_u AND r_v.

82
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:20,823
Or another way to think about it is...

83
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:22,867
...this plane, that these...

84
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:23,716
...when you take the cross product...

85
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:26,485
...this plane is essentially a tangential plane...

86
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:27,462
...to the surface.

87
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:28,984
And if something is going to be perpendicular...

88
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:30,452
...to both of these characters,

89
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:32,555
...it's going to have to be normal to them...

90
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:33,723
...or, it's definitely going to be perpendicular...

91
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:35,442
...to both of them, but it's going to be normal...

92
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:36,467
...to this plane.

93
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:37,905
Which is essentially going to be...

94
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:40,871
...perpendicular to the surface itself.

95
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,154
So this right over here...

96
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:44,347
...is going to be A normal vector.

97
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:45,774
This is... I'll write it...

98
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:46,956
Well, let me just write it this way.

99
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:48,622
This is A normal vector.

100
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:50,816
I'm not saying THE unit normal...

101
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:52,906
I'm not saying THE normal vector, 'cause you have...

102
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:54,442
...you could have different normal vectors of...

103
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,691
...different magnitudes.

104
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:58,861
This is A normal vector, when you take the cross product.

105
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:01,641
And we can even think about what direction it's pointing in.

106
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,477
And so when you have "something" cross "something else"...

107
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,417
...the easiest way I remember how to do it is...

108
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:07,995
...you point your left thumb...

109
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,724
Oh, sorry. You point your RIGHT thumb...

110
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,439
...in the direction of the first vector...

111
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,870
So, in this case, r_u.

112
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,839
So let me see if I can...

113
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,709
...if I can draw this.

114
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,771
I'm literally looking at my hand and trying to draw it.

115
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:20,443
So you put your right thumb...

116
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:22,303
-- so this is a right-hand rule, essentially --

117
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,339
...in the direction of the first vector...

118
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:28,200
...and then you put your index finger in the direction of...

119
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,634
...the second vector...

120
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:31,102
...right over here.

121
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:32,305
So this is the second vector.

122
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,442
So that's the direction of my index finger.

123
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:37,968
So my index finger is going to look something like...

124
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:39,504
...that.

125
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:40,702
And then you bend...

126
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:43,164
...you bend your middle finger inward...

127
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:45,367
...and that will tell you the direction of the cross product.

128
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:48,054
So if I bend my middle finger inward,

129
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,533
...it will look something...

130
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:52,134
...it will look something like this.

131
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,651
And then of course, my other two fingers are just going to be...

132
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:56,787
...folded in like that, and they're not really relevant.

133
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:59,389
But my other two fingers and my hand looks like that.

134
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:00,924
And so that tells us the direction.

135
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:02,265
The direction is going to be like that.

136
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:03,616
It's going to be upward-facing.

137
00:05:03,616 --> 00:05:05,635
That's important, because you have normal vectors.

138
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:06,672
One could...

139
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:09,208
Or there's two directions of "normalcy," I guess you could say.

140
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,156
One is going out like that...

141
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:12,182
...outwards...

142
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:12,954
...or I guess...

143
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:14,434
...in the upward direction...

144
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:15,903
...one would be going downwards,

145
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,886
...or going -- I guess you could say -- into the surface.

146
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:19,524
But the way I have set it up right now,

147
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:20,695
...this would be going outwards.

148
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,415
It would be A...

149
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:24,878
It would be A normal vector...

150
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:25,901
...to the surface.

151
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,068
Now, in order to go from A normal vector...

152
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:31,016
...to the UNIT normal vector,

153
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:32,490
...we just have to normalize it.

154
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,684
We just have to divide this...

155
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,173
...by its magnitude.

156
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:37,151
So now we have our drumroll.

157
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,235
The unit vector...

158
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:39,837
And it's going to essentially be...

159
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:41,685
It's going to be a function of u...

160
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:42,422
It's going to be...

161
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:44,510
...a function of u and v.

162
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,888
You give me a u or a v...

163
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:46,600
...and I'll give you a...

164
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,099
...that unit normal vector.

165
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,090
It is going to be equal to...

166
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,058
...the partial of r...

167
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:53,998
...the partial of r with respect to u...

168
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:55,400
...crossed with...

169
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,052
...the partial of r with respect to v...

170
00:05:58,052 --> 00:05:58,580
That just...

171
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,090
Now that gives us A normal vector,

172
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,451
but it hasn't been normalized.

173
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:03,054
So we want to divide...

174
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:04,550
...by the magnitude...

175
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,785
We want to divide by the magnitude...

176
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,168
...of the exact same thing.

177
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,307
r_u crossed with r_v.

178
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,417
And we're done!

179
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,361
We have constructed a unit normal vector.

180
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:21,569
And in future videos, we'll actually do this with concrete examples.
