1
00:00:00,698 --> 00:00:04,414
Let's multiply 4 times 2012.

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:08,361
Actually, let's make it a little bit simpler, let's multiply 4 times 201.

3
00:00:08,361 --> 00:00:11,287
Just to simplify things a little bit.

4
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:13,330
So 4 times 201.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,092
So as we've seen in previous videos I'd like to write the larger number on top.

6
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:20,760
This is just one of many ways of tackling a calculation like this.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,033
I'll write the 201 and then I'll write the 4 right below it, right below the ones place.

8
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:29,033
And so I have 201 times 4.

9
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:31,674
Now just like we did when we were multiplying a one digit times a two digit,

10
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:33,833
we do essentially the same process.

11
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:41,008
We first multiply 4 times the 1. Well, 4 times 1, we know, is equal to 4.

12
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:46,674
So we put a 4 right over there in the ones place.

13
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:49,693
Then we could multiply our four times the digit that we have in the tens place.

14
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:52,433
In this case we have a 0 in the tens place.

15
00:00:52,433 --> 00:01:00,002
So 4 times 0, well that's just 0. 4 times 0 is 0, we put that 0 in the tens place right over here.

16
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:06,364
And then last, we have 4 times this 2 right over here.

17
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:12,541
And so 4 times 2 is equal to 8. And we put the 8 right over here.

18
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,002
And we got our answer! 804.

19
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:16,674
Now why did this work?

20
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:19,275
Well, remember when we multiplied 4 times 1, there was literally just 4.

21
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:22,201
(We've got that 4 right over here.)

22
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:27,033
Then we multiplied 4 times 0, that's 0 tens so we've got 0 tens right over here.

23
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:31,349
And then we multiplied 4 times 2, this was actually a 200, it's in the hundreds place.

24
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,018
So 4 times 200 is 800.

25
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:37,700
So, what we were essentially doing by writing in the right places,

26
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,866
we were saying: 4 times 201, that's the same thing as 4 times 200, which is 800,

27
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:45,606
plus 4 times 0 tens, which is 0 tens,

28
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,346
plus 4 times 1, whis is 4.

29
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:52,346
So 800 plus 0 plus 4 is 804.
