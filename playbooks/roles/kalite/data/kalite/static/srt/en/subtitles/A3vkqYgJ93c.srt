1
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:09,313
This is the Sant Ignatius Chapel, Ignatius of Loyola

2
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:12,474
and in his memory before he actually was proclaimed

3
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:16,392
as saint fully, the church was dedicated

4
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:20,232
and then when he was beatified and then canonised in 1622,

5
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:23,393
another entire church was built with his name Sant Ignazio,

6
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:25,659
which is nearby this chapel,

7
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,748
and celebrates his relationship to god.

8
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:32,800
It is explosion of light, precious material,

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,641
gold, lapis lazuli, silver, bronze and precious marbles.

10
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:44,278
And what we see is basically a painting enshrined in a great tabona.

11
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:47,414
A painting shows Sant Ignatius before God himself.

12
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,150
He is kneeling in his black habit before the figure of Christ

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,740
and he is holding a banner, bright red banner with the name of Jesus on it

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,886
as a representing or supplicating before God to be admitted to have.

15
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:01,898
And the most extraordinary thing about this

16
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:04,066
it is actually a theatrical mechanism.

17
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:07,334
In very recent years this has been restored

18
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:12,817
and it's functioning once again and generally speaking, at 5.30 p.m daily a painting

19
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:17,832
at combination of a fifteen to twenty minute sound and light show

20
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:23,250
lowers itself, the painting slides down gradually like a piece of theatrical

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,009
machinery into the ground, below the author

22
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:33,963
and reveals a full size but much larger than life size statue of Sant Ignatius.

23
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,245
He has not died and gone to heaven and above the whole figure cramps around by

24
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:42,369
angels as the image of Holy Trinity.

25
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,242
So this is Baroque scenery,

26
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:46,985
Baroque theatricality at its finest.

27
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:50,146
And at their call their machina back in those days as a machine.

28
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:54,949
The entire tabernacle is even on this deem day, is beautifully illuminated,

29
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:58,619
all of the incredible reflective qualities of the gold,

30
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,206
of the semi-precious stones, really reflecting light.

31
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:04,409
But if you look at the image itself it is so interesting, because below

32
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,902
the main scene you have the representation of the forming continents,

33
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:10,598
of the Africa of the new world.

34
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,585
The four corners of the world is like call of then

35
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:16,804
and then the Church of Sant Ignatius, church of few blocks from here,

36
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,542
we have a similar, the much larger painting on the ceiling in fresco

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,325
of that theme, of Ignatius' work, teaching and faith of the Jesuits

38
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:28,816
extending to the four parts of the now world.

39
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,937
The statue behind is not the original statue, part of it is,

40
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:47,406
but the great solid silver and gold parts were melted down,

41
00:02:47,406 --> 00:02:51,063
when the Polian invaded in 1798

42
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:54,982
also to pay for the troops they also burnt a lot of the tapestries of the Vatican's

43
00:02:54,982 --> 00:02:57,672
so they could get the precious gold and silver thread out.

44
00:02:57,672 --> 00:03:00,311
This was the remain of the ninetinth century

45
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:05,419
and it still stands as a piece of absolutely wonderful 
precious material.

46
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:10,916
I would add that between the gilded bronze shafts of those columns

47
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,424
are lots of pieces of lapis lazuli.

48
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:15,409
Lapis is ultramarine blue,

49
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:17,431
is one of the richest materials that we know,

50
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:19,902
still the most expensive colourig painting.

51
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:22,269
I clounge to use the last judgement ground up.

52
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:25,911
It comes from Afghanistan, but it is also highly expensive,

53
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:28,418
it's three times the price of gold,

54
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:30,325
three times the value of gold.

55
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:33,294
When the painting comes down and the sculpture is revealed

56
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:35,516
there is also musical accompaniment.

57
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,915
This is very central experience.
