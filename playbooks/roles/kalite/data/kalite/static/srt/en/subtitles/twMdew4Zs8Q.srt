1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,080
Let's multiply 9 times...8,000...8,085.

2
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:15,503
That should be a pretty fun little calculation to do.

3
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:20,330
So like always let's just rewrite this, 
so I'm going to write the 8,085.

4
00:00:20,614 --> 00:00:24,435
I'm going to write the 9 right below it and write our little multiplication symbol.

5
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:29,533
And now we're ready to compute. 
So first, we can tackle 9 times 5.

6
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:32,662
Well we know that 9 times 5 is 45.

7
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:37,336
We can write the 5 in the ones place
and carry the 4 to the tens place.

8
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,637
So if 9 times 5 is 45.

9
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:44,895
Now we're ready to move on to 9 times 8.

10
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:49,509
And we're going to calculate 9 times 8 
and then add the 4 that we just carried.

11
00:00:49,936 --> 00:00:56,168
So 9 times 8 is 72, plus the 4 is 76.

12
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,921
So we'll write the 6 right here in the tens place
and carry the seven.

13
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:06,643
Now, we are ready to calculate
(and I'm looking for a suitable color)

14
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:11,995
9 times 0...9 times 0 hundreds plus

15
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:14,919
(and this is the 7 in the hundreds place, 
so that's actually 700)

16
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:19,084
or if we're just kind of going with the computation, 
9 times 0 plus 7.

17
00:01:19,138 --> 00:01:24,065
Well 9 times 0 is 0, plus 7 is 7...is 7.

18
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:27,996
And then finally, finally, we have

19
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:30,577
(and once again I'm looking for a suitable color)

20
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:35,634
9 times 8, 9 times 8,
this is the last thing we have to compute.

21
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:42,638
We already know that 9 times 8 is 72 
and we just write the 72 right down here.

22
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:43,698
And we're done!

23
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:50,038
8,085 times 9 is 72,765.

24
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:53,975
Let's do one more example just to make sure that this is really clear in your brain.

25
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:57,242
At least the process for doing this, and I also want you to think about why this works.

26
00:01:57,947 --> 00:02:09,502
So let's try...let's try 7 times 5,000...5,396.

27
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:11,909
And I encourage you to pause it 
and try it on your own as well.

28
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:20,996
Well 5,000...(I'm going to re-write it)
5,396 times 7 - first we'll think about...

29
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:25,912
first we'll think about what 7 times 6 is; 
we know that's 42.

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,331
Put the 2 in the ones place, 4 we will carry.

31
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:33,910
Then we need to concern ourselves with 7 times 9.

32
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,178
But then we have to calculate that 
and then add the 4.

33
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:42,569
7 times 9 is 63 plus 4 is 67.

34
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,255
So, we get...we put the 7 down here and carry the 6.

35
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:55,814
Then, we have to worry about 7 times 3 
plus this 6 that we have just finished carrying.

36
00:02:56,074 --> 00:03:00,838
7 times 3 is 21 plus 6 is 27.

37
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:05,703
So, we'll write the 7 here in the hundreds place 
and carry the 2.

38
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:13,022
And finally, we have 7 times 5, 
which is 35 but we have to add the 2.

39
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:16,272
35 plus 2 is 37.

40
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:22,522
So 5,396 times 7 is 37,772.
