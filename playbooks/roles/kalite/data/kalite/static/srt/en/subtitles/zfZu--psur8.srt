99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are looking at a painting at the Museum of Modern Art by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a street scence in Dresden and it dates to 1908

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And Kirchner is known as an expressionist artist that's his classification

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He would become a part of a group called "Die Brucke" The Bridge

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The bridge meant that they were bridging the past and the future

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it also refers directly to Nietzsche

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the bridge from civilization to the Ubermensch. Crossing the bridge to a journey of self discovery

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
To individual self actualization

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There were so many German artists and craftsmen who were really interested or even obsessed with Nietzsche

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What was it about Nietzsche?

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He was interested in taking apart ideas of morality wich constricted culture so much I think all over

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Europe but escpecially in Germany.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think the young artists I think Kirchner was not even 30 at this point

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The young German artists were all really interested in sort of renewal

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the new and....

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Germany was late into coming into the industrail revolution so there is a lot of change happening

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In a very compressed time period

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They in the later 19th century really tried to catch up to England and France

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They worked really hard to do that and then there was alot of growth really fast

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But there were all these cultural morays that they worked really hard to break out of

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and Nietzsche was totally influential and inspirational because he deposited all of these ways of sort

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of breaking out of a really very constritive, proper, individually accountable art form

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that you would not be proper and contained and even in this painting there is a kind of isolation

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
amongst these figures

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Even though its a crowded sort of really dense scence that's pretty wild

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I have to say, I know that you like this painting and I have always really not.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I love this painting

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Why don't you like this painting?

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It feels very like a man looking at women on the street. And I know that there I don't know

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's just that there are... I guess for me it doesn't build all that much more on the 19th century
