1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're in the Museum du Louvre

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
looking at one of the great Jacques David paintings The Oath of the Horatii

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
probably his most important painting

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well just an incredibly important painting even at its time

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not just looking back historically, it's from 1784

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it had enormous meaning to the French Revolutionaries

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It did, a couple of years later, a few years later right

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When the war and revolution would break out.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But had an enormously powerful impact even when it was first shown

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at the salon in 1785. It was painted, not in Paris where we're seeing it

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and where it was exhibited, but actually here in the Louvre

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but was painted in Rome. David had won that important prize

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for a young painter, the Prix de Rome.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But he had gone to Rome and ended up studying

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not this great Baroque canvases that were expected to be looked at

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but to go back further to the Ancient Roman

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and even to the Greek tradition, and we can see that here

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
very much so, these figures look like Ancient Greek sculptures.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The notion of the Greek tradition and of the early Republican

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Roman tradition was really one about rationalism and truth and those were...

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and a kind of true nobility of character and heroism, verasity, and virtue

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
yeah, yes, truth.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this was in and of itself a very radical set of political ideas in 1785.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And in complete opposition to the sort of percieved lifestyle

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the French nobility. Um, that's right, of the nobility of the king

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which was all seen as excess and was seen as destroying the state.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes, and if you look at this painting, it looks so, I mean it must have

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
even looked in 1785 when it was exhibited, So paired down

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so stark, so simplified, rationalized, yeah, think about the brush

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
work, the looseness, think about brush work,and looseness and openess

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the poetic qualities of the Rococa, that this was direct in opposition to.
