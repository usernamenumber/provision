1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,702
What i wanna do in this video

2
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:03,430
is give a very high level overview

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:09,143
of the 4 fundamental forces of the universe

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:14,154
And I'm gonna start with gravity.

5
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:16,508
and it might surprise some of you

6
00:00:16,508 --> 00:00:18,307
that gravity is actually the weakest

7
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:19,796
of the 4 fundamental forces

8
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:23,623
And that is surpring cause thats what keeps us glued,

9
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,874
well not glued, but what keeps us from

10
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:25,987
jumping off the planet

11
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:27,825
its what keeps the moon in orbit around the earth

12
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:29,818
the earth in orbit around the sun

13
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:34,955
the sun in orbit around the center of milky way galaxy.

14
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,464
So it is a little bit surpring that it is actually the weakest

15
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:43,174
of the forces. and that starts to make sense when actually you

16
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:46,724
think about things in more of a human scale or a molecular scale

17
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:49,644
or even an atomic scale. Even on a human scale

18
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:54,075
your computer monitor and you have some gravitational

19
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:57,073
attraction, but you don't notice it or your cell phone and your

20
00:00:57,073 --> 00:00:59,380
wallet, there is some gravitational attraction, but you don't see

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,787
them drawn to each other the way you might see 2 magnets

22
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:05,394
drawn to each other or repelled from each other.

23
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:08,228
and if you go even for a smaller scale you see that it matters

24
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:11,389
even less, we don even talk about gravity in chemistry, although

25
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:17,467
the gravity is there. but at those scales the other forces really start to dominate

26
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:19,414
So the gravity is our weakest.

27
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:22,591
If we move up a little bit from that, we get,

28
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:30,416
and this is maybe the hardest force for us to visualise, at least the hardest force for me,

29
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:38,342
is actually the weak force, sometimes called the weak interaction

30
00:01:38,342 --> 00:01:41,782
and it's what's responsible for radiactive decay,

31
00:01:41,782 --> 00:01:44,517
in particular beta minus and beta plus decay

32
00:01:44,517 --> 00:01:47,902
and just to give you an example of a weak interaction

33
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:51,970
if I had some cesium 137

34
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,756
137 means that it has 137 nucleons

35
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:58,210
a nucleon is either a proton or a neutron

36
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,981
you add up the protons and neutrons of cesium, you get 137

37
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:07,289
and it is cesium because it has exactly 65 protons.

38
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:12,057
Now, the weak interaction is what's responsible for one of its neutrons,

39
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:15,077
essentially for one of its quarks flipping and turning into a proton

40
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:18,139
and I'm not going to detail of what a quark is, and all of that

41
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,537
and the math can get pretty hairy

42
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:23,206
but i want to give you an example of what a weak interaction does

43
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:26,841
so if one of these neutrons turns into a proton

44
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:29,155
we're going to have one extra proton

45
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:32,300
but we're going to have the same number of nucleons

46
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,364
instead of an extra neutron you have an extra proton here

47
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:40,539
and now it is a different atom it is now barium

48
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:46,507
and in that flipping, it will actually emit an electon

49
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:49,834
and, an anti-electron neutrino

50
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:54,630
I'm not going to go into the details of what anti-electron neutrino is

51
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,514
these are fundamental particles

52
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:59,093
but this is just what the weak interaction is

53
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:01,700
it's not something that is really obvoius to us

54
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,489
it's not just these traditional things pulling and pushing away from each other

55
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,925
like we associate with the other forces

56
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:12,095
Now, the next stronger force

57
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:14,573
and just to give you a sense of how weak gravity is

58
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:18,095
even relative to the weak interaction

59
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:26,675
the weak interaction is 10^25 times the strength of gravity

60
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:27,704
and you might be thinking:

61
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:31,250
if this is so strong, how come this does not operate on planets

62
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,751
or us relative to the earth

63
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:39,433
why doesn't this apply to intergalactical distances

64
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:39,933
the way gravity does

65
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,279
and the reason is

66
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:50,197
weak interaction really applies to very small distances

67
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,034
so it can be much stronger than gravity

68
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:57,637
but it only applies over subatomic scale

69
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,526
you go anything beyond that,

70
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:03,425
it kind of disappears as an actual force, or interaction

71
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:07,160
And now, the next force up the hierarchy,

72
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,750
wich is the one we are more familliar with

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,429
it is something that actually dominates most of the chemistry that we deal with

74
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:17,517
and the electromagnetism that we deal with

75
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:29,967
And that is, the electromagnetic force.

76
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:38,408
And just to give you a sense, this is 10^36 times the strength of gravity.

77
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,277
So it kind of puts the weak force in its place

78
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:42,966
it's 10^12 times stronger than the weak force

79
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,857
these are huge numbers that we are talking about

80
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:48,496
either this relative to that, or this relative to the gravity

81
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,417
so you might be saying, the electromagnetic force,

82
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,555
that is unbelievably strong, why doesn't that apply over

83
00:04:54,555 --> 00:05:00,005
over these macro scales, like gravity

84
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:03,374
lemme write it down, macro scales

85
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:05,482
why doesn't it apply to macro scales?

86
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:06,659
and actually

87
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:09,790
there is norhing about the electromagnetic force why it can't

88
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,775
or it actually does apply overlarge distances.

89
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,352
The reality though, is that

90
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:20,542
you don't have such concentrations of either coulomb charges

91
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:21,919
or magnetism,

92
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,967
the way you do mass

93
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,485
so mass, since you have such huge concentrations,

94
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:28,637
it can operate over huge, huge distances

95
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:32,862
even though it's way way way weaker than the electromagnetic force

96
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:35,206
The electromagnetic force, what happens,

97
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:37,389
because it is attractive and repulsive,

98
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,470
it tends to sort itself out

99
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,852
sou you don't have these huge, huge concentrations of charge

100
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:46,203
Now, the other thing you might be wondering,

101
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:47,811
why is it called the electromagnetic force?

102
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:49,249
In our everyday life,

103
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,757
there's things like the coulomb force

104
00:05:51,757 --> 00:05:55,744
or the electrostatic force, which we're familiar with:

105
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:59,913
positive charges, or like charges want to repel

106
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:02,533
if both of these were negative, the same thing would be happenning

107
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:06,337
and different charges like to attract

108
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:09,035
we've seen this before, this is the coulomb force,

109
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:13,230
or the electrostatic force

110
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,387
and then on the other side of the.. word i guess

111
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:17,680
you have the 'magnetic' part

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,695
and magnets, you know you've had played with magnets on you fridge,

113
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:23,768
if they're the same side of the magnet,

114
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:25,667
they're gonna repel each other

115
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,367
if they're the opposite sides, opposite poles,

116
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:28,374
they're gonna attract each other

117
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:29,997
who why is it called one force?

118
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:31,544
And it's called one force,

119
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:35,201
and once again, I'm not going to go into detail here,

120
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:38,070
it's called one force , because it turns out that

121
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,161
the coulomb force (electrostatic force) and magnetic force

122
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:43,702
are actually the same thing

123
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,563
viewed in different frame of reference

124
00:06:46,563 --> 00:06:48,491
so I won't go into much detail,

125
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,729
but just keep that in the back of your mind

126
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:50,722
that they are connected

127
00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:52,729
In the future video, I'm going (????)

128
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:56,359
of how they're connected (????)

129
00:06:57,661 --> 00:06:59,315
It's more apparent when they're moving,

130
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:03,567
when the charges are moving in relativistic frames, and you have..

131
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:08,022
Just keep in mind that they are really the same force,

132
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:10,838
just viewed from different frames of reference

133
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,855
Now, the strongest of the forces,

134
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:15,201
it's probably the best named of them all,

135
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:19,000
and that's the strong force

136
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:28,034
and although, you've probably haven't seen this yet in chemistry classes

137
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:30,204
it actually applies very strongly in chemistry

138
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:36,159
because when you first learn about atoms, lemme draw a helium atom

139
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:42,258
A helium atoms ha two protons in his nucleus

140
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:45,346
and it has two neutrons,

141
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:48,462
and the it also has two electrons circulating around

142
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:51,369
So it has electron, and I can draw the electron much smaller

143
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,552
Well, I won't try to so anything in relative size,

144
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:55,784
but it has two electrons floating around.

145
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:58,411
And one question, that may or may not have jumped into your mind

146
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,435
when you first saw this model of an atom

147
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:05,587
is like: I see why electrons are attracted to the nucleus,

148
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:07,656
It has negative coulomb charge,

149
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:10,266
the nucleus has positive coulomb charge,

150
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:11,597
but what's not so obvious,

151
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:14,861
and what tends to sometimes not be explained in chemistry classes is:

152
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,009
These two positive charges are sitting right next to each other!

153
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:21,224
If the electromagnetic force was the only force in play

154
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:23,515
if the coulomb force was the only thing happening,

155
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:26,257
these guys would just run away form each other

156
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:27,849
they would repel each other

157
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:31,279
and so, the only reason that they're able to stick to each other

158
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,424
is that there's even stronger force

159
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:35,001
than the electromagnetic force

160
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,771
operating at these very, very small distances

161
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:41,938
so if you get two of these protons close enough together,

162
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:46,475
and the strong force applies only over very, very small distances

163
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:50,528
subatomic, or I should even say sub-nucleic distances

164
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:53,521
then the strong interaction comes into play

165
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:55,960
so then you have the strong interaction actually

166
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,521
keeping these charges together

167
00:08:57,521 --> 00:09:01,074
And once again, just keep it in mind

168
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:08,912
relative to gravity, it is 10^38 times the strength gravity of

169
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:12,698
or it's about 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force

170
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:15,516
So once again, the reason you don't see the strong force,

171
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:17,201
which is the strongest of all forces,

172
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:18,655
or the weak interaction,

173
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:20,231
applying over huge scales,

174
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:24,445
is that their strength dies off super, super fast

175
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:29,308
even when you start to go into large radius nuclei of atoms

176
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:32,257
the strength starts to die off, especially for the strong force.

177
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:36,239
The reason you don't see the electromagnetic force applying over large distances,

178
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:39,262
even though in theory it can, like gravity,

179
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:42,028
is that you don't see the type of charge concentration

180
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:45,200
the way you see mass concentrations in the universe

181
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,029
because the charge concentrations tend to sort themseleves out,

182
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,175
they tend to equalize

183
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:56,890
If I have a huge positive charge there and a huge negative charge there,

184
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,819
they will attract each other and then they become

185
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:04,352
essentially a big lump of neutral charge,

186
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:06,051
and once they're a big lump of neutral charge,

187
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:08,335
they won't interact with anything else.

188
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:13,198
Gravity, if you have one mass, and another mass, they attract each other

189
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:17,350
then you have a mass that's even better at attracting other masses

190
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,057
and so it'll keep attracting things to it.

191
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:22,028
So kind of snowball-like process

192
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:24,322
and that's why gravity can operate some of these

193
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:26,900
really, really large objects in our universe

194
00:10:26,900 --> 99:59:59,999
and the universe as a whole
