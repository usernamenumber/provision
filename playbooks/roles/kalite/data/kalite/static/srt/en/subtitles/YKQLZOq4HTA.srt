99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Solve for p. We have the absolute value p minus twelve plus 4 is less than 14

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets just do this one step at a time.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The first thing we want to do is we just want to isolate the part the has the absolute values.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So to do that we can get rid of this positive four here. We can do that by substracting four from both

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sides of the inequality.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The positive four and the negative four cancel out. We are just left the absolute value p minus twelve
