1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
   

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,920
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,180
Let's continue doing projectile
motion problems. I

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,380
think this video will be
especially entertaining,

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,370
because I will teach you a game
that you can play with a

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,370
friend, and it's called let's
see how fast and how high I

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,110
can throw this ball.

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,270
You'd be surprised--
it's actually quite

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,020
a stimulating game.

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,910
Let me just write
down everything

11
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,100
we've learned so far.

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:32,119
Change in distance is
equal to the average

13
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,540
velocity times time.

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,170
We know that change in
velocity is equal to

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,340
acceleration times time.

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,600
We also know that average
velocity is equal to the final

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,800
velocity plus the initial
velocity over 2.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,400
We know the change in velocity,
of course, is equal

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,960
to the final velocity minus
the initial velocity.

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,775
This should hopefully be
intuitive to you, because it's

21
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:02,660
just how fast you're going at
the end, minus how fast you're

22
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,080
going at the beginning,
divided-- oh no, no division,

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,080
it's just that I got
stuck in a pattern.

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,900
It's just vf minus
vi, of course.

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,500
   

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,560
You probably already knew this
before you even stumbled upon

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,340
my videos, but-- the two
non-intuitive ones that we've

28
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,980
learned, they're really just
derived from what I've just

29
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,470
written up here.

30
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,120
If you ever forget them, you
should try to derive them.

31
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,130
Actually, you should try to
derive them, even if you don't

32
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,780
forget them, so that you
when you do forget it,

33
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,000
you can derive it.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,020
It's change in distance-- let
me change it to lowercase d,

35
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,680
just to confuse you-- is equal
to the initial velocity times

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:52,760
time plus at squared over 2,
and that's one of what I'll

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,110
call the non-intuitive
formulas.

38
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,600
The other one is the final
velocity squared is equal to

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,200
the initial velocity
squared plus 2ad.

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,090
We've derived all of these,
and I encourage you to try

41
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,060
rederive them.

42
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,070
But using these two formulas
you can play my fun game of

43
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,630
how fast and how high did
I throw this ball?

44
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,890
All you need is your arm, a
ball, a stopwatch, and maybe

45
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,200
some friends to watch
you throw the ball.

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,460
So how do we play this game?

47
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,110
We take a ball, and we throw
it as high as we can.

48
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,760
We see how long does the
ball stay in the air?

49
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,810
What do we know?

50
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,120
We know the time for the ball
to leave your hand, to

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,970
essentially leave the ground and
come back to the ground.

52
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:48,240
We are given time, and
what else do we know?

53
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,570
We know acceleration-- we know
acceleration is this minus 10

54
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,670
meters per second.

55
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,130
If you're actually playing
this game for money, or

56
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,770
something, you would probably
want to use a more accurate

57
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,550
acceleration-- you could look
it up on Wikipedia.

58
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:07,400
It's minus 9.81 meters
per second squared.

59
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,680
Do we know the change
in distance?

60
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,060
At first, you're saying-- Sal,
I don't know how high this

61
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,540
ball went, but we're talking
about the change in distance

62
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,700
over the entire time.

63
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,430
It starts at the ground--
essentially at the ground,

64
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,266
because I'm assuming that you're
not 100 feet tall, and

65
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:24,050
so you're essentially at the
ground-- so it starts at the

66
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,610
ground, and it ends of the
ground, so the change in

67
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:33,260
distance of delta d is 0.

68
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,180
It starts with at the ground
and ends at the ground.

69
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,080
This is interesting-- this is a
vector quantity, because the

70
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,880
direction matters.

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,460
If I told you how far did the
ball travel, then you'd have

72
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,720
to look at its path, and say
how high did it go, and how

73
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,690
high would it come back?

74
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,000
Actually, if you want to be
really exact, the change in

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,930
distance would be the height
from your hand when the ball

76
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,880
left your hand, to the ground--
so, if you're 6 feet

77
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,440
tall, or 2 meters tall, the
change in distance would

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,490
actually be minus 2 meters,
but we're not going to do

79
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,870
that, because that would just be
too much, but you could do

80
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,190
it if there's ever a close call
between you and a friend,

81
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,280
and you're betting for money.

82
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,830
You're given these things,
and we want to figure

83
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,300
out a couple of things.

84
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,410
The first thing I want to figure
out is how fast did I

85
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,560
throw the ball, because that's
what's interesting-- that

86
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,800
would be a pure test
of testosterone.

87
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,450
How fast?

88
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:30,470
I want to figure out vi--
vi equals question mark.

89
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,640
Which of these formulas
can be used?

90
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,300
Actually, I'm going do it first
with the formulas, and

91
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,750
then I'm going to show you
almost an easier way to do it,

92
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,640
where it's more intuitive.

93
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,440
I want to show you that these
formulas can be used for fun

94
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,310
with your friends.

95
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,060
We know time, we know
acceleration, we know the

96
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,930
change in distance, so we could
just solve for vi--

97
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,350
let's do that.

98
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,310
In this situation, change in
distance is 0-- let me change

99
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,730
colors again just to change
colors-- so change in distance

100
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:09,450
is 0 is equal to
vi times time.

101
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,420
Let me put the g in for here,
so it's minus 10 meters per

102
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,850
second squared divided by 2,
and it's minus 5 meters per

103
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,720
second squared-- so it's
minus 5t squared.

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,170
All I did it is that I took
minus 10 meters per second

105
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,400
squared for a, divided it
by 2, and that's how I

106
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,070
got the minus 5.

107
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,510
If you used 9.81 or whatever,
this would be

108
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,610
4.905 something something.

109
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,630
Anyway, let's get back
to the problem.

110
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,000
If we wanted to solve this
equation for vi,

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,860
what could we do?

112
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,900
This is pretty interesting,
because we

113
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,910
could factor a t out.

114
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,700
What's cool about these physics
equations is that

115
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,190
everything we do actually has
kind of a real reasoning

116
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,590
behind it in the real world,
so let me actually flip the

117
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,600
sides, and factor out a t, just
to make it confusing.

118
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:12,210
I get t times vi minus
5t is equal to 0.

119
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,770
All I did is that I factored out
a t, and I could do this--

120
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,710
I didn't have to use a quadratic
equation, or factor,

121
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,930
because there wasn't a
constant term here.

122
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,320
So I have this expression, and
if I were to solve it,

123
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,110
assuming that you know vi is
some positive number, I know

124
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,160
that there's two times where
this equation is true.

125
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:41,810
Either t equals 0, or this term
equals 0-- vi minus 5t is

126
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:48,460
equal to 0, or since I'm solving
for velocity, we know

127
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:54,323
that vi is equal to 5t.

128
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:57,198
   

129
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:58,880
That's interesting.

130
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,070
So what does this say?

131
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,050
If we knew the velocity, we
could solve it the other way.

132
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,580
We could say that t is equal to
vi divided by 5-- these are

133
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,370
the same things, just solving
for a different variable.

134
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,790
But that's cool, because there
are two times when the change

135
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,000
in distance is zero-- at time
equals 0, of course, the

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,430
change in distance is zero,
because I haven't thrown the

137
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,150
ball yet, and then, at a later
time, or my initial velocity

138
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,530
divided by 5, it'll also
hit the ground again.

139
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,930
Those are the two times
that the change

140
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,740
in distance is zero.

141
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,330
That's pretty cool.

142
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,810
This isn't just math--
everything we're doing in math

143
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,550
has kind of an application
in the real world.

144
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,570
We've solved our equation--
vi is equal to 5t.

145
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:49,150
So, if you and a friend go
outside and throw a ball, and

146
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,710
you try to throw it straight
up--0 although we'll learn

147
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,540
when we do the two dimensional
projectile motion that it

148
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,000
actually doesn't matter if you
have a little bit of an angle

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,340
on it, because the vertical
motion and the horizontal

150
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,390
motions are actually
independent, or can be viewed

151
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:06,070
as independent from each other--
this velocity you're

152
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,160
going to get if you play this
game is going to be just the

153
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,670
component of your velocity
that goes straight up.

154
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,645
I know that might be a little
confusing, and hopefully it

155
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:16,270
will make a little more sense in
a couple of videos from now

156
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,520
when I teach you vectors.

157
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,030
   

158
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,940
If you were to throw this ball
straight up, and time when it

159
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,120
hits the ground, then this
velocity would literally the

160
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,990
speed-- actually, the
velocity-- at which

161
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,230
you throw the ball.

162
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,410
So what would it be?

163
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:39,950
If I threw a ball, and it took
two seconds to go up hit the

164
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,400
ground, then I could
use this formula.

165
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,890
This is actually 5
meters per second

166
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:51,490
squared times t seconds.

167
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,710
If it took 2 seconds-- so if
t is equal to 2-- then my

168
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,100
initial velocity is equal
to 10 meters per second.

169
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,160
You could convert that to
miles per hour-- we've

170
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,980
actually done that in
previous videos.

171
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:16,380
If you throw a ball that stays
up in the air for 10 seconds,

172
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,780
then you threw it at 50 meters
per second, which is

173
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,170
extremely, extremely fast.
Hopefully, I've taught you a

174
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,560
little bit about a fun game.

175
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,040
In the next video, I'll show
you how to figure out-- how

176
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,380
high did the ball go?

177
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,790
I'll see you soon.

178
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,900
