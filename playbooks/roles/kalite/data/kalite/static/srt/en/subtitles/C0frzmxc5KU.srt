00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,689
S: This is Sal here at Stanford Medical School with Dr. Andy Connely, a pathologist,

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,847
this is the 2nd video in our series looking at these slides.

3
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:15,209
Dr: We left off last time looking at this piece here, normal colon,

4
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:21,107
we had said this is an example of something you'd see at the edge of a specimen for colon cancer.

5
00:00:21,107 --> 00:00:26,169
Now I'm going to the next one which is a slightly more worrisome area if

6
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:31,231
you're a pathologist looking through the colon. I'm going to zoom in just a little bit

7
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:36,386
S: That's very worrisome, compared to the last one.

8
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:41,123
Dr: What we don't like about it, we saw before this is what a normal gland looks like,

9
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:46,092
It's a test-tube shape, going down, and it has these cells which are normal.

10
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:51,804
Now, all of a sudden it is a little thicker here, and what catches our eye is these are

11
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:56,866
not straight test-tubes anymore, they divide, go in and out like that.

12
00:00:56,866 --> 00:01:04,528
S: They still are test-tubes, they just look like circles because of the cross-section?

13
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:10,380
Dr: That's right, but when you come from the surface here and go down--

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,469
they normally should never branch.

15
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:16,417
So these ones are branching, and that's always bad, and in a cross-section

16
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:23,708
there's normally a little hole in the middle, where the mucin...

17
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,773
you can see it spilling out, coming right out.

18
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:40,705
This one here looks different, it's piled up, it's bigger around, cells are piled up,

19
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:43,027
and they branch.

20
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:47,532
So we look a little more closely at this, and we say,

21
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:51,572
"Hmm, I wonder if that's cancer? Could it be pre-cancer? Or just an area of irritation?"

22
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:57,516
A common response of the body to irritation is to change.

23
00:01:57,516 --> 00:02:04,204
And like we said before, the epithelium is the top layer, facing the outside world.

24
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:10,473
If it's irritated, it will change, and in this case it's changing by undergoing more growth.

25
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:15,999
S: Even if it's not cancer, is there a higher chance of it becoming cancer in the future?

26
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:21,015
Dr: A lot of cancers that appear in the body come from parts of the body that are

27
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:26,866
either irritated or have some sort of environmental challenges that are constantly at them,

28
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:31,835
and part of that is because there is a lot of cell division, if you keep dividing a cell,

29
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:33,972
you might have errors in DNA.

30
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:36,897
S: I see, so that's why skin cells, bowel cells...

31
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:39,823
Dr: That's right, and even things like liver, if you keep damaging your liver,

32
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:42,377
you might have higher chance for liver cancer.

33
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:47,160
So when a pathologist looks at this area and says,

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,111
"Well, it's a dividing gland...

35
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,526
It's kind of thrown up in these areas..."

36
00:02:51,526 --> 00:02:55,891
But largely they're still making mucin, or they're this type here, which looks like it's tall

37
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,445
and probably absorbing water.

38
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:02,996
S: So even in these test-tube-like vessels, there are these absorptive cells as well?

39
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:11,541
Dr: Right. So here, we would sign this off as 'hyperplasia'.

40
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:16,046
S: Hyperplasia. Hyper-, too much of something. And -plasia?

41
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:21,665
Dr: Growth. Plasia just means growth. So hyperplasia means too much growth.

42
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:25,102
But the important thing, if you took away the irritant, it wouldn't do this.

43
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:29,792
So if you took away whatever the irritant is, for the hyperplasia,

44
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,882
it would go back to being normal.

45
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:41,124
S: So there was some stimulus that was causing these cells to do this--some chemical, etc.

46
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:44,839
Dr: Right. We're rarely sure because so many things just float on through.

47
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:51,201
It's really hard to know. But this is probably too much growth due to some irritant.

48
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:56,356
S: Is it possible that it was just when this section of the colon was taken out,

49
00:03:56,356 --> 00:04:00,118
if this was done a day later, [hyperplasia] might not have been there?

50
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:02,765
Dr: Probably take longer that, a couple of weeks.

51
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:07,687
Because what happens is the cells come from the bottom, and they work their way to the top,

52
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:09,870
and eventually the top...

53
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,211
S: So it works sort of like the skin, these cells are being constantly used up

54
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:17,811
because things keep scraping by them.

55
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:25,892
Dr: They do. There is a lot known now about stem cells, the stem cells for the intestines are these guys.

56
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:29,375
S: How do you differentiate those from the others?

57
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:33,879
Dr: At the very bottom, the bottom hemisphere, there are going to be cells that do not have

58
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,523
the open chromatin, and kinda elongated. There maybe ones that are endocrine cells,

59
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:43,028
meaning they release hormones. And so they may have hormone releasing cells,

60
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:46,697
but in this bottom hemisphere, turns out to be where the intestine keeps [stem cells].

61
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:51,341
S: Stem cells are cells that haven't picked their jobs yet?

62
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:58,214
Dr: They haven't. There are all kinds of stem cells: the stem cells that can make a whole body/being,

63
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,511
there is also the kind that can make the rest of the colon.

64
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:05,784
So, this probably one that can make the rest of the epithelium,

65
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:10,846
with these two different cell types. So they're down here at the bottom, where you'd want them.

66
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:22,177
So this is a hyperplasia. I'd like to show you next, the next step which is a pre-cancer region.

67
00:05:22,177 --> 99:59:59,999
S: NEXT VIDEO!! =D
