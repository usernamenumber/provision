1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,180
Find the area of rhombus ABCD

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,030
giving that the radii of the circles circumscribed

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,960
about triangles ABD and ACD are 12 5 and 25 respectively

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,500
So let's draw ourselves rhombus ABCD

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,140
So let's draw a rhombus!

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,510
So let me draw it, and here we go!

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,630
That's a decent rhombus right over there;

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,470
we know that the all sides of a rhombus are equal

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,850
So let's name, let's label the vertices, so vertex A, B, C, D

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,280
So there we go rhombus ABCD

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,150
And then they say the radii of the circles circumscribed

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,630
about triangles ABD, so triangle ABD, that's ABD

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,010
That is triangle ABD so let's draw the circle,

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,720
let's draw it's circumcircle, its circumscribed circle

15
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:01,060
or the circle that passes through the vertices A, B and D

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,340
So, let me draw, do my best job at that

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,190
this is not a trivial thing to do, it's not always easy

18
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,540
So let's, let's do it like that there we go, that's it,

19
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,070
It's circumscribed circle or it's the circle,

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,790
circle circumscribed about ABD right over there

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,130
Now they're telling us, they're telling us that its diameter is 12 5

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,390
so they're saying that this diameter right over here

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,410
So if I were to draw a diameter of this circle right over here

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,100
it is 12 5

25
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,860
Now there other circle, circumcircle for triangle ACD

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:47,120
so let's draw ACD; A, C, A, C, D

27
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,230
So let's draw a circle that can go through the these 3 point

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,550
it looks like it would have to be something,

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,650
something like this, something like this

30
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,590
It looks like somewhat bigger circle,

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,800
and that that gels with the information that they gave us,

32
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,530
the way I drew it

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,890
So the circle would look something like that

34
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,890
I don't wanna spend too much trying, time trying to draw that circle

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,080
but they're telling us that it's I should be very careful

36
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,840
They're saying that the radius is 12 5 not the diameter,

37
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,350
so there we make it very clear,

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,760
Actually let me delete that circle

39
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,650
since it's just so messy

40
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,420
I can delete that 12 5 too, let me get

41
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,710
There you go, so the 12 5 is the radius the radii of the circle,

42
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,740
so this first circle ABD around a triangle ABD

43
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,020
This distance right over is 12 5

44
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,160
and this distance over here is also 12 5

45
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:53,640
So let's focus on triangle ACD

46
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,430
Let's focus on that triangle

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:03,650
Its circumcircle -- will look something like this,

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,430
there you go something like that

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,520
The whole point here is we're trying to draw circumcircle

50
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,780
but it's a point it's a circle

51
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,150
that will go through those three points

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,810
And it has a radius of 25,

53
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,760
so if you draw if you had its center

54
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,460
or if I were to draw a diameter of it is 25, fair enough

55
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:36,060
Now we need to figure out the area of rhombus A, B, C and D

56
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,600
Now if you've been seeing the video that I've been uploaded lately,

57
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,210
actually I've been uploading a few of the prerequisites for this

58
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,230
Because there is a formula, we proved the formula in the geometry

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,390
and in the competition math playlist

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,570
We proved the formula that relates

61
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:57,530
the area of a triangle to it's to radius of its circumcircle

62
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,270
And let me just rewrite the formula right over here

63
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,110
The formula is the radius of triangles circumcircle

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,570
is equal to the product of the triangles,

65
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,930
the product of the triangles' sides all of that over four

66
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,130
times the area of the triangle

67
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,750
So let's see if we can use this formula

68
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,390
then we have proved in a previous video

69
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,910
to figure out the areas of triangle ABD or express them somehow

70
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,560
and triangle ACD

71
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,540
and see if we can use that information

72
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,580
to figure out the area of the entire rhombus

73
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,380
So let me let me redraw it, let me redraw it a lil' bit

74
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,090
cause I think my diagram's got kinda messy

75
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,500
So I'll redraw the rhombus,

76
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,990
if you want you don't have to draw the circumcircles

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,700
or the circumscribed circles

78
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,520
because we know this formula right of here

79
00:04:51,530 --> 00:05:05,170
So this is A, B, C and D now let's think first of about triangle ABD,

80
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,280
Actually let me just draw the diagonals here

81
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,160
BD is one of the diagonals AC

82
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,890
is another one of the diagonals AC is the other diagonals

83
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,250
We know that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors

84
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,280
we know that that's a right angle,

85
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,890
And we know, that this length is equal to this length

86
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,120
and we also know that that length is equal to that length

87
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,690
Now, if we knew this green length here

88
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,770
and this blue length here we would be able

89
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,250
to figure out the area of the rhombus

90
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,640
Let's label them, let's call this let's call this right over

91
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,990
here let's call this lower case a

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,310
and let's this length over here lower case b

93
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,750
A times B times one half would be

94
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,540
the area of this triangle right over there

95
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,510
A time B times one half times 2 would give us this area

96
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,010
and to that area or other way to think about it

97
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,190
This triangle is completely congruent;

98
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,770
it has sides AB and this side right over here

99
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,670
All of these four triangles have those three sides

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,510
So, all four of these triangles are congruent

101
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,320
so you could take the area of this triangle multiply it by four

102
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,580
you will have the area of the rhombus

103
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:19,080
Let me write this down, the rhombus the rhombus area

104
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,500
is equal to four times one half AB

105
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,810
One half AB gives us just this triangle

106
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,640
right over here four times that which will be

107
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,740
so four times one half AB is two AB

108
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,610
is gonna be the area of the rhombus

109
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,340
We can tell more we can figure out A and B,

110
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,810
we can figure out A and B we can figure out the rhombus' area

111
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,650
So let's focus on this first piece of information,

112
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,810
let's focus on triangle let's focus on triangle A, B, and D

113
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,170
They tell us that it's circumradius s 12 5

114
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,960
so let's just use this formula right over here we get

115
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,090
12 5 is equal to its circumradius

116
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,160
12 5 is equal to the product of length of the sides

117
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,480
So what's the length of the sides here?

118
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,480
So we have this side right over here side BD

119
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,270
that's just gonna be 2A right?

120
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,440
That's an A so A plus an A

121
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,920
So it's gonna be 2A times this side right over here

122
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,910
What's this side which is one of the sides of the rhombus?

123
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,160
Well that's, this is a hypothesis of this

124
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,010
right triangle right over here, right?

125
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,320
This is a right angle,

126
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,720
so it's going to be the square root of A squared plus B squared

127
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,380
But all of the sides are going to be like that,

128
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,610
it's a rhombus all the sides are the same

129
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,330
A squared plus B squared they're all going

130
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,000
to have the exact same length

131
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,170
So the product of the sides,

132
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,890
you have 2A that's the length of BD times

133
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,230
the length of BA which is going to be the square root of A

134
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,380
squared plus B squared time the length of AD

135
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,570
which is the square root of A squared plus B squared

136
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,070
all of that over four times

137
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,910
the area four times the area of ABD

138
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,380
So all of that is four times,

139
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,570
so what's the area of A, B, and D

140
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,090
Well ABD is just two of these triangles right over here

141
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,730
This guy over here is one half AB

142
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,040
This guy also is one half AB

143
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,640
So the entire the entire area is going to be two

144
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,070
of these guys right over here which is gonna be A times B

145
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,400
A times B it gives you the area

146
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,170
of both of these triangles each of more than one half AB

147
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,780
So, instead of writing the area right here I can write AB

148
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:47,700
So, let's see this simplifies to 12 5 is equal to

149
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,720
divide the numerator and the denominator by twos

150
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,330
so it becomes one becomes a two becomes a one

151
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,780
That becomes a one, square of A squared plus

152
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,260
B squared times square of A squared plus

153
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,880
B squared is just A squared plus B squared

154
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:06,310
A squared plus B squared and the denominator were just with 2b

155
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,350
So this first piece of information the circumradius for ABD 12 5

156
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,720
gives us this equation right over here

157
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:25,390
Now let's just do the same thing for triangle ACD

158
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:34,460
Its circumradius is 25 is equal to the length of this side

159
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,120
This is a B this is also a B so it's going to be 2B,

160
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,360
2B times the length of the side

161
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,350
which is the square root of A squared plus B squared

162
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,760
times the length of this side which is again

163
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:52,740
just square root of A square plus B squared

164
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,850
all of that over four times four times the area four times the area

165
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,570
Now the area once again it's just this triangle

166
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,370
which is one half AB plus this triangle which is another one half AB

167
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,300
you add them together you just get AB, you just get AB

168
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,460
Two divided by two you get one there,

169
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,850
you get a two here divide by B, get a one

170
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,760
that just has becomes an A

171
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:20,120
and so you get 25 is equal to the numerator squared

172
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,380
of A squared of B squared times itself

173
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:29,850
it's just gonna be A squared plus B squared over 2A

174
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,150
So that second triangle its circumradius being 25

175
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,290
gives us this equation right over here

176
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,260
We can use the both of this;

177
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,040
we have two equations with two unknowns

178
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,540
Let's solve for A and B if we know A and B

179
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,560
we can then go back here to figure out the rhombus' area

180
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,330
So, over here we get over here we get

181
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,660
let's multiply both sided by 2B

182
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:57,300
we get 25B is equal to A squared plus B squared

183
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,350
Over here if we multiply both sides by 2A

184
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,240
we get 50A is equal to A squared plus B squared

185
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,910
So 50A is equal to A squared plus B squared,

186
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,170
25B is equal to A squared plus B square

187
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,430
so 25B must be the same thing as 50A

188
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,480
they're both A squared plus B squared

189
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:22,120
So we get 25B must be equal to 50A

190
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,630
they're both equal to A square plus B squared

191
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,990
Now divide both sides no with by 25

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:36,120
you get B is equal to 2A B

193
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,140
I wanna do that in magenta

194
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,740
B is equal to B is equal to 2A

195
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,580
So we can take this information

196
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,930
and then now substitute back into one of these equations

197
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,700
to solve for B so we can solve for A

198
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,190
So let's go back into this one

199
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,910
so we get 50A

200
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,260
I have to solve for A first

201
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,220
50A is equal to A squared plus B squared instead of writing B squared,

202
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,240
we know B is the same thing as 2A

203
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,890
so let's write 2A squared

204
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:17,480
So we get 50A is equal to A square plus four A squared

205
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:23,950
or we get 50A is equal to 5A squared divide

206
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,400
both sides we can divide both sides by 5A

207
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,520
If we divided this side by 5 we get 10

208
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,270
and if we divide this side by 5 we get A

209
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,970
So A is equal to 10 and we can just substitute

210
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,110
back here so we can figure out B

211
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,570
Two times A is equal to B,

212
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,290
B is equal to two times 10 which is equal to 20

213
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,300
So we now A is 10 B is 20 we just have to go right back

214
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,640
here to figure out the area of the rhombus

215
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,460
The area of the rhombus is equal to

216
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:59,940
2 times A was 10, 2 times 10 times 20

217
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:08,200
This is 20 times 20 this equal to 400 and we're done

218
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:12,580
The area of the rhombus ABCD is 400
