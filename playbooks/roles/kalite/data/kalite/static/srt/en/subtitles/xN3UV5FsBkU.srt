1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,804
What I want to do in this video is

2
00:00:01,804 --> 00:00:04,621
make sure we understand the difference between

3
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:07,639
"comparative advantage" and "absolute advantage".

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,242
What we saw in the last video is that

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,798
Patty had a comparative advantage in plates

6
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:14,095
relative to Charlie because

7
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:17,633
her opportunity cost of producing one plate was

8
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:21,573
lower than Charlie's opportunity cost of producing a plate.

9
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:24,791
Hers was one-third of a cup, his was three cups.

10
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,609
So, that's why it made sense for her to specialize in plates.

11
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,512
Charlie on the other hand had

12
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:31,784
a comparative advantage in cups;

13
00:00:31,784 --> 00:00:33,629
his opportunity cost for producing a cup

14
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:35,381
was only a third of a plate,

15
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:37,640
while Patty's was three plates.

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,335
So that's why he specialized in cups.

17
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:43,584
Now, we can't confuse this with absolute advantage.

18
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:47,171
Absolute advantage in a given product just means that

19
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:49,210
you are more productive

20
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,572
at that thing given the same inputs.

21
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:53,870
And so if I were to just give you this graph,

22
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,969
and you didn't know how many workers Charlie or Patty had

23
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,770
and how many inputs they're using to produce

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,310
either thirty cups in a day or thirty plates in a day,

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,436
you actually could not make any statement

26
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:05,230
about absolute advantage.

27
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,547
But if we assume that in all of these scenarios

28
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:09,102
they have the same number of inputs,

29
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,658
so if we think about plates . . .

30
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:13,987
If we say they each have one employee,

31
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:15,269
maybe it's themselves,

32
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:16,602
and given that one input,

33
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:18,228
or the same number of inputs,

34
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:22,222
Patty is able to produce more plates than Charlie,

35
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:24,102
then it is true that Patty would have

36
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:25,983
an absolute advantage in plates.

37
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:28,079
And if given the same number of inputs,

38
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,112
Charlie is able to produce more cups than Patty,

39
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:34,321
then he would have an absolute advantage in cups.

40
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:36,360
But it is not because of that absolute advantage

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,400
that he is specializing in it.

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
In fact, we don't even know what their inputs were.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,400
It might be that he doesn't have an absolute advantage.

44
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,664
Maybe Charlie needs

45
00:01:44,664 --> 00:01:46,928
a hundred people to produce his thirty cups,

46
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:50,643
while Patty can produce ten cups with one person.

47
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,807
So in that case,

48
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,894
actually Patty would have an absolute advantage,

49
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:56,587
but it just wouldn't be obvious from this right over here.

50
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:58,997
But to make everything clear,

51
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:02,300
I want to do a scenario where

52
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,411
Charlie improved his productivity in some way and

53
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:09,524
he actually has the absolute advantage in both products,

54
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:10,938
and still show that as long as

55
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:13,008
they have different comparative advantages,

56
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:16,080
then it still makes sense for them to specialize.

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,900
So let's do another scenario.

58
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,244
So Charlie has improved dramatically.

59
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:26,309
So let's draw our little graph here.

60
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:30,646
That's our cups axis, this is still our plates axis.

61
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:33,762
Cups and plates . . .

62
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:35,771
and let's just put some more markers here...

63
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:40,427
ten, twenty, thirty and forty.

64
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:47,903
And ten, twenty, thirty and forty, and

65
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:50,736
let's still put Patty, let's assume Patty hasn't changed,

66
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:55,659
so this is her PPF, so that is Patty's PPF, just like that.

67
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,328
But let's say that Charlie has improved dramatically.

68
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:02,300
And so Charlie's PPF looks like this.

69
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,933
So this is Charlie's PPF now looks like this.

70
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,978
So in a given day he can produce

71
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:10,077
- and let's just assume

72
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:11,761
they're using the same number of inputs-

73
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:13,974
so using the same number of inputs in a given day

74
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:15,344
he can produce forty cups

75
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:16,975
when Patty can only produce ten.

76
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:18,972
So he has the absolute advantage in cups.

77
00:03:18,972 --> 00:03:22,426
Or, in the same given day using the same inputs,

78
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:24,246
he could produce forty plates

79
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,534
while Patty can only produce thirty.

80
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:29,022
So now Charlie, all of a sudden,

81
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:33,030
has an absolute advantage in both products.

82
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,947
But we'll see it still makes sense for them to specialize

83
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:37,611
because they have different comparative advantages;

84
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:39,823
they have different opportunity costs.

85
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:41,682
So let's figure this out.

86
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:44,195
So we have all the same numbers for Patty -

87
00:03:44,195 --> 00:03:48,554
actually, let me copy and paste Patty's numbers right here.

88
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:50,319
Actually we have access to her numbers right over here

89
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,991
so I don't have to copy and paste it.

90
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,667
But let's think of Charlie's new numbers now.

91
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,952
So this is the PPF for Charlie.

92
00:03:56,952 --> 00:03:59,237
So this is our new PPF for Charlie.

93
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:01,232
Maybe he did some investment or R&D

94
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:05,551
to get this new, awesome, productive PPF.

95
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:06,920
So he's expanded his PPF.

96
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,704
So what is his opportunity costs?

97
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:16,115
Say he's sitting here - so he's producing 40 cups -

98
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:18,551
what would be his opportunity cost of producing 40 plates?

99
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,779
Well to produce those forty plates,

100
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,067
he would have to give up those forty cups.

101
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:26,995
So his opportunity cost of forty plates

102
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:29,708
is equal to forty cups.

103
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,882
Or you divide both sides by forty:

104
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:37,734
his opportunity costs for one plate is equal to one cup.

105
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:40,311
And this makes math very easy:

106
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:46,330
his opportunity cost for one cup is equal to one plate.

107
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,841
Now given this new reality - so we've already established

108
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,296
Charlie has an absolute advantage in both.

109
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:54,895
Using the same inputs he can do more of either of them.

110
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:55,833
And remember,

111
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,131
when you're talking about absolute advantage

112
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,460
you have to think about the amount of inputs you use.

113
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,333
Who's more productive in that way?

114
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,989
But let's think about comparative advantage.

115
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:05,449
If we think about plates,

116
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,804
who has a lower opportunity cost for producing a plate?

117
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:09,127
Patty hasn't changed.

118
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:11,578
Her opportunity cost for producing a plate

119
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,880
is one-third of a cup.

120
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,629
Charlie's opportunity cost for producing a plate

121
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:20,087
has improved, but it's still worse than Patty's.

122
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,595
He has to spend one cup to make a plate,

123
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:25,892
she only has to give up one-third of a cup to make a plate.

124
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,747
So Patty still has a comparative advantage in plates.

125
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:33,743
And if we look at the opportunity cost in cups,

126
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:37,933
the opportunity cost for Charlie to make 1 cup is 1 plate.

127
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:43,928
So it's actually a little bit worse than it was before,

128
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:46,911
but as we'll see it ends up being a good thing,

129
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:48,462
he's just overall more productive.

130
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:51,901
But his opportunity cost for one cup,

131
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,326
he's giving up one plate now,

132
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:55,567
when before he was producing one third of a plate.

133
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,267
And that's because in the other scenario,

134
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:02,301
he was more one-sided, I guess is one way to say it.

135
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:04,969
But his opportunity cost for producing a cup

136
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:08,324
is still cheaper than Patty's.

137
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:11,017
Her opportunity cost of producing a cup is three plates:

138
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,395
her opportunity cost.

139
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,188
While his is only one plate.

140
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:18,667
So he still has the comparative advantage in cups.

141
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:26,966
So Charlie should still specialize in cups . . .

142
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:29,455
and Patty should still specialize in plates.

143
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,932
And to show that they can still get an outcome that

144
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:35,052
is beyond even Charlie's Production Possibilities Frontier,

145
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,062
let's think about how they could trade.

146
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:38,896
So Charlie's going to specialize in cups;

147
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:42,667
he's going to sit right over there producing forty cups a day.

148
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:46,988
And Patty's going to specialize in plates,

149
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:48,196
and she's going to sit right there

150
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:51,490
- let me use a different color, I don't want to use this color -

151
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,761
she's going to sit right there and produce thirty plates a day.

152
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:57,890
So how could they trade for mutual benefit?

153
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,112
Well any trade that is -

154
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:03,068
assuming that they don't want to have only plates

155
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:04,769
or they don't only want to have cups.

156
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:06,574
Any trade that is cheaper

157
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:09,082
than their opportunity cost will be a good one.

158
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:12,565
So for example, Patty is sitting here producing only plates.

159
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:18,340
Her opportunity cost for a cup is three plates.

160
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,263
So she would be willing to trade

161
00:07:21,263 --> 00:07:23,937
anything less than three plates for a cup,

162
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:25,103
assuming that she wants it.

163
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:27,000
Because, if she had to make the cups herself,

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,333
she would have to give up three plates.

165
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:42,797
So let's say that Patty would be willing to trade one cup

166
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:45,501
sorry, one plate -

167
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:52,205
actually she'd be willing to trade two plates for one cup.

168
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,772
She's be willing to trade that,

169
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:57,722
because if she had to make the cups herself,

170
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,887
she'd have to give up three plates for one cup.

171
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:02,255
So she's willing to trade two plates for one cup.

172
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:04,018
And let's see if Charlie would be willing

173
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,901
to trade two plates for one cup.

174
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,615
So he has all of these cups -

175
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:10,150
how many cups does he have to give away for a plate?

176
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,900
Well he has to give away one cup for a plate.

177
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,162
Now he would have to give away one cup for two plates,

178
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:19,400
or he would have to give up half a cup for a plate.

179
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,795
Either way, this is better than his opportunity cost of

180
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,165
trying to get that incremental plate.

181
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:28,948
So he would be willing to do that too:

182
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:30,466
two plates for one cup.

183
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:32,906
He'd be willing to do one cup for two plates.

184
00:08:32,906 --> 00:08:36,279
And to see how that would improve,

185
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,939
he could have forty cups

186
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:42,229
or he could trade one of them away -

187
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,301
Actually, let's do a scenario

188
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:48,658
where he trades ten of the cups away.

189
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:51,417
So now he only has twenty cups,

190
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:55,561
but for those twenty cups he traded away -

191
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,873
Actually, that's a bad example

192
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:58,610
because Patty won't have enough cups.

193
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,070
So let's say he trades away ten cups.

194
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,708
Let's say he trades away ten cups for twenty plates.

195
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:19,276
So Charlie trades 10 cups for 20 plates.

196
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:22,875
So now he trades ten cups and he gets twenty plates.

197
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,172
So now he'll end up at this scenario over here,

198
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:28,200
which was beyond, which was unattainable,

199
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,769
when he was working by himself,

200
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,396
when he didn't specialize and get gains from trade.

201
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,000
So this is a good scenario for him.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,656
He's able to get outcomes he otherwise

203
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,384
would not have been able to get.

204
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:38,728
He could, depending on how he trades,

205
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:42,774
he could get outcomes, well up to a certain point,

206
00:09:42,774 --> 00:09:46,513
because Patty only has thirty cups.

207
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:51,283
So at best he can take all of Patty's cups.

208
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:53,728
So he can get something along that line over there.

209
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:55,887
But if we look at the same scenario,

210
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,045
Patty traded twenty plates for ten cups:

211
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:00,649
where does that put her?

212
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:03,743
So she traded twenty plates, so she's down ten plates

213
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:07,504
but she got ten cups, so that put her right over here.

214
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:10,880
Once again, beyond her Production Possibilities Frontier,

215
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,464
so this would look like

216
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:15,649
a pretty good situation for Patty as well.
