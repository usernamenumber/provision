1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:06,600
Solve p=2l+2w for l

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,467
So this right here, this is just a formula for

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,635
the perimeter of a rectangle.

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,933
Perimeter is equal to 2 times the length plus

5
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,396
2 times the width.

6
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:17,267
They just want us to solve this equation right here,

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,000
solve for l, so let's do that.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,217
So we have p is equal to 2 times, 2 times l plus 2 times w

9
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:26,889
so we can solve for l.

10
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:29,533
Let's isolate all of the l terms on one side,

11
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:32,554
and the best way we can do that by leaving it here on the right

12
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:34,600
and then getting rid of this 2w, and the best way

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,200
to get rid of this 2w is to subtract is from the right

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,667
and if you're gonna subtract it from the right

15
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,400
you also have to subtract it from the left

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,333
if you want this equality to hold

17
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,467
so you have to also subtract if from the left

18
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:51,067
and so the lefthand side becomes p-2w, p-2w

19
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:56,667
and the right hand side you get, this 2w minus 2w, cancels out

20
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,955
you just have a 2l. And then if you want to solve for l,

21
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:04,575
you just have to divide both sides of the equation by 2!

22
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:07,200
If you just divide both sides of this equation by 2

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,067
and we have isolated our l.

24
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:12,467
We get l is equal to p-2w over 2.

25
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,267
Or if we wanted to write it the other way

26
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:20,155
we could write l is equal to p-2w over 2,

27
00:01:20,155 --> 99:59:59,999
and we are done.
