1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,470
My motivation for doing this
series of three or four videos

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,800
on the fractional reserve
banking system isn't because I

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,280
expect some type of
revolutionary change or I

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,080
think that the world is going
to end if we keep fractional

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,020
reserve banking.

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,730
The whole reason why I want to
do it is just to kind of

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,450
clarify our collective thoughts
on what it is and

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,030
what are its weaknesses.

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,260
I mean, it is the system that
we're in and by the way that

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,680
it's often talked about, it's
kind of viewed as the only

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,360
system because banks around the
world now use the system.

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,640
But we have to realize this is
a system, a structure, that's

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,930
been in a place and its modern
form for on the order of a

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,790
hundred years.

16
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,030
And it isn't the only way to do
banking and this has some

17
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,280
very obvious flaws that
I've gone over in the

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,160
last couple of videos.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,450
And just to kind of highlight
them-- the first one-- and

20
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,490
this is one that would strike
anyone as, at least it would

21
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,080
make them uncomfortable, is just
this disingenuous nature

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,560
of fractional reserve.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,960
   

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,790
Look, you tell someone you can
get your deposits anytime you

25
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,180
want, but the reality is you can
get your deposits anytime

26
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,860
you want as long as no more than
10% of people want their

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,330
money at that same time.

28
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,910
And obviously that by itself
might make you a little

29
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,510
uncomfortable, but that by
itself isn't a whole reason to

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,710
say a system is bad, but the
more severe problem is that

31
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,260
this kind of half-lie leads to
the notion of a bank run.

32
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,800
Everyone has the right to get
all of their money back on--

33
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,580
essentially on a day's notice
or an hour's notice, but the

34
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,680
reality is that everyone can't
get all of their money back on

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,570
an hour's notice so that leads
to an inconsistency and some

36
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,800
people aren't going to get what
they expected and this

37
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,270
leads to a panic, this leads to
a generalized panic-- which

38
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,660
is, of course, a very unstable
situation for your entire

39
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,160
financial system.

40
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,323
You don't want an unstable
financial system.

41
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:56,110
   

42
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,695
So to fix this problem of bank
runs and panics, there have

43
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:01,580
been kind of two fixes here.

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:10,630
You have your lender of last
resort in the Federal reserve

45
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,240
and then probably more
importantly, you have the

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,000
notion of FDIC insurance.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,030
   

48
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,690
And in the last video, I talk
about the idea that FDIC

49
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,410
insurance-- the main negative
I see-- it essentially gives

50
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,710
all banks the same access to
capital because they all say,

51
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,780
hey, look give me your money.

52
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,970
It's insured.

53
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:44,940
So essentially it's a Federal
subsidy for all banks.

54
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,810
By definition the fact that
the FDIC is about to be

55
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,380
insolvent and will have to go
back to Congress to ask for

56
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,110
more money-- that means
that it was

57
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,780
undercharging for the insurance.

58
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,590
So it was subsidizing these
banks and since all of these

59
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,660
banks have the same as the FDIC
insurance and they're

60
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,220
paying a slight different amount
for them, what it leads

61
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:10,730
to is, it encourages risk taking
to essentially get more

62
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,830
profits because all of the
banks' borrowing costs are the

63
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,400
same because when they take on
more risk, people don't say,

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,670
hey, you're a riskier bank.

65
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,070
I need more money from you
to give me your deposits.

66
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,800
They'll say, no, I might be a
riskier bank, but I'm FDIC

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,440
insured just like that
more conservative

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,400
bank down the street.

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,650
So I should be able to-- I'll
just pay you a slightly higher

70
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,290
deposit, just for giving me your
business, but then I can

71
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,060
go take big risks and it's
essentially subsidized by the

72
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,190
Federal government.

73
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,790
But even here, you might say,
hey, look, we've been-- the

74
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,130
U.S. runs on a fractional
reserve banking system and is

75
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,940
clearly kind of the financial or
the economic powerhouse of

76
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,810
the world and those
are both true.

77
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,900
And obviously other modern
countries are all based on on

78
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,890
fractional reserve banking,
so what's wrong with it?

79
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,740
Maybe we have these weaknesses,
but we've

80
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,930
engineered away the problem.

81
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,400
And the main-- I guess the
best way to answer that

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,200
question-- and I really don't
want to-- I guess I want to

83
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,550
make it very clear that when I
started off thinking about

84
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,100
this problem-- because I've
gotten a lot of requests from

85
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,120
people to think about the
problem, I came at it from as

86
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,170
neutral a position
as possible.

87
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,873
I said, I don't want to just
say it's bad and be kind of

88
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:21,029
this reactionary radical person,
but the more you think

89
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,880
about it, the more that you
realize that there is

90
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,470
something that just doesn't
fit right here.

91
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,920
For example, when you talk
about any financial

92
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,020
intermediary, what's
it's purpose?

93
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,640
Let me draw a financial
intermediary right here.

94
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,880
You have savers who like to put
their money in a nice big

95
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,390
vault someplace or maybe they
would like it invested

96
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,990
someplace, but they just don't
know how to invest it or they

97
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,250
don't have-- their money doesn't
have the scale so it

98
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,830
can be invested properly.

99
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,100
And what the financial
intermediary says is, hey

100
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,610
savers, give me all of your
money and I'll hire some

101
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,700
really smart people to invest
your money properly in good

102
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,470
investments.

103
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,550
So you have your savers on this
side and then you have

104
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,650
your projects or your
investments on this side.

105
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,730
   

106
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,850
They might loan out the money--
I'm speaking in very

107
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,450
general terms.

108
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,910
We're talking about a
commercial bank or

109
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,010
lending out the money.

110
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,110
If you're talking about a
venture capital fund, they're

111
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,010
making direct investments in
actual startup companies, but

112
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,060
the idea for any financial
intermediary is the same.

113
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,110
For them to create value,
they're taking the saver's

114
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,600
money and they're putting it
in investments that should

115
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,550
generate some positive yield.

116
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,440
So it'll generate some positive
return if they

117
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,690
invested right.

118
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,600
   

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,640
And they'll give some
fraction of that

120
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,045
return back to the savers.

121
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:43,110
   

122
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,740
And they'll keep some of that
for themselves-- which you

123
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,050
might say is reasonable.

124
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,930
If they're doing this work and
they're allocating this

125
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,933
capital, they're providing a
useful function for society.

126
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:58,710
   

127
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,890
These people deserve to be
wearing their Armani suits and

128
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,720
and have their Rolex watches.

129
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,920
I'll put deserve in
quotation marks.

130
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,825
But you can say they are adding
value to our economy.

131
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:13,060
   

132
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,330
Is fractional reserve banking
a requirement to have

133
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,160
financial intermediaries
like this?

134
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,670
And the simple answer is, no.

135
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,300
You don't need fractional
reserve banking to do this.

136
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,420
In fact, many financial
intermediaries in no way

137
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,830
participate in a fractional
reserve lending system.

138
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,060
I guess the most obvious one
is venture capitalists and

139
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:40,240
regardless of what you think
of them, they are not--

140
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,260
there's not some kind of-- they
tell their investors,

141
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,720
which are the equivalent of the
depositors for a bank--

142
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,580
they tell them, look, you're
going to have your money

143
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,350
locked up for X years.

144
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,110
Or they'll say, look, we'll take
your money as we need it.

145
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,900
Once we take our money, it's
going to be locked up.

146
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,890
That's also true of private
equity funds.

147
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,110
Some people consider venture
capital a subset of private

148
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,520
equity, but private equity more
invests in companies that

149
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,600
already exist. They do that--
and hedge funds, maybe they

150
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,080
don't have a lockup
for the most part.

151
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,900
Some of them might actually tell
you, look, we're going to

152
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,750
lock your money up.

153
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,660
So they're being very upfront
with their investors.

154
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,700
I don't want to defend them, but
the ones that don't have a

155
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,400
lockup, they'll invest in
liquid instruments.

156
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,380
   

157
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,680
Hedge funds-- this is a
big group of people.

158
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,760
Some of them are adding
some value to society.

159
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,500
Some of them aren't.

160
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,850
Probably the great majority of
them are just trading funds

161
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,660
between each other in some type
of a game, but I won't go

162
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,310
into that debate.

163
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,110
I won't try to defend all of the
hedge fund world, but that

164
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,570
the notion is that to be a
financial intermediary, you're

165
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,500
not dependent on fractional
reserve banking-- even if you

166
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,220
wanted to run a commercial
bank.

167
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,300
I could take deposits.

168
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,080
So let's say you come to me.

169
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,570
Let's say a bunch of
people come to me.

170
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,570
Let's say this is your
deposit right here.

171
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,890
This is your money.

172
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,560
Let's say you have
$100 right here.

173
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,680
I could tell you, look, if you
want money on demand, I'm not

174
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,210
going to pay you any
interest on that.

175
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,870
For the service of you having
access to it on your ATM and

176
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,170
for it to be secure and all of
that, I'm actually going to

177
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,460
maybe charge you a little bit
of money for on demand money

178
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,250
and everything-- and if you want
interest on your money,

179
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,429
you have to give me your money
for a certain period of time.

180
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:41,309
So what you do is-- so you've
given me your $100-- and you

181
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,340
say, I would like to get some
interest on my money.

182
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,750
I'm a sophisticated investor.

183
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,070
I'd like to participate in the
miracles of capitalism.

184
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,710
So let me tell you what.

185
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,300
Out of this $100, I only need
$10 on a daily basis to run my

186
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,020
business or my household so
I'm going to make this a

187
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,140
demand account.

188
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,210
So that would be just a checking
account-- and for

189
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,070
that I'll get no interest.
I might even

190
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,150
have to pay some money.

191
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:13,770
Now the other part-- the longer
you're willing to lock

192
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,750
up your money for, I'm
going to give you

193
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,000
more interest in it.

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,260
   

195
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,250
So this is $10 right here.

196
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,540
Let'sw say, well, I might need
some of my money in a year.

197
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,340
So let me put the rest of
it in for one year.

198
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,940
We'll call that a one year
CD, which exists already.

199
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,930
For this, the bank will pay
you 2% or maybe 3%.

200
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,000
And then you said, the rest of
the money-- this is long term

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,480
retirement money and I'll put it
in a 10 year CD and because

202
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,050
I've locked it up longer, I'm
going to get more interest.

203
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,390
Maybe I'll get 5% for that.

204
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,250
And now me, the commercial bank
that's not participating

205
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,380
in fractional reserve banking,
can say, look, this guy has

206
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,330
this $10 that he wants access to
whenever and I'm not paying

207
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,090
any interest on that.

208
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,990
I'm just allowing him to use my
financial infrastructure so

209
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,950
I'm just going to
put that aside.

210
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,880
I'm just going to put it in my
vaults and he can access that

211
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,710
from his ATM or wherever, but
this money out here, I can

212
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,730
then lend this out.

213
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,100
So if someone comes to me and
say, hey Sal-- or Sal Bank-- I

214
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,380
have this project and I want to
be able to borrow-- let's

215
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,840
say that this right
here is $45.

216
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,270
I need to borrow $45
for eight years.

217
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,320
You say, sure.

218
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,900
I don't have to give this
guy his money back until

219
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,815
10 years from now.

220
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:36,910
So what you do is you take that
$45 and you loan it out--

221
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,770
which is fine because you know
it's going to be back.

222
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,300
As long as you're loaning it
out properly, it should be

223
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,210
back in time to pay this guy.

224
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,440
And this guy knows that you're
loaning out this money so he

225
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,610
knows that there's some risk
inherentness and he should do

226
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,550
his homework before he buys
this 10 year CD from you.

227
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,520
He should see where you're
loaning your money and how

228
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,100
risky it is and if it's really
risky, he should want more

229
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,630
than 5%-- he should focus on the
interest rate or he should

230
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,960
just not give you his money.

231
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,140
So the natural supply and
demand and the natural

232
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,860
feedback forces of capitalism
would come into play.

233
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,580
So you could completely run a
financial system with banks

234
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,430
and all sorts of financial
intermediaries without

235
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,990
fractional reserve banking.

236
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,060
So now the next question
is, OK.

237
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,800
You can do without factional
reserve banking, but what's

238
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,790
really wrong about
what fractional

239
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,800
reserve banking is enabling?

240
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,000
And for that I'll have
to review the

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,140
yield curve for you.

242
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,340
So the yield curve--
it's nothing fancy.

243
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,390
It's really just a graph showing
how much interest you

244
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,260
pay for different durations or
how much interest you get.

245
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,220
So let's say this is
the yield curve.

246
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,470
Let's say right here I
have overnight money.

247
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,120
So let's say this is if you
give a loan for one day.

248
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,810
This is if you give a
loan for one year.

249
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,060
And this is-- let's say you
gave a loan for 10 years.

250
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,590
And there could be all sorts
of-- a duration is just how

251
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,430
long you're giving
the loan out for.

252
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,590
Now, if you're lending money to
the government, which you

253
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,590
view as safe-- maybe the safest
person to lend money

254
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,750
to, then you can say, look, the
government for one day--

255
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,080
I'm willing to lend money
to them for 1%.

256
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,660
For one year-- I'm locking it
up-- maybe 2% and then for 10

257
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,890
years, I'm willing to lend
it to them for 5%.

258
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,520
The yield curve will look
something like this.

259
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,160
   

260
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,350
Doesn't always go upward sloping
like that, but it

261
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,360
tends to go upwards
sloping like that.

262
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,395
So that's the yield curve and
this might be for treasuries.

263
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:38,560
   

264
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,500
So one day, 1%, one year,
maybe-- the way I drew it--

265
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,800
maybe this is 3%, maybe for 10
years, this would be 5%.

266
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,050
This isn't the current
yield curve, but

267
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,910
you you get the idea.

268
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,550
This would just be for

269
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,950
treasuries, the safest borrower.

270
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,130
Now for investment grade
companies-- if I'm trying to

271
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,710
lend money to them, maybe to a
GE or someone like that-- or a

272
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,760
Berkshire Hathaway, I'd want
some premium over the

273
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,120
treasuries because they're
not as safe as the U.S.

274
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,190
government, but it's going to
have a curve similar to that.

275
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,330
Maybe it looks like
that, right?

276
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,330
And this premium right here is
essentially the amount of more

277
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,890
interest you'd want
from these still

278
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,120
relatively safe companies.

279
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,700
relative to treasuries, but
you still have this upward

280
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,280
sloping as you go up.

281
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,930
And then, finally, you might
have your really risky guys--

282
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,063
and every company will have its
own yield curve based on

283
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:26,790
its borrowing costs, but you
might group a bunch of risky

284
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,530
guys together and say, look,
the risky guys-- the yield

285
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,570
curve looks like that.

286
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,450
If there's some guy who's
looking to start some biotech

287
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,960
firm and he wants to borrow
money from them, I'm going to

288
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,080
charge a much higher premium
over treasuries because I

289
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,610
don't even know if he's going
to be around in five years.

290
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,100
So this is just the yield curve
and the whole reason why

291
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,730
I drew this is to show how
fractional reserve banking

292
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,390
allows banks to essentially take
advantage of the yield

293
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,550
curve without really adding
any true value to society.

294
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,270
This notion of a financial
intermediary does

295
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,670
add value to society.

296
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,020
When you have fractional reserve
banking, what you're

297
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:09,590
allowing banks to do is to
take deposits and this--

298
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,330
fractional reserve banking isn't
the only place where

299
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:11,870
this happens.

300
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,360
This happens a lot of places,
but they take deposits-- and

301
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,760
they're demand deposits,
right?

302
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,860
These are checking deposits,
which are essentially loans

303
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,060
from their depositors and they
are essentially overnight

304
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,860
loans, right?

305
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,110
These are on demand loans.

306
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,010
   

307
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,680
They're essentially-- when you
give your money to a bank in a

308
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,520
checking deposit, that's
essentially every hour that

309
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,680
you don't go and take your
money back, they're

310
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,270
essentially just renewing
that loan.

311
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,690
It's kind of the shortest
possible duration loan.

312
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,700
And every day you don't do it,
it's just kind of a renewal of

313
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,840
that loan, right?

314
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,460
You could imagine a
world where every

315
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,530
year you renew a loan.

316
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,310
Every year that you don't
withdraw it, you just keep

317
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:51,890
rolling it over.

318
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,320
When you do on demand, it's
every second that you don't

319
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,120
withdraw it, you're
renewing it.

320
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,660
So they're able to borrow money
at this part of the

321
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,890
yield curve and they can do it
very safely, pay very little

322
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,270
interest, because people--
even though they might be

323
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,550
doing risky activities.

324
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,830
Maybe they're lending to
people like this guy.

325
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,340
Because of the FDIC insurance,
people are lending to them

326
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,720
like they're the government
because they're going to get

327
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,980
paid back if the government
can pay them back.

328
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,930
So it really lowers their
borrowing costs, so they

329
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,830
borrow down here and what it
does is, it allows them to

330
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,430
lend money over longer
durations.

331
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,270
So this could be
a 10 year loan.

332
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,680
So the money doesn't get paid
back, only interest does in

333
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,800
the interirm, but the
money doesn't get

334
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,820
paid back for 10 years.

335
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,210
Maybe this right here
is a five year loan.

336
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,140
And they can do it to
riskier investments.

337
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,090
I mean, one, they could just
borrow money here, which is

338
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,510
what they're paying the
depositors-- like 1%-- and

339
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,750
then they could just invest it
if they wanted to and if the

340
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,260
yield curve looked like this,
they could invest it in

341
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,200
treasuries or maybe investment
grade bonds, essentially

342
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,190
lending to the Berkshire
Hathaways of the world-- and

343
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,700
getting a lot more interest.
And what they did here-- it

344
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,890
doesn't take any special
genius to do this.

345
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,630
Everyone knows that you'll get
higher interest here than over

346
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,390
here, but the only reason why
they can do it this way is

347
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,560
because they have this implicit
guarantee-- actually

348
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,300
it's an explicit guarantee--
from the FDIC.

349
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,010
So this FDIC insurance
is what allows people

350
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,380
to lend them money.

351
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,330
People are only willing to part
with their money at this

352
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,970
point of the yield curve because
of the FDIC insurance.

353
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,420
And then the bank can then go
and invest at this point of

354
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,410
the yield curve and then make
the difference on the spread.

355
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,500
They'll get 5% on the money
and then only pay 1%.

356
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,720
And where's the value here?

357
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,470
Because I could do this,
but I'm not an

358
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,820
FDIC insured entity.

359
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,680
Clearly these people would love
to get 5% on their money,

360
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,690
get that money that the bank's
getting, but they don't get

361
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,400
that insurance from the FDIC so
it doesn't allow them to.

362
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,780
So essentially what fractional
reserve banking and the

363
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,690
insurance that's come about
to make fractional reserve

364
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,930
lending viable-- all it does
is it allows banks to

365
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,880
arbitrage the yield curve-- to
borrow money at the short end

366
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,440
and lend it out in the long end,
and make up the spread.

367
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,250
And this is kind of a, one, that
doesn't add any value.

368
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,200
Anyone can do this.

369
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,020
You don't need a a fancy
MBA to figure this out.

370
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,704
This doesn't add any true
value to society.

371
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,099
It actually just flattens out
the yield curve a little bit,

372
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,490
but we can debate about
the value of that.

373
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,690
But I want to kind of make a
bigger point here-- is that

374
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,710
obviously a lot of people in the
banking system are kind of

375
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:40,000
the champions of capitalism
and unless they're being

376
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,680
bailed out, they're the first
ones to be against any form of

377
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,400
government intervention or
government safety net.

378
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,370
But their whole industry is
predicated on a government

379
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,460
safety net.

380
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,240
This notion of a financial
intermediary that I outlined

381
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,430
here and venture capitalists
and private equity-- they

382
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,600
still operate on this
model right here.

383
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,590
They are in no way dependent
on the Federal government.

384
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,990
I mean, some of them might end
up being indirectly, but they

385
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,620
don't need a whole elaborate
system of FDIC insurance and

386
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,830
the Federal and the discount
window and all of these

387
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,720
interventions that the Federal
government does.

388
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,520
They don't need that to operate
efficiently-- or to

389
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,750
operate in general.

390
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,380
And even this banking system
here, where you just had

391
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,390
people get CDs instead of having
this kind of halfway

392
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,760
truth of fractional reserve
lending-- this could

393
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,610
completely operate without any
government intervention.

394
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,830
This system, on the other
hand, fractional reserve

395
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,660
lending-- it could not exist
without government

396
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,910
intervention.

397
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,660
   

398
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,330
And so you have to you have to
debate-- or I guess think in

399
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,640
your mind-- some system like
fractional reserve banking

400
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,650
that is dependent on the
government-- is this even

401
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,900
capitalism?

402
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,460
   

403
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,160
I mean, where is the
competition here?

404
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,760
Where is the innovation here?

405
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,610
If you're big enough, you get
your FDIC insurance and you

406
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,760
just keep arbitraging the yield
curve and you make money

407
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,610
to buy your Rolex and your fancy
trips in your private

408
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,120
jets, but there's no
innovation here.

409
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,270
You're just big and you were one
of the lucky ones to get a

410
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,030
bank charter with the FDIC and
be insured by them-- there's

411
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,770
no innovation here.

412
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,980
Where's the competition?

413
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,690
If anything, the person who
takes the most risk and who

414
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,630
does the most silly things is
going to be able to generate

415
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,300
the highest yield and they have
the subsidized insurance

416
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,940
from the Federal government and
so they're going to be the

417
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,750
most successful.

418
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,670
It's all dependent
on government.

419
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,975
It's all dependent
on a subsidy.

420
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:37,910
   

421
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,180
And in the end, this money that
these people are making

422
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,440
by arbitraging this, this is
coming from a subsidy from the

423
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,970
Federal government and it's
coming from the taxpayer.

424
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,630
So you essentially have the
taxpayers subsidizing this

425
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,960
world where people can just
arbitrage this yield curve--

426
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,130
not take on real risk and make
real investments and

427
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,130
efficiently allocate capital,
just arbitraging the yield

428
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,360
curve with cheap insurance-- and
you're essentially making

429
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,510
a small percentage of the
population-- being able to

430
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,690
extract, essentially, rents or
or some type of subsidy from

431
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,470
the rest of the population.

432
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,440
And obviously this isn't the
part of our economic system

433
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,100
that is the most in need.

434
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,240
So I'm not saying this
to kind of impugn

435
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,250
the financial system.

436
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,170
I think for the most part,
people here, they're taking on

437
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,910
risk and they're getting return
and the savers here

438
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,360
know what they're getting
into, but there's no

439
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,620
government intervention here.

440
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,050
There's no implicit government
subsidy.

441
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,240
This whole thing is based
on a government subsidy.

442
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,460
Fractional reserve banking could
not exist without the

443
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,040
FDIC and the FDIC could not
exist without the implicit

444
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,070
backing that the Congress would
make them solvent if

445
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,040
they ever ran out of money, like
is the case right now.

446
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,710
Anyway, hopefully this informs
your view a little bit more.

447
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,530
I don't want to be some kind
of crazy reactionary.

448
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,230
I'm resigned to the fact that
fractional reserve banking

449
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,430
isn't going to go away, but it
does bother me a little bit

450
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,900
because it is completely
dependent on government

451
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,380
intervention.

452
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,040
As you see right now over the
past year, you have this whole

453
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,370
financial system where we're
piling more and more money

454
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,850
into the very same entities that
took on the most risk--

455
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,420
and essentially they have
us at gunpoint.

456
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,960
They're like, you better pour
more money into us or else

457
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,440
we're going to blow up because
of the risk I took, but I'm

458
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,890
going to take you
down with me.

459
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,000
