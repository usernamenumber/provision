1
00:00:02,406 --> 00:00:05,550
So here's a picture of mom and a little fetus

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,315
and at this point when the fetus is still attached by

3
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:11,764
the umbilical cord everything that goes into the fetus

4
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:13,677
is really originating from mom. She controls all

5
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:17,813
the nutrients and all the oxygen that goes into that baby.

6
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:24,276
And with oxygen in mind, there are a couple of interesting ways that the baby, in this case this little

7
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:30,548
fetus on the right, has come up with to be able to get as much oxygen as possible from mom.

8
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:34,509
because remember the fetus is trying to grow and it wants to make sure that all of it's tissues that are

9
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:38,677
growing and developing have enough oxygen. So there are a couple of tricks.

10
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:46,579
And the first trick, let me actually just draw it out for you, is simply looking at a single vial of blood.

11
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:52,009
If we look at a single vial of blood from mom, and compare it to a vial of blood from baby.

12
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,247
So let me try to draw the vials about the same height and width.

13
00:00:56,247 --> 00:01:04,778
These are the two vials. If I was to take now, let's say a little bit of mom's blood and spin it down, let's say in this little tube.

14
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:09,911
And then do the exact same thing with the baby's blood, take some of baby's blood and spin it down.

15
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:17,353
That spun blood, once it's spun down, would actually separate out into little parts, right?

16
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:19,382
You'd have three different layers.

17
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:26,265
And this first layer would be something like this. This is called the plasma.

18
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:30,415
The next layer right below it, remember there's a little layer of white blood cells and platelets.

19
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:35,645
And below that, right here, is a layer of red blood cells.

20
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:38,011
Remember red blood cells are the ones that contain the hemoglobin.

21
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:40,976
They're the ones that are going to move oxygen around.

22
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:47,278
And in mom, the percent that this red layer takes up is about 35%.

23
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:59,413
Meaning this whole thing would be 100%, and of that just over 1/3, or 35% exactly, is that bottom red layer.

24
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:01,234
That's the red blood cell layer.

25
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:03,646
So we would call this the hematocrit.

26
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:08,113
So this is mom's hematocrit. And this is a very typical number for a pregnant woman.

27
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:14,516
It varies depending on whether you're a man or a woman, and what age you are.

28
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:18,680
But for a pregnant woman, 35% is a pretty reasonable number.

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,646
Now going over here to the baby side.

30
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:24,114
Let's draw in what baby's blood probably looks like.

31
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:27,644
The baby has a lot less of the blood taken up by plasma

32
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:31,315
so that layer is going to be smaller. And then the next layer, the white blood cell layer,

33
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:34,941
that's a very small layer anyway so that's not going to change much.

34
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:39,010
And the final layer, the third layer, is the red blood cell layer.

35
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,047
This layer takes up about 55%.

36
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:49,210
So I hope I didn't misdraw that, but that's about 55%.

37
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,377
So here the hematocrit is much higher, and what does that mean?

38
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:58,075
If the hematocrit is higher in the baby, about 55% percent, then that means that the baby actually has

39
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:05,012
more red blood cells going around, in a given amount of volume of blood, and those red blood cells

40
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:09,610
can then take up more oxygen because that's really the part of blood we care about when it comes

41
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,344
to moving oxygen around.

42
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:15,012
So that's one trick, in terms of tricks, for getting more oxygen.

43
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:25,972
Simply having more of the red blood cells in a given volume of blood. Kind of the amount of red blood cells is going to go up in the fetus

44
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,909
and that's kind of one trick. When I say trick that's what I mean.

45
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,812
So what's another trick, or strategy, that the baby or the fetus can come up with

46
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,941
to get more oxygen from mom?

47
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:41,649
Well if we think of the amount, you can also think of the type.

48
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:45,886
And what I mean by that is: thinking specifically about the type of hemoglobin.

49
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:50,799
So we know that the adult hemoglobin has four units to it.

50
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,713
So let me draw out the adult hemoglobin over here on the left.

51
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:56,983
Let me first write out adult hemoglobin.

52
00:03:56,983 --> 00:04:00,108
So "Hb" for hemoglobin and "A" for adult.

53
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:03,976
I'll write adult here so we keep track of which is which.

54
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:09,148
And there isn't one type of adult hemoglobin. There is a main one, which is the one I am going to draw.

55
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,848
But there're few different types of little (...)

56
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:15,524
The main one, as I said, is this one,

57
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:20,176
has a couple of alpha units, this is just a protein peptide,

58
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:24,189
that is in some conformation we call it alpha,

59
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:25,776
and a couple of beta units,

60
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:29,415
and these are slightly different looking than the alpha ones

61
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:32,885
and there's a 2 to 2 ratio, so which hemoglobin has four units

62
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:37,143
and here you can see that you have two of each type.

63
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:41,144
Now, on the fetus side you actually have something a little different

64
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:45,433
so we also have over here hemoglobin, Hb,

65
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:47,984
this time F, for fetus,

66
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:52,936
and just as before the fetus has a few different type of hemoglobin,

67
00:04:52,936 --> 00:05:00,417
but the main one is HbF, and it's actually this one also shares that alpha units

68
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:04,574
and has two of them just as before,

69
00:05:04,574 --> 00:05:09,181
but instead of beta unit, this one has what we call it gamma unit,

70
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:11,646
this is the Greek letter for gamma,

71
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:14,104
now oxygen is gonna bind and both of hemoglobin,

72
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:17,711
both the adult and the fetus, can bind four oxygens,

73
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,350
let me just draw in four oxygens here, you got the idea.

74
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,690
now inside of red blood cells there's a little molecule and

75
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,437
actually I just gonna sketch it out for you,

76
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:31,606
this molecule has three carbons, let me just number the carbon one two three,

77
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:35,743
and coming off of the two carbon, this one right here,

78
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:41,244
is an oxygen, and coming off of that oxygen is a phosphate.

79
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:44,863
Remember that phosphate has typically five bonds,

80
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:48,252
so I just gonna show you what this little molecule looks like,

81
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:52,883
in fact, the exact same thing is happening of the three carbons.

82
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:57,885
so this molecule that exist inside of the red blood cells, it looks like this,

83
00:05:57,885 --> 00:06:04,576
has a couple of phosphates, and coming off this number one is something like this,

84
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:07,777
so this is the little molecule, and it's called --

85
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:11,610
and you can --maybe when you can take a stab and try to guess what it's called--

86
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,471
it's called 2,3 --I'm reffering to this 2 and this 3--

87
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:21,496
Di --because it got two phospho--

88
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:26,046
so, Di-phospho- glycerate.

89
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:30,990
so that's Di-phospho, and then glycerate just refers to this part right here,

90
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,479
this is kind of the part that is being refered to when we say gycerate,

91
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,181
so Diphosphoglycerate.

92
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:43,346
and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, we just fix that,

93
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:47,876
is actually sometimes shortened down to 2,3-DPG

94
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:49,244
'cause people don't like to say the whole thing,

95
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:53,221
so they'll say 2,3-DPG, and that's what this molecule is.

96
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:57,849
so this molecule 2,3-DPG, is inside red blood cells,

97
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:02,635
and it actually helps the red blood cell get rid of oxygen,

98
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:06,077
the way it does that is, actually is a tiny little molecule I'll draw it.

99
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:10,054
now that you know what the whole sturcture looks like, I'll draw --it's a yellow dot,

100
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:14,471
this is the same thing, I just make the equal sign, the equal of same thing,

101
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:19,095
This little molecule will go and bind in the middle here,

102
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:21,611
and it likes to bind to the beta subunits,

103
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:26,559
actually the beta subunits are shaped so that this thing can bind very easily.

104
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:31,310
and it nit, it sits kind of nicely between all four subunits, the betas and the alphas,

105
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,276
and what it does is that actually makes the conformation or

106
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:40,446
'the shape of the molecular' change, so these little oxygens want to move off.

107
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:46,413
So basically what it does is that it makes it easier for the oxygen to be released from the hemoglobin.

108
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:50,052
Now when this molecule comes around this side, on the fetus side it tries to bond,

109
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:57,677
guess what happens, well this gamma subunits basically say, go away! go away!

110
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:01,301
They don't want to bind to this 2,3-DPG.

111
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:03,745
They don't have the right shape for it.

112
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:07,102
And so they basically want this little molecule to get lost.

113
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:12,102
And so this molecule doesn't bind as easily to hemoglobin F.

114
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:17,512
and this result those molecules of hemoglobin don't get rid of oxygen

115
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:20,811
nearly as easily as hemoglobin A does.

116
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:24,445
Now why would we even have a molecule like 2,3-DPG around?

117
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:26,079
What it would be doing there?

118
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,700
well, interestingly, the level of 2,3-DPG actually go up

119
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,911
in situations where you actually have more niver oxygen,

120
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:40,200
so let's say chronically you're without oxygen.

121
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,475
So the situation like that be, when you're chronically without oxygen.

122
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:47,810
Well, let's say you live --I don't know what the-- the top of the Himalayan Mountains.

123
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,844
And you know, the altitude is so high, if you got a high alitude,

124
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:56,140
that the air itself doesn't have a lot of oxygen in it.

125
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,551
and that situation your tissues are kind of always, or chronically, without oxygen.

126
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:05,034
Now another situation could be, let's say you have lung disease.

127
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:09,611
Let's say you have lung problem or lung disease, and it's a chronic lung disease,

128
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:13,672
where you're always having difficulty, you know, getting oxygen to the blood.

129
00:09:13,672 --> 00:09:16,839
Well again, the tissues are really lacking of the oxygen,

130
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,975
so there the red blood cells would make a lot of the 2,3-DPG.

131
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:24,280
Or a final situation, maybe you're anemic,

132
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,476
maybe you don't have a lot of red blood cells circulating around the body,

133
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:31,642
and for anemic, the tissues are not getting as much oxygen

134
00:09:31,642 --> 00:09:33,672
as they wish they would.

135
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:37,213
And again, in this situation you might have more 2,3-DPG.

136
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:43,475
So 2,3-DPG, its basic job is to try-- to make sure that oxygen is left off of the hemoglobin,

137
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:46,407
so that if you have tissue that really needs that oxygen,

138
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:50,379
it's more easy to-- to actually deliver the oxygen to that tissue.

139
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:52,576
So, going back to the trick for the fetus,

140
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:56,311
you can see the fetus has different type of hemoglobin from the adult.

141
00:09:56,311 --> 00:10:01,142
So, let me draw a little curve and you'll see what this different incept doing.

142
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,043
so let me sketch out a curve.

143
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:05,179
let's just draw out a little graph here.

144
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:08,412
this'll be the partial pressure of oxygen on this axis,

145
00:10:08,412 --> 00:10:12,110
and this'll be O2 or oxygen saturation,

146
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,658
looking at how many of those spots on hemoglobin are taken up.

147
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:18,312
so this'll be going up that way.

148
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:22,577
let's start out with mom's hemoglobin, or adult hemoglobin,

149
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:25,845
you know, has kind of S-shape, because of the cooperativity

150
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:27,743
that we've talked about at the past.

151
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:32,142
so this'll be hemoglobin adult type, or hemoglobin A.

152
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:37,410
now, if I have, let's say, really high level of 2,3-DPG,

153
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,711
let me just draw out what that would look like,

154
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:42,943
so let's say we have a situation where that high level of 2,3-DPG,

155
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,946
and it could be because of one these reasons,

156
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:49,042
maybe live on a high mountain, or you've chronic lung disease,

157
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:52,393
or you're always anemic, if you had one of these situations,

158
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:56,212
and your 2,3-DPG level were really high, or higher than usual,

159
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:59,111
then what will happen to your curve, it was actually--

160
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:04,179
it would look like this, the curve for oxygen binding or oxygen saturation

161
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:07,442
basically kind of shifts over to the right.

162
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:14,076
So we call this a right shift, because the whole thing looks like it has just kind of moved over a little bit.

163
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:18,477
And now, at any point --let's say I just choose a random point over here,

164
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,679
and I choose the same point here.

165
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,109
So this is the same partial pressure of oxygen, right?

166
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:25,013
which is somewhere down here.

167
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:30,060
Now for the same partial pressure of oxygen, my curve actually went down,

168
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:36,310
meaning I have less oxygen bound to hemoglobin in the presence of molecule.

169
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,778
and that makes sense with what we just said, because the molecule helps kick off the oxygen.

170
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:43,414
Now what if you had an opposite situation,

171
00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:46,276
what if I actually drew out a curve like this,

172
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:52,776
and this could be --let's say, a situation where you have a low levels of 2,3-DPG.

173
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:58,211
Well, with low level of 2,3-DPG, you can see that this would make sense

174
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:02,345
because now of all sudden, that molecules are not around, it's not doing anything

175
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:07,977
to help get the oxygen off, so of course oxygen is gonna stay down to hemoglobin,

176
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:14,845
and at the same partial pressure of oxygen, more of the hemoglobin would be bound by oxygen.

177
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:18,377
Now, think back to the idea of fetal hemoglobin,

178
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:22,749
remember, fetal hemoglobin we said has this gamma unit,

179
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:27,244
and the gamma doesn't like 2,3-DPG, it doesn't like to bind to it,

180
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:29,444
and so it says, get lost! go away!

181
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:33,897
and so in a sense the way I drawn it for a low level of 2,3-DPG,

182
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:36,609
I could --just this --well, erase that,

183
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:39,908
and say, well, this is the situation in the fetus.

184
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:43,409
The fetal hemoglobin is basically this curve, right?

185
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:47,046
This is kind of the hemoglobin F curve.

186
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,672
If you just look at the curve, it looks like it's left-shifted.

187
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:52,975
But the-- but the real concept behind it,

188
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:57,173
it's that it's because those hemoglobin molecules don't like to bind to 2,3-DPG,

189
00:12:57,173 --> 00:13:02,777
and so of course it's gonna go in the opposite direction of the blue curve.

190
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:05,777
So looking at these two curves now, the white one and the red one,

191
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:09,443
the white one represents mom, the red one represents baby,

192
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:14,840
and the white one, if you wanna look at the point where about half of the

193
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,172
hemoglobin molecules are bound to oxygen, that might be right about there,

194
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:22,377
meaning this is about half way up to here,

195
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:25,776
this is actually 50% of the way there.

196
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:30,946
So 50% of the hemoglobin molecules are bound to oxygen,

197
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:34,089
when the pressure of oxygen --the partial pressure of oxygen--

198
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:42,009
is about 27. And for the fetus, the same kind of point of reaching half way saturation

199
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:47,257
is reached when the partial pressure is about 20.

200
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:50,839
So it's interesting for a lower partial pressure of oxygen,

201
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,047
the baby or the fetus is able to accomplish the same thing we adult can accomplish

202
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:59,211
at only higher amount of oxygen in the environment or in the blood.

203
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:03,142
And this values are called p50, so if you see p50

204
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:08,044
--if you see that term, you can remember now that the hemoglobin F p50

205
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:11,590
is lower than the hemoglobin A p50.

206
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:16,547
and that is --again, the actual number is 20 versus 27, or there about.

207
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:22,925
so these are the two tricks than one, is the-- you know, the amount of hemoglobin

208
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:24,344
or red blood cells in the fetus,

209
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:31,010
and the other is the type and hemoglobin F binds oxygen much more tightly and has a lower p50

210
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,000
~o0o~
