1
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:03,219
In this video, we're going to look at how to draw a dot structure,

2
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:04,881
which has a simple organic molecule,

3
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:06,197
which has single bonds.

4
00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:08,884
So, if I look at the molecular formula,

5
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,244
CH4, which is methane.

6
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,046
I want to draw a dot structure for the methane molecule.

7
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:16,688
I will go over here to my organic periodic table,

8
00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:18,380
and find carbon,

9
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:20,857
and I can see carbon is in Group 4.

10
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:23,517
Therefore, carbon will have four valence electrons.

11
00:00:23,517 --> 00:00:27,176
So, I can draw a carbon with its four valence electrons
around it like that.

12
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:29,104
Remember from general chemistry,

13
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:30,886
valence electrons are the electrons

14
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:32,705
on the outer-most energy level.

15
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:35,003
So, carbon has four valence electrons

16
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:36,936
in its outer-most energy level.

17
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,496
Next, I have to think about hydrogen,

18
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:42,492
and hydrogen is in Group 1 on the Periodic Table.

19
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:45,006
Therefore, hydrogen will have one valence electron.

20
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:47,284
So, I can go ahead and put the hydrogen in there

21
00:00:47,284 --> 00:00:49,075
with one valence electron.

22
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:51,150
I know I have to do that three more times.

23
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:53,581
So, I keep putting the hydrogens

24
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:55,156
each with one valence electron.

25
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:56,747
So, the total of four hydrogens.

26
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:58,705
And now, I can start connecting my dots.

27
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,502
I know that two valence electrons equal to one single covalent bond.

28
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:04,466
So, there is a single covalent bond.

29
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:06,225
There is a single covalent bond.

30
00:01:06,225 --> 00:01:08,251
And then, I have two more here.

31
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:11,338
So, this is my complete dot structure for methane.

32
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:14,131
Now, I can see the carbon is surrounded by

33
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,931
eight electrons here.

34
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:17,716
So, we can go ahead and highlight those.

35
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:19,568
So, if I count on the electrons around the carbons,

36
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:22,206
it would be two, four,

37
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:24,619
six and eight like that.

38
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,446
And eight electrons around the carbon

39
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,250
makes carbon very stable.

40
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,389
And if we look at the Periodic Table,

41
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:31,531
we can see why.

42
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:34,526
So, if i look at the second period,

43
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,559
I can see that

44
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,131
the valence electron of the carbon

45
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,282
would be one,

46
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:40,112
two,

47
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:41,770
three and four,

48
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:43,985
and to get eight electrons,

49
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:47,304
we will go to five, six, seven, eight.

50
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:49,556
so, if carbon is surrounded by eight electrons,

51
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:52,702
it's likely to have the electron configuration of noble gas,

52
00:01:52,702 --> 00:01:57,714
which makes it very stable, because all the orbitals in the energy level on are full.

53
00:01:57,714 --> 00:02:02,887
so, octetable electrons is the maximum number of electrons for the carbon.

54
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:07,122
if we look at the hydrogen, we can see each hydrogen is surrounded by two electrons.

55
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:10,671
so if i find the hydrogen here, the hydrogen is in the first energy level,

56
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:13,287
so here is one electron, and here is two electrons

57
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:17,219
so on the first energy level, there is only an s-orbital, and so

58
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,224
that orbital holds maximum two electrons and we get to the electron

59
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,968
configuration of the noble gas,

60
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:27,834
and so hydrogen is stable with having only two electrons around it.

61
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,723
let's look at another dot structure,

62
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:33,668
and let's do one tha has a nitrogen in it.

63
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:39,723
so if i look at the molecular formula, CH3-NH2,

64
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:42,652
i'm going to once again start with the carbon in the center,

65
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:45,630
with its four valence electrons around it like that.

66
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,416
and i know that three hydrogens on the carbon

67
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,486
so i can go ahead and put three hydrogens

68
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:54,269
each hydrogen has one valence electron, like that.

69
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:56,868
and on the right side, i'm going to think about the nitrogen.

70
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:59,147
i need to find the nitrogen in my periodic table.

71
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:02,438
nitrogen is in Group 5.

72
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:04,998
Therefore, nitrogen has five valence electrons.

73
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:12,622
so i can represent the electron as one, two, three, four and five, like that.

74
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:16,287
and i still have two hydrogens to worry about, right?

75
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:17,933
so i still have two hydrogens here.

76
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:20,855
and i can see the place for them on the nitrogen.

77
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:23,116
so i can go ahead and put a hydrogen in here,

78
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:25,498
and a hydrogen in here,

79
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,121
and connect the dots,

80
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:28,835
and i have my dot structure.

81
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:32,277
and i can also check my octet rule,

82
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,687
so carbon has an octet,

83
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,937
and nitrogen has an actet as well,

84
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:38,900
so let's go ahead and verify that.

85
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,736
so there is two electrons here,

86
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:45,113
four, six, and eight.

87
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:47,525
so nitrogen is in the second period,

88
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:52,288
so nitrogen is also going to follow the octet rule, when you draw dot structures.

89
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:54,130
let's do one more.

90
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,616
oxygen, next.

91
00:03:55,616 --> 00:04:00,223
so if i want to draw a dot structure, for methanol,

92
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:05,442
methanol is CH3OH.

93
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:09,311
so once again, i'll start carbon, with four valence electrons,

94
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:13,573
and i have three hydrogens, each one with one valence electron like that

95
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:16,909
so i can go ahead and put those three hydrogens

96
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:18,279
next i have oxygen

97
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,858
so i need to find the oxygen in my organic periodic table

98
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,807
and i can see that oxygen is in group 6 right here

99
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,518
so oxygen has six valence electrons around it

100
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:32,605
so i can go ahead and draw in oxygen

101
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,328
and i can put its six valence electrons in

102
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:39,200
one, two, three,

103
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,043
four, five and six like that

104
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:46,186
and then i'm going to put in the hydrogen right?

105
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,491
so i know now i have a hydrogen to worry about

106
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:51,184
and i know hydrogen has one valence electron,

107
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,573
so i can see there is a place for over here

108
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:56,340
and once again i can connect the dots

109
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,505
and see all of the single covalent bonds in this molecule.

110
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:01,956
so that's one bond, that's another bond,

111
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:04,305
now i can see that carbon is bonded to oxygen,

112
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,628
and oxygen is bonded to this hydrogen as well

113
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:09,679
again we can check our octet rule

114
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,209
so, the carbon has eight electrons around it

115
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,539
so is the oxygen

116
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:16,186
this will be two right here

117
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:20,691
and then four, and then six, and then eight

118
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:22,854
so the oxygen is following the octet rule

119
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:24,505
now when you are drawing a dot structure,

120
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:28,367
you don't always have to do this stuff where you are drawing each individual atom,

121
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:31,110
and summing all the valence electron in that way

122
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,991
you can just start drawing it

123
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:37,469
so for example, if i gave you C2H6, which is ethyne

124
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,851
another way to do it is we just do

125
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:41,576
we'd just be started drawing the bonds here

126
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,539
so i have two carbons,

127
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:47,159
and there is a pretty good bet that the two carbons are connected to each other

128
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,454
and i have six hydrogens

129
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:53,315
and if i look at what's possible around those carbons,

130
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:56,536
i could put those six hydrogens around those two carbon atoms like that

131
00:05:56,536 --> 00:06:00,609
and if i do that, i will have octet around each carbon atom

132
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:03,642
so this would be my dot structure for ethyne.

133
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:09,477
to double-check yourself, you could make sure that your dot structure has the correct number of valence electrons

134
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:12,093
so if i'm thinking about each carbon,

135
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:14,827
each carbon having four valence electrons,

136
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:16,399
and i have two of them,

137
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,705
i'm going to get eight valence electrons from those two carbons

138
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:21,272
that i have to represent in my dot structure

139
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:24,446
each hydrogen has one valence electron

140
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:25,938
and i have six of them

141
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:28,810
so i need to worry about six valence electron of hydrogens

142
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,490
so the total of 14

143
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,527
so i'm look at my dot strcuture

144
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:35,925
i can check to make sure i have the correct number of valence electrons

145
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:37,812
i need 14, so let's go ahead and count them

146
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:40,007
so this will be two here,

147
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:45,082
four, six, eight, ten, twelve and fourteen

148
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:46,940
so i have the correct number of valence electrons

149
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,937
represented in my dot structure

150
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:51,382
i also have an octet of electrons

151
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:52,939
around my carbons

152
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:56,067
so this would be the dot structure for ethane
