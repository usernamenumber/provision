1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,590
Everything we've named so
far has been an alkane.

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,630
We've seen all single bonds.

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,610
Let's see if we can expand our
repertoire a little bit and do

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,990
some alkenes.

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,830
So let's look at this first
carbon chain right here.

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,110
And actually, here I drew out
all of the hydrogens just to

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,110
remind you that everything we
were doing before with just

9
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,810
the lines, it really
was representing

10
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,210
something like this.

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,800
When you start having the
double bonds, and we'll

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,020
explain it in more detail later
on, it actually starts

13
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,400
to matter a little bit more to
draw the constituents, because

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,550
there's actually different ways
that you can arrange it.

15
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,750
Because these double bonds, you
can imagine, they're more

16
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,610
rigid, you can't rotate
around them as much.

17
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,050
But don't think about that
too much right now.

18
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,830
Let's just try to name
these things.

19
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,540
So like we always do, let's try
to find the longest chain

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,070
of carbons.

21
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,230
And there's only one chain
of carbons here.

22
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,520
There's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons in

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,170
that chain.

24
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,460
So we're going to be
dealing with hept,

25
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,930
that is seven carbons.

26
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,470
   

27
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,700
But it's not going
to be a heptane.

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,340
Heptane would mean that we
have all single bonds.

29
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,250
Here we have a double bond, so
this is going to be an alkene.

30
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,200
So this tells us right here
that we're dealing with an

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,290
alkene, not an alkane.

32
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,300
If you have a double bond,
it's an alkene.

33
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,910
Triple bond, alkyne.

34
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,000
We'll talk about that
in future videos.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,230
This is hept, and we'll put an
ene here, but we haven't

36
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,040
specified where the double
bond is and we haven't

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,790
numbered our carbons.

38
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,730
When you see an alkene like
this, you start numbering

39
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,300
closest to the double bond, just
like as if it was a alkyl

40
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,340
group, as if it was a side
chain of carbons.

41
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,860
So this side is closest to the
double bond, so let's start

42
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,390
numbering there.

43
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:54,180
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,710
The double bond is between two
and three, and to specify its

45
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,830
location, you start at the
lowest of these numbers.

46
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,620
So this double bond is at two.

47
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,870
This is actually hept-2-ene.

48
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,530
   

49
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,330
So this tells us that we have a
seven carbon chain that has

50
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,060
a double bond starting-- the
ene tells us a double bond.

51
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,080
Let me write that down.

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,940
So this double bond right
there, that's what

53
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,190
the ene tells us.

54
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,710
   

55
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,910
Double bond between two carbons,
it's an alkene.

56
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,120
The double bond starts-- if you
start at this point-- the

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,000
double bond starts at number two
carbon, and then it will

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,620
go to the number three carbon.

59
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,960
Now you might be asking, well,
what if I had more than one

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,830
double bond here?

61
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,630
So let me draw a quick
example of that.

62
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,760
Let's say I have something like,
one, two, three, four,

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,060
five, six, seven.

64
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,010
So this is the same
molecule again.

65
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,120
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,810
The way we drew it up
here, it would look

67
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,130
something like this.

68
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,170
What if I had another double
bond sitting right here?

69
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,170
How would we specify this?

70
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,220
Well, once again we have
seven carbons.

71
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,860
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

72
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,580
So we're still going to
have a hept here.

73
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,850
It's still going to
be an alkene, so

74
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,310
we put our ene here.

75
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,740
But we start numbering it, once
again, closest to the

76
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,970
closest double bond.

77
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:25,070
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

78
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,620
But now we have a double bond
starting at two to three, so

79
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,940
it would be hept-2.

80
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,405
And we also have another double
bond starting from four

81
00:03:31,405 --> 00:03:32,760
and going to five,
so hept-2,4-ene.

82
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,920
   

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,290
That's what this molecule
right there is.

84
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,560
Sometimes, this is the-- I
guess-- proper naming, but

85
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,610
just so you're familiar with
it if you ever see it.

86
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,620
Sometimes someone would write
hept-2-ene, they'll write that

87
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,390
as 2-heptene, probably because
it's easier to say 2-heptene.

88
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,710
And from this, you would be able
to draw this thing over

89
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,620
here, so it's giving you the
same amount of information.

90
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,390
Similarly over here, they
might say 2,4-heptene.

91
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,520
But this is the specific,
this is the correct

92
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,640
way to write it.

93
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,890
It let's you know the two and
the four apply to the ene,

94
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,860
which you know applies
to double bonds.

95
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's do a couple more.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,910
So over here, I have a double
bond, and I also have some

97
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,720
side chains.

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,140
Let's see if we can figure
out how to deal with

99
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,519
all of these things.

100
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,300
So first of all, what is our
longest chain of carbons?

101
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,400
So we have one, two, three,
four, five, six.

102
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,180
Now we could go in either
direction, it doesn't matter.

103
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,650
Seven carbons or
seven carbons.

104
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,580
Let's start numbering closest
to the double bond.

105
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,490
The double bond actually will
take precedence over any other

106
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,210
groups that are attached
to it.

107
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,990
So let's take precedence--
well, over any other

108
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,940
groups in this case.

109
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,510
There will be other groups that
will take precedence in

110
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,800
the future.

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,580
But the double bond takes
precedence over this side

112
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,300
chain, this methyl group.

113
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,230
But it doesn't matter in this
case, we'd want to start

114
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,140
numbering at this end.

115
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,800
It's one, two carbon, three
carbon, four carbon, five

116
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,100
carbon, six carbon,
seven carbon.

117
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,855
So we're dealing with
a hept again.

118
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:08,610
   

119
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,480
We have a double bond starting
from the second carbon to the

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,760
third carbon.

121
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,750
So this thing right here, this
double bond from the second

122
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,760
carbon to the third carbon.

123
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,880
So it's hept-2,3-ene-- sorry,
not 2,3, 2-ene.

124
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,490
You don't write both
endpoints.

125
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,420
If there was a three, then there
would have been another

126
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,530
double bond there.

127
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,780
It's hept-2-ene.

128
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,140
   

129
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,680
And then we have this methyl
group here, which is also

130
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,900
sitting on the second carbon.

131
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,040
So this methyl group right there
on the second carbon.

132
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,290
So we would say
2-methyl-hept-2-ene.

133
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:52,050
   

134
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,020
It's a hept-2-ene, that's all of
this part over here, double

135
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,380
bonds starting on
the two if we're

136
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,570
numbering from the right.

137
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,870
And then the methyl group
is also attached

138
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,260
to that second carbon.

139
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,960
Let's do one more of these.

140
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,830
So we have a cycle here, and
once again the root is going

141
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,890
to be the largest chain or
the largest ring here.

142
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,110
Our main ring is the largest
one, and we have one, two,

143
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,150
three, four, five,
six, carbon.

144
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:24,890
So we are dealing with hex as
our root for kind of the core

145
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,350
of our structure.

146
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,240
It's in a cycle, so it's
going to be cyclohex.

147
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,230
So let me write that.

148
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,980
So it's going to be cyclohex.

149
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,280
But it has a double
bond in it.

150
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,710
So it's cyclohex ene,
cyclohexene.

151
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,040
Let me do this in a
different color.

152
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,750
So we have this double bond
here, and that's why we know

153
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,410
it is an ene.

154
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,160
Now you're probably saying, Hey
Sal, how come we didn't

155
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,850
have to number where
the ene is?

156
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,990
So if you only have one double
bond in a ring, it's assumed

157
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,380
that one end point of the double
bond is your 1-carbon.

158
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,200
When you write just cyclohexene,
you know-- so

159
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,100
cyclohexene would look
just like this.

160
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,590
   

161
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,480
Just like that.

162
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,140
You don't have to specify
where it is.

163
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,390
It's just, one of these are
going to be the double bond.

164
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,920
Now when you have other
constituents on it, by

165
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,510
definition or I guess the proper
naming mechanism, is

166
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,940
one of the endpoints of the
double bond will be the

167
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,070
1-carbon, and if any of those
endpoints have something else

168
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,730
on it, that will definitely
be the 1-carbon.

169
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:33,270
So these both are kind of the
candidates for the 1-carbon,

170
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,640
but this point right here also
has this methyl group.

171
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,020
We will start numbering there,
one, and then you want to

172
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,580
number in the direction of the
other side of the double bond.

173
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,470
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

174
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,750
So we have three methyl
groups, one on one.

175
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,490
So these are the-- let me circle
the methyl groups.

176
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,950
That's a methyl group
right there.

177
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,490
That's a methyl group
right there.

178
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,470
That's just one carbon.

179
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,760
So we have three methyl groups,
so this is going to

180
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,650
be-- it's at the one, the
four, and the six.

181
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,900
So it is 1, 4, 6.

182
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,370
   

183
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:19,030
We have three methyl groups, so
it's trimethyl cyclohexene.

184
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,460
1, 4, 6-trimethylcyclohexene.

185
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,720
That's what that is, hopefully
you found that useful.

186
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,333
