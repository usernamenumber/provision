1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,248
Pretend you're me and you're in math class. Actually... nevermind, I'm sick so I'm staying home today

2
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:10,449
so pretend you are Stanislaw Ulam instead. What I am about to tell you is a true story.

3
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:13,785
So you are Stan Ulam and you're at a meeting but there's this really boring presentation so

4
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:17,578
of course you're doodling and, because you're Ulam and not me, you really like numbers...

5
00:00:17,578 --> 00:00:20,828
I mean <i>super</i> like them. So much that what you're doodling is numbers, just counting

6
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:25,379
starting with one and spiralling them around. I'm not too fluent in mathematical notation so

7
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,489
so i find things like numbers to be distracting, but you're a number theorist and if you love numbers

8
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,926
who am I to judge? Thing is, because you know numbers so intimately,

9
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:37,593
you can see beyond the confusing, squiggly lines you're drawing right into the heart of numbers.

10
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:40,821
And, because you're a number theorist, and everyone knows that number theorists are

11
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:44,327
enamoured with prime numbers( which is probably why they named them "prime numbers"),

12
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:50,132
the primes you've doodled suddenly jump out at you like the exotic indivisible beasts they are...

13
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:54,822
So you start drawing a heart around each prime. Well... it was actually boxes but in my version

14
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:59,002
of the story it's hearts because you're not afraid to express your true feelings about prime numbers.

15
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:02,833
You can probably do this instantly but it's going to take me a little longer... I'm all like -

16
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:08,174
"Does 27 have factors besides one and itself? ... o.0 ... Oh yeah, it's 3 times 9, not prime."

17
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:10,380
"Hmmm what about 29...? pretty sure it's prime."

18
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,908
But as a number theorist, you'll be shocked to know it takes me a moment to figure these out.

19
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:20,086
But, even though you have your primes memorised up to at least 1000 that doesn't change that

20
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:22,547
primes, in general, are difficult to find.

21
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:26,889
I mean if I ask you to find the highest even number, you'd say, "that's silly, just give me

22
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:30,465
the number you think is the highest and i'll just add 2.... BAM!!"

23
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:39,706
But guess what the highest prime number we know is? 2 to the power of 43,112,609 - 1.

24
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:44,510
Just to give you an idea about how big a deal primes are, the guy that found this one won

25
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,026
a $100,000 prize for it!

26
00:01:47,026 --> 00:01:50,821
We even sent our largest known prime number into space because scientists think

27
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:54,683
aliens will recognise it as something important and not just some arbitrary number.

28
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:57,423
So they will be able to figure out our alien space message...

29
00:01:57,423 --> 00:02:00,163
So if you ever think you don't care about prime numbers because they're 'not useful',

30
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:04,807
remember that we use prime numbers to talk to aliens, I'm not even making this up!

31
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:10,310
It makes sense, because mathematics is probably one of the only things all life has in common.

32
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,342
Anyway, the point is you started doodling because you were bored but ended up

33
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:18,205
discovering some neat patterns. See how the primes tend to line up on the diagonals?

34
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,990
Why do they do that?... also this sort of skeletal structure reminds me of bones so

35
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,821
lets call these diagonal runs of primes: Prime Ribs!

36
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:29,769
But how do you predict when a Prime Rib will end? I mean, maybe this next number is prime...

37
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:32,694
(but my head is too fuzzy for now this right now so you tell me.)

38
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,922
Anyway...Congratulations, You've discovered the Ulam Spiral!

39
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,035
So that's a little mathematical doodling history for you.

40
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:41,216
Yyou can stop being Ulam now... or you can continue. Maybe you like being Ulam. (thats fine)

41
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:46,719
However you could also be Blaise Pascal. Here's another number game you can do using

42
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,063
Pascal's triangle.(I don't know why I'm so into numbers today but I have a cold so

43
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:55,078
if you'll just indulge my sick predelections maybe I'll manage to infect you with my enthusiasm :D

44
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:59,119
Pascal's Triangle is the one where you get the next row in the triangle by adding two adjacent

45
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:03,781
numbers. Constructing Pascal's Triangle is, in itself a sort of number game because it's not just

46
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:07,380
about adding, but about trying to find patterns and relationships in the numbers so you

47
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,161
don't have to do all the adding.

48
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:12,610
I don't know if this was discovered through doodling but it was discovered independantly in:

49
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,603
France, Italy, Persia, China and probably other places too so it's possible someone did.

50
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:19,436
Right... so I don't actually care about the individual numbers right now.

51
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:24,754
So, if you still Ulam, you pick a property and highlight it(e.g. if it's even or odd)

52
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:29,746
If you circle all the odd numbers you'll get a form which might be starting to look familiar.

53
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:33,117
And it makes sense you'd get Sierpinski's Triangle because when you add

54
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:35,412
an odd number and an even number, you get an odd number.

55
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:38,244
(odd + odd) = even and (even + even) = even... So it's just like the

56
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:42,935
crash and burn binary tree game. The best part about it is that, if you know these properties, you can

57
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:45,698
forget about the details of the numbers

58
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:50,481
You don't have to know that a space contains a 9 to know that it's going to be odd.

59
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:55,799
Now, instead of two colours, let's try three. we'll colour them depending on what the remainder is

60
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,935
when you divide them by three(instead of by two).

61
00:03:57,935 --> 00:03:59,299
Here's a chart! :)

62
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,327
So, all the multiples of three are coloured red, remainder of one will be coloured black and

63
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:07,863
remainder of two will be coloured green. The structure is a little different from Sierpinski's Triangle

64
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:12,359
already but I'm tired of figuring out remainders based of individual numbers, so

65
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:16,046
Let's figure out the rules... If you add up two multiples of three you always get

66
00:04:16,076 --> 00:04:21,201
another multiple of three( which is the sort of fact you use everday in math class)

67
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:22,943
However, here this means (red + red) = red.

68
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:26,403
and when you add a multiple of three to something else, it doesn't change it's remainder.

69
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:30,884
So, (red + green) = green and (red + black) = black.

70
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:34,713
(remainder 1 + remainder 1) = remainder 2, (remainder 2+ remainder 2) = remainder 4

71
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:40,288
and the remainder of 4 divided by 3 is one and (1+2) = 3 remainder 0. (whew...)

72
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:43,585
The bottom line is you're making up some rules as to what coloured dots combine to

73
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:46,279
produce which other coloured dots and then you're following those rules to their

74
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,344
mathematical and artistic conclusion...

75
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:52,525
The numbers themselves were never necessary to get this picture.

76
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:56,751
Anyway, those are just a couple of examples of number games that are out there but you should

77
00:04:56,751 --> 00:05:00,768
also try making up your own. For example, I have no idea what you'd get if you

78
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:04,065
highlighted the prime numbers in Pascal's Triangle, maybe nothing interesting(who knows...)

79
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:07,895
Or, what happens if, instead of adding to get the next row, you start with a two(and a sea of invisible ones)

80
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:10,913
and multiple two adjacent numbers to get the next row.

81
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:13,516
I've no idea what hapens there either or if it's already a 'thing' people do.

82
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:16,316
(Hmmm? o.0 Powers of two...)

83
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,205
I know another way to write this. Ok, that makes sense.

84
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:24,243
Then there is also a thing called Floyd's Triangle where you put the numbers like this...

85
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:25,604
Maybe you can do something with that as well.

86
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:26,892
... Man, it seems like everyone has a triangle these days...

87
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm going to take a nap... ZZZzzz...
