1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,450
We've learned about matrix
addition, matrix subtraction,

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,560
matrix multiplication.

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,760
So you might be wondering,
is there the

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,150
equivalent of matrix division?

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,460
And before we get into that,
let me introduce

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,220
some concepts to you.

8
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,490
And then we'll see that there is
something that maybe isn't

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,440
exactly division, but it's
analogous to it.

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,620
So before we introduce that, I'm
going to introduce you to

11
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,210
the concept of an
identity matrix.

12
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,350
So an identity matrix
is a matrix.

13
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,840
And I'll denote that
by capital I.

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,315
When I multiply it times another
matrix-- actually I

15
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:36,960
don't know if I should write
that dot there-- but anyway,

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,450
when I multiply times
another matrix, I

17
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,040
get that other matrix.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,130
Or when I multiply that matrix
times the identity matrix, I

19
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,230
get the matrix again.

20
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,790
And it's important to realize
when we're doing matrix

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,580
multiplication, that
direction matters.

22
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,810
I've actually given you some
information here that-- we

23
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,030
can't just assume when we were
doing regular multiplication

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,290
that, a times b is always
equal to b times a.

25
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,095
It's important when we're doing
matrix multiplication,

26
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:08,040
to confirm that it matters
what direction you do the

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,650
multiplication in.

28
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,350
But anyway, and this works
both ways only if we're

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,810
dealing with square matrices.

30
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,660
It can work in one direction or
another if this matrix is

31
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,080
non-square, but it won't
work in both.

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,670
And you can think about that
just in terms of how we

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,910
learned matrix multiplication,
why that happens.

34
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,910
But anyway, I've defined
this matrix.

35
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,180
Now what does this matrix
actually look like?

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,280
It's actually pretty simple.

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,620
If we have a 2x2 matrix, the
identity matrix is 1, 0, 0, 1.

38
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:50,490
If you want 3x3, it's 1,
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1.

39
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,840
I think you see the pattern.

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,140
If you want a 4x4, the identity
matrix is 1, 0, 0, 0

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:05,490
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,
0, 0, 0, 0, 1.

42
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,220
So you can see all that any
matrix is, for a given

43
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,390
dimension-- I mean we could
extend this to an n by n

44
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,680
matrix-- is you just have 1's
along this top left to bottom

45
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,390
right diagonals.

46
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,790
And everything else is a 0.

47
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,510
So I've told you that.

48
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,360
Let's prove that it
actually works.

49
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,270
Let's take this matrix
and multiply it

50
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,220
times another matrix.

51
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,150
And confirm that that matrix
doesn't change.

52
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,480
So if we take 1, 0, 0, 1.

53
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,600
Let's multiply it times-- let's
do a general matrix.

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,490
Just so you see that this
works for all numbers.

55
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,670
a, b, c, d.

56
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,190
   

57
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,440
So what does that equal?

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,180
   

59
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,970
We're going to multiply this
row times this column.

60
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,870
1 times a plus 0 times c is a.

61
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,340
And that row times
this column.

62
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,590
1 times b plus 0 times d.

63
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,450
That's b.

64
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,370
Then this row times
this column.

65
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,850
0 times a plus 1 times c is c.

66
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,420
Then finally, this row
times this column.

67
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,470
0 times b plus 1 times d.

68
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,140
Well, that's just d.

69
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,400
There you have it.

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,630
And it might be a fun exercise
to try it the other

71
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,100
way around as well.

72
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,430
And actually it's an even better
exercise to try this

73
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,740
with a 3x3.

74
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,700
And you'll see it
all works out.

75
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,520
And a good exercise for you is
to think about why it works.

76
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,540
And if you think about it, it's
because you're getting

77
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,420
your row information from
here and your column

78
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,200
information from here.

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,860
And essentially, anytime you're
multiplying, let's say

80
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,220
this vector times this vector,
you're multiplying the

81
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,940
corresponding terms and then
adding them, right?

82
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,370
So if you have a 1 and a 0, the
0 is going to cancel out

83
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,890
anything but the first term
in this column vector.

84
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,630
So that's why you're
just left with a.

85
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,380
And that's why it's going to
cancel out everything but the

86
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,470
first term in this
column vector.

87
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,190
And that's why you're
left with just b.

88
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,220
And similarly, this will cancel
out everything but the

89
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,020
second term.

90
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,250
That's why you're left
with just c there.

91
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:56,960
This times this.

92
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,270
You're just left with c.

93
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,830
This times this.

94
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,010
You're just left with d.

95
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,690
And that same thing applies
when you go to

96
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,030
3x3 or n by n vectors.

97
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,900
So that's interesting.

98
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,740
You have the identity vector.

99
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,860
Now if we wanted to complete
our analogy-- so

100
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,440
let's think about it.

101
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,230
We know in regular mathematics,
if I have 1 times

102
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,750
a, I get a.

103
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,680
And we also know that 1 over a
times a-- this is just regular

104
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,160
math, this has nothing to do
with matrices-- is equal to 1.

105
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,060
And you know, we call this
the inverse of a.

106
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,800
And that's also the same thing
as dividing by the number a.

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
So is there a matrix analogy?

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,250
Let me switch colors, because
I've used this green a little

109
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:39,860
bit too much.

110
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,580
Is there a matrix, where if I
were to have the matrix a, and

111
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,600
I multiply it by this matrix--
and I'll call that the inverse

112
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,650
of a-- is there a matrix where
I'm left with, not the number

113
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,140
1, but I'm left with
the 1 equivalent

114
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,930
in the matrix world?

115
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,785
Where I'm left with the
identity matrix?

116
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:01,190
And it would be extra nice if
I could actually switch this

117
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,780
multiplication around.

118
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,910
So A times A inverse should
also be equal to

119
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,745
the identity matrix.

120
00:05:08,745 --> 00:05:12,170
And if you think about it, if
both of these things are true,

121
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,100
then actually not only is A
inverse the inverse of A, but

122
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,210
A is also the inverse
of A inverse.

123
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,330
So they're each other's
inverses.

124
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,520
That's all I meant to say.

125
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,020
And it turns out there
is such a matrix.

126
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,020
It's called the inverse
of A, as I've

127
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,580
said three times already.

128
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,030
And I will now show you
how to calculate it.

129
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,220
So let's do that.

130
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,290
And we'll see calculating
it for a 2x2 is fairly

131
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:35,970
straightforward.

132
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,010
Although you might think it's a
little mysterious as to how

133
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,090
people came up with the
mechanics of it, or the

134
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,540
algorithm for it.

135
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,050
3x3 becomes a little hairy.

136
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,480
4x4 will take you all day.

137
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,790
5x5, you're almost definitely
going to do a careless mistake

138
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,310
if you did the inverse
of a 5x5 matrix.

139
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,970
And that's better left
to a computer.

140
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,170
But anyway, how do we calculate
the matrix?

141
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,160
So let's do that, and then we'll
confirm that it really

142
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,660
is the inverse.

143
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:14,250
So if I have a matrix A,
and that is a, b, c, d.

144
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,765
And I want to calculate
its inverse.

145
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:17,915
Its inverse is actually--
and this is going

146
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:18,630
to seem like voodoo.

147
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,480
In future videos, I will give
you a little bit more

148
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,690
intuition for why this works, or
I'll actually show you how

149
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,890
this came about.

150
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,140
But for now it's almost better
just to memorize the steps,

151
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,690
just so you have the confidence
that you know that

152
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,210
you can calculate an inverse.

153
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:38,050
It's equal to 1 over this number
times this. a times d

154
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,820
minus b times c.

155
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,410
ad minus bc.

156
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:50,970
And this quantity down here, ad
minus bc, that's called the

157
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,980
determinant of the matrix A.

158
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,270
And we're going to
multiply that.

159
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,410
This is just a number.

160
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,390
This is just a scalar
quantity.

161
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,660
And we're going to multiply
that by-- you switch

162
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,560
the a and the d.

163
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,290
You switch the top left
and the bottom right.

164
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,640
So you're left with d and a.

165
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,980
And you make these two, you make
the bottom left and the

166
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,910
top right, you make
them negative.

167
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:17,590
So minus c minus b.

168
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,700
And the determinant-- once
again, this is something that

169
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,610
you're just going to take a
little bit on faith right now.

170
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,620
In future videos, I promise
to give you more tuition.

171
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,500
But it's actually kind of
sophisticated to learn what

172
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,230
the determinant is.

173
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,060
And if you're doing this in your
high school class, you

174
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,270
kind of just have to know
how to calculate it.

175
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,410
Although I don't like
telling you that.

176
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,700
So what is this?

177
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,810
This is also call the
determinant of A.

178
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,700
So you might see on an
exam, figure out the

179
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,370
determinant of A.

180
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,120
So let me just tell you that.

181
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,460
And that's denoted by A in
absolute value signs.

182
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,660
And that's equal
to ad minus bc.

183
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,760
So another way of saying this,
this could be 1 over the

184
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,250
determinant.

185
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,540
So you could write A inverse
is equal to 1 over the

186
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:02,740
determinant of A times
d minus b minus c, a.

187
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,550
Anyway you look at it.

188
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,810
But let's apply this to a real
problem, and you'll see that

189
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,100
it's actually not so bad.

190
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,700
So let's change letters, just so
you know it doesn't always

191
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,380
have to be an A.

192
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,526
Let's say I have a matrix B.

193
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:20,840
And the matrix B is 3-- I'm
just going to pick random

194
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:28,720
numbers-- minus 4, 2 minus 5.

195
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,060
Let's calculate B inverse.

196
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,770
So B inverse is going to
be equal to 1 over the

197
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,780
determinant of B.

198
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,020
What's the determinant?

199
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,860
It's 3 times minus 5 minus
2 times minus 4.

200
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:48,270
So 3 times minus 5 is minus
15, minus 2 times minus 4.

201
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,950
2 times minus 4 is minus 8.

202
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,333
We're going to subtract that.

203
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,583
So it's plus 8.

204
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,640
   

205
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:06,142
And we're going to multiply
that times what?

206
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:11,130
Well, we switched these two
terms. So it's minus 5 and 3.

207
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,770
And we just make these
two terms negative.

208
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,770
Minus 2 and 4.

209
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,110
4 was minus 4, so now
it becomes 4.

210
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,980
And let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

211
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,060
So B inverse is equal
to minus 15 plus 8.

212
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,700
That's minus 7.

213
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,340
So this is minus 1/7.

214
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,980
So the determinant of B-- we
could write B's determinant--

215
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,636
is equal to minus 7.

216
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:45,400
So that's minus 1/7 times
minus 5, 4, minus 2, 3.

217
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,800
Which is equal to-- this is just
a scalar, this is just a

218
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,420
number, so we multiply it times
each of the elements--

219
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,420
so that is equal to minus,
minus, plus.

220
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,210
That's 5/7.

221
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,650
5/7 minus 4/7.

222
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,710
Let's see.

223
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,960
Positive 2/7.

224
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,540
   

225
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,790
And then minus 3/7.

226
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,770
   

227
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,500
It's a little hairy.

228
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,210
We ended up with fractions
here and things.

229
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,470
But let's confirm that this
really is the inverse

230
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,490
of the matrix B.

231
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,730
Let's multiply them out.

232
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,565
So before I do that I have
to create some space.

233
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:30,440
   

234
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,690
I don't even need
this anymore.

235
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,230
   

236
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,940
There you go.

237
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,260
OK.

238
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,450
So let's confirm that that
times this, or this times

239
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,870
that, is really equal to
the identity matrix.

240
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,940
So let's do that.

241
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,390
So let me switch colors.

242
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:53,520
So B inverse is 5/7,
if I haven't made

243
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,120
any careless mistakes.

244
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,250
Minus 4/7.

245
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,965
2/7.

246
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:04,020
And minus 3/7.

247
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,745
That's B inverse.

248
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:06,610
And let me multiply that by B.

249
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,490
3 minus 4.

250
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,090
2 minus 5.

251
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,090
And this is going to be
the product matrix.

252
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,066
I need some space to
do my calculations.

253
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,630
   

254
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,520
Let me switch colors.

255
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,820
I'm going to take this row
times this column.

256
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,880
So 5/7 times 3 is what?

257
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:41,170
15/7.

258
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,000
Plus minus 4/7 times 2.

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,510
So minus 4/7 times 2 is minus--
let me make sure

260
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,030
that's right-- 5 times
3 is 15/7.

261
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,520
Minus 4-- oh right, right--
4 times 2, so minus 8/7.

262
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,830
   

263
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,910
Now we're going to multiply this
row times this column.

264
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:16,640
So 5 times minus 4
is minus 20/7.

265
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:25,390
Plus minus 4/7 times minus 5.

266
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:32,760
That is plus 20/7.

267
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,710
My brain is starting to slow
down, having to do matrix

268
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,360
multiplications with fractions
with negative numbers.

269
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,950
But this is a good exercise
for multiple

270
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,730
parts of the brain.

271
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,100
But anyway.

272
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,350
So let's go down and
do this term.

273
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,800
So now we're going to multiply
this row times this column.

274
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,680
So 2/7 times 3 is 6/7.

275
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,790
Plus minus 3/7 times 2.

276
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,410
So that's minus 6/7.

277
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,290
One term left.

278
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,330
Home stretch.

279
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,570
2/7 times minus 4
is minus 8/7.

280
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:13,500
   

281
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,730
Plus minus 3/7 times minus 5.

282
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:25,300
So those negatives cancel out,
and we're left with plus 15/7.

283
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,370
And if we simplify,
what do we get?

284
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,500
15/7 minus 8/8 is 7/7.

285
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,310
Well that's just 1.

286
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,520
This is 0, clearly.

287
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,260
This is 0.

288
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,680
6/7 minus 6/7 is 0.

289
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,430
And then minus 8/7 plus
15/7, that's 7/7.

290
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,660
That's 1 again.

291
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,730
And there you have it.

292
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,150
We've actually managed to
inverse this matrix.

293
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,010
And it was actually harder to
prove that it was the inverse

294
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,980
by multiplying, just because we
had to do all this fraction

295
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,850
and negative number math.

296
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,610
But hopefully that
satisfies you.

297
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,430
And you could try it the other
way around to confirm that if

298
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,010
you multiply it the other
way, you'd also get

299
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,050
the identity matrix.

300
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,110
But anyway, that is how
you calculate the

301
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,600
inverse of a 2x2.

302
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,950
And as we'll see in the next
video, calculating by the

303
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,310
inverse of a 3x3 matrix
is even more fun.

304
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,850
See you soon.

305
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,000
