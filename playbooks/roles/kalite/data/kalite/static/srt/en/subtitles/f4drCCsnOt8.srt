1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,970
   

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,920
Where are we?

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:10,950
We are on problem 15.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,220
Let's see.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,890
They have a bunch of
triangles drawn.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,550
So let me get the line tool and
see what I can do about

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,380
drawing these.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:24,880
I've got a big triangle, looks
something like that.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,040
It's the big triangle, and
there's this altitude to that

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,790
drops down like that.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,230
And there's a smaller triangle
within it that looks

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,480
something like this.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,545
   

14
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:46,940
A smaller triangle and then
this is a 90 degree angle

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,410
right here.

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,550
It's perpendicular.

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:58,220
q, s, p, v.

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,530
Oh my God no, I messed up.

19
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,000
   

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,370
I should have done this
ahead of time.

21
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,350
I'm wasting your time.

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,320
Bear with me, I drew
this line wrong.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,790
This line is something
different.

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,370
That line looks like this.

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,430
   

26
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,840
All right, now I'm
back in business.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:31,190
   

28
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,220
t and then r.

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,375
It took me almost two minutes
just to draw this thing.

30
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,810
And it says, note, figure
not drawn to scale.

31
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,840
It says, in triangle
pqr above, qs over

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:50,800
qv is equal to 1/3.

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:02:02,410
And it says, pt over
pr is equal to 3/4.

34
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,670
What is the value
of the fraction?

35
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:14,890
And they want to know area of
triangle pst over area of

36
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,150
triangle pqr?

37
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,680
Now let's see what we can do.

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,910
I haven't been thinking
just yet.

39
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,680
I've just been drawing
and writing.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:30,740
So they say, qs over qv, over
this whole thing, is 1/3.

41
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,360
Fair enough.

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:41,180
And they say, pt over
pr is equal to 3/4.

43
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,690
OK.

44
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,305
Fair enough.

45
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:45,480
So, area of pst over
area of pqr.

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,610
So what's the area of pst?

47
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:57,350
   

48
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,470
That would be just the base
times the height times 1/2.

49
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,120
And we'll see the 1/2's cancel
out, we don't have to do them,

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,470
but I'll do it just
to figure it out.

51
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:17,940
So it's 1/2 pt times sv.

52
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,510
   

53
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:35,040
And then area of pqr
is going to be 1/2.

54
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,760
So it's this whole thing,
pr times qv.

55
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,500
   

56
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,640
So the area of this triangle pst
over the area of triangle

57
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:04,920
pqr is just going to be 1/2 pt
times sv over 1/2 times the

58
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,820
area of pqr.

59
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,150
So it's over this.

60
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,250
1/2 pr times qv.

61
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,590
Let's see what we could
figure out.

62
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,540
We definitely see the
1/2's cancel out.

63
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,410
   

64
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,350
Do we know what pt over pr is?

65
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,740
Let me see, pt over pr.

66
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,840
They give it right here.
pt over pr is 3/4.

67
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,960
So this term is equal to 3/4.

68
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:39,910
So this is equal to 3/4
times sv over qv.

69
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,220
And now we're at a conundrum.

70
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,430
We know what qv is.

71
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,580
But we only know qs,
we don't know sv.

72
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,200
Let me ask you a question.

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:57,920
If qs over qv, over this whole
thing, is 1/3-- so this pink

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,580
distance right here is 1/3 of
this entire length, right?

75
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,530
Because this distance over the
entire distance is 1/3.

76
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:12,340
Then sv over qv so then this
is going to be 2/3.

77
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,600
If this is 1/3, this'll
be 2/3.

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,730
So then we know that sv
over the whole thing

79
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,870
is going to be 2/3.

80
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,980
So this is 2/3.

81
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,970
And then 3/4 times 2/3,
well the 3's cancel

82
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,220
out, and you get 2/4.

83
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,530
It equals 1/2, and you
just fill it in.

84
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,490
Next problem.

85
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,640
Hope you get that.

86
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,020
Most of it we just figured out
what the areas were and just

87
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,890
substituted.

88
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,980
And then we just have to figure
out what sv over qv is,

89
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,110
given qs over qv.

90
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,580
We figured out that
sv over qv is 2/3.

91
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,685
I hope I did not confuse you.

92
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:58,360
It's Thanksgiving and it's not
a good day to confuse people.

93
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,560
OK number 16.

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:17,840
Let the function h be defined by
h of x is equal to 14 plus

95
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,380
x squared over 4.

96
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:30,510
If h of 2m is equal
to 9m, what is one

97
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,930
possible value of m?

98
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,940
Well let's just figure
out what h of 2m is.

99
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:44,000
So h of 2m is equal to, just
using this definition of its

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,440
function, 14 plus-- we're taking
h of 2m, so it's 2m

101
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,080
squared over 4.

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,790
And we also know that
this is equal to 9m.

103
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,850
   

104
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,680
And let's see what we can
do to simplify it.

105
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,920
So we could say 14 plus
4m squared over 4.

106
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,740
Just squaring both of these.

107
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,790
This is equal to 9.

108
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,766
This cancels out.

109
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:16,730
   

110
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,890
Oh, that was equal to 9m.

111
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,570
Sorry.

112
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,200
And now we're left with 14 plus
m squared is equal to 9m.

113
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,280
We're left with a quadratic.

114
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,370
It might not be obvious
to you.

115
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,270
Let's subtract 9m from
both sides and

116
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,100
rearrange a little bit.

117
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,860
You get m squared minus 9m
plus 14 is equal to 0.

118
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,500
All I did is I took this 9m,
put it on this side,

119
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,360
subtracted 9m from both
sides, and put the

120
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,210
m squared out front.

121
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,740
Now we have a quadratic and we
need to solve-- figure out

122
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,280
where this expression intersects
the x-axis, or

123
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,740
figure out the roots
of this quadratic.

124
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,090
And we can factor this.

125
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,580
If you remember your factoring
from later Algebra I or some

126
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,120
Algebra II.

127
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:03,100
This would be m minus 7 times
m minus 2 is equal to 0.

128
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,120
And how did I figure that out?

129
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,880
Well I had to figure out two
numbers that when I multiply

130
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,450
them, equals positive 14, and
that when I add them, is equal

131
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,440
to negative 9.

132
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,840
So 7 times 2 is 14, or
negative 7 times

133
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,390
negative 2 is also 14.

134
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,740
And we know it's negative
because it has to go to

135
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,000
negative 9.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,380
And that's just a review
of what you

137
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,230
learned in algebra class.

138
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,740
If this was confusing,
you might

139
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,930
want to review factoring.

140
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,500
Anyway, m minus 7 times m
minus 2 is equal to 0.

141
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,860
That means that m is
equal to 7 or 2.

142
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,780
And you can fill in either one
of those, because they say

143
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,400
what is one possible
value for m?

144
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,910
I have a minute left, so and I
only have two problems left.

145
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,940
Well, that's good for one extra
video, so I'll see you

146
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,540
in the next video.

147
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:49,833
