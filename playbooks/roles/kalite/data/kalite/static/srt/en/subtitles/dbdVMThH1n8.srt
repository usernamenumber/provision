1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,760
Let's think about what might
happen if we had a solution of

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,370
this carboxylic acid here.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,410
We might as well name it just
to get some practice.

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,440
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,720
So this is heptan-, and then
we don't write heptane,

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,380
because this is a
carboxylic acid.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,240
It is heptanoic acid.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,470
So let's see what happens if
we have heptanoic acid

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,380
reacting with-- this is one, two
carbons, and then it has

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,200
an OH group, so this
is ethanol.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,400
   

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,890
That's what the OH group does.

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,260
It makes this an alcohol.

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,750
And it's in the presence of a
sulfuric acid catalyst. This

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,120
right here is sulfuric acid,
one of the stronger acids.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,220
I'll actually draw its
structure, because I always

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,740
find it frustrating when people
just write just the

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,950
formula here without the actual
structure, because the

20
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,770
structure actually shows
you why it's so acidic.

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,960
   

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,310
Sulfur has six valence
electrons, just like oxygen.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,310
So it has a double bond to an
oxygen, another double bond to

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,410
an oxygen, and then it has a
single bond to an OH group,

25
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,560
and then it has another single
bond to an OH group.

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,640
And notice, it has one,
two, three, four,

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,880
five, six valence electrons.

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,220
Now, the reason why this is such
a strong acid, is that if

29
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,490
either of these oxygens take the
electron from this proton,

30
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,480
so actually give away the
proton to the solution,

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,130
there's a ton of resonance
structures here.

32
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,230
And maybe I'll make a whole
video on sulfuric acid, just

33
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,720
to show you all of the
resonance structures.

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,245
But, in general, whenever you
see a reaction when they say

35
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:45,960
it's catalyzed by an acid, all
you have to do is realize it's

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,880
just going to make the
surrounding solution a lot

37
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,230
more acidic, just a
ton more acidic.

38
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,676
Maybe we're in a solution of
ethanol, and if we are in a

39
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:57,990
solution of ethanol, it'll
just add protons to the

40
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,165
ethanol itself.

41
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:01,390
So you can imagine this
guy right over here.

42
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,440
Let me draw the sulfuric acid
a little bit differently.

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,210
Let me draw these
oxygen-hydrogen bonds, so you

44
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,580
have this oxygen and it is
bonded to a hydrogen there.

45
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,040
This is floating around
the solution.

46
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,790
You have your ethanol that
looks like this, so two

47
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,250
carbons and then bonded to an
oxygen, and then that oxygen

48
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,040
is bonded to a hydrogen.

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,680
The oxygen has two lone
pairs, just like that.

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,800
And so this guy really is good
at getting rid of the protons.

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,050
So you have a situation where
this electron can be taken

52
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,870
back by this oxygen, and then it
can actually be given here,

53
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,080
and there's all these resonance
structures.

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,280
But it's just very good at
taking that electron.

55
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,080
And that can happen at the exact
same time that one of

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,235
the ethanols capture the
hydrogen proton, at the exact

57
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:55,490
same time that this oxygen
captures that hydrogen proton.

58
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,130
And if you just look at this
part right here, this will

59
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,760
just result in-- this part alone
will just result in a

60
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,590
ton of having these protonated
ethanols flying around.

61
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,970
Actually, let me draw
it over here.

62
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:08,760
I want to make sure
I'm using my

63
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,080
screen real estate properly.

64
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,950
So this will result in a ton of
these protonated ethanols.

65
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,510
So one, two carbons, it
has this original

66
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,940
hydrogen over here.

67
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,950
But now it has one electron in
that original pair, and it

68
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,350
gave the other electron to this
hydrogen, so it gave the

69
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,850
other electron to that
hydrogen nucleus.

70
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,125
   

71
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,840
Let me do it in that
same color.

72
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,010
   

73
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,900
So it took a proton.

74
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,440
It gave away an electron, so it
now has a positive charge.

75
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,930
And now what was a sulfuric
acid now has a

76
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,210
negative charge over here.

77
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,380
So if I were to draw it, it
would now look like this.

78
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,690
Plus sulfur, two double
bonds, two oxygens.

79
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,330
You still have this OH group.

80
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,470
Actually, it could
still donate.

81
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,320
This is still acidic, but now
this oxygen right now gained

82
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,300
an electron.

83
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,980
It now has a negative charge.

84
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,960
Now, the whole reason I did this
is I wanted to give you a

85
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,820
tangible sense of what sulfuric
acid looks like and

86
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,830
why it's acidic.

87
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,120
But really, you just have to
kind of internalize that

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,290
you're just going to have a
bunch of hydrogen protons

89
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:19,930
floating around.

90
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,040
They could be attached
to an ethanol.

91
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,070
If this was a water solution,
they could create hydronium,

92
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,400
so you have a bunch of hydrogen
protons floating

93
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,410
around that will catalyze
this reaction.

94
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,590
They will be used to facilitate
the reaction we're

95
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,380
going to explore, and then
they will be let go.

96
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,310
So hopefully, this right here,
by having this right here, if

97
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,720
I start involving some of these
protonated ethanols in

98
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,160
our reaction, you won't view
that as a huge stretch of the

99
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,740
imagination, because they would
have gotten protonated

100
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,270
by the sulfuric acid.

101
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,100
Or if I just actually grab
protons in our reaction, that

102
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,630
actually might make it
a little bit simpler.

103
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,170
So let's start with the
actual reaction.

104
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,820
So let me read redraw
my heptanoic acid.

105
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,990
So I have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven

106
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,320
carbons, double bond to an
oxygen, and then we have an OH

107
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,010
group right over here.

108
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:15,410
Now, the first step of this
reaction, this oxygen right

109
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,660
here, we have all these protons
floating around, very

110
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,330
acidic environment.

111
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,580
We have sulfuric acid there just
giving protons away to

112
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,060
the ethanol or to
other things.

113
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,270
So this guy can grab a proton
either directly from sulfuric

114
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,170
acid or maybe from one
of the protonated

115
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,580
ethanols, either one.

116
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,720
So we could just draw
it like this.

117
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,700
He just grabs a hydrogen
proton.

118
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,190
The hydrogen proton might have
had an electron associated

119
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,540
with it that would then go back
to a sulfuric acid, but

120
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,010
just to make things simple, I'll
just say grabs a proton

121
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,490
from something else.

122
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,530
So once he grabs that proton,
then it looks like this.

123
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,480
So I'll draw my two, three,
four, five, six, seven

124
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,240
carbons, double bond to an
oxygen, single bond to an OH.

125
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,370
This oxygen had two lone pairs,
but now one of the lone

126
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,400
pairs is broken up because it
gave an electron to this

127
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,730
hydrogen proton right
over there.

128
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,700
Hydrogen proton, it was
positively charged.

129
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,630
It gained an electron.

130
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,810
Now it is neutral.

131
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,160
But this oxygen right over here
gave away the electron,

132
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,170
so it is now positive.

133
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,570
Now, the next step,
we have all this

134
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,820
ethanol floating around.

135
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,460
   

136
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,600
So let me introduce some
ethanol, and I'll do this in a

137
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,810
different color.

138
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,200
So we have this ethanol floating
around, and this is

139
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,380
one, two carbons.

140
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,140
This is our ethanol.

141
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,600
You have two electron pairs
on that oxygen.

142
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,250
And then you could imagine,
especially because this is now

143
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,430
a good leaving group, you can
imagine that this acts as a

144
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,100
nucleophile.

145
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,040
It would do a nucleophile attack
on this carbonyl carbon

146
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,030
right here.

147
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,120
And so what you could imagine is
that this electron attacks,

148
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,560
or gets given to, this carbon
right here on the carbonyl.

149
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,780
And at the exact same time that
this happens, this oxygen

150
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,120
is positively charged.

151
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,130
It wants an electron.

152
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,300
It wants to get neutral again.

153
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,471
It's already hogging
these electrons.

154
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,533
That's why you have
a partial positive

155
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:16,926
charge on this carbon.

156
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:19,626
That's why this guy might
be attracted to this.

157
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:21,590
We've see this in Sn2 reactions
many, many, many,

158
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,660
many times already.

159
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,280
So this electron will
be taken up by this

160
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,890
top oxygen over there.

161
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,420
So after that happens, what
does our newly formed

162
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,770
molecule look like?

163
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,850
Let me just scroll down and
have some clear space.

164
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,880
After that, our newly formed
molecule will look like this.

165
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,290
We have two, three, four, five,
six, seven carbons to

166
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,770
get to the carbonyl carbon, and
now it will have a single

167
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,180
bond to that oxygen up there.

168
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,560
That oxygen had one
lone pair already.

169
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,370
It had this bond to this
hydrogen that it nabbed from

170
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,990
the solution, that proton that
it nabbed from the solution,

171
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,190
and now it has another pair.

172
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,170
It had this electron that was
participating in a double bond

173
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,190
with this carbonyl carbon, but
now it took the other side of

174
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,230
that bond back.

175
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,490
So now it has that electron and
the other one that it took

176
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,770
from the carbon, so it has
two lone pairs again.

177
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,070
It had a positive charge, but
now it took back an electron.

178
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,330
Now, it is neutral.

179
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,500
Now the rest of the molecule,
we have this OH

180
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,180
group right over here.

181
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,730
We have that OH group
right over there.

182
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:34,039
And now we have the actual
ethanol that has attached

183
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,289
itself, so it is no
longer ethanol.

184
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,820
It's attached itself to
this larger molecule.

185
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,390
So this oxygen right over here,
it still has one lone

186
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,980
pair, but the other lone pair
has been broken up, and it has

187
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,890
given an electron
to this carbon.

188
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,000
   

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,690
It is now bonded to the larger
molecule, and then the rest of

190
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,360
it, you have these one, two
carbons right there, and then

191
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,460
you have this hydrogen
right over there.

192
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,980
   

193
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,245
Remember, we have a bunch of
protons floating around.

194
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,480
   

195
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,490
Actually, I should
make it clear.

196
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,980
These are all reversible
reactions, so I actually

197
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,390
shouldn't even draw one-way
arrows here.

198
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,460
Let me scratch that out.

199
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,240
Actually, delete that.

200
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,710
A better thing to do, instead
of drawing these one-way

201
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,870
arrows is to show that the
reaction could actually go in

202
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,530
either direction.

203
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,030
It's just as likely to go from
here to here as it is from

204
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,900
there to there.

205
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,890
So let me draw that.

206
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:35,420
These are kind of in equilibrium
with each other.

207
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,960
So you can imagine the next
thing that could happen is

208
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,600
another oxygen could grab a
proton from the medium.

209
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,530
And actually, before I do that,
let me make sure this

210
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,700
guy can lose a proton
to the medium.

211
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,000
Actually, this guy could take
the proton from that guy, but

212
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,390
I won't do it that way.

213
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:57,550
So you could imagine a situation
where this proton

214
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,800
just jumps off.

215
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,080
   

216
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,320
I should have pointed it out.

217
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,100
This guy gave away an electron
to this carbonyl carbon.

218
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,300
So this right here has
a positive charge.

219
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,490
In general, the oxygen, very
electronegative, it's going to

220
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,750
be hogging the electrons
of this proton, so it

221
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,880
can take them away.

222
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,210
So far, we gained a
proton, and now we

223
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,770
can give back a proton.

224
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:27,320
So this electron right here can
go back to this oxygen,

225
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,350
making it neutral.

226
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,780
And the proton can be picked
up by anything.

227
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,800
It could be picked up by another
molecule of heptanoic

228
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,250
acid through this first
protonation we saw.

229
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,700
It could be picked up by another
molecule of ethanol.

230
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,730
Let me draw it like that.

231
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,275
Let me draw it as getting picked
up by another molecule

232
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,160
of ethanol.

233
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,520
It just gets thrown back
in the solution.

234
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,760
So this guy gives an electron
to the proton, but the end

235
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,240
result is the hydrogen leaves.

236
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,820
The electron goes back
to the oxygen.

237
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,040
It now has a neutral charge.

238
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,090
And once again, these are all
reversible reactions.

239
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,280
It can go in either direction.

240
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,620
But we're now over here,
and let me redraw

241
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,940
my heptanoic acid.

242
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,900
Two, three, four, five, six,
seven single bond now to the

243
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,580
oxygen, single bond
to this OH.

244
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,290
And now we have this bond right
over here to this now

245
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,080
deprotonated, what was ethanol,
so you have O, and

246
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,270
then we have one, two carbons,
just like that.

247
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,050
And this guy has a hydrogen
attached to it.

248
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,770
And I won't even bother to draw
this protonated ethanol.

249
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,080
The protons are flying
around everywhere.

250
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,020
Now, the next step, this guy,
this OH group, and especially

251
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,890
the oxygen in it, he could
grab a proton from the

252
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,940
surrounding solution.

253
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,930
So he's got these
two lone pairs.

254
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,360
He can grab a proton from one
of these protonated ethanols

255
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,710
from the sulfuric acid, or maybe
from one of these other

256
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,760
intermediate molecules,
from anywhere.

257
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,400
That's the whole point of having
this acid catalyst, so

258
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,460
he could donate an electron
to a proton and then

259
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,110
form a bond with it.

260
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,420
I'll keep it in that color.

261
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,850
And so if that happened, then
the next step in our

262
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,490
reaction-- and remember,
these can all

263
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,100
go in either direction.

264
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,270
The next step in our reaction
will look like this.

265
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,790
You would have your two, three,
four, five, six, seven

266
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:26,520
carbons, single bond to an
oxygen, and then you have your

267
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,360
bond to this oxygen, which is
bound to two carbons, one, two

268
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,110
carbons, just like that.

269
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,830
And this guy on top is
bonded to an oxygen.

270
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,650
He's got two lone pairs.

271
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,980
And this guy over here
grabbed a proton.

272
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,470
He gave an electron to
a hydrogen proton.

273
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,840
   

274
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,480
He had two, but now he gave one
of them to this proton.

275
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,440
And so he gave it to
that hydrogen.

276
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,460
That hydrogen is now neutral.

277
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,670
It gained an electron.

278
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,300
This oxygen is now positive,
because it

279
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,170
gave away an electron.

280
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,170
It still has this other
lone pair over here.

281
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:13,790
It is now positive, and frankly,
it is now a good

282
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,530
leaving group.

283
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,660
So, in the next step, you
can have someone else.

284
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,460
Remember, other people
need protons

285
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,520
earlier in this reaction.

286
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,150
So this proton might get lost,
maybe by one of the other

287
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,295
ethanol molecules, so
let me draw that.

288
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,780
Let me do a color I
haven't used yet.

289
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,110
I'll use orange.

290
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,010
So maybe one of the other
ethanol molecules, or one of

291
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,685
the other intermediaries
in this whole reaction.

292
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:36,250
So ethanol, I'll just
do ethanol because

293
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,530
it's easier to draw.

294
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,440
It might give an electron
to just the nucleus.

295
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,030
And then this guy can take
the electron back.

296
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,700
This guy could take that
hydrogen's electron back and

297
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,300
give it to this carbon that
was the carbonyl carbon

298
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,460
several steps ago.

299
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,690
And then since he's got that
electron, he can then give

300
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,520
back this electron to this, what
was an OH group, but now

301
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,510
it's got another hydrogen there,
so he can then give it

302
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,150
back to him.

303
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,900
And then the resulting products
will look like this.

304
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,180
And this is all in
equilibrium.

305
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,650
We now have two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons.

306
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,670
Now, this guy has a
double bond again.

307
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,010
So you have an oxygen
right there.

308
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,100
It is now a double bond.

309
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,130
I'll draw this newly formed
double bond in magenta.

310
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:33,450
This guy has left as water, so
I can just draw that, so now

311
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,490
you have this other OH group
that is bonded to this

312
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,780
hydrogen over here.

313
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,450
He has now left as water.

314
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,250
And now you have this other
thing over here.

315
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,360
You have what was that ethanol
group has now attached itself.

316
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,180
That ethanol has lost
its hydrogen.

317
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,390
It has attached itself to what
was a carboxylic acid, so now

318
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,000
it looks like this.

319
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,750
It now is bonded to an oxygen
and is bonded to one, two

320
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,440
carbons, just like that.

321
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,860
And this whole reaction that
I showed you is called

322
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,910
esterification, one of
those words that I

323
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,730
have trouble saying.

324
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,640
This one in particular
is called the Fischer

325
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,890
esterification.

326
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,450
   

327
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:26,290
And he won the Nobel Prize in
1902 generally for his work in

328
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,540
organic chemistry.

329
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:34,290
   

330
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,320
And the reason why it's called
that is we started with the

331
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
carboxylic acid.

332
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,810
We started with a heptanoic
acid, and

333
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,170
now we have an ester.

334
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,230
An ester is something that,
instead of an OH group like

335
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,010
you have in carboxylic
acid, you have an OR.

336
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,230
You have an oxygen with
an actual alkyl

337
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,870
group attached to it.

338
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,160
And this ester right here, and
we'll probably talk more about

339
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,720
esters in future videos, this
ester right here, just to give

340
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,690
you a hint of how to name it,
you first start with the group

341
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,930
that's attached to this
oxygen right here.

342
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:12,410
There are two carbons over
there, so we'll use ethyl to

343
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,900
name that over there.

344
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,340
And then we have the rest of
this, and we already know that

345
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,070
that is one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons,

346
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,350
including the carbon in
the carbonyl group.

347
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,785
And so that is hepta-,
heptan-.

348
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,550
   

349
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,570
And you would be tempted to call
it heptanoic acid, but it

350
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,580
is no longer a carboxylic
acid.

351
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,590
It is now an ester.

352
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,886
So you call it heptanoate.

353
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:45,170
   

354
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,230
And this is what tells
you that you are

355
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,410
dealing with an ester.

356
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,590
And this tells you what's on the
other side of the oxygen

357
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,490
in the ester.

358
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,360
This is telling you how many
carbons you have attached to

359
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,000
the carbonyl chain of
the actual ester.

360
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,380
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that useful.

361
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,310
I just wanted introduce you
to a well-known reaction

362
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,970
mechanism of creating an ester
out a carboxylic acid.

363
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,667
