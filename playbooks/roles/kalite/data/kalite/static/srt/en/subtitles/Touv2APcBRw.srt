1
00:00:00,654 --> 00:00:05,403
Factor twenty seven x to the sixth plus one twenty five

2
00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:07,999
So this is a pretty interesting problem and frankly

3
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:09,195
the only way to do this

4
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:11,904
is if you recognize it as a special form

5
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:12,907
and what I want to do

6
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:15,400
is kind of show you the special form right first

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,615
and then we can kind of pattern match.

8
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:19,156
So the special form is

9
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:20,526
if I were to take

10
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:22,601
and this is really something you need to know

11
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:25,876
and I'd argue whether you really need to know this

12
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:27,349
but actually to do this problem

13
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:28,538
it's something you need to know

14
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:29,801
and that's if you have

15
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:33,609
a squared minus a b plus b squared

16
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,840
and you multiply that times a plus b

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,409
let's think about what we're going to get

18
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,040
So we're gonna take a product right here

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,965
we're multiplying

20
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:43,048
so let's do some algebraic multiplication

21
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:46,215
so let's multiply b times b squared is b to the third

22
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:51,290
b times negative a b is negative a b squared

23
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,577
b times a squared is a squared b

24
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:58,810
Now let's multiply this top term times a

25
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,293
a times b squared is a b squared

26
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:08,718
a times negative a b is negative a squared b

27
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:12,190
and then a times a squared is a to the third

28
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,813
and then we just have to add up all of the terms

29
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:16,272
We have a negative a squared b -

30
00:01:16,272 --> 00:01:17,662
Oh, we have a positive a squared b

31
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:19,170
and a negative a squared b

32
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,005
so these guys cancel out

33
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:21,903
we have a negative a b squared

34
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:23,623
and a positive a b squared

35
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:25,174
These guys cancel out.

36
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:26,470
So all we're left with is

37
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,114
an a to the third here

38
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:29,577
a to the third

39
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:33,497
and then plus, plus this b to the third

40
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:35,004
plus this b to the third

41
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:36,582
Or another way to think about it

42
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:38,217
if someone gives you a to the third

43
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:39,876
plus b to the third

44
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:42,867
this can be factored into these two expressions

45
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:44,065
That can be factored into

46
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:46,558
a plus b times

47
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:51,615
a squared minus a b plus b squared

48
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:53,712
So this is essentially the special form

49
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:55,664
If you have a sum of cubes

50
00:01:55,664 --> 00:02:00,167
it can be factored out as the sum of the cube roots

51
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:03,184
plus- er, the sum of the cube roots times

52
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:04,752
this expression right here

53
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:06,346
and we just showed that it works

54
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:08,834
So let's see if we have that special form here

55
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:12,897
Well 27 is definitely the cube of three

56
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:14,965
three to the third power is twenty seven

57
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:18,547
x to the sixth is also the cube of x squared

58
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:21,155
if you raise x to the sixth to the one third power

59
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:23,030
you get x squared

60
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,595
So this first term right over here can be rewritten

61
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:29,351
as three x squared to the third power

62
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,266
and the second term right here-

63
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,272
that's five to the third power

64
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:35,383
so plus five to the third power

65
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:37,772
And this might be a little bit confusing for you

66
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:40,487
so just let's - never hurts to review

67
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:42,291
let's multiply three x squared times

68
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:46,319
three x squared times three x squared

69
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,525
that is literally equal to three times three

70
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:52,075
times three times x squared times x squared

71
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:53,617
times x squared

72
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:56,529
that's this part right here is twenty seven

73
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:58,385
x squared times x squared is x to the fourth

74
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:01,548
times x squared is x to the sixth

75
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,926
Or you could just raise both of these to

76
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:04,218
the third power

77
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,427
three to the third is twenty seven

78
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:07,145
x squared to the third power -

79
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,172
you take an exponent to an exponent

80
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:10,274
and you're gonna take the product

81
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,275
of the exponents

82
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,877
so it'll be x to the two times three or

83
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:15,476
x to the sixth power

84
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:18,086
So now we know that we have this pattern

85
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:19,685
So we can just use this

86
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,312
We have the sum of cubes

87
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:23,566
So just by using this pattern right over here

88
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,312
that means that we can factor it as

89
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,708
this is going to be equal to

90
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,111
three x squared

91
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,454
that's our a let me make it clear

92
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:34,754
this right here is our a

93
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:36,967
this right here is our b

94
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,392
so it's going to be a plus b

95
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:42,178
so it's going to be three x squared plus

96
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,322
b

97
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:46,981
plus five times a squared

98
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:48,400
a squared

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,355
let me do this in a new color

100
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:52,356
so three x squared squared

101
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:54,269
let's start thinking about that for a second

102
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,339
three x squared squared

103
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:57,903
well that's going to be nine

104
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,563
x to the fourth

105
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:02,176
so it's going to be times nine x to the fourth

106
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,169
minus the product of these two things

107
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:08,589
so minus the product of five and three x squared

108
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:11,996
so minus fifteen x squared

109
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:14,018
and then finally plus b squared

110
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:15,162
b is five

111
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:17,163
so it's going to be five squared

112
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:19,228
so plus twenty five

113
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:20,177
when I said b is

114
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,705
this is b - not the whole five to the third

115
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:24,067
and when I say a just this part is a

116
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:26,101
And we're done

117
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:26,961
and we could

118
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:28,916
I won't explain it in detail in this video

119
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:29,835
but this right here

120
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,485
if we're thinking about real numbers

121
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:33,954
we can't actually factor this any more

122
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:35,414
so we are done factoring this

123
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:37,189
And remember this is really just a very

124
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,498
very very special case of being able to recognize

125
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:45,026
the sum of cubes
