00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,530
Welcome to the third in this series of age word problems.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,060
And I just wanted to start off where I left off

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,210
in the second one.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,330
I got myself confused.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,350
You guys make me very nervous while you just sit there

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,170
listening and I have to perform for you.

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,170
But, it turns out we did get the right answer, if you say

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:24,420
Arman is one hundred and fifty-three and Tarush is seven hundred and sixty-five, then eighty-five years ago Arman would

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,970
have been sixty-eight and Tarush would have been six hundred and eighty.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,710
And notice that's ten times.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,030
So it worked out.

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,370
So we're ready to tackle another problem.

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,530
One more problem.

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,200
Let's see.

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:58,780
This problem says, Zack is four times as old as Salman.

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,580
What a coincidence.

17
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,550
Salman really shows up in a lot of problems.

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,340
So Zack is four times as old as Salman.

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:15,460
Zack is also three years older then Salman.

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,470
How old is Zack?

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,940
Well, actually this one actually seems fairly

22
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,610
straightforward.

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,820
We're not dealing with the present and the future.

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,160
We're just dealing with the present.

25
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,310
So let's see if we can figure this out.

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,520
So we're trying to figure out how old is Zack.

27
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,590
Let's say, z for Zack.

28
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,110
z equals Zack.

29
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,380
It says Zack is four times as old as Salman.

30
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,980
So, Salman, if Zack is z, this first sentence,

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,120
let me circle it.

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,160
Zack is four times as old as Salman.

33
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,730
So, if Zack is four times as old as Salman, that means that Sal

34
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:19,010
is equal to Zack divided by four, But then it also says here that

35
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,930
Zack is also three years older than Salman.

36
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,580
Well, if Zack is also three years older than Salman, so

37
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:35,300
that means that also Sal would be Zack minus three.

38
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,500
The first sentence says Zack is four times as old as Salman.

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,140
So that means if you take Zack's age and divide it

40
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,110
by four, you get Sal's age.

41
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,280
The second sentence says Zack is also three years

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,620
older than Salman.

43
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,880
So that means if you take Zack's age and you subtract

44
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,350
three from it, you get Sal's age again.

45
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,710
Well, we have our equation set up.

46
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,170
And, actually, instead of writing Zack, I should

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,430
have just written z.

48
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,640
But the equation is all set up for us.

49
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:05,490
We get z over four is equal to z minus three.

50
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,780
We can multiply both sides of this equation times four and we'll

51
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:15,680
get z is equal to fourz, remember to distribute, minus twelve.

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,270
And then, we'll skip a couple of steps.

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,020
And I get threez is equal to twelve.

54
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:28,810
And I get Zack is equal to four years old.

55
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,960
Let's see if that makes sense.

56
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,450
If Zack is four years old, then this first sentence says Zack

57
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,020
is four times as old as Salman.

58
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,380
So that means Sal is one year old.

59
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,690
It also says Zack is three years older than Salman.

60
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,560
Well, that's consistent.

61
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,570
four is three more than one.

62
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,340
So we were right.

63
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,390
Zack is exactly four years old.

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,610
Hope that helps.

65
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,080
Have fun.

66
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,900
I think you're ready.

67
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,810
You've now seen, at least, every type of

68
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,990
the age word problems.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,480
If you're still a little confused, you might just want

70
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,780
to re-watch the videos and maybe pause it right after I

71
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,050
give you the problem, and see if you can solve it yourself.

72
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,020
And remember, you had a lot of practice problems that you

73
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,330
can do on the actual modules themselves.

74
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,920
Have fun.
