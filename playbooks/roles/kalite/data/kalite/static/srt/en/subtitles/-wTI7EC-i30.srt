[music]

2
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:09,204
We're in Rome, at the Palazzo Barberini,

3
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:11,990
and we're looking at one of the most famous portraits

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,946
of Henry VIII [the Eighth], by Hans Holbein.

5
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:15,651
King Henry VIII, King of England,

6
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:19,465
on the occasion of his marriage to Anne of Cleves -

7
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:23,342
- a marriage that was purely political, and was his fourth -

8
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:24,733
- in a long series.

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,855
Yes. The portrait is a perfect expression of power.

10
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:29,938
- of authority.

11
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:33,305
Absolutely. It's a rectangular painting, slightly vertical,

12
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:34,898
but it's almost square.

13
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:37,974
He, himself, is almost square.

14
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:40,856
His body is almost a perfect square. It's true.

15
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:42,542
And he fills out the frame,

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,495
the entire shape of the panel.

17
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:46,791
Look at the horizontality of those shoulders.

18
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,054
It's almost absurd.

19
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:50,143
Of course, part of it is his costume,

20
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:54,083
but nevertheless there's a sense of his absolute presence.

21
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,973
His face is completely frontal,

22
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,095
but his shoulders are slightly tilted back,

23
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:00,875
so he's a little bit off center

24
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:04,703
and almost seems to be slightly moving forward toward us.

25
00:01:04,703 --> 00:01:06,436
So there's a little animation in the body.

26
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:08,847
But the face is absolutely static,

27
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:10,955
and he looks directly at us.

28
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:12,801
He rules us.

29
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:16,379
The date is written in gold letters, horizontally again,

30
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,091
above the shoulders, really emphasizing -

31
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:19,493
- his eyes.

32
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:20,829
Yes! Emphasizing his eyes,

33
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,395
because as we read across those letters,

34
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:25,811
we read directly into his eyes and so,

35
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:29,275
really interesting way of focusing our attention.

36
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:32,978
Mm-hmm. His clothing, beautiful details of

37
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:38,258
the gold stitching, and embroidery, and the jewels, fur,

38
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:44,347
but I almost read that circular necklace around his chest,

39
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:47,536
and then the circular form completed above his head

40
00:01:47,536 --> 00:01:49,224
almost like a halo.

41
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:52,312
Oh, interesting. Two arcs that really do frame his face.

42
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,318
Yeah, so he, you know, he has this almost sense of being divine in a way -

43
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:56,971
It's interesting.

44
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:59,361
- or drawing on that tradition, I think.

45
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:01,567
The white of the feathers of the hat,

46
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:02,388
and then the gold,

47
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,396
and the white of the pearls certainly support that.

48
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:06,961
Mmm-hmm. And then the way this white fabric,

49
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,382
this white cotton fabric kind of puts -

50
00:02:08,382 --> 00:02:09,971
- the tufts of - or silk maybe?

51
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:12,411
Yeah, or silk kind of - I mean, it's just fabulous.

52
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:12,950
It is.

53
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,892
The surface is so animated.

54
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:17,298
Just since we were talking about the geometry of the painting,

55
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:20,058
and you had pointed out the arc of the hat

56
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,405
and the arc of the necklace,

57
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:24,653
that arc is continued again by his arm and his belt;

58
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:25,410
- Right.

59
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,592
- and so, there's this real rhythm, in a sense,

60
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:30,308
that's set up across the surface of the painting,

61
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:31,481
just in a purely formal way.

62
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,491
- and a kind of balance between circular forms

63
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:34,871
and the rectangular forms.

64
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:37,722
Oh! Even his beard and his chin actually continue that as well,

65
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:39,646
and to some extent, his eyes.

66
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:41,558
But I think you pointed to something else

67
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:42,705
which is really interesting.

68
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:47,033
The background is this simple, deep aqua,

69
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,837
against which the tones of the flesh are beautifully contrast.

70
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,806
But the face itself is a broad plane,

71
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,089
just like the background.

72
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:57,059
And it's so beautifully offset against

73
00:02:57,059 --> 00:03:00,040
the almost absurd complexity of his wealth,

74
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,903
of his taste, of his authority,

75
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:03,540
represented in his garment.

76
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,580
The man who tames his clothing! [chuckles]

77
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,771
He's in control of his kingship.

78
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:12,152
Clothing represents that authority.

79
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:14,994
He's clutching with his right hand his gloves,

80
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,815
but he's got his thumb hooked around the belt

81
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:20,367
that actually holds his scabbard,

82
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,890
and you can see the handle of his sword

83
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,142
and its sheath just at the bottom right of the canvas.

84
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:29,985
And so, there's that threat that is never too far away.

85
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:33,516
Yeah. You said canvas, but this would be on a panel, right?

86
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:34,765
Oh, it's a panel. Yes, and I should -

87
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:35,639
So it would be oil on panel.

88
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,240
Yeah. And actually you can tell it's a panel,

89
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,391
because there's a kind of rigidity to the surface.

90
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:41,313
And we know we're in the north here,

91
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:43,111
we know we're coming from that northern tradition,

92
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:44,159
because of just the way that

93
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,818
he's painted all of those tiny details.

94
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:49,594
Well, that fascination with the nearly microscopic.

95
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:51,560
And you can see that in the brocade, absolutely.

96
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,015
You can see that in those large jewels,

97
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:56,698
in the silk that is pulled through. Absolutely.

98
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:57,850
What fun!

99
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:09,177
