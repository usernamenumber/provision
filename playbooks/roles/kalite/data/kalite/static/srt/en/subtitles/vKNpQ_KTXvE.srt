1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,760
Let's explore another example
of a binomial distribution.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,910
Let's say I'm playing
basketball and I know I'm going

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,190
to take 10 shots in the game.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,650
So I'm going to take 10 shots.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,990
Let's say that n
is equal to 10.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,260
That's the number
of shots I take.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,690
Let's just say that every shot
I take they're independent

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,920
events and that, in general,
I have a 30% chance of

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,670
making any given basket.

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,600
We're not going to get too
detailed of where I take

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,620
the basket from or are
they three pointers?

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,210
Or are they lay out?

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:30,860
Whatever.

14
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,760
Every time I take a shot I have
a 30% chance of making it.

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,410
So let's say the probability
of success is equal to 30%.

16
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,280
Probability is equal to 30%.

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,850
I just made that definition.

18
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:48,050
Let's define a random variable,
X, like we always do.

19
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:54,900
X is equal to number
of shots I make.

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,330
Number of shots/baskets I make.

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,900
And this one's a little bit
more interesting than the

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,110
flipping a coin example because
in the flipping a coin example,

23
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,390
heads or tails both had an
equal probability of happening.

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,570
In this situation, making
a shot is less likely

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,430
than not making a shot.

26
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,880
The not making a
shot-- let's say not.

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,750
Not making a shot, that
is equal to 1 minus the

28
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,130
probability of making a shot,
which is equal to 70%.

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,300
So there's a slight twist on
what we did before, but in some

30
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,220
ways this might be a more
interesting example to

31
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,930
your everyday life.

32
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,680
And let's see what the
distribution looks like.

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,555
And also, I'm taking more
shots now than I did before.

34
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:34,640
So it'll probably take a little
bit more time-- actually,

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,750
this is too much.

36
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,870
I don't want to waste
too much time.

37
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,760
Let's say I take 6 shots.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,220
And the random variable, X, is
the number of shots I make.

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,280
So let's think about how we
figure out this probability.

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,030
What is the probability
that X is equal to 0?

41
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,410
So I make no shots at all.

42
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,770
So I take 6 shots and
every shot I take I miss.

43
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,400
So in order for that to happen
this event has to happen

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,340
six times in a row.

45
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,630
So something with a 70%
probability has to happen six

46
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:13,520
times in a row, the probability
of this is 0.7-- it's 705--

47
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,130
times 0.7 times 0.7 times
0.7-- I'm getting confused.

48
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:29,130
It's 0.7 times 0.7 times 0.7
times 0.7 times 0.7 times 0.7.

49
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,410
Each of these are missing the
first shot, second shot, third

50
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,870
shot, and so forth and so on.

51
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,990
And this is equal to 0.7
to the sixth power.

52
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,990
Whatever that might be.

53
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,010
All right, and there's
only one way to do it.

54
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,220
I literally have to miss
every shot in order for

55
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,660
X to be equal to 0.

56
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,390
What's the probability that
I make exactly 1 shot?

57
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,110
I might make the first one and
then miss the other ones.

58
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,890
I might miss all of
them but the second.

59
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,810
I might miss all of
them, but the third.

60
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,290
So let's think about, what's
the probability of each

61
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,300
of those circumstances?

62
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,580
Let's say I make it.

63
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,780
I'll call that a make.

64
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,765
Too bad make and miss
both start with m.

65
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:15,910
Let's see, I'll call it
point-- point and miss.

66
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,750
So it could be like a
point and then 5 misses.

67
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,920
Could be a miss, a miss, a
miss, a point, a miss, a miss.

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,490
Now you can imagine, there's
5 of these scenarios.

69
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,330
There's actually 6
of these scenarios.

70
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,630
The shot that I make would be
in 1 of these 6-- I don't want

71
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,860
to use the word bucket because
we're already using a

72
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,720
basketball analogy.

73
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,750
But it can be in 1
of these 6 spots.

74
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,670
In one of the six
shots that I take.

75
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,790
So there's 6 of
these scenarios.

76
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,490
What's the probability
of each of these?

77
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,080
This is a 30% chance
of happening.

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,070
And then each of these are
70% chance of happening.

79
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:04,750
So it'd be 0.3 times 0.7
times 0.7 times 0.7

80
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,520
times 0.7 times 0.7.

81
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,540
This is 0.7 to the fifth.

82
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,210
Times 0.7 to the fifth.

83
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,580
That's the odds of
this happening.

84
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,440
What are the odds of
this one happening?

85
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,860
Well, let's see.

86
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,820
You have 0.7 times 0.7
times 0.7 times 0.3

87
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,570
times 0.7 times 0.7.

88
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,910
But if you think about it,
you're still taking 0.7

89
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,490
times itself five times.

90
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,380
0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7.

91
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,310
You're taking 0.7 to the fifth
power and you have to multiply

92
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,830
by 0.3 once as well.

93
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,760
So no matter where you make the
shot, the chances of any of

94
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,320
these permutations
independently are 0.3 times

95
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,660
0.7 to the fifth--
whatever that is.

96
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,690
And then how many ways
are there to do this?

97
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,700
Well, we just figured out.

98
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,640
There are 6 ways to do this.

99
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,160
You might make only
the first shot.

100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,910
You might make only the second
shot, only the third shot,

101
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,240
and so forth and so on.

102
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,280
So the probability that X is
equal to 1-- the probability

103
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,350
that our random variable is
equal to 1 is equal to 6 times

104
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,450
0.3 times 0.7 to the fifth.

105
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,980
And just so that we make it
clear and connect it all to the

106
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,160
binomial distribution, if we
were to have done the n

107
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,110
choose 0 here, what's the
binomial coefficient?

108
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,215
So in our example n is 6,
so what's 6 choose 0?

109
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:38,720
That's 6 factorial over
0 factorial, times 6

110
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,070
minus 0 factorial.

111
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,460
6 minus 0 is just 6.

112
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,440
So 6 factorial divided by 6
factorial, those cancel out.

113
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,295
You're left with 1.

114
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:50,880
But what's 0 factorial?

115
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,390
And this is one of those
bizarre definitional things in

116
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,150
mathematics, and I'll leave
you to think about it.

117
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,120
And I've addressed this
is previous videos.

118
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,420
But 0 factorial is actually--
so that it works out properly

119
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,720
is defined to be equal to 1.

120
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,740
And I did that to just show
you that this is the binomial

121
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,890
coefficient on this term.

122
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,900
So we just multiply it by 1.

123
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,580
That's why I never
even brought it up.

124
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,610
The probability of this
happening is 0.7 to the sixth.

125
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,270
And then you multiply it times
the binomial coefficient.

126
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,030
But there's only one way that
this can happen and that's

127
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,030
why this turned out to be 1.

128
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,970
I didn't want to confuse you so
I didn't bring all that up.

129
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,920
But we did still use the
binomial coefficient.

130
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,550
Let's think about
it in this one.

131
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,750
In this situation we're taking
6 shots, and we're choosing

132
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,740
only 1 of them to be made.

133
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,820
What's 6 choose 1?

134
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:44,580
That's 6 factorial over
1 factorial, divided by

135
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,100
6 minus 1 factorial.

136
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,650
That's 6 factorial divided
by-- well, 1 factorial

137
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,520
can be ignored.

138
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,140
That's just one.

139
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,230
Divided by 5 factorial.

140
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,320
Well, what's that?

141
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,230
That's 6 times 5 times 4
times 3 times 1 divided by

142
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,830
5 times 4 times 3 times 1.

143
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,890
So everything else cancels
out except for just

144
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,180
four of the 6's.

145
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,430
And so that's where
we got our 6 from.

146
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,220
We got it by reasoning,
which actually I think is

147
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,430
a better way to get it.

148
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,310
But I just wanted to show you
that we're still using the

149
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,450
binomial coefficients.

150
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,960
This is 6 choose 1.

151
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,120
And then we multiply that times
the probability of any of

152
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,430
these permutations happening.

153
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,580
And we figure that out
by we make 1 shot and

154
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,200
we miss the rest.

155
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,850
Let's keep going.

156
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,300
I think you'll get the hang
on this sooner than later.

157
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,410
What's the probability that
you make exactly two shots?

158
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,750
So what's the probability for
any given-- let's say I miss,

159
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,560
miss, miss, miss, and
then I get 2 points.

160
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,750
Or two shots.

161
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,860
I don't want to
get too confused.

162
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,400
Let's say they're all worth
1 point in this version of

163
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,360
basketball we're playing.

164
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,850
So here, what's
the probability?

165
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:57,540
If 0.7 times 0.7 times 0.7
times 0.7 times 0.3 times 0.3.

166
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,050
So this is 0.7 to the--
1, 2, 3, fourth power--

167
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,500
times 0.3 squared.

168
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,970
That's each of these
circumstances.

169
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,620
But this isn't the only way
that I can make 2 shots.

170
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,930
essentially I can choose any
two of these shots I take to

171
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,470
be the ones that I make.

172
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,280
I'm not picking it, but
the god's of probability

173
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,040
will pick it.

174
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,880
So this isn't the
only circumstance.

175
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,200
The probability of just this
circumstance, where I MAKE (Sal says accidentaly wrong)

176
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,700
exactly the last
2 shots is this.

177
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,390
But if I wanted to figure out
all of the different ways that

178
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,350
I can make exactly 2 shots, I
would essentially say, well,

179
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,450
I'm taking 6 shots and I'm
choosing 2 of them to be made.

180
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,980
So how many does
that result in?

181
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,300
Let's see.

182
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:50,460
6 factorial over 2 factorial
6 minus 2 factorial.

183
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,480
That is equal to-- I like
to multiply it out.

184
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,030
That's 6 times 5 times 4 times
2 times 1 over 2 times 1.

185
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,370
This is 4 factorial, 6
minus 2 is 4 factorial.

186
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,725
4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

187
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:06,450
And actually, I forgot
to write a 4 up here.

188
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,040
6 times 5 times 3 times
3 times 2 times 1.

189
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,700
Anyway, this cancels
out with that.

190
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,840
The 2 and the 6 is a
3, so it becomes 15.

191
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,700
So there are 15 possible ways
to make exactly two shots,

192
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,780
especially if you don't care
about the order in which-- I'm

193
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,380
not saying that this point and
this point, if they were

194
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,390
to happen the other way
around, it doesn't matter.

195
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,290
It's kind of the
same circumstance.

196
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,190
I made the last two shots.

197
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,640
It doesn't say I made the
second to last shot in one

198
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,340
way and I made the last
shot in the other way.

199
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,900
We're not differentiating
between, we're just saying

200
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,250
that we made them.

201
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,380
So that's why there's 15
different ways to make

202
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,040
2 shots out of 6.

203
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,800
And the probability of each
of those is 0.7 to the

204
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,000
fourth times 0.3 squared.

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,610
So the probability of making
exactly 2 shots is going to be

206
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:10,710
6 choose 2 times 0.7 to the
fourth times 0.3 squared.

207
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,060
And we can go on.

208
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,650
Let's do them fast.

209
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,650
The probability that I make
exactly 3 shots by the same

210
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,710
logic-- well, what's the
probability that I make

211
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,600
exactly-- in any one of the
circumstance-- well, how many

212
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,320
ways can I make 3 shots?

213
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,760
Well, I'm taking 6
and I'm choosing 3.

214
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,080
And then the probability of
each of those ways is, in

215
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,550
order to make 3 shots I'm
going to miss 3 shots.

216
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,820
And then I'm going
to make 3 shots.

217
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,550
That's straightforward enough
and we could calculate

218
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,900
what that is.

219
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,800
But hopefully you know it.

220
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,370
Let me just do it.

221
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:51,700
So that's 6 factorial over 3
factorial times 6 minus 3

222
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:59,520
factorial times this part--
0.7 third time's 0.3 squared.

223
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,400
Let's keep going and this
should actually get faster once

224
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,040
you-- see probability that
I make exactly 4 shots.

225
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,230
Well, I'm taking 6 and I'm
going to make 4 of them.

226
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,090
So I have to choose 4 out of 6.

227
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,170
So if I'm making 4 shots
I missing 2 shots, so

228
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,900
there's going to be
2 shots that I miss.

229
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,110
0.7 times 0.7.

230
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,360
That's the probability
of a miss-- 0.7.

231
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,320
And then I making 4 of them.

232
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,900
So 0.3-- there's a 30% chance
of making each of them.

233
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,940
So to make 4 it's
0.3 to the fourth.

234
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,600
So in any one of these ways
where I make 4 shots, this

235
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,590
is their probability.

236
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,080
And there are this many
ways of doing it.

237
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:44,330
And that's equal to 6 factorial
over 4 factorial times

238
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,210
6 minus 4 factorial.

239
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,460
And then times 0.7 squared
times 0.3 to the fourth.

240
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,970
And if you think,
this is 2 factorial.

241
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,850
We figured out what
that was up here.

242
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,790
6 choose 2 was the same thing.

243
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,040
It was 6 factorial over
2 factorial divided

244
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,680
by 4 factorial.

245
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,990
It's the same thing as
this, we just switched

246
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,400
the 4's and the 2's.

247
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,030
So this would also
be equal to 15.

248
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,260
Anyway, I'll probably do
that in the next video,

249
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,000
but let's just calculate
these really fast.

250
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,370
The probability that
X is equal to 5?

251
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,470
I make 5 shots.

252
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:25,110
That's 6 choose 5 times 0.7.

253
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,640
So I'm only missing
1 shot, right?

254
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,070
So the probability of missing 1
is 0.7 and then I have to make

255
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,960
5, not necessarily in a
row-- 0.3 to the fifth.

256
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,120
But you see, any given way
that I make exactly 5 shots,

257
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,240
this is the probability.

258
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,880
And there are this many
ways, 6 choose 5 ways of

259
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,310
making exactly 5 shots.

260
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,650
I could get the first 5
shots, miss the sixth.

261
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,780
I could get the last 5 shots.

262
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,335
I could make the first,
miss the second, et

263
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:55,850
cetera and so forth.

264
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,030
And then finally, the
probability that

265
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,290
X is equal to 6?

266
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,440
I make all of the shots.

267
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,590
That's 6 choose 6.

268
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:07,210
How many ways can I pick 6
things out of 6 choices?

269
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,260
And there's really
only one way.

270
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,640
You could calculate it
by calculating that.

271
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,380
Once again, you'll have to know
that 0 factorial is equal to 1.

272
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,100
I have to make all 6 shots.

273
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,370
So 0.3 to the sixth.

274
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,020
0.3 times 0.3 times 0.3
times 0.3-- anyway, I'm

275
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,070
all out of time again.

276
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,750
In the next video we're
going to graph this.
