00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,040
Welcome to solving a quadratic by factoring.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,960
Let's start doing some problems.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:13,470
So, let's say I had a function f of x is equal to x

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,400
squared plus six x plus eight.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,800
Now if I were to graph f of x, the graph is going to

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,780
look something like this.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,790
I don't know exactly what it's going to look like, but it's

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,410
going to be a parabola and it's going to intersect the x-axis

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,430
at a couple of points, here and here.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,450
And what we're going to try to do is determine what

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,470
those two points are.

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,790
So first of all, when a function intersects the

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,210
x-axis, that means f of x is equal to zero.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,810
Because this is f of x-axis, similar to the y-axis.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,750
So here f of x is zero.

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,410
So in order to solve this equation we set f of x to zero,

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:01,470
and we get x squared plus six x plus eight is equal to zero.

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,110
Now this might look like you could solve it pretty easily,

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,050
but that x squared term messes things up and you could

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,120
try it out for yourself.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,670
So we're going to do is factor this.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,650
And we're going to say that x squared plus six x plus eight, but

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,220
this can be written as x plus something times x

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,880
plus something.

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,200
It will still equal that, except that's equal to zero.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,650
Now in this presentation, I'm going to just show you the

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,970
systematic or you could say the mechanical way of doing this.

28
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,710
I'm going to give you another presentation on why this works.

29
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,410
And you might want to just multiply out the answers we

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,130
get in and multiply out the expressions and

31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,400
see why it works.

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,150
And the metod we're going to use is, we look at the

33
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,390
coefficient on this x term, six.

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,440
And we say what two numbers will add up to six.

35
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,840
And when those same two numbers are multiplied

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,650
you're going to get eight.

37
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,290
Well let's just think about the factors of eight.

38
00:01:53,290 --> 00:02:00,150
The factors of eight are one, two, four and eight.

39
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,660
well one times eight is eight, but one plus eight is nine, so that doesn't work.

40
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,610
two times four is eight, and two plus four is six.

41
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,030
So that works.

42
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:17,550
So we could just say x plus two and x plus four is equal to zero.

43
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,150
Now if two expressions or two numbers times each other equals

44
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,460
zero, that means that one of those two numbers or both of

45
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,980
them must equal zero.

46
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:37,780
So now we can say that x plus two equals zero, and x

47
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,870
plus four is equal to zero.

48
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,740
Well, this is a very simple equation.

49
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,680
We subtract two from both sides and we get x equals negative two.

50
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,020
And here we get x equals minus four.

51
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,020
And if we substitute either of these into the

52
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,460
original equation, we'll see that it works.

53
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,640
Minus two-- so let's just try it with minus two and I'll leave

54
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:07,050
minus four up to you --so minus two squared plus six times

55
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,930
minus two plus eight.

56
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:18,050
Minus two squared is four, minus twelve-- six times minus two --plus eight.

57
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,150
And sure enough that equals zero.

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,020
And if you did the same thing with negative four, you'd

59
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,810
also see that works.

60
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,590
And you might be saying, wow, this is interesting.

61
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,170
This is an equation that has two solutions.

62
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,030
Well, if you think about it, it makes sense because the graph

63
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:39,120
of f of x is intersecting the x-axis in two different places.

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,140
Let's do another problem.

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:56,570
Let's say I had f of x is equal to two x squared

66
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,830
plus twenty x plus fifty.

67
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,160
So if we want to figure out where it intersects the x-axis,

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,460
we just set f of x equal to zero, and I'll just swap the left and

69
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,650
right sides of the equation.

70
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:20,510
And I get two x squared plus twenty x plus fifty equals zero.

71
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,880
Now, what's a little different this time from last time, is

72
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,900
here the coefficient on that x squared is actually a two instead

73
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,130
of a one, and I like it to be a one.

74
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,670
So let's divide the whole equation, both the left

75
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,140
and right sides, by two.

76
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:42,450
I get x squared plus ten x plus twenty-five equals zero.

77
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,770
So all I did is I multiplied one / two times-- this is the same

78
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,210
thing as dividing by two --times one / two.

79
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,930
And of course zero times one / two is zero.

80
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,560
Now we are ready to do what we did before, and you

81
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,650
might want to pause it and try it yourself.

82
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,070
We're going to say x plus something times x plus

83
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,440
something is equal to zero and those two somethings, they

84
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,290
should add up to ten, and when you multiply them,

85
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,930
they should be twenty-five.

86
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,680
Let's think about the factors of twenty-five.

87
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,110
You have one, five, and twenty-five.

88
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,100
Well one times twenty-five is twenty-five.

89
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,250
one plus twenty-five is twenty-six, not ten.

90
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:30,160
five times five is twenty-five, and five plus five is ten, so five actually works.

91
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:34,630
It actually turns out that both of these numbers are five.

92
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,680
So you get x plus five equals zero or x plus five equals zero.

93
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,870
So you just have to really write it once.

94
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,580
So you get x equals negative five.

95
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,010
So how do you think about this graphically?

96
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,280
I just told you that these equations can intersect the

97
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,470
x-axis in two places, but this only has one solution.

98
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,910
Well, this solution would look like.

99
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:05,070
If this is x equals negative five, we'd have a parabola that just

100
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,000
touches right there, and then comes back up.

101
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,870
And instead of intersecting in two places it only

102
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,560
intersects right there at x equals negative five.

103
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,100
And now as an exercise just to prove to you that I'm not

104
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:24,270
teaching you incorrectly, let's multiply x plus five times x plus

105
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,360
five just to show you that it equals what it should equal.

106
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,730
So we just say that this is the same thing is x times x plus

107
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:39,940
five plus five times x plus five.

108
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:47,190
x squared plus five x plus five x plus twenty-five.

109
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,400
And that's x squared plus ten x plus twenty-five.

110
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,770
So, it equals what we said it should equal.

111
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,310
And I'm going to once again do another module where I explain

112
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,860
this a little bit more.

113
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,220
Let's do one more problem.

114
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,920
And this one I am just going to cut to the chase.

115
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:15,240
Let's just solve x squared minus x minus thirty is equal to zero.

116
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,550
Once again, two numbers when we add them they equal-- whats the

117
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,850
coefficient here, it's negative one.

118
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,080
So we could say those two numbers are a plus b equals

119
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,750
minus one and a times b will equal minus thirty.

120
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,040
Well let's just think about what all the factors are of thirty.

121
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:46,580
one, two, three, five, six, ten, fifteen, thirty.

122
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,920
Well, something interesting is happening this time though.

123
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,310
Since a times b is negative thirty, one of these numbers

124
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:55,990
have to be negative.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,370
They both can't be negative, because if they're both

126
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,800
negative then this would be a positive thirty.

127
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,940
a times b is negative thirty.

128
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,610
So actually we're going to have to say, two of these factors,

129
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,020
the difference between them should be negative one.

130
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,920
Well, if we look at all of these, all these numbers

131
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,850
obviously when you pair them up, they multiply out to thirty.

132
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:22,190
But the only ones that have a difference of one is five and six.

133
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,690
And since it's a negative one, it's going to be-- and I know

134
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,750
I'm going very fast with this and I'll do more example

135
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,260
problems --this would be x minus six times x plus

136
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,000
five is equal to zero.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,840
So how did I think about that?

138
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,150
Negative six times five is negative thirty.

139
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,160
Negative six plus five is negative one.

140
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,540
So it works out.

141
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,990
And the more and more you do these practices-- I know it

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,570
seems a little confusing right now --it'll make

143
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,890
a lot more sense.

144
00:08:52,890 --> 00:09:00,000
So you get x equals six or x equals negative five.

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,130
I think at this point you're ready to try some solving

146
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,600
quadratics by factoring and I'll do a couple more modules

147
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,980
as soon as you get some more practice problems.

148
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,510
Have fun.
