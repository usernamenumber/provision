99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Find the 8th term of the sequence 1440,1716,1848....,whose terms are formed by multiplying the corresponding

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
terms of two arithmetic sequences.lets think about the two sequences and then we will take the product

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of corresponding terms to get the term of this sequence .So maybe one of the arithmetic sequences starts

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with a and then next term in that sequence is going to be some 'constant + a'.Thats what arithmetic sequences
