1
00:00:00,237 --> 00:00:07,303
Let's now use our understanding of some of the operations on sets to get some blood flowing to our brains.

2
00:00:07,303 --> 00:00:11,969
I've defined some sets here, and just to make things interesting, I haven't only put numbers in these sets.

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,503
I've also put some colours and some little yellow stars here.

4
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:18,823
What I want you to figure out is, what would this set be?

5
00:00:18,823 --> 00:00:24,771
This crazy thing that involves relative complements, intersections, unions, absolute complements.

6
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:28,705
I encourage you to pause it and try to figure out what this set would be.

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,520
Let's give it a shot. The key here is really to break it down.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,035
Work on the stuff in the parentheses first

9
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:39,500
just as you would do if you were trying to parse a traditional mathematical statement

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,168
and then it should hopefully make a little bit of sense.

11
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:48,482
A good place to start is to try to figure out what is the relative complement of C in B (B\C)

12
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:51,082
or another way of thinking about it is what is B minus C,

13
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,681
what is B if you take out all the stuff with C in it?

14
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:55,148
Let me write this down:

15
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:59,555
The relative complement of C in B, or you could call this B minus C

16
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:03,415
this is all the stuff in B with all the stuff in C taken out of it.

17
00:01:03,415 --> 00:01:05,219
Let's think about what this would be.

18
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:10,149
B has a 0, does C has a 0? No, so we don't have to take out the 0.

19
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:15,388
B has a 17, does C have a 17? Yes it does, so we take out the 17.

20
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:19,219
B has a 3 but C has a 3 so we take that out.

21
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:27,637
B has a "blue", C doesn't not have a "blue", so we leave the blue in.

22
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:32,885
B has a gold star but C also has a gold star so we take the gold star out.

23
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:41,224
The relative complement of C in B is just the set of 0 and this "blue" written in blue.

24
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,765
Now it gets interesting.

25
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:51,622
We're going to take the absolute complement of that.

26
00:01:51,622 --> 00:02:11,104
The absolute complement of this business (B\C) is going to be the set of all things in our universe

27
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:24,632
that are neither a 0 or a blue.

28
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:28,500
That's the only way I can describe it right now, I haven't really defined the universe well.

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,466
We already see that our universe definitely contains some integers

30
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,899
it contains some colours, it contains some stars

31
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:39,832
so this is all I can really say: it's the set of all things that are neither a 0 or a blue.

32
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:43,834
So far we've figured out all of this stuff.

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:59,699
Now we want to find the intersection of A and this business.

34
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:08,106
It's going to be A intersected with the absolute complement of the relative complement of C in B.

35
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:13,701
This is going to be the intersection of the set A and the set of all things in the universe

36
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:16,969
that are neither a 0 or a blue.

37
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:21,486
It's essentially the things that satisfy both of these things.

38
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:27,759
It has to be in set A, and it has to be in the set of all things in the universe that are neither a 0 or a blue.

39
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,283
Let's think about what this is.

40
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:35,425
The number 3 is in the set A and it's in the set of all things in the universe that are neither a 0 or a blue

41
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,010
so let's throw a 3 in there.

42
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,497
The number 7 is in A and in the set of all things in the universe that are neither a 0 or a blue

43
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:44,011
so let's put a 7 there.

44
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:47,630
-5 also meets that constraint.

45
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,594
A 0 does not meet that constraint.

46
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:56,296
A 0 is in A but it's not in the set of all things in the universe that are neither 0 or blue because it is a 0

47
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:58,261
so we're not going to throw a 0 in there.

48
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:03,594
Then a 13 is in A and it's in the set of all things in the universe that are neither a 0 or a blue

49
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:06,259
so we could throw a 13 in there.

50
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:14,630
We've simplified things a good bit, all of this crazy business has simplified to this set right over here.

51
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:26,494
Now we want to find the relative complement of this business in A.

52
00:04:26,494 --> 00:04:38,163
I'll just actually write out the set. I'll write out both of them so we can really visualize them both right over here.

53
00:04:38,163 --> 00:05:01,600
A is 3, 7, -5, 0 and 13, and relative complement with all of this business which we figured was a 3, 7, -5 and 13.

54
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,296
So essentially, start with this set (the first one) and take out all the things that are in this set (the second one).

55
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:07,395
This is going to be equal to:

56
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:14,035
We're going to take out a 3, 7, -5, and 13 out of the set

57
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:18,037
so we're just left with a set that contains a 0.

58
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:24,929
So all of this business right over here has simplified to a set that only contains 0.

59
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:30,670
Now let's think about what B intersect C is.

60
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,155
These are all of the things that are in both B and C.

61
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:37,093
This is going to be:

62
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:39,826
0 is not in both of them.

63
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:43,765
17 is in both of them, so we'll throw a 17 there.

64
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:47,901
The number is 3 in both of them.

65
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:50,624
Blue is not in both of them.

66
00:05:50,624 --> 00:05:55,236
The star is in both of them.

67
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:57,624
That's B intersect C.

68
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:01,876
We're essentially going to take the union of this crazy thing, which ended up just being a set with a 0 in it

69
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:04,375
we're going to take the union of that with B intersect C

70
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:10,569
and, we deserve a drumroll now, this is all going to be equal to, when we combine these two sets

71
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:19,156
it's going to be a set with a 0, 17, 3, and our gold star.

72
00:06:19,156 --> 99:59:59,999
And we are done!
