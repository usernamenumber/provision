1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,030
All right.

3
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,000
We're on problem number 9.

4
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,440
At least for the next few, I
don't think I have to copy and

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,020
paste these problems.
I can just write it.

6
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,670
It looks like a little bit of
algebraic long division.

7
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:18,140
Problem 9: They want us to
divide 2x plus 7 into-- it's

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,310
pretty long so I'll give it some
space-- 2x to the fourth

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:34,110
plus 21x to the third plus 35x
squared minus 37x plus 46.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,670
This might look daunting,
but once you

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,560
start, it's not so bad.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,520
So like any long division,
you kind of look

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,560
at the biggest place.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,890
And the largest degreed place,
at least in this polynomial,

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,330
is the 2x place.

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,290
And that's what we work with.

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,820
So we say, how many times does
2x go into 2x to the fourth?

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,160
Well, let's see.

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,900
The 2 goes into the 2 one time,
and x goes into x to the

20
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,050
fourth x to the third times.

21
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,415
What's x to the fourth
divided by x?

22
00:00:57,415 --> 00:00:58,570
It's x to the third.

23
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,570
So we say it goes into it
x to the third times.

24
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,604
And if we were right, when we
multiply, we should get 2x to

25
00:01:04,604 --> 00:01:04,994
the fourth.

26
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:10,630
So x to the third times 2x
is 2x to the fourth.

27
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:18,700
And then x to the third times
7 is plus 7x to the third.

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,000
If this was some other-- well,
we'll worry about it when we

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,940
get to it, but you would want
to put it under the

30
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,190
appropriate place
in this number.

31
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,640
It just happened to be that x to
the third was the next one.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,600
Now you subtract just like you
do with regular long division.

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,450
These cancel out.

34
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,715
21 minus 7 is 14x
to the third.

35
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:38,800
   

36
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,470
And then you could bring down
all of this, but we can worry

37
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,280
about that in a second.

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,940
So how many times does 2x go
into 14x to the third?

39
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,840
Well, 2 goes into 14 seven
times, plus 7, and x goes into

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,480
x to the third x
squared times.

41
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,980
If we're right, when we
multiply, it should work out.

42
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,960
So 7x squared times 2x is equal
to 14x to the third,

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,310
like we thought it should.

44
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,090
7x squared times 7 is what?

45
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:15,130
That's plus 49x squared.

46
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,870
And now we subtract.

47
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,840
14x to the third minus
14x to the third.

48
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,170
That's 0.

49
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,650
Now we have 35-- we could bring
this down, just because

50
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,050
it makes it easier.

51
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,490
35x squared.

52
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,580
35x squared minus 49x squared.

53
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:31,990
Let's see.

54
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,120
So it's minus 14, right?

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,810
49 minus 35.

56
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,840
So it's minus 14x squared.

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,640
And then 2x goes into
minus 14x squared.

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,570
So 2 goes into minus 14 minus 7
times, and then x goes into

59
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,230
x squared x times.

60
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,690
When you multiply this minus 7x
times 2x, so you get minus

61
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,262
7 times 2 is minus 14.

62
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,610
x times x is x squared.

63
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,390
Of course, you have
to multiply it

64
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,690
times both terms, right?

65
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,430
We're multiplying it times
this whole expression.

66
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:13,670
Minus 7x times 7 is minus 49x.

67
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,640
Now we're ready to subtract
again and I'm

68
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,140
running out of space.

69
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,560
These cancel out.

70
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,210
We could bring this minus
37x down, so minus 37x.

71
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,040
Remember, we're subtracting
this, right?

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,170
We could almost add
the negative.

73
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,350
Let's make the negative.

74
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,250
So this is minus 37x minus minus
49x is the same thing as

75
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,220
minus 37x plus 49x.

76
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,360
I made both of those
positive just to

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,620
simplify it in my brain.

78
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:43,900
Oh, whoops.

79
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,880
I didn't want to go
down that much.

80
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,320
OK.

81
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,560
So these cancel out and then
this is equal to 12x.

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,320
And 2x plus 7 goes into 12x.

83
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,950
Well, now, let's see.

84
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,010
2 goes into 12 six times, x goes
into x one time, so then

85
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,530
this is equal to plus 6.

86
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,980
6 times 2x plus 7.

87
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,800
6 times to 2x-- I know you
can't see it-- is 12x.

88
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:19,029
And then 6 times the 7 is 42.

89
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,709
We have a 46 up there.

90
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,720
I should have written smaller.

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,500
So you get this 46.

92
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,390
And now we're ready
to subtract again.

93
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,340
12x minus 12x is 0.

94
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,030
46 minus 42 is 4, so we
have a remainder of 4.

95
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,360
So let's see, our answer
is all of this

96
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,430
with a remainder 4.

97
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,380
So all of that plus the
remainder over what we're

98
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,190
using to divide into:
2x plus 7.

99
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,620
So our answer, let's see
what choice it is.

100
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,050
It's x to the third plus 7 x
squared minus 7x plus 6 plus 4

101
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,750
over 2x plus 7.

102
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,990
We just took our remainder and
said, OK, whatever this is,

103
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,410
that's also there.

104
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:05,100
So that is choice-- let's see, x
to the third plus 7x squared

105
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:15,340
minus 7x plus 6 plus
4 over 2x plus 7.

106
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,500
   

107
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,850
So it's actually choice
d is our answer.

108
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,940
I was just reading choice a.

109
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,300
I should have shown you that.

110
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,360
So choice d is our answer.

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,310
Next question.

112
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,530
Problem number 10.

113
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,000
That one took up more space
than I expected.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,510
Problem number 10.

115
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,900
Which polynomial represents-- so
they want us to multiply--

116
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,330
this how they write it-- 3x
squared plus x minus 4 times

117
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,230
2x minus 5.

118
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,520
I find that we should just
multiply these the way I would

119
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,500
multiply any number.

120
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,110
So I would rewrite it as 3x
squared plus x minus 4 times,

121
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,250
and I put the same degree under
the same degree, times

122
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,560
2x minus 5.

123
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,650
And now let's take the
0th degree place.

124
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,590
I guess you could
view that way.

125
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,470
Minus 5 times minus
4 is plus 20.

126
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,310
Minus 5 times x minus 5x.

127
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:25,370
Minus 5 times 3x squared
is minus 15x squared.

128
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,380
2x times minus 4 is minus 8x.

129
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,800
I'll put it in this place
because that's our x's space.

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,400
2x times x is 2x squared.

131
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,940
   

132
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,110
And then I should have had all
of this-- actually, I think I

133
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,040
can do that.

134
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,830
Let me see if I can move all
of this to the right.

135
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,740
The magic of computers.

136
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,720
I can move it all to the right,
although I should color

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,300
that back in.

138
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,020
Let's see if I can color that.

139
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,060
Look at that!

140
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,830
All right, back in business.

141
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,170
All right.

142
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,930
So I did 2x times minus
4 is minus 8x.

143
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,500
2x times x is 2x squared.

144
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:10,950
2x times 3x squared is
6x to the third.

145
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,070
This is a plus.

146
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,390
Now we just add up everything.

147
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:21,672
So we get 6x to the third minus
15 plus 2 minus 13x

148
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:28,130
squared minus 13x plus 20.

149
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,550
So 6x to the third minus 13x
squared-- I'm just checking

150
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,200
all the choices-- minus
13x plus 20.

151
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,880
That's choice b.

152
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,340
Problem 11.

153
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,360
Problem 11.

154
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,770
Let's see, they wrote-- this
is problem 11, just so you

155
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,600
know what we're doing.

156
00:07:50,600 --> 00:08:01,380
Minus 2x squared plus 6x plus
1 minus 2 times 4x squared

157
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,350
minus 3x plus 1 is equal to--
well now, we just have to

158
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,590
simplify this.

159
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,590
Let me rewrite this part.

160
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,595
This is minus 2x squared
plus 6x 1.

161
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:17,510
   

162
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,940
Let's distribute a minus 2.

163
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:25,250
So minus 2 times 4x squared
is minus 8x squared.

164
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,440
That's that.

165
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,200
Minus 2 times minus 3x,
that's plus 6x.

166
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,710
Minus 2 times 1 is minus 2.

167
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,409
And now, let's see.

168
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,730
We can add the like terms up.

169
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,630
Let's see what this
is equal to.

170
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,789
Let's do the x squared term.

171
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:47,250
So first I'll do the minus 2x
squared and minus 8x squared,

172
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,120
so that is minus 2 minus 8,
that's minus 10x squared.

173
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,270
Let me do another color
for each of them.

174
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,610
Then I have the x terms. I
have 6x, and then I have

175
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,930
another 6x.

176
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,240
You add them together, you
get 12x, plus 12x.

177
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,960
And then you have your ones
terms or x to the 0th power,

178
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,570
you can view it.

179
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,270
You have plus 1 and minus
2, so that's minus 1.

180
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:19,430
And then that is choice-- let's
see, let me scroll down.

181
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,130
That is choice d. minus 10x
squared plus 12x minus 1.

182
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,270
Choice d.

183
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,370
Problem number 12.

184
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,570
Problem 12.

185
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,820
We're on a roll.

186
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,070
   

187
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,645
Problem 12: Which expression
is equivalent to-- so now

188
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,380
they're multiplying.

189
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:47,950
They write 6y squared minus
2 times 6y plus 2.

190
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,230
You could do this in your head,
and you should practice

191
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,810
doing it in your head, but if
you never want to make a

192
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,850
mistake, you just write
it like this.

193
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,900
6y squared.

194
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,680
And I have nothing
in the x's spot.

195
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,470
And I say minus 2.

196
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,590
And then this one is 6y.

197
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,520
I write that in the y spot.

198
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,070
This is y squared, this is y,
this is y to the 0, which is

199
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,850
just 1, plus 2.

200
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,960
And now I multiply them.

201
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,670
2 times minus 2 is minus 4.

202
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,690
2 times 6y squared
is 12 y squared.

203
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,520
So I write that in that
spot, 12y squared.

204
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,380
Now 6y times minus
2 is minus 12y.

205
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,630
So that'll go here.

206
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,520
   

207
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:36,340
And then 6y times 6y squared
is 36y to the third.

208
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,520
So we have our answer.

209
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,747
It is-- you just add them up--
36y to the third plus 12y

210
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:48,450
squared minus 12y minus 4.

211
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,270
And that is choice d.

212
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,030
And you could do this in your
head, and that's a good thing

213
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,660
to practice.

214
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,480
But I just wanted to make sure
it was clean when I did it.

215
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,980
And let's see, should I continue
with the next video

216
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,340
or should I stop there?

217
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,230
Because I'm at 11 minutes.

218
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,510
I'll stop there and I'll see
you in the next video.

219
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,000
