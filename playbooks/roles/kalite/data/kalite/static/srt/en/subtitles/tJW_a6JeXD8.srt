1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,430
   

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,360
In the last video we talked
about the idea that if I start

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,570
with some type of a string
there, and if I were to take

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,870
the left end of the string-- I
could just have equally have

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,370
done the right, but if I take
the left end of the string and

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,280
jerk it up, then all the way
down, and then back to its

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,890
resting position, it'll generate
this disturbance in

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,460
the string.

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,190
And the disturbance might
initially look like this after

10
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,270
I've done that jerking
up and down once.

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,960
And that disturbance is going to
propagate down the string.

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,330
It's going to move down
the string like that.

13
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,090
Let me color this in black.

14
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,950
So this is right after I do that
first cycle-- that first

15
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,870
jerking up and down.

16
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,300
The string might look
something like that.

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,710
And if we wait a little while,
the string might look

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,420
something like this, assuming
that I only did that once.

19
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,980
The string might look something
like this, where

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,630
that pulse has actually
propagated down the string.

21
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,570
That pulse has propagated
down the string.

22
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,675
And in the last video, we said,
hey, this disturbance

23
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:57,520
that's propagating down the
string, or propagating down

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,580
this medium-- although it
doesn't necessarily have to

25
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:05,180
have a medium- we called this
a wave. And in particular,

26
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,690
this wave right here,
this is a pulse.

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,260
This is a pulse wave because we
only have, essentially, one

28
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,140
perturbation of the string.

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,010
Now if I kept doing that-- if I
kept going up and down, and

30
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,290
up and down, essentially, if I
periodically did it at regular

31
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,430
intervals, then my
string would look

32
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,680
something like this.

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,660
   

34
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,070
Doing my best to
draw it neatly.

35
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,550
It might look something like
this, where once again, the

36
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,280
perturbations are going
towards-- the disturbances are

37
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,830
going to move to-- the right.

38
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,870
They're going to move to the
right with some velocity.

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,510
And what I want to do in this
video is really focus on this

40
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,390
type of wave. This type of wave
right here, which you can

41
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,310
imagine, since I'm periodically
moving this left

42
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,200
side up and down, up and down,
and creating these periodic

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,370
movements in the wave, we call
this a periodic wave. This is

44
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:08,979
a periodic wave. The motion is
repeated over and over again.

45
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,980
So what I want to talk about is
some of the properties of a

46
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,190
periodic wave. Now, the first
thing you might say is, hey,

47
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,990
how far are you jerking
it up and down?

48
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,630
How far are these movements
from rest?

49
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,130
So if this is the resting
position right there, how far

50
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,590
are these movements above the
resting position and below the

51
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,640
resting position?

52
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,430
And we call that the amplitude
of the wave. So that distance

53
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,170
right there- I'll do it in
magenta-- that distance right

54
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,420
there is the amplitude.

55
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,340
   

56
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,660
Sometimes mariners will have
an idea of wave height.

57
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,660
Wave height, they normally refer
to from the bottom--

58
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,560
from the trough-- of
a wave to its peak.

59
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,730
Amplitude, we're talking
about from the resting

60
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,480
position to it's peak.

61
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,950
So let me label peak.

62
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,160
I think you know what
peak means.

63
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,300
Peak is the highest point on
the wave. That's the peak.

64
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,580
And that's the trough.

65
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,510
If you're in a fishing boat and
you wanted to see how big

66
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,280
a wave is, you'd probably care
about the wave height-- not so

67
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,920
much if your boat's sitting down
here, you have to care

68
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,760
about this whole distance.

69
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,780
But anyway, we won't talk
too much about that.

70
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,600
So that's the first interesting
idea behind a

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,170
wave. And not all waves are
being generated by Sal

72
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,980
jiggling a string on
the left-hand side.

73
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,430
But I think you get the idea
that these waves can represent

74
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,680
many different-- this graph can
represent many different

75
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,290
types of wave forms. And this,
essentially, displacement,

76
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,290
from the resting position, or
from the zero position, that

77
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,330
is your amplitude.

78
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,210
Now the next question you might
ask is, OK, I know how

79
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,890
far you're jiggling this string
up and down, but how

80
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,850
quickly are you doing it?

81
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,730
So how long does it take for you
to go all the way up, all

82
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,050
the way down, and back again?

83
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,630
So how long for each cycle?

84
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,070
Cycle is me going up,
down, back again.

85
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,190
How long for each cycle?

86
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,640
Or you might say how long
for each period?

87
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,760
We're saying this is periodic.

88
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,350
Each period is each repetition
of the wave. So this idea of

89
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,205
how long for each cycle, we
call that the period.

90
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:25,590
   

91
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,560
And this is going to
be a unit of time.

92
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,420
Maybe I'm doing it every
two seconds.

93
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,570
It takes me two seconds to
go up, down, back again.

94
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,610
Up, down, back again.

95
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,080
That's going to be
two seconds.

96
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,570
A very related term is,
how many cycles

97
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,820
am I doing per second?

98
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:53,730
   

99
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,500
So in other words, you
could say, how many

100
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,840
seconds for each cycle?

101
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,090
We could even write that.

102
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,870
   

103
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,200
So for example, a period might
look like something like 5

104
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,260
seconds per cycle.

105
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,240
Or maybe it's 2 seconds
per cycle.

106
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,870
But what if we're asked how
many cycles per second?

107
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,600
So we're asking the
opposite question.

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,480
It's not how long, how many
seconds does it take for me to

109
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,270
go up, down, and back again.

110
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,200
We're saying in each second, how
many times am I going up,

111
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,440
down, back again?

112
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,080
So how many cycles per second?

113
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,510
That's the inverse of period.

114
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,600
So period, the notation
is normally a big

115
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,160
capital T for period.

116
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,410
This is frequency.

117
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:49,210
   

118
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,430
It's normally denoted by an F.

119
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,770
And this, you're going to
say cycles per second.

120
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,240
So if you're going 5 seconds per
cycle, that means you're

121
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:08,550
doing 1/5 of a cycle or, 1/5
of a cycle per second.

122
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,510
All I did is invert
this right there.

123
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,560
And that make sense.

124
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,490
Because the period and the
frequency are inversions of

125
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:14,860
each other.

126
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,160
This is how many seconds
per cycle.

127
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,550
How long does one up, down,
back again take?

128
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,710
And this is how many up,
down, back agains

129
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,670
are there in a second?

130
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,040
So they are inverses
of each other.

131
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,090
So we could say that frequency
is equal to 1 over the period.

132
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,180
Or you could say that
period is equal

133
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,580
to 1 over the frequency.

134
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,860
So if I told you that I'm
vibrating the left end of this

135
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:49,060
rope at 10 cycles per second--
and, by the way, the unit of

136
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,300
cycles per second, this is a
hertz, so I could have also

137
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,120
written this down as 10
hertz, which you've

138
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,000
probably heard before.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,360
10 hertz just means 10
cycles per second.

140
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,770
If my frequency is 10 cycles per
second, my period is going

141
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,540
to be 1 over that.

142
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:13,580
So 1 over 10 seconds per cycle,
which makes sense.

143
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,680
If in 10 times, I can go up and
down, a whole up, down,

144
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,560
back again, if I can do that
10 times in a second, it's

145
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,690
going to take me 1/10 of a
second to do it each time.

146
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,460
Now another question we might
ask ourselves is, how quickly

147
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,170
is this wave moving, in this
case, to the right?

148
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,010
Since I'm jiggling the left
end of the string.

149
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,700
How quickly is it moving
to the right?

150
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,170
So the velocity.

151
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,770
So to do that, we need to figure
out how far did the

152
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,200
wave go after one cycle?

153
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,270
Or after one period?

154
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,750
So after I jiggled this once,
how far did the wave go?

155
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,520
What is this distance from this
resting point to this

156
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,010
resting point there?

157
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,370
And we call that a wavelength.

158
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,760
   

159
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,480
And there's a lot of different
ways you can define a

160
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,060
wavelength.

161
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,160
You could view a wavelength as
how far the initial pulse went

162
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,070
after completing exactly
one cycle.

163
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,390
Or you could view it as the
distance from one peak to

164
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,360
another peak.

165
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
That is also going to
be the wavelength.

166
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,070
Or you could view it as a
distance from one trough to

167
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,100
the other trough.

168
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,390
That's also the wavelength.

169
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,240
Or in general, you could view
the wavelength as one exactly

170
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
equal point on the
wave. From that

171
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,700
distance to that distance.

172
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,970
That is also one wavelength.

173
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,940
Where you're completing, between
that point and that

174
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,150
point, you're completing one
entire cycle to get exactly

175
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,090
back to that same point.

176
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,500
And when I say exactly back to
that same point, this point

177
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,450
doesn't count.

178
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,220
Because this point, although
we're in the same position,

179
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,670
we're now going down.

180
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,940
We want to go to
the point where

181
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,330
we're in the same position.

182
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,390
And notice over here,
we're going up.

183
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,890
We want to be going up again.

184
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,590
So distance is not
one wavelength.

185
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,530
To go one wavelength,
we have to go

186
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,780
back to the same position.

187
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,340
And we're moving in the
same direction.

188
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,920
So this is also one
wavelength.

189
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,630
So if we know how far we've
travelled after one period--

190
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:22,220
let me write it this way;
wavelength is equal to how far

191
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:31,625
the wave has traveled
after one period.

192
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,590
   

193
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,170
Or you could say after
one cycle.

194
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,130
   

195
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,020
Because remember, a period is
how long does it take to

196
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,540
complete one cycle.

197
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,340
One to complete up, down,
and back again notion.

198
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,600
So if we know how far we've
traveled, and we know how long

199
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,750
it took us, it took us one
period, how can we figure out

200
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,350
the velocity?

201
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:02,175
Well, the velocity is equal to
distance divided by time.

202
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:09,450
   

203
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,340
For a wave, your velocity--
and I could write it as a

204
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,260
vector, but I think you
get the general idea.

205
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,800
Your velocity-- what's
the distance

206
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,650
you travel in a period?

207
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:23,390
Well, the distance you travel in
a period is your wavelength

208
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,640
after one up, down,
back again.

209
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,210
The wave pulse would have
traveled exactly that far.

210
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,910
That would be my wavelength.

211
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,830
So I've traveled the distance of
a wavelength, and how long

212
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,850
did it take me to travel
that distance?

213
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,180
Well, it took me a period
to travel that distance.

214
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,170
So it's wavelength divided
by period.

215
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,320
   

216
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,790
Now I just said that 1 over the
period is the same thing

217
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,410
as the frequency.

218
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,910
So I could rewrite this
as wavelength.

219
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,570
And actually, I should
be clear here.

220
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,540
The notation for wavelength
tends to be the

221
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,810
Greek letter lambda.

222
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,550
So we could say velocity
is equal to

223
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,510
wavelength over period.

224
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,170
Which is the same thing
as wavelength

225
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,110
times 1 over my period.

226
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,050
And we just said that 1 over the
period, this is the same

227
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,570
thing is your frequency.

228
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,650
So velocity is equal to

229
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,600
wavelength times your frequency.

230
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,090
And if you know this, you can
pretty much solve all of the

231
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,470
basic problems that you might
encounter in waves.

232
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,400
So for example, if someone
tells you that I have a

233
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:42,520
velocity of-- I don't know-- 100
meters per second to the

234
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,940
right, so in that direction--
velocity you have to give a

235
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:54,410
direction-- and they were to
tell you that my frequency is

236
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,770
equal to-- let's say my
frequency is 20 cycles per

237
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,370
second, which is the same
thing as 20 hertz.

238
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,790
So literally, if you had a
little window where you're

239
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,410
only able to observe this part
of your wave, you'd only

240
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,160
observe that part
of my string.

241
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,020
If we're talking about 20 hertz,
then in 1 second, you

242
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,960
would see this go up and
down twenty times.

243
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,020
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

244
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,410
18, 19, 20.

245
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,280
In exactly one second,
you would see this go

246
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,510
up and down 20 times.

247
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,960
That's what we mean by the
frequency being 20 hertz, or

248
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,590
20 cycles per second.

249
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,495
So, they gave you
the velocity.

250
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:34,470
They gave you the frequency.

251
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,380
What's the wavelength here?

252
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,380
So the wavelength, in this
situation-- you would say the

253
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,130
velocity-- your velocity is
equal to your wavelength times

254
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,780
your frequency.

255
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,380
Divide both sides by 20.

256
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,470
And actually, let me make sure
I get the units right.

257
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:58,110
So this is meters per second,
is equal to lambda times 20

258
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,450
cycles per second.

259
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,610
So if you divide both sides by
20 cycles per second, you get

260
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:14,010
100 meters per second times
1/20 seconds per cycle.

261
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,490
And then this becomes a 5.

262
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,370
This becomes a 1.

263
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,760
So you get 5, and then the
seconds cancel out.

264
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,680
So you get 5 meters per cycle.

265
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,830
So this is equal to 5 meters per
cycle, which would be your

266
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,150
wavelength in this situation.

267
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,350
So it's 5 meters.

268
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,130
You could say 5 meters per
cycle, but wavelength implies

269
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,810
that you're talking about
the distance per cycle.

270
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,760
So in this situation, if this is
moving to the right at 100

271
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,440
meters per second and this
frequency-- I see this moving

272
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,830
up and down 20 times in a
second-- then this distance,

273
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,700
right here, must be 5 meters.

274
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,050
Likewise, we can figure out
the period very easily.

275
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,710
The period here is just going
to be 1 over the frequency.

276
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:06,470
It's going to be 1/20
seconds per cycle.

277
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,190
So using these formulas-- and I
don't want you to memorize a

278
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,350
formula, it should be
intuitive for you.

279
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,470
And hopefully, this video made
it a little bit intuitive.

280
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,380
But using this, you can really
answer almost any question if

281
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,770
you're given two of these
variables and you need to

282
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,990
solve for the third.

283
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,190
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
