1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,010
   

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,120
Let's do one more homogeneous
differential equation, or

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,190
first order homogeneous
differential equation, to

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,530
differentiate it from the
homogeneous linear

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,810
differential equations
we'll do later.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,040
But anyway, the problem
we have here.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,110
It's the derivative of y with
respect to x is equal to--

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,550
that x looks like a
y-- is equal to x

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,090
squared plus 3y squared.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,312
I'm writing it a little
bit small, so that I

11
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:31,970
don't run out of space.

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,670
Divided by 2xy.

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,270
So in all of these homogeneous
equations-- and obviously, we

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,370
don't know it's homogeneous
yet.

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,440
So we have to try to write
it as a function of

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,910
y divided by x.

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,930
So it looks like we could do
that, if we divide the top and

18
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,110
the bottom by x squared.

19
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,450
So if we just multiply-- let
me do it in a different

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,370
color-- 1 over x squared,
or x to the negative 2,

21
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,240
over 1 over x squared.

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,370
We're essentially just
multiplying by 1.

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,860
And then, that is
equal to what?

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:11,370
1 plus 3y squared over x squared
divided by 2-- if you

25
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,110
divide x, divide by x squared,
you just get a 1 over x-- so 2

26
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,610
times y over x.

27
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,730
Or we could just rewrite the
whole thing, and this is just

28
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:27,930
equal to 1 plus 3y over
x squared divided by 2

29
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,260
times y over x.

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,840
So yes, this is a homogeneous
equation.

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,260
Because we were able to write
it as a function of

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,490
y divided by x.

33
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,570
So now, we can do the
substitution with v.

34
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,200
And hopefully, this is starting
to become a little

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,750
bit of second nature to you.

36
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,610
So we can make the substitution
that v is equal

37
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,720
to y over x, or another way of
writing that is that y is

38
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,660
equal to xv.

39
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,150
And then, of course, the
derivative of y with respect

40
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,130
to x, or if we take the
derivative with respect to x

41
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,100
of both sides of this, that's
equal to the derivative of x

42
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,060
is 1 times v, this is just the
product rule, plus x times the

43
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,050
derivative of v with
respect to x.

44
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,545
And now, we can substitute the
derivative of y with respect

45
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,490
to x is just this.

46
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,270
And then the right hand side
of the equation is this.

47
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,360
But we can substitute
v for y over x.

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,230
So let's do that.

49
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,180
And so we get v plus x.

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,020
Instead of dv [? dv ?]

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,570
x, I'll write v prime for now,
just so that I don't take up

52
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,150
too much space.

53
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:36,420
v prime is equal to 1 plus 3v
squared, we're making the

54
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,475
substitution v is equal
to y over x.

55
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:41,800
   

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,140
All of that over 2v.

57
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,320
   

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,290
Now, let's see what we can do.

59
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,970
This is where we just get our
algebra hat on, and try to

60
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,990
simplify until it's a separable
equation in v.

61
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,860
So let's do that.

62
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,950
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 2v.

63
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:08,250
So we'll get 2v squared plus 2xv
v prime-- 2v times x, yep,

64
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:14,570
that's 2xv v prime-- is equal
to 1 plus 3v squared.

65
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,760
Now let's see, let's subtract
2v squared from

66
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,350
both sides of this.

67
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:29,580
And we will be left with 2xv v
prime is equal to 1 plus--

68
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,700
let's see, we're subtracting
2v squared from both sides.

69
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,520
So we're just left with a 1 plus
v squared here, right?

70
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,800
3v squared minus 2v squared
is just v squared.

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,080
And let's see, we want it to be
separable, so let's put all

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,420
the v's on the left hand side.

73
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:51,900
So we get 2xv v prime
divided by 1 plus v

74
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,640
squared is equal to 1.

75
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,350
And let's divide both
sides by x.

76
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,100
So we get the x's on
the other side.

77
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,210
So then we get 2v-- and
I'll now switch back

78
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,100
to the other notation.

79
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,520
Instead of v prime,
I'll write dv dx.

80
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,760
2v times the derivative of v
with respect to x divided by 1

81
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,140
plus v squared is equal to-- I'm
dividing both sides by x,

82
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,200
notice I didn't write the x on
this side-- so that is equal

83
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,560
to 1 over x.

84
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,970
And then, if we just multiply
both sides of this times dx,

85
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,310
we've separated the two
variables and we can integrate

86
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,940
both sides.

87
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,710
So let's do that.

88
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,530
Let's go up here.

89
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,290
I'll switch to a different
color, so you know I'm working

90
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,540
on a different column now.

91
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,400
So multiply both sides by dx.

92
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:51,050
I get 2v over 1 plus v squared
dv is equal to 1 over x dx.

93
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,640
And now we can just integrate
both sides of this equation.

94
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,960
This is a separable equation
in terms of v and x.

95
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,980
And what's the integral
of this?

96
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,860
At first, you might think, oh
boy, this is complicated.

97
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,750
This is difficult, maybe some
type of trig function.

98
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,110
But you'll see that it's
kind of just the

99
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,740
reverse chain rule.

100
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,860
We have a function here,
1 plus v squared,

101
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,500
an expression here.

102
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,890
And we have its derivative
sitting right there.

103
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,040
So the antiderivative of this,
and you can make a

104
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,070
substitution if you like.

105
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,790
You could say u is equal to 1
plus v squared, then du is

106
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,240
equal to 2v dv.

107
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,360
And then, well, you would
end up saying that the

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,320
antiderivative is just
the natural log of u.

109
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,760
Or, in this case, the
antiderivative of this is just

110
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,640
the natural log of
1 plus v squared.

111
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,440
We don't even have to write
an absolute value there.

112
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,940
Because that's always going
to be a positive value.

113
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,820
So the natural log of
1 plus v squared.

114
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,260
And I hope I didn't
confuse you.

115
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,120
That's how I think about it.

116
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,670
I say, if I have an expression,
and I have its

117
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,630
derivative multiplied there,
then I can just take the

118
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,860
antiderivative of the
whole expression.

119
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,060
And I don't have to worry about
what's inside of it.

120
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,980
So if this was a 1 over an x,
or 1 over u, it's just the

121
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,270
natural log of it.

122
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,460
So that's how I knew that this
was the antiderivative.

123
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,170
And if you don't believe me,
use the chain rule and take

124
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,770
the derivative of this,
and you'll get this.

125
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,570
And hopefully, it will make
a little bit more sense.

126
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,880
But anyway, that's the left
hand side, and then that

127
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,000
equals-- Well, this
one's easy.

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,630
That's the natural log, the
absolute value of x.

129
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,180
We could say, plus c, but just
so that we can simplify it a

130
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,640
little bit, an arbitrary
constant c, we can really just

131
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,100
write that as the natural log of
the absolute value of some

132
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,400
constant c.

133
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,400
I mean, this is still some
arbitrary constant c.

134
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,880
So we can rewrite this whole
equation as the natural log of

135
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,900
1 plus v squared is equal to--
when you add natural logs, you

136
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,240
can essentially just multiply
the two numbers that you're

137
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,640
taking the natural log of-- the
natural log of, we could

138
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,710
say, the absolute value of cx.

139
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,760
And so the natural log of
this is equal to the

140
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,150
natural log of this.

141
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:07,010
So we could say that 1 plus
v squared is equal to cx.

142
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,850
And now we can unsubstitute
it.

143
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,700
So we know v is equal to y
over x, so let's do that.

144
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:22,541
So we get 1 plus y over x
squared is equal to cx.

145
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,240
Let me scroll this down
a little bit.

146
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,100
Let's multiply both sides of the
equation times x squared.

147
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,730
We could rewrite this as y
squared over x squared.

148
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,900
So we multiply both sides times
x squared, you get x

149
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:41,500
squared plus y squared is equal
to cx to the third.

150
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,370
And we're essentially done.

151
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,040
If we want to put all of the
variable terms on left hand

152
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,010
side, we could say that this is
equal to x squared plus y

153
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,210
squared minus cx to the
third is equal to 0.

154
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,200
And this implicitly defined
function, or curve, or however

155
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,980
you want to call it, is the
solution to our original

156
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,480
homogeneous first order
differential equation.

157
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,340
So there you go.

158
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,780
I will see you in
the next video.

159
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,340
And now, we're actually
going to do something.

160
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,260
We're going to start embarking
on higher order

161
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,980
differential equations.

162
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,190
And actually, these are more
useful, and in some ways,

163
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,630
easier to do than the
homogeneous and the exact

164
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,740
equations that we've
been doing so far.

165
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,720
See you in the next video.

166
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:21,900
