1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So here x is 0, y is 2.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
3 times 0 plus 6 times 2
is equal to 0 plus 12.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Doesn't equal 2, it equals 12.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This one doesn't work.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm just taking 3 times
x plus 6 times y and

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
seeing what it equals.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In this case, we have 3 times
0 plus 6 times y.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Plus 6 times 6.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well that's 0 plus 36.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That doesn't equal 2.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Can't be that choice.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This one, we have 3,
this 3, times 1.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Plus 6 times this y.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
6 times minus 1/6.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's 3.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's equal to 3.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then, 6 times 1/6
is 1, but we have a

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative out there.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's minus 1.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That is equal to 2.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that works.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
3 times 1 plus 6 times negative
1/6 is equal to 2.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So our answer is C.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Problem 29.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me see if I need to cut
and paste this one in.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All right.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So yeah, I think it's
a good idea.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me see.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Copy and paste it.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me copy and paste the next
several problems. We could

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just move-- be streamlined
about it.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, they all fit.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Good enough.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the equation of the line
that has slope of 4 and

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
passes through the point
3 comma minus 10?

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if the slope is 4, we know
that the line-- so just

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
rewrite it in slope y-intercept
form again.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
mx plus b.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They're telling us that
the slope is 4.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we know the equation of the
line is y is equal to 4x plus

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the y-intercept.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we could figure
out the y-intercept by

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
substituting in this point that
they say it goes through.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it goes through the point
3 comma negative 10.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So y is equal to minus 10
when x is equal to 3.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 4 times x.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x is equal to 3.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Plus b.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what is that?

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's minus 10 is equal
to 12 plus b.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We could subtract 12 from both
sides of this equation, and we

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
get minus 22.

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Minus 10 minus 12 is minus 22.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This 12 obviously goes away.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Is equal to b.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the equation of our line is y
is equal to 4x plus b, which

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we just figured out
is minus 22.

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4x minus 22.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's choice A.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Problem 30.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The date in the table show the
cost of renting a bicycle by

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the hour, including a deposit.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If hours, h, were graphed on the
horizontal axis-- let me

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
see if I can draw that.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that is on the horizontal
axis I have hours, h.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is h.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And costs were graphed on the
vertical axis, so let me draw

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the vertical axis.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So cost is on the
vertical axis.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What would be the equation of
the line that fits the data?

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, so they just want to know
cost as a function of hours.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a linear relationship.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We could treat this just
like any other line.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we write it as
y equals mx plus b.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I didn't even have to do this.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So y is equal to mx plus b.

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So m, or the slope, is equal to
change in y over-- or let

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
me write it differently.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because we want it in terms of--
so we could write c is

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to the slope times
the hours plus b.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Instead of x, we have hours, and
instead of y, we have the

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cost.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what's the slope?

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Slope is equal to change in the
dependent variable, change

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in cost, divided by change in
the independent variable,

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
divided by change in hours.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If when our hours increased
by 3, how much did our

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
change in c go by?

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When we go from 2 to 5, so if
we say 5 minus 2, that's how

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
much we changed in hours.

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's delta h.

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then how much did we
change in cost?

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well it's 30 minus 15.

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it equals 15 over 3.

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is equal to 5.

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we figured out the slope.

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Slope is equal to 5.

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we just have to figure
out the y-intercept.

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this equation, we could
rewrite it as cost is equal to

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the slope, which is 5, times
the hours plus whatever our

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
y-intercept is.

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we just have to
substitute one of the points

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in to solve for b, just like we
did in the previous video.

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's substitute the point
when h is equal to 2, c is

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to 15.

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the point 2 comma 15.

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So when h is equal to
2, c is equal to 15.

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
c is equal to 15 when
h is equal to 2.

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And now we can just
solve for b.

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you get 15 is equal
to 10 plus b.

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Subtract 10 from both sides,
you get b is equal to what?

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
5.

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the equation of this line is
cost is equal to 5 times h

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus our y-intercept, or plus
our c-intercept we could say.

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So plus 5.

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
5h plus 5, and that
is choice C.

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if you try it out
with these points,

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it should all work.

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, next problem.

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me see.

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think this cutting and
pasting works out well.

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think I have time for
at least two more.

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, let me clear this.

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Clear this one right here.

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me paste it in.

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, it says, some ordered pairs
for a linear function of

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x are given in the
table below.

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's kind of like
the last one.

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which of the following equations
was used to generate

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the table above?

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well we could do the same thing
we did the last time.

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We could say OK, this is going
to have some relation.

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You know y is equal
to mx plus b.

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's going to be a line
and this is the

139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
slope y-intercept form.

140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they tell us it's
the linear function.

141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's why we can immediately
say that's going

142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to be a line.

143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's no x squared or
anything like that.

144
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So a good place to start
is just with the slope.

145
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So slope is equal to change
in y over change in x.

146
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see.

147
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When x goes from 1 to 3,
what does y go for.

148
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It goes from 1 to 7.

149
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So change in x is equal to
3 minus 1 or just 2.

150
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what's change in y?

151
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
7 minus 1.

152
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that is equal to
6 over-- oh, no.

153
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sorry.

154
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Change in x was 3 minus 1.

155
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sorry about that.

156
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
3 minus 1.

157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's 6 over 2.

158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When x changes by 2-- that's
this 2, change in x-- y

159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
changes by 6.

160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's change in y.

161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the slope is 3.

162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the equation of our line is
going to be y is equal to 3x

163
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus some y-intercept.

164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And now we could substitute
some points in.

165
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's substitute this one.

166
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This 1, 1 seems easy.

167
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So y is equal to 1 when
x is equal to 1.

168
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we get 1 is equal
to 3 plus b.

169
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Subtract 3 from both sides of
this equation and we get what?

170
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1 minus 3 is minus 2 is equal
to-- obviously, this

171
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
disappears, 3 minus 3.

172
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So b is equal to minus 2.

173
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the equation of our line,
we have a slope of 3 and a

174
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
y-intercept of minus 2.

175
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The equation is going to be
y is equal to 3x plus b.

176
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well b is minus 2.

177
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So minus 2.

178
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that is choice C.

179
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
32.

180
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The equation of line l is
6x plus 5y equals 3.

181
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And equation of line q is 5x
minus 6y is equal to 0.

182
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which of the statements about
the two lines are true?

183
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, let's see.

184
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They have the same
y intercept.

185
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They're parallel.

186
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They have the same
x-intercept.

187
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lines l and q are
perpendicular.

188
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well I'll tell you how you can
identify perpendicular lines.

189
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They have the negative inverse
of each other's slope.

190
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But I don't know if that's going
to come into play yet.

191
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I always find it easier to look
at these lines in kind of

192
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the slope y-intercept form.

193
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's do that.

194
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So line l can be 6x plus
5y is equal to 3.

195
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we were to subtract 6x
from both sides you get 5y is

196
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to minus 6x plus 3.

197
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then you divide both sides
by 5 and you get y is equal to

198
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus 6/5 x plus 3/5.

199
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is line l right here.

200
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll do line q in a
different color.

201
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So q is 5x minus 6y
is equal to 0.

202
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's subtract 5x
from both sides.

203
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You get minus 6y is
equal to minus 5x.

204
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you divide both sides by
negative 6, you get y is equal

205
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to-- minus 5 divided
by negative 6.

206
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's 5/6 x.

207
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, it actually looks like
D comes into play.

208
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because the slope of this
one is minus 6/5.

209
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the slope of line l.

210
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The slope of line q is the
inverse of that made negative.

211
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
At this point it's a good
thing to memorize.

212
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I haven't proven
it to you yet.

213
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you want a line that has a
slope perpendicular to this

214
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one, or a line that is
perpendicular to this one will

215
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
have a negative inverse slope.

216
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the inverse of this is minus
5/6 and the negative

217
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
inverse is plus 5/6.

218
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is the negative
inverse of that.

219
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So these lines are actually
perpendicular.

220
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that is D.

221
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
See you in the next video.

222
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're on problem 27.

223
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the question is, which
equation best represents the

224
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
graph above?

225
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So before even looking at the
choices, let's see what we can

226
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
figure out about the graph.

227
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what's its y-intercept?

228
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we said that this is the
equation of a line, we said y

229
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to mx plus b where m is
the slope and y is-- and b

230
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the y-intercept.

231
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's late, I'm getting
slightly muddled.

232
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what's the y-intercept?

233
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well when x is equal to
0, y is equal to 0.

234
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is going to
be equal to 0.

235
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The y-intercept is 0.

236
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When x is equal to 0,
why is equal to 0.

237
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the y intercept is 0.

238
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we know that this has a form
y is equal to mx where m

239
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is a slope.

240
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's figure out the slope.

241
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Slope is equal to change in y
for a given change in x or

242
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
change in y over change in x.

243
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So when we increase x by 1, how
much are we increase-- or

244
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
decrease y by?

245
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well then y increases by 2.

246
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we could say that equals y
changes by 2, by plus 2 when x

247
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
changes by plus 1.

248
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we get the slope is equal to
2, so the equation of this

249
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
line is y is equal to 2x.

250
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which is choice B.

251
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Next problem.

252
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which point lies on the line
defined by 3x plus

253
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
6y is equal to 2?

254
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well the best thing to do is
just probably to substitute

255
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these numbers in for x and y
and see which one works.
