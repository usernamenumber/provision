1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,180
In the last video, we started
with a linear transformation

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,520
S, that was a mapping between
the set x, that was a subset

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,510
of Rn to the set y.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,390
And then we had another
transformation that was a

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,540
mapping from the set
y to the set z.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,060
And we asked ourselves,
given these two linear

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,900
transformations, could
we construct a linear

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,320
transformation that goes all
the way from x to z?

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,780
What we did was we made
a definition.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,820
We said let's create something
called the

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,290
composition of T with S.

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,180
What that is, is first you apply
S to some vector in X to

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,535
get some vector in Y.

15
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:40,990
And that's your vector
right there.

16
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,090
And then you apply T to
that, to get to z.

17
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,720
And so we defined it that way.

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,420
And our next question was, was
that a linear transformation?

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,890
We show that it was.

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,010
It met the two requirements
for them.

21
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,620
And because it is a linear
transformation, I left off in

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,440
the last video saying that
it should be able to be

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,870
represented by some matrix
vector product.

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,440
Where this will have to
be an l by n matrix.

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,690
Because it's a mapping from an n
dimensional space, which was

26
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,300
x-- it was a subset of Rn--
to an l dimensional space.

27
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,860
Because z is a subset of Rl Now
in this video, let's try

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,340
to actually construct
this matrix.

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,130
So at the beginning of the last
video, I told you that T

30
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,050
of x could be written as some
matrix product, B times x.

31
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,170
Let me write that and rewrite
it down here.

32
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,090
So I told you that the linear
transformation T applied to

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,900
some vector x, could be written
as the matrix vector

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,410
product, B times a vector x.

35
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:49,540
And since it was a mapping from
an m dimensional space to

36
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,170
an l dimensional space, we know
this is going to be in l

37
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,800
by m matrix.

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,000
Now similarly, I told you that
the transformation S can also

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,780
be written as a matrix
vector product.

40
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,729
Where we can say A is its
matrix representation

41
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,160
times a vector x.

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,060
And since S was a mapping from
an n dimensional space to an m

43
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,950
dimensional space, this will
be an m by n matrix.

44
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,780
   

45
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:32,600
Now by definition, what was the
composition of T with S?

46
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,460
What is this?

47
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,680
By definition, we said that this
is equal to-- you first

48
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,590
apply the linear transformation
S to x.

49
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,890
And I'll arbitrarily
switch colors.

50
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,000
So you first apply the
transformation S to x.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,400
And that essentially gets you
a vector right there.

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
This is just a vector in Rm.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,360
Or it's really a vector in y,
which is a subset of Rm.

54
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,600
And then you apply the
transformation T to that

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,460
vector to get you into z.

56
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:07,170
   

57
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,340
Given this we can use our matrix
representations to

58
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,620
replace this kind of
transformation representation.

59
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,830
Although they're really
the same thing.

60
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,110
What is a transformation
of S applied to x?

61
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:25,830
Well this right here is just
A times x, where this

62
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,530
is an m by n matrix.

63
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,800
So we can say that this is equal
to the transformation

64
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,480
applied to A times x.

65
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,080
Now, what is the T
transformation applied

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,410
to any vector x?

67
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,740
Well that's the matrix B
times your vector x.

68
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,960
So this thing right here is
going to be equal to B times

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
whatever I put in there.

70
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,790
So the matrix B times the matrix
A times the vector x

71
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,710
right there.

72
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,010
This is what our composition
transformation is.

73
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,440
The composition of T with S
applied to the vector x.

74
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,730
Which takes us from the set x
all the way to the set z is

75
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,140
this, if we use the matrix
forms of the two

76
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,700
transformations.

77
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,850
Now at the end of last video I
said I wanted to find just

78
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,500
some matrix that if I were to
multiply times this vector,

79
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,260
that is equivalent to
this transformation.

80
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,800
And I know that I can
find this matrix.

81
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,100
I know that this exists because
this is a linear

82
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,440
transformation.

83
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,910
So how can we do that?

84
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,180
Well, we just do what we've
always done in the past. We

85
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,040
start with the identity matrix,
and we apply the

86
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,370
transformation to every column
of the identity matrix.

87
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,980
And then you end up with your
matrix representation of the

88
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,530
transformation itself.

89
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,200
So first of all, how
big is the identity

90
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,750
matrix going to be?

91
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,600
Well, these guys that we're
inputting into our

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,500
transformation, they are subsets
of x, or they're

93
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,960
members of x, which is
an n dimensional

94
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,410
space, a subset of Rn.

95
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:13,920
   

96
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,460
So all we do to figure out C
is we start off with the

97
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,710
identity matrix.

98
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,880
   

99
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,610
The n dimensional identity
matrix, because

100
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,110
our domain is Rn.

101
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,705
And of course we know what
that looks like.

102
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:31,340
   

103
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,600
We have 1, 0 all the way down.

104
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,880
It's going to be an n by n
matrix, and then 0, 1 all the

105
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,540
way down 0's.

106
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,410
These 0's right here, and then
you have 1's go all the way

107
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,430
down the columns and everything
else is 0.

108
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,680
We've seen this multiple times
that's what your identity

109
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,970
matrix looks like, just 1's down
the column from the top

110
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,700
left to the bottom right.

111
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,340
Now to figure out C, the matrix
representation of our

112
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,060
transformation, all we do is we
apply the transformation to

113
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,950
each of these columns.

114
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:12,580
So we can write that our matrix
C is equal to the

115
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,900
transformation applied
to this first column.

116
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,615
What is the transformation?

117
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:23,150
It is the matrix B times the
matrix A times whatever you're

118
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,450
taking the transformation of.

119
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,190
In this case we're taking the
transformation of that.

120
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,850
We're taking the transformation
of 1, 0, 0 all

121
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,380
the way down.

122
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,100
There's 1 followed by
a bunch of 0's.

123
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,350
That's going to be our
first column of C.

124
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:42,370
Our second column of C is going
to be B times A times

125
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,300
the second column of our
identity matrix.

126
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,650
And, of course, you remember
these are each the standard

127
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,980
basis vectors for Rn.

128
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:57,220
   

129
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,740
So this is going to be times
E2, which is a 0, 1,

130
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,290
0 all the way down.

131
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,560
And then we're going to keep
doing that until we do get to

132
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,700
the last column, which is B
times A times a bunch of 0's

133
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,680
all the way down
until get a 1.

134
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,970
The nth term is just
a 1 right there.

135
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,110
Now what is this going
to be equal to?

136
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,540
It looks fairly complicated
right now.

137
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,970
But all you have to do is make
the realization-- and we've

138
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,500
seen this multiple times.

139
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,490
If we write our vector A or we
write our matrix A as just a

140
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,690
bunch of column vectors.

141
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:40,610
So this is a column vector A1,
A2, all the way to An.

142
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,150
   

143
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,413
We already learned that this
was and n by m matrix.

144
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:48,690
   

145
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:56,670
Then what is the vector A times,
for example, x1, x2 to

146
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,140
all the way down to xn.

147
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,800
We've seen this multiple
times.

148
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:12,390
This is the equivalent to x1
times A1 plus x2 times A2, all

149
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,210
the way to plus xn times An.

150
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,460
We've seen this multiple
times.

151
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,290
It's a linear combination of
these column vectors where the

152
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,000
waiting factors are the terms
in our vector that we're

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,470
taking the product of.

154
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,620
So given that, what is this
guy going to reduce to?

155
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,410
This is going to be A1 times
this first entry right here,

156
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,100
times x1, plus A2 times a second
entry, plus A3 times a

157
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,559
third entry.

158
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,900
But all these other
entries are 0.

159
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,189
The x2's all the way
to the xn are 0's.

160
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:43,789
So you're only going to end
up with 1 times the first

161
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,590
column here in A.

162
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,680
So this will reduce to--
let me write this.

163
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:56,820
So the first column is going
to be B times-- now A times

164
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,780
this E1 vector, I guess we could
call it, right there is

165
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,720
just going to be 1 times the
first column in A plus 0 times

166
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,430
the second column in A plus
0 times the third column.

167
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,420
So it's just 1 times the
first column in A.

168
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,240
So it's just A1.

169
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,300
That simple.

170
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,610
Now what is this one going
to be equal to?

171
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,740
It's going to be 0 times the
first column in A, plus 1

172
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,660
times a second column in A, plus
0 times a third column in

173
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,180
A, and the rest are
going to be 0's.

174
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,250
So it's just going to be 1 times
the second column in A.

175
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,410
So the second column in our
transformation matrix is just

176
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,850
going to be B times A2.

177
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,230
And I think you get
the idea here.

178
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,830
The next one is going to be B
times A3 and all the way until

179
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,660
you get B times An.

180
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,870
   

181
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,670
So that's how you would
solve for your

182
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,800
transformation matrix.

183
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,050
Remember what we were
trying to do.

184
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,100
We were trying to find some--
let me write down and

185
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,140
summarize everything that
we've done so far.

186
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:09,170
We had a mapping S, that was
a mapping from x to y.

187
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,490
But x was a subset of Rn.

188
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,370
Y was a subset of Rm.

189
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,110
And so we said that this linear
transformation could be

190
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:27,760
represented as some matrix A
where A is an m by n matrix

191
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,750
times a vector x.

192
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,700
Then I showed you another
transformation, we already

193
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:39,320
called it T, which was a
mapping from y to z.

194
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,570
z is a subset of Rl.

195
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,030
   

196
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,490
And of course, the
transformation T applied to

197
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:53,430
some vector in y, can be
represented as some matrix B

198
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,450
times that vector.

199
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,740
I shouldn't have drawn
parentheses there,

200
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,430
but you get the idea.

201
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,870
And this, since it's a mapping
from a subset of our Rm to Rl,

202
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,850
this will be an l by m matrix.

203
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,220
And then we said, look, if
we actually just take the

204
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:20,750
composition of T with S,
of some vector in x,

205
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,180
this reduced to B.

206
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,790
So first we applied the
S transformation.

207
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,060
We multiplied the matrix
A times x.

208
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,810
   

209
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,800
And then we applied the T
transformation to this.

210
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,910
So we just multiplied
B times that.

211
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,200
   

212
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,100
Now we know this is a linear
transformation, which means it

213
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,450
can be represented as a
matrix vector product.

214
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,840
And we just figured out what the
matrix vector product is.

215
00:11:50,840 --> 00:12:00,210
So this thing is going to be
equal to C times x, which is

216
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,400
equal to this thing right there,
which is equal to that

217
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,040
thing right there.

218
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:16,280
Which is equal to-- let me write
it this way-- B, A1,

219
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,020
where A1 is the first column
vector in our matrix A.

220
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,030
And then the second column
here is going to be B.

221
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,990
And then we have A2, where
this is the second column

222
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,970
vector in A.

223
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:42,140
And you can keep going all the
way until you have B times An

224
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,770
times x, of course.

225
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:51,670
   

226
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,980
Now this is fair enough.

227
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,470
We can always do this if you
give me some matrix.

228
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,350
Remember this is an
l by m matrix.

229
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,370
And you give me another matrix
right here that is an m by n

230
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,650
matrix, I can always do this.

231
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,250
And how do I know I can
I always do that?

232
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,000
Because each of these
A's are going to

233
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,900
have m entries, right?

234
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,580
They're going to be Ai.

235
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,150
All of them are going to
be members of our Rm.

236
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,490
So this is well-defined.

237
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,080
This has m columns.

238
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,360
This has m entries.

239
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,820
So each of these matrix vector
products are well-defined.

240
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,480
Now, this is an interesting
thing, because we were able to

241
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,620
figure out the actual matrix
representation of this

242
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,350
composition transformation.

243
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,970
Let's extend it a little
bit further.

244
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,630
Wouldn't it be nice if this
were the same thing as the

245
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,820
matrices B times A.

246
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:58,860
   

247
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,740
All of that times x.

248
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,050
   

249
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,500
Wouldn't it be nice if these
were the same thing?

250
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,010
Because then we could say that
the composition of T with S of

251
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,490
x is equal to the matrix
representation of B times a

252
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,580
matrix representation of S.

253
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,270
And you take the product
of those two.

254
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,690
And that will create a new
matrix representation which

255
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,135
you can call C.

256
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:26,600
That you can then multiply
times x.

257
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,480
So you won't have to do it
individually every time, or do

258
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,360
it this way.

259
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,870
And I guess the truth of the
matter is there is nothing to

260
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,330
stop us from defining this
to be equal to B times A.

261
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,080
We have not defined what a
matrix times a matrix is yet.

262
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,290
So we might as well.

263
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,500
This is a good enough motivation
for us to define it

264
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,530
in this way.

265
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,010
So let's throw in
this definition.

266
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,360
   

267
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,510
So if we have some matrix B.

268
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,010
   

269
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,980
B is an l by m matrix.

270
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,630
And then we have some other
matrix A-- and I'll actually

271
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,090
show what A looks like, where
these are its column vectors.

272
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:16,600
A1, A2, all the way to An.

273
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,500
We're going to define
the product.

274
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,750
So this is a definition.

275
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,730
   

276
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:28,880
We're going to define the
product BA as being equal to

277
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,360
the matrix B times each of
the column vectors of A.

278
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,080
So it's B times A1.

279
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,410
That's going to be
its first column.

280
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,220
This is going to
be B times A2.

281
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,320
All the way to B times An.

282
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,750
And you've seen this before in
algebra two, but the reason

283
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,740
why I went through almost two
videos to get to here, is to

284
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:56,480
show you the motivation for
why matrix products are

285
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,670
defined this way.

286
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,270
Because it makes the notion
of compositions of

287
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,900
transformations kind
of natural.

288
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,740
If you take the composition of
one linear transformation with

289
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,050
another, the resulting
transformation matrix is just

290
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,000
the product, as we've just
defined it, of their two

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,250
transformation matrices.

292
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,850
For those of you who might not
have a lot of experience

293
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,590
taking products of matrices, and
who think this is fairly

294
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,240
abstract to look at, in the next
video I'll actually do a

295
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,270
bunch of examples and show you
that this definition is

296
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,560
actually fairly straightforward.

297
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:29,933
