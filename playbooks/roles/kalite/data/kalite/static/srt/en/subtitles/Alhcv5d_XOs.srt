1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,380
I think by now we have a
reasonable sense of what

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,990
linear dependence means.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,240
So let's just do a slightly
more formal definition of

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,010
linear dependence.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,390
So we're going to say that a set
of vectors-- Let me just

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,800
define my set of vectors.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,230
Let me call my set s
of vectors, v1, v2,

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,760
all the way to vn.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,845
I'm going to say that they
are linearly dependent.

11
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:36,970
   

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,320
If and only if.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,950
So sometimes it's written if, if
with a lot of f's in there.

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,410
So sometimes it's written
if and only if.

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,570
Sometimes it's shown like an
arrow in two directions.

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,290
If and only if I can satisfy
this equation, I can find a

17
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,250
set of constants c1 times v1.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,750
I can take a linear combination
of my vectors all

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,260
the way to cn vn, that satisfy
the equation that I can create

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,070
this into the 0 vector.

21
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,760
Sometimes it's just written as
a bold 0, and sometimes you

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,300
could just write it -- I
mean we don't know the

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,100
dimensionality of this vector.

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,610
It would be a bunch of 0's.

25
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:29,040
We don't know how many actual
elements are in each of these

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,280
vectors, but you get the idea.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,770
My set of vectors is linearly
dependent-- remember I'm

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,030
saying dependent, not
independent --is linearly

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,010
dependant, if and only if I can
satisfy this equation for

30
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:51,335
some ci's where not all of
them are equal to 0.

31
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:54,050
   

32
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,650
This is key, not all are 0.

33
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,990
Or you could say it
the other way.

34
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,465
You could say at least
one is non-zero.

35
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:09,590
   

36
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,010
So how does this gel with what
we were talking about in the

37
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,300
previous video where I said
look, a set is linearly

38
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,730
dependent if one of the of
vectors can be represented by

39
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,690
the combination of the
other vectors?

40
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,800
Let me write that down.

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:35,320
In the last few I said, look,
one vector can be -- Let me

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,220
write it this way.

43
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,330
One vector being represented
by the some of the other

44
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,050
vectors, I can just write
it like this.

45
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,160
I can write it a little
bit more math-y.

46
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,380
In the last video, I said that
linear dependence means that--

47
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,280
let me just pick an arbitrary
vector, v1.

48
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,480
Let's say that v1, you know
this is arbitrary, v1 one

49
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,490
could be represented
by some combination

50
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,570
of the other vectors.

51
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,070
Let me call them a1 times v --
let me be careful -- a2 times

52
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:11,170
v2 plus a3 times v3 plus all
the way up to an times vn.

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,980
This is what we said in
the previous video.

54
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,860
If this is linear dependence,
any one of these guys can be

55
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,930
represented as some combination
of the other ones.

56
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,980
So how does this imply that?

57
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,790
In order show this if and only
if, I have to show that this

58
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,410
implies that and I have to show
that that implies this.

59
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,870
So this is almost a trivially
easy proof.

60
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,340
Because if I subtract v1 from
both sides of this equation I

61
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:49,320
get 0 is equal to minus 1 v1
plus a2 v2 plus a3 v3 all the

62
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,730
way to an vn.

63
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,930
And clearly I've just
said, well,

64
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,670
this is linearly dependent.

65
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,160
That means that I can represent
this vector as a sum

66
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,510
of the other vectors, which
means that minus 1 times v1

67
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,770
plus some combination of the
other vectors is equal to 0,

68
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,850
which means that I've been able
to satisfy this equation,

69
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,960
and at least one of my constants
is non-zero.

70
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,740
   

71
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,160
So I've shown you that, if I
can represent one of the

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,440
vectors by a sum of the other
ones, then this condition is

73
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,160
definitely going to be true.

74
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,380
Now let me go the other way.

75
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,810
Let me show you if I have this
situation that I can

76
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,110
definitely represent one
of the vectors as

77
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,890
the sum of the others.

78
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,730
So let's say that
this is true.

79
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,270
   

80
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,190
And one of these constants,
remember it's not just this,

81
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,370
it's at least one,
is non-zero.

82
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,860
So let me just assume, just for
the sake of simplicity-- I

83
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,790
mean these are all arbitrary.

84
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,270
I'll do it in a new color.

85
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,610
Let me do it in the magenta.

86
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,090
Let me assume that c1
is not equal to 0.

87
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,370
If c1 is not equal to 0, then
I can divide both sides of

88
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,180
this equation by c1.

89
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,240
And what do I get?

90
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:19,860
I get v1 plus c2 over c1 v2 plus
all the way up to cn over

91
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,420
c1 is equal to 0.

92
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,350
And then I can multiply both
sides of this, or I could add

93
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,510
negative v1 to both sides of
this equation or subtract v1

94
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,290
from both sides.

95
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:41,290
And I get c2 over c1 v2 plus all
the way up to cn over c1

96
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,890
vn-- there's a vn here --is
equal to minus v1.

97
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,400
Now if I just multiply both
sides of this by negative 1, I

98
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,200
get a minus, and all these
become minuses and this

99
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,480
becomes a plus.

100
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,090
And I just showed you that
if at least one of these

101
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:02,160
constants is non-zero, that I
can represent my vector v1 as

102
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,920
some combination of
the other vectors.

103
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,920
So we're able to go
this way too.

104
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,200
If this condition is true, then
I can represent one of

105
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,040
the vectors as a combination
of the others.

106
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,590
If I can represent one of those
vectors as a combination

107
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,360
of the others, then this
condition is true.

108
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,710
Hopefully that kind of proves
that these two definitions are

109
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,240
equivalent.

110
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,930
Maybe it's a little
bit of overkill.

111
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,260
Let's apply that definition
now, to actually test. You

112
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,690
might say, hey Sal, why'd you go
through all of this effort?

113
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,180
I went through all of this
effort because this is

114
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,770
actually a really useful way
to test whether things are

115
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,460
linearly independent
or dependent.

116
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,250
Let's try it out.

117
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,170
Let's use our newly
found tool.

118
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,520
Let's say I have the
set of vectors--

119
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,460
Let me do it up here.

120
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,980
I want to be efficient
with my space usage.

121
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:59,450
So let's say I have the set
of vectors 2,1 and 3,2.

122
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,470
And my question to you is, are
these linearly independent or

123
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,270
are they linearly dependent?

124
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,440
In order for them to be linearly
dependent, that means

125
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,600
that if some constant times 2,1
plus some other constant

126
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,090
times this second vector,
3,2 where this

127
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,250
should be equal to 0.

128
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,450
Where these both aren't
necessarily 0.

129
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,570
Before I go up for this problem,
let's remember what

130
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,210
we're going to find out.

131
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,790
If either of these are non-zero,
if c1 or c2 are

132
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,630
non-zero, then this implies
that we are dealing with a

133
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,380
dependent, linearly
dependent set.

134
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,660
   

135
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:58,430
If c1 and c2 are both 0, if the
only way to satisfy this

136
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,060
equation -- I mean you can
always satisfy it by sitting

137
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,680
everything equal to 0.

138
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,520
But if the only way to satisfy
it is by making both of these

139
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,830
guys 0, then we're
dealing with a

140
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,570
linearly independent set.

141
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,860
   

142
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,110
Let's try to do some math.

143
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,280
And this'll just take us back
to our Algebra 1 days.

144
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,880
In order for this to be true,
that means 2 times c1 plus 3

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,870
times c2 is equal to -- when I
say this is equal to 0, it's

146
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,980
really the 0 vector.

147
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,669
I can rewrite this as 0,0.

148
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,120
So 2 times c1 plus 3
times c2 would be

149
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,159
equal to that 0 there.

150
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:46,480
And then we'd have 1 times
c1 plus 2 times c2 is

151
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,730
equal to that 0.

152
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,600
   

153
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,870
And now this is just a system,
two equations, two unknowns.

154
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,420
A couple of things
we could do.

155
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:02,340
Let's just multiply this
top equation by 1/2.

156
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:12,170
If you multiply it by 1/2 you
get c1 plus 3/2 plus 3/2 c2 is

157
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,200
equal to 0.

158
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,460
And then if we subtract the
green equation from the red

159
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,410
equation this becomes 0.

160
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,290
2 minus 1 and 1/2-- 3/2 is 1 and
1/2 --of this is just 1/2

161
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,960
c2 is equal to 0.

162
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,390
And this is easy to solve.

163
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,090
c2 is equal to 0.

164
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,770
So what's c1?

165
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,350
Well, just substitute this back
in. c2 is equal to 0.

166
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,270
So this is equal to 0.

167
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,720
So c1 plus 0 is equal to 0.

168
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,940
So c1 is also equal to 0.

169
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,190
We could have substituted
it back into that

170
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,440
top equation as well.

171
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,320
So the only solution to this
equation involves both c1 and

172
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,610
c2 being equal to 0.

173
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,680
So they both have to be 0.

174
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:04,110
So this is a linearly
independent set of vectors.

175
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,790
Which means that neither
of them are redundant

176
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,480
of the other one.

177
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,600
You can't represent one as a
combination of the other.

178
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,550
And since we have two vectors
here, and they're linearly

179
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,790
independent, we can actually
know that this will span r2.

180
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:22,320
   

181
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,910
The span of my r vectors
is equal to r2.

182
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,290
If one of these vectors was
just some multiple of the

183
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,610
other, than the span would have
been some line within r2,

184
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,260
not all of.

185
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,400
But now I can represent any
vector in r2 as some

186
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,910
combination of those.

187
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,300
Let's do another example.

188
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,170
Let me scroll to the right,
because sometimes this thing,

189
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,060
when I go too far down, I
haven't figured out why, when

190
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,920
I go too far down it
starts messing up.

191
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,480
So my next example is
the set of vectors.

192
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,110
So I have the vector 2,1.

193
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,520
I have the vector 3,2.

194
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,490
And I have the vector 1,2.

195
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,690
And I want to know are these
linearly dependent or linearly

196
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,440
independent.

197
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,800
So I go to through
the same drill.

198
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,890
I use that little theorem that
I proved at the beginning of

199
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,090
this video.

200
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:24,710
In order for them to be linearly
dependent there must

201
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,840
be some set of weights that
I can multiply these guys.

202
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:37,100
So c1 times this vector plus c2
times this vector plus c3

203
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,060
times that vector, that will
equal the 0 vector.

204
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,690
And if one of these is non-zero
then we're dealing

205
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,390
with a linearly dependent
set of vectors.

206
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,790
And if all of them are 0,
then it's independent.

207
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,445
Let's just do our
linear algebra.

208
00:11:54,445 --> 00:12:00,430
   

209
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:10,520
So this means that 2 times c1
plus 3 times c2 plus c3 is

210
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,280
equal to that 0 up there.

211
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
And then if we do the bottom
rows-- Remember when you

212
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,270
multiply a scalar times a vector
you multiply it by each

213
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,880
of these terms. So c1 times 1.

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:29,200
1c1 plus 2c2 plus 2c3
is equal to 0.

215
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,350
There's a couple of giveaways
on this problem.

216
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,570
If you have three
two-dimensional vectors, one

217
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,070
of them is going to
be redundant.

218
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,650
Because, in the very best case,
even if you assume that

219
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,540
that vector and that vector are
linearly independent, then

220
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,740
these would span r2.

221
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,270
Which means that any point,
any vector, in your

222
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,250
two-dimensional space can
be represented by some

223
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,140
combination of those two.

224
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,280
In which case, this is going to
be one of them because this

225
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,935
is just a vector in
two-dimensional space.

226
00:12:57,935 --> 00:12:59,940
So it would be linearly
dependent.

227
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,890
And then, if you say, well,
these aren't linearly

228
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:07,030
independent then, they're just
multiples of each other.

229
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,900
In which case, this would
definitely be a linearly

230
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,450
dependent set.

231
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,290
When you see three vectors that
are each only vectors in

232
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,910
r2, that are each
two-dimensional vectors, it's

233
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,580
a complete giveaway that this
is linearly dependent.

234
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,460
But I'm going to show it to you
using our dependent, using

235
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,560
our little theorem here.

236
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,940
So I'm going to show you that I
can get non-zero c3's, c2's,

237
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,270
and c1's such that I
can get a 0 here.

238
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,000
If all of these had to be 0-- I
mean you can always set them

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,440
equal to 0.

240
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,580
But if they had to be equal to
0, then it would be linearly

241
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,190
independent.

242
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,220
Let me just show you.

243
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,290
I can just pick some
random c3.

244
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,420
Let me pick c3 to be equal
to negative 1.

245
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,610
So what would these two
equations reduce to?

246
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,920
I mean you have just three
unknowns and two equations, it

247
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,050
means you don't have enough
constraints on your system.

248
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,640
So if I just set c3-- I just
pick that out of a hat.

249
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,290
I could have picked
c3 to be anything.

250
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,460
But if I set c3 to be equal to
negative 1, what do these

251
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,230
equations become?

252
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:12,790
You get 2c1 plus 3c2 minus
1 is equal to 0.

253
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:19,560
And you get c1 plus 2c2
minus 2 is equal to 0.

254
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:19,830
Right?

255
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,780
2 times minus 1.

256
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,010
What can I do here?

257
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,950
If I multiply this second
equation by 2, what do I get?

258
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:37,360
I get 2 plus 4c2 minus
4 is equal to 0.

259
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,580
And now let's subtract this
equation from that equation.

260
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,600
So the c1's cancel out.

261
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,960
3c2 minus 4c2 is minus c2.

262
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:53,840
And then minus 1 minus minus 4,
so that's minus 1 plus 4.

263
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,620
That's plus 3 is equal to 0.

264
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,860
And so we get our -- Let me make
sure I got that right.

265
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,640
   

266
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,190
We have a minus 1
minus a minus 4.

267
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,150
So plus 4.

268
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,170
So we have a plus 3.

269
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,410
So that is a minus 2.

270
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,150
   

271
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:28,225
So minus c2 is equal to minus
3 or c2 is equal to 3.

272
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:32,480
And if c2 is equal to 3 and c3
is equal to minus 1-- Let's

273
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,510
just substitute here, so we
get c1 plus 2 times c2, so

274
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,760
plus 6, plus 2 times c3.

275
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,980
So minus 2 is equal to 0.

276
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,830
c1 plus 4 is equal to 0.

277
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,310
c1 is equal to minus 4.

278
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,250
   

279
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,720
I'm giving you a combination
of c's that

280
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,210
will give us a 0 vector.

281
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:03,920
If I multiply minus 4 times our
first vector, 2,1, that's

282
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:13,150
c1, plus 3 times our second
vector, 3,2 minus 1 times our

283
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,720
third vector, 1,2 this
should be equal to 0.

284
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,510
Let's verify it just for fun.

285
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:24,660
Minus 4 times 2 is minus
8 plus 9 minus 1.

286
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,590
Yeah, that's minus 9 plus 9.

287
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,490
That's 0.

288
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:36,010
Minus 4 times plus 6 minus
2 that's also 0.

289
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,370
So we've just shown a linear
combination of these vectors,

290
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,820
where actually none of
the constants are 0.

291
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,840
But all we had to show was
that at least one of the

292
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,680
constants had to be non-zero,
and we actually showed all

293
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,690
three of them were.

294
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,850
But at least one of these
had to be non-zero.

295
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,100
And I was able to satisfy this
equation, I was able to make

296
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,560
them into the zero vector.

297
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:02,460
So this shows, this proves,
that this is a linearly

298
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,520
dependent set of vectors.

299
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,450
Which means one of the
vectors is redundant.

300
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,520
And you can never just say,
oh, this is the redundant

301
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,410
vector, because I can represent
this as combination

302
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,170
of those two.

303
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,589
You could just as easily pick
this guy as the redundant

304
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,960
vector, and say, hey, I can
represent this guy as the sum

305
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,609
of those two.

306
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:23,380
There's not one bad apple
in the bunch.

307
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,640
Any of them can be represented
by the combination of some

308
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,580
other, by all of the
rest of them.
