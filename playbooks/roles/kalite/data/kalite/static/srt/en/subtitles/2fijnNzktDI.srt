1
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:10,620
We are in the museum of the cathedral of Siena, and we are looking at

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,655
probably , the singlemost famous work of art

3
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:17,888
from Siena, and certainly one of the most important

4
00:00:17,888 --> 00:00:21,196
works of art from the 14th century. This is Duccio's Maesta.

5
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:24,880
The title means the Virgin Mary in majesty

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,264
and we see her very large in the centre of the main

7
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:31,415
panel. She is by far the largest figure anywhere in this painting.

8
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:35,714
This is a polyptych. It is made of many many panels,

9
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:38,967
not all of which are here in the museum unfortunately.

10
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:42,040
Maestas peter on both the front and the back.

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,313
The Mary is on the front and the stories of Marys life are on the front

12
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:49,030
but the story of Christ is on the back. so in a sense this is

13
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,055
a free standing painting. It is a large sculptural object

14
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:55,846
that has all this imagery all over. And the figures

15
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:59,312
of the saints and angels are almost life size.

16
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:01,443
Its true, and there are three rows of them and they are lined up

17
00:01:01,443 --> 00:01:06,405
almost as if you worked for a class picture.

18
00:01:06,405 --> 00:01:09,271
There are four local saints in front, and then angels and saints in the second row

19
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:13,413
and I think an unbroken row of angels in the back

20
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:19,257
Now we would have originally seen a predella below, that is a stab of small paintings,

21
00:01:19,257 --> 00:01:22,396
and then above the large panel, there would have been

22
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:25,711
the series of saints as well. We think that the predella,

23
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:29,144
would have held the scenes of the early life of virgin Mary

24
00:01:29,144 --> 00:01:31,644
and above her death and ascend to heaven

25
00:01:31,644 --> 00:01:33,190
and then there would have been in the elaborate frame.

26
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,588
In the previous century,

27
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:37,206
Siena had won a significant battle against

28
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:41,160
its arch rival

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,088
Florence. Now Siena and Florence were wealthy city states.

30
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:45,191
That is they were independant nations

31
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:48,056
and were often at war with each other. Siena

32
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:53,398
believes that they won because of the grace of Mary. Many years later

33
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:57,574
the town of Siena commissioned their most famous painter

34
00:01:57,574 --> 00:02:00,242
Duccio , to create a very large painting, which

35
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:03,238
was dedicated to Virgin Mary. It would have stood exactly

36
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:07,121
on the altar of the cathedral in the crosslink just under the dome

37
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:16,704
As you cross the higher altar you would be able to make out, just at the bottom

38
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,627
an inscription that read, 'Holy Mother of God, be the cause of peace to Siena, and to the life of Duccio, because he has painted thee thus.'

39
00:02:20,627 --> 00:02:22,954
Now Siena was very much a competitor of Florence. and

40
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:26,413
the great florentine painter of the day was

41
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,064
Giotto. He had painted a major cycle, telling the story

42
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:34,653
of the Virgin Mary. of the Christ's parents, of Christ himself

43
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:37,949
and in some ways the Maesta was a kind of answer to that. We can do this too.

44
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:42,012
We can be as comprehensive and have a masterpiece

45
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:43,984
too. And I think they proved that they did something that their rival Giotto did

46
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:48,034
in the arena chapel. But Giotto's

47
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,984
painting was a fresco. Fresco did not make sense for the cahtedral

48
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:53,248
of Siena because the cathedral of Siena is made of

49
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:57,818
alternating blocks of black and white marble.

50
00:02:57,818 --> 00:03:01,218
It has a very decorative interior, that would'nt have worked with fresco

51
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:06,035
and so it made sense to do a panel painting for the altar piece.

52
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:08,599
And you have to remember that at the end of the medieval,

53
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:15,597
Mary had taken on an enormously important role.

54
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:17,283
she was the bridge that normal people could access Christ through.

55
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:21,935
You would speak and pray to the virgin Mary and she

56
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:27,568
would perhaps speak to her son on your behalf. She had the role of an intercessor, or someone who intercedes

57
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:31,043
between god and mankind. As is traditional, she is garbed in an intensely

58
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:35,166
billoed, that must have been fabulously

59
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,739
expensive, given of the lapezzawould have been required to produce that artillery in paint.

60
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:41,745
There is this beautifully embedded gold

61
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:45,382
in the strait behind her. There are lot of decorative surfaces,

62
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:50,381
representing that this is particular to the siena style.

63
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:54,496
There is a sense of delicacy, and christ has modelled him

64
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,034
there is a kind of transparency and around his leg there is a beautiful

65
00:03:58,034 --> 00:04:01,313
amatilation of light and shadow

66
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:04,737
that is being used here not only strylation of gold

67
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:07,812
this is not the earlier work of Chimabue. this

68
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:11,978
is a work of Duccio who is moving steadily and consciously

69
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:16,981
it is creating a sense of real mass and real volume.

70
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:20,003
the drapery about the Christ is softly and beautifully modelled. look at the christ

71
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:26,418
in her hands pearls in her drapery

72
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:32,817
and dthe modelling that we see under chrissts chin and neck

73
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:37,180
it really is three dimensional and the way we begin to see its life charter also

74
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,249
in the early thirten hundreds, creating forms that were three dimensional

75
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:45,150
and lok at the face of christ. there is a look of awaremess

76
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,201
and wisdom that is peircing. he seems to look dirrectly at us

77
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:53,317
and it is the stare of a fully conscious adult.

78
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:57,129
the angels are remarkably animated. some

79
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:00,637
look at mary,, some look away, some look at us

80
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:04,838
there is a kind of informality. its true

81
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:08,816
that informality is so unexpected. you would expect something more rigid

82
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:12,268
this is the court of heaven after all. this is quite wonderful

83
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:16,752
and gives it a sense of complexity and lso notincing

84
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:20,173
the lovely curls that make up the wings of the angel

85
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:23,522
somehow actually make to feel like feathers

86
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:28,554
it gives us a sense of voleume and the wings are not flat

87
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:29,854
and now in the ground we see the throne opening out moving

88
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:32,725
into our space

89
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:37,000
now remember that in the medieval era

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,488
the cathedrals and churches in general were not open for people to walk

91
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:43,720
through as they are now. and the lay people as they are

92
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,041
known would have gone to the front of the church only

93
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:52,156
the area at the back of the church, the altar would have been reserved

94
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:55,040
for those who had worked directly with the church. it is intersting to note

95
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,973
the relation that the men who had the power to access

96
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:02,483
to this side of the painting that focussed on virgin Mary

97
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:07,367
the intercessor between man and the divine

98
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,719
a more privileged reach was available to the monks and the priests

99
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:12,505
to those who were closely associated with the church.

100
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,472
let us take a walk at the back and take a look at that panels
