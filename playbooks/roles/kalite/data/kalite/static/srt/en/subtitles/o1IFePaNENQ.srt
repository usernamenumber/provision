1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As we've already seen, the end of fighting in World War I

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or I guess we have the end of world war one in 1918

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so in 1919, it's time to talk about the terms for peace

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this happens at the paris peace conference

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And at this conference, you have all the parties of all the major warring parties

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but the terms of peace are dictated by the winners.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the major powers among the winners are led by these gentlemen over here

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is prime minster Lloyd George of the UK, Vittorio Orlando

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of Italy, George Clemenceau of France, President Woodrow wilson of the United States,

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they come to the Paris Peace conference

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with very different outlooks of what the peace should look like

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We already learned about President Wilson's 14 points. It was very idealistic.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It talked about making the world safe for democracy, how people should determine their own fate,

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how we should have the self determination

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the end of empires, free trade, creating a league of nations,

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that you can avoid things like world war I again.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The European side was not quite as idealistic, especially the french. As you can

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
imagine, the french- The us lost a lot of soldiers in World War 1 but the french lost a significant fraction

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of their adult males in world war one. the ugly western front was fought in their country

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they were much more eager to make germany pay for what

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
-for what it's done. So the terms of the treaty with Germany

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the treaty of Versailles, and the treaty of Versailles, it's important

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to note is only one of several treaties that came out of the paris

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
peace conferece. It tends to get the most attention because it was

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the treaty with germany and many people blame it for

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
being part of the cause of world war 2. it so humiliated germany that it was so unnacceptable
