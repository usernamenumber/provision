00:00:00,842 --> 00:00:02,187
Let's learn a little bit about fluids

2
00:00:02,187 --> 00:00:06,621
so - you probably have some notion of what a fluid is,

3
00:00:06,621 --> 00:00:09,575
but let's talk about it in the physics sense or

4
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,088
maybe even in the chemistry sense

5
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:13,295
depending on what context you are watching this video-

6
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:15,943
So a fluid is anything that takes the shape of it's container

7
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:22,154
for example if I had a glass sphere

8
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:31,295
Let's say I completely fill this glass sphere with water

9
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:33,401
I was going to say we were in a zero gravity environment,

10
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:34,550
but you really don't need that

11
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:38,629
let's say that every cubic centimeter

12
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:40,846
or cubic meter of this glass sphere is filled with water

13
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:46,656
and let's say it's not of glass, let's say it's a rubber sphere

14
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:48,827
if I were to change the shape of that sphere

15
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:52,046
but not change the volume

16
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:53,792
If I were to change the shape of the sphere so

17
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,459
it looks like this now

18
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:58,006
the water would just change its shape

19
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:00,345
with the container

20
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:06,886
in this case I have green water

21
00:01:06,994 --> 00:01:11,307
and the same is also true if that was oxygen

22
00:01:11,307 --> 00:01:13,153
if that was just some gas, right?

23
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,109
It would fill the container and in this situation

24
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,509
it would also fill the the newly shaped container.

25
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:26,864
So a fluid, in general, takes the shape of the container.

26
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:34,193
I just gave you two examples of fluids:

27
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:38,142
You have liquids

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,957
and you have gases. Those are two types

29
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:44,896
of fluid. Both of those things take the shape of their container.

30
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,745
What's the difference between a liquid and a gas, then?

31
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:50,979
Well, a gas is compressible,

32
00:01:53,394 --> 00:01:56,527
which means that I could actually decrease

33
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:58,727
the volume of this container

34
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:02,496
and the gas would just become denser within the container.

35
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:03,756
So you can think of it as...

36
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,662
if I blew air into a balloon, you could squeeze

37
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:08,377
that balloon a little bit. There's air in there.

38
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,211
I mean at somepoint the pressure might get high

39
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:12,490
enough to pop the balloon, but you can squeeze it.

40
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,244
While a liquid is incompressible.

41
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:22,703
And how do I know a liquid is incompressible?

42
00:02:22,703 --> 00:02:25,437
Well, imagine the same balloon filled with water-

43
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,777
completely filled with water.

44
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:29,573
If you squeeze on that balloon from every side

45
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:34,847
let's say i have this ballon and it's is filled with water.

46
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:36,513
If you squeezed on this balloon

47
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:38,175
from every side, you would not be able to

48
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,144
change the volume of this balloon. No matter what you

49
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:43,625
do you will not be able to change the volume of this ballon.

50
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,594
No matter how much force or pressure you put

51
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:47,779
from any side on it.

52
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:53,487
If this was filled with gas- magenta ballon for gas-

53
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:55,362
you actually could decrease the volume by just increasing

54
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:59,589
the pressure on all sides of the balloon

55
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:01,123
you could acutally squeeze it and make the entire

56
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:02,871
volume smaller. So that's the difference between

57
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:05,540
a liquid and a gas: gas is compressible, liquid isn't.

58
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,079
we'll learn later that you can

59
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,207
actually turn a liquid into a gas, and a gas into a liquid

60
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:11,426
and a liquid into a solid, we'll learn all about that

61
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:14,621
later, but this is a pretty good working definition

62
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:18,238
so let's use that and now we're going to actually just focus on

63
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:21,488
the liquids to see if we can learn a little bit about liquid motion

64
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:31,445
or maybe even fluid motion in general. Let me draw something else

65
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:37,726
So let's say i had a situation, say I had this

66
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:40,955
weird shaped object that tends so show up in a lot

67
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,745
of physics books, which i'll draw. This weird

68
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:47,744
shaped container which is relatively narrow here

69
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:56,619
and it goes, and kind of U-turns and turns into a much larger opening

70
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:04,672
Let's say that the area of this opening is A1

71
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:08,244
and the area of this opening is A2.

72
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:09,432
This one is bigger.

73
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:14,589
And let's fill this thing with some liquid

74
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,781
which will be blue.

75
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:20,616
So that's my liquid.

76
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:23,989
Let's fill it with some liquid....

77
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:26,550
Let me see if this tool...

78
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,881
There you go! Look at that!

79
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,794
I've filled it with liquid, so quickly.

80
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:30,754
Alright.

81
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:35,926
And this is liquid, this is not just a fluid, and what's the important thing

82
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:39,442
about liquid? It's incompressible. So let's take what we

83
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:44,943
know about force actually about work and see

84
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:49,629
if we can come up with any rules about force and pressure with liquids at the center of it.

85
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:53,912
so what do we know about work? Work is force times distance.

86
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:56,629
We can also kind of view this as the energy put into the system.

87
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,080
I'll write down here.

88
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,491
So, work is equal to force times distance.

89
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:05,558
and we learned in the mechanical advantage etc.

90
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:12,496
that the work in is equal to work out

91
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:13,788
right?

92
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:15,860
the force times the distance you put into a system

93
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,928
is equal to the force times the distance you put out of it.

94
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:19,711
and you migh want to review the work chapter for that

95
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:22,492
but that's just the law of conservation of energy

96
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:24,655
because work in is just the energy that you're putting into a system

97
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:26,027
it's measured in joules

98
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:28,126
and work out is just the energy that comes out of a system.

99
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:31,479
And that's just saying that no energy is destroyed or created.

100
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,861
It just turns into different forms.

101
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:35,409
So, let's just use this stuff here:

102
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,226
the force times distance in is equal to

103
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:39,044
force times distance out.

104
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:44,454
Force in times distance in

105
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:51,078
is equal to force out times distance out.

106
00:05:51,078 --> 00:05:53,176
Allright, so let's say that

107
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:55,777
I pressed with some force

108
00:05:55,777 --> 00:05:57,624
on this entire surface.

109
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:01,940
So lets' say I have a piston

110
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:08,378
let's say I have a magenta piston right here

111
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:13,659
and I push down on this magenta piston

112
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:15,922
So, I pushed down on this

113
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:20,371
with a force of F1

114
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:24,944
and let's say I push it a distance of D1

115
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:27,093
That's it's initial position

116
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:29,810
and that's it's final position

117
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,725
I'll do it in ...

118
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,176
(the harder part of this video is picking the colors)

119
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:33,787
So let's say after I've pushed it

120
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:36,228
the piston goes this far.

121
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:39,223
So this is the distance that I pushed it.

122
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:41,441
This is D1.

123
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:42,257
The water is here

124
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:46,142
and I pushed the water down D1 meters, right ?

125
00:06:46,142 --> 00:06:47,841
So, in this situation, my work is

126
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,944
F1 times D1, right ?

127
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,659
But let me ask a question:

128
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:55,760
how much water did I displace?

129
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,891
How much total water did I displace?

130
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,661
Well, this volume, right?

131
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,757
I took this entire volume

132
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:01,987
and pushed it down.

133
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,143
So, what's the volume right there,

134
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:05,629
that I displaced?

135
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:09,077
The volume there is going to be...

136
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:14,560
The volume displaced

137
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,840
has to equal this distance

138
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,540
(this is like a cylinder of liquid)

139
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,837
so this distance times this area, right?

140
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:24,460
... times the area of the container at that point.

141
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,687
I will assume that it is constant at that point

142
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:27,757
and that it changes just after that.

143
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:36,743
So, it equals area 1 times distance 1, right?

144
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:41,112
We also know that liquid has to go some place.

145
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:43,079
What do we know about liquids?

146
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,972
You can't compress it.

147
00:07:44,972 --> 00:07:47,593
You can't change it's total volume.

148
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,127
So all of that volume is going to

149
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,871
have to go some place else.

150
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,541
This is where the liquid was.

151
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,541
The liquid is going to rise some level.

152
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,711
Let's say it gets to this level.

153
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,859
This is it's new level.

154
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:05,192
It's going to change some distance here.

155
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,162
And how do you know what distance that is going to be?

156
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:11,130
Well, the volume that it changes here

157
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,244
has to go some place.

158
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,678
That's going to push on that,

159
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:15,945
that's all going to push

160
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:17,623
That liquid has to go some place

161
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:18,860
essentially, it's going to end up

162
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,280
it might not be the exact same molecules

163
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,654
but that might displace some liquid here

164
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:22,898
that is going to displace some liquid here

165
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:24,064
here, and here, and here, and here

166
00:08:24,064 --> 00:08:25,792
all the way until the liquid up here

167
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,846
gets displaced and gets pushed upward.

168
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,679
So the volume that you're pushing down here

169
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:32,559
is the same volume that goes up right here.

170
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,192
And so, what's the change in volume?

171
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:40,629
How much volume did you push up here?

172
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,108
Well, this volume here is going to be

173
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:46,526
the distance 2 times this larger area.

174
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,310
So we could say:

175
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,440
volume 2 is going to be equal to

176
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,754
the distance 2 times this larger area.

177
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:57,672
And we know that this liquid is incompressible,

178
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:01,613
so this volume has to be the same as this volume, right?

179
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:04,979
So we know that these two quantities

180
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,107
are equal to each other.

181
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:10,289
So area 1 times distance 1

182
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:11,809
(this area times this distance)

183
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:14,755
is going to be equal to

184
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:18,140
this area times this distance

185
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,859
(area 2 times distance 2).

186
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,762
So, let's see what we can do:

187
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,645
We know this: the force in times distance in

188
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:28,996
in equal to the force out times the distance out

189
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:30,106
Let's take this equation...

190
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:31,245
(I'm gonna switch back to green

191
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:34,243
so we don't lose track of things)

192
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:36,373
... and divide both sides by...

193
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:38,577
(let's just rewrite it)

194
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:41,856
So, let's say I rewrote each input force...

195
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:43,229
Actually, I'm much out of time

196
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:44,754
so I'll continue this into the next video.

197
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:46,000
See you soon.
