1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,580
In the price to earnings
conundrum video we encountered

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,340
a situation where two different
entrepreneurs bought

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,130
an identical asset, in this case
it was a pizza parlor or

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,050
a pizzeria, but they
each financed it

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:14,950
in a different way.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,830
This guy was a little bit
more conservative.

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,650
He paid for it outright.

9
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,230
The entire asset
was his equity.

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,210
He had no debt.

11
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,630
While this guy, he borrowed
some money and he even had

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,240
some non-operating assets.

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,590
So he levered up.

14
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,170
For every $1 he put in he
borrowed $10 from the bank in

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,610
order to buy more assets
that he actually

16
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,680
brought to the table.

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,620
And we saw when you did their
financial statements-- their

18
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,280
revenue, cost of goods--
everything up to the operating

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,940
profit line was the same.

20
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,810
And that makes sense because,
if you remember the first

21
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,080
introduction to income statement
video, operating

22
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,100
profit is really indicative of
what the operating assets are

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,100
generating.

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,880
So in this case it's what this
purple area right here is

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,940
generating.

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,740
You could also consider
that the enterprise.

27
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,110
What the enterprise
is generating.

28
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,840
And everything below the
operating line, everything

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,880
below the operating profit line,
is either coming from

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,540
non-operating assets, that
would the case of

31
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,210
non-operating income.

32
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,370
And the entrepreneur on the
right had some of that.

33
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,330
He had some of this
non-operating income, $2,000

34
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,230
per year in that case.

35
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,510
While this guy didn't
have any.

36
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,490
And then you have expenses
associated

37
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,930
with interest. Right?

38
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,250
In this case this entrepreneur
had 5% of

39
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,910
$100,000, so $5,000 a year.

40
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,250
And then when you have these
differences in capital

41
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,090
structure it changes what
your net income is.

42
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,030
And they have slightly different
net income numbers.

43
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,600
But what we saw is when we
applied the same price to

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,310
earnings ratio, and they had
the same share counts-- I

45
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,490
didn't change too many variables
here I just really

46
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,860
changed how they paid
for the asset.

47
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,680
But when you apply the same
price to earnings ratio to

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,700
both earning streams, to both
companies, you got something

49
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,280
that was reasonably
unintuitive.

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,940
And there's no trick
here really.

51
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,530
Because it's not crazy to
assign the same price to

52
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,320
earnings ratio.

53
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,760
And if you try it out, if you
grow this guy's revenue a

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,260
little bit, if you actually grow
both of their revenues by

55
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,770
the same amount or both of their
gross profits by the

56
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,360
same amount or if you grow
both of their operating

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,610
profits by the same amount,
you're actually going to see

58
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,170
that this guy's earnings per
share is growing faster.

59
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,040
So given that someone might
say, oh, because of the

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,300
leverage maybe I'm willing to
pay even a higher multiple.

61
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,230
So it's not crazy to pay the
same multiple for both of

62
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,070
these guys.

63
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,630
But we saw at the end of the
last video, when you apply,

64
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,270
let's say, a 10 multiple, or
really any multiple to both of

65
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,000
these earning streams, you get
a situation that at first

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,780
doesn't look crazy.

67
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,210
OK, the market cap of this guy
is $210,000 if you apply a 10

68
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,140
multiple to their earnings
stream, while the market cap

69
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,310
of this guy is $189,000 if you
apply a 10 multiple to their

70
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:54,730
earning stream.

71
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:54,980
Right?

72
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,400
10 times 18.9 thousand
is 189,000.

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,480
10 times 21 thousand
is 210,000.

74
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,390
But what was the conundrum, what
really got us thinking,

75
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,150
was how can this whole equity
stream right here, or this

76
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,940
equity, or this earnings stream
be, worth 210 and this

77
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,770
one be worth 189 when this guy
only put $10,000 in initially

78
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,790
and this guy put $100,000?

79
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,440
He put in 10 times as much.

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,940
And so when you're paying
$210,000 for this asset, for

81
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,600
this equity, you are essentially
saying that this

82
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,680
asset is worth $210,000.

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,230
But if you're saying that this
equity is worth $189,000,

84
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,620
right, that's what the
market cap is.

85
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,030
It's the value of the equity.

86
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,690
Then you're implicitly saying
that this asset, that all of

87
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,500
these assets are worth the
value of this market

88
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,330
capitalization plus
this debt, right?

89
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,230
So that's $289,000.

90
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,670
And then if you wanted the value
of this operating asset

91
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,080
you would subtract out this
much right here, the cash.

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,205
So you got something
like $279,000.

93
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:56,190
So when you apply the same price
to earnings to to these

94
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,160
similar businesses you've
actually got a situation where

95
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,110
you're overpaying for this asset
relative to this one,

96
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,370
even though they're identical.

97
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,530
So that left us with a question:
what do we do?

98
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,030
What can we use other than a
price to earnings ratio?

99
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,670
And that's what this
video is for.

100
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,730
So the short answer is,
one, you do have to

101
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,630
use something different.

102
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,950
Price to earnings ratio is a
good a quick way of comparing

103
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,180
two companies relative
to their growth or

104
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,490
relative to an industry.

105
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,040
But it does lose a lot of
information relative to how

106
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,420
the companies are capitalized.

107
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,140
You saw in the last video that
how you're capitalized, and

108
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,770
when I say capitalized
I mean how do you

109
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,230
pay for your assets.

110
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,090
If you have a lot of debt versus
a lot of equity, what

111
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,750
actually happens on
the earnings line

112
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,160
is very, very different.

113
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,130
And so you lose all of
that information.

114
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,830
And so if you want to capture
that information, when you

115
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,720
look at the price of a stock
you have to figure out what

116
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,730
you're actually paying for the
enterprise of the company, the

117
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,340
enterprise value
of the company.

118
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,000
So when I talk about the
enterprise, or the enterprise

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,025
value, I'm talking about
the operating assets.

120
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:01,750
   

121
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,450
It gets a little bit more
complicated if you're talking

122
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,180
about a financial company
like a bank or

123
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,990
an insurance company.

124
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,790
But if we're talking about a
widget factory, the enterprise

125
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,620
is essentially the assets.

126
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,050
The enterprise value is the
asset value of the assets that

127
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,410
allow the company
to do business.

128
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,840
So whatever factories-- well, in
this case it's a pizzeria,

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,030
so the ovens, the building,
the places, where people

130
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,940
actually eat their food, and
even the cash that's necessary

131
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,000
to operate the business.

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,500
The enterprise value shouldn't
incorporate the cash that's

133
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,650
surplus, that's not necessary
to operate the business.

134
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,080
So that begs the question,
how do you calculate the

135
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,100
enterprise value?

136
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,110
So you could go backwards and
you say, OK, for a given price

137
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,980
how much am I paying for
an enterprise value?

138
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:54,190
So let's say that this stock--
let's say that Company A or

139
00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:03,510
this one, let's say the stock
right now is trading at $20.

140
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,180
So this is the current price
that you could buy it at.

141
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,530
So it's the asking price in
the market is at $20.

142
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,610
While this one is at, let's
say it's at $10.

143
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,700
It's at $10.

144
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,040
So at first glance you might
just do a quick price to

145
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,930
earnings ratio.

146
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,840
And you'll say, OK, for $20 I'm
getting $2.10 earnings per

147
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,660
year, assuming it's not
growing or something.

148
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,170
So my price to earnings is
approximately, I don't know

149
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,070
have my calculator in front of
me, but $20 divided by $2.10

150
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,870
is going to be 9 point
something, something.

151
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,940
Right?

152
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,700
While this guy, for $10,
I am getting $1.89 of

153
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,010
earnings per year.

154
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,440
So what's 100 divided by 18?

155
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,230
It's 5 or 6 times.

156
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,270
It's going to be 5
point something.

157
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:56,360
6 times 18 is 60 plus -- Yeah
it's going to be 5 point

158
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,980
something, something.

159
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,900
So when you superficially just
look at this you're going to

160
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,930
say, wow, this is a cheaper
price to earnings ratio, maybe

161
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,250
I should buy that.

162
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,290
But what we saw in the last
video is that price to

163
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,780
earnings isn't a good relative
valuation metric when two

164
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,120
different companies are
capitalized very differently.

165
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,640
So what you want to do is
instead back out what these

166
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,660
prices imply about the
enterprise value.

167
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,280
So what does $20 imply about the
enterprise value and what

168
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,760
does $10 imply.

169
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,670
And how do you do that?

170
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,270
Well first you say what
is the market cap?

171
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,300
Market cap.

172
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,450
So you take the price times
the number of shares.

173
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,980
If you remember, we
had 10,000 shares.

174
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,710
So in this case $20 times
10,000 shares implies a

175
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,090
$200,000 market cap.

176
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,310
In this case we have $10 times
10,000 shares so it implies a

177
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,900
$100,000 market cap.

178
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,790
Now remember, the market cap
is just what's left over.

179
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,410
So let me redraw those two
diagrams because I feel like

180
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,420
I'm--

181
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,490
So for this entrepreneur
you have the assets

182
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,530
and there's no debt.

183
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,140
So the assets are kind
of completely

184
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,280
represented by the equity.

185
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,170
So if the market cap is $200,000
you're essentially

186
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,210
saying that these assets, these
operating assets, are

187
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,150
worth $200,000.

188
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:20,860
So in this case, at a price
of $20, we know that the

189
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,910
enterprise value, the market
enterprise value, so what the

190
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,290
market is saying the enterprise
is worth, the

191
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,670
operating assets are
worth, is $200,000.

192
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,080
Now, in this case, remember the
market is saying that the

193
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,010
equity is worth $100,000.

194
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,230
Let me draw that.

195
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:42,260
The market is saying that the
equity is worth $100,000.

196
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,620
But of course this company
has a lot of debt.

197
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,200
It has another $100,000
of debt.

198
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,230
Actually let me draw this
a little bit different.

199
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:56,290
   

200
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,380
All right.

201
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,160
So in this situation the market
is saying that its

202
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,070
market cap is $100,000.

203
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,440
So just to be proportional
let me draw it like that.

204
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,240
   

205
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,430
Not really use that one.

206
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,480
So $100,000, this is the
equity or the market

207
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,320
capitalization or the market
value of the equity.

208
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,520
That's what the market cap is.

209
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,230
So that's just the price times
the number of shares.

210
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,700
And then it has debt.

211
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:34,280
If I remember correctly it
has $100,000 in debt.

212
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:49,983
We take $100,000 in debt.

213
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:52,410
$100,000.

214
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,520
And so what is it saying
about the assets?

215
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,150
So the equity plus
the debt, or the

216
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,860
liabilities, is $200,000.

217
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:07,850
So it's saying all of the assets
are worth $200,000.

218
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,760
This is all of the
assets, $200,000.

219
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,420
But what we need to do, we want
to figure out the value

220
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,840
of the enterprise.

221
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,900
Not just all of the assets.

222
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,170
So if we remember there was some
of the assets that were

223
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,260
actually operational and some
were non-operational.

224
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,460
So we had $10,000 of
cash right there.

225
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:31,110
So we have $10,000 of cash.

226
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,990
So when this stock is trading
at $10 it implies a market

227
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,250
capitalization of $100,000.

228
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,250
It implies that the liabilities

229
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,550
plus equity is $200,000.

230
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,100
So all of the assets
are $200,000.

231
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,110
But if we were to subtract out
the cash or the non-operating

232
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,810
assets, what's not necessary
to operate the business, we

233
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,160
get $190,000 of enterprise
value.

234
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,520
So in this case we're
saying that the

235
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,790
enterprise value is $190,000.

236
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,570
So in this case, when you look
at the price to earnings

237
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,660
you're like, wow, this is half
as expensive as that.

238
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,270
This is great deal,
let me buy it.

239
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,590
And I just happened to make up
the numbers so even when I did

240
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,560
the enterprise value it's
only 5% cheaper.

241
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,430
Here it looks 50% cheaper.

242
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,540
Here it looks 5% cheaper.

243
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,960
And so it might be a
little unintuitive.

244
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,730
To figure out the enterprise
value you take, and this will

245
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,830
be the formula you see
in a lot of books.

246
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,880
Enterprise value is equal
to market cap

247
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,660
plus debt minus cash.

248
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,930
And you might be like, when I'm
trying to value something

249
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,620
why should I add debt back?

250
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,450
Debt is a negative thing.

251
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,590
Shouldn't debt make my
enterprise worth less?

252
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,480
And why am I subtracting cash?

253
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,390
Because cash is a positive
thing, shouldn't that make my

254
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,170
enterprise value more?

255
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,230
And the reason why, first, you
subtract cash is, and it

256
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,540
really should be just cash that
is not associated with

257
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,220
the enterprise.

258
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,280
And you'll see a lot of people
do it in different ways.

259
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,850
Some people subtract out all
cash with the argument that

260
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,030
the company doesn't need
to use any of it.

261
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:06,110
But the real idea behind it is
to kind of capture the assets

262
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,120
that are actually generating the
profits of the enterprise.

263
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,930
And the profits of the
enterprise are

264
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,860
the operating profits.

265
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,430
And the reason why you
add debt is, think

266
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,350
about it this way.

267
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,100
If you wanted to buy
out this company.

268
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,360
Let's say from this company you
wanted to buy his assets

269
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,210
at the market price.

270
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,880
How would you do it?

271
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,800
You would have to pay, what?

272
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,040
You would have to maybe
get $200,000.

273
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,210
If you got $200,000 you could
buy these guys off.

274
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,740
You could pay them $100,000
and own that.

275
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,830
And then you could
buy the bank out

276
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,030
and pay them $100,000.

277
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,740
So if you paid $200,000, you
would own all of this.

278
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:46,970
Right?

279
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,670
This would all be your equity.

280
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,780
And then you would get $10,000
back if you know if you wanted

281
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,060
to take this cash, right?

282
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,310
So you would have essentially
paid $200,000 which is the

283
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,040
market cap plus the debt.

284
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,840
That's what you would have to
do to buy out both of those

285
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,330
stakeholders in the company.

286
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,050
And then you would get
back the cash.

287
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,120
So you would have to pay net
$190,000 to own this

288
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,060
enterprise.

289
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,030
And hopefully that makes a
little bit more sense as why

290
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:19,020
the enterprise value is actually
described this way.

291
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,390
Now the one thing you might say,
OK, Sal, you figured out

292
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,620
how to calculate enterprise
value from a share price.

293
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,140
But what if I want to go
the other way around.

294
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,270
How do I figure out what a
company's enterprise value

295
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,750
should be and then figure
out what its share

296
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,440
price should be?

297
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,350
Well one metric, and there's
two metrics.

298
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,630
The most common metric that's
used is EBITDA.

299
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,950
EBITDA.

300
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,620
I won't cover that now because
it's a new term for you, but

301
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,230
it means earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation,

302
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,340
and amortization.

303
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,840
And people look at something
called an enterprise value to

304
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,060
EBITDA ratio.

305
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,710
And I'll do that in
the next video.

306
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,820
But what I like to do is just
think about, OK, what are the

307
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,130
real earnings from
the enterprise?

308
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,500
Well, that's the operating
profit.

309
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,700
That's the operating
profit, right?

310
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,700
And then you could apply a
multiple to that based on what

311
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,120
other companies are trading at
or how fast it's growing.

312
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,850
Let's say in this case we're
saying they're both generating

313
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,760
$30,000 in operating
profit per year.

314
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,660
Let's say that I want to
apply a 5 multiple to

315
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,520
its operating profits.

316
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:29,530
So let's say I want to say that
EV to operating profit,

317
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,730
which I frankly think is a
better metric than EV to

318
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,970
EBITDA-- and I'll cover EBITDA
in a future video-- let's say

319
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,130
that I think for this industry
it should be 5.

320
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,660
Let me say it should be 6.

321
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,530
6 times is a good multiple.

322
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:49,840
So in both those cases the
operating profit was $30,000.

323
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,990
So that means that EV should be
$30,000 times 6, which is

324
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,410
equal to $180,000.

325
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,250
Now for the first guy if the EV
is $180,000, if I'm saying

326
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,440
that this thing right here, the
market value, should be

327
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,380
$180,000, then I'm implying
that the equity should be

328
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,970
worth $180,000.

329
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:17,490
And there are 10,000 shares.

330
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,300
So essentially I would take that
EV and I would say, well,

331
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,540
all of that's equity, there's
no cash there, there's no

332
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,350
debt, so all of this
is equity.

333
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,200
So I would divide that
by the shares.

334
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,870
I would say that the market cap
for the first guy should

335
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,830
be $180,000.

336
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,520
So the per-share price,
the price I'd be

337
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,000
willing to pay, is $18.

338
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,580
Because it had 10,000 shares.

339
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,920
$18.

340
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,690
Now let's take the second
guy's situation.

341
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,340
We both agree in both situations
their enterprise

342
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:54,150
value should be $180,000.

343
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:59,190
But in this guy's case,
what are the assets?

344
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,270
The assets are the enterprise,
$180,000 plus $10,000.

345
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,880
Plus $10,000, right?

346
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,290
This whole left-hand
side is $190,000.

347
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,570
And then if you wanted to
subtract out, figure out the

348
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,570
market cap, you would take
this whole thing and then

349
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,630
subtract out the debt to
get the market cap.

350
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:17,870
Right?

351
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,850
And then you would be left with
this piece right here.

352
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,890
That right there, right?

353
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,990
You were just figuring out
this whole distance,

354
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,540
subtracting out this distance.

355
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,760
So essentially you would say
that the market cap is equal

356
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,260
to the enterprise value plus
the cash minus the debt.

357
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,870
And it's good to draw those
balance sheets if

358
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,930
you ever get confused.

359
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,800
Minus the debt.

360
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,920
So the market cap is equal to
$190,000 minus $100,000 is

361
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,050
equal to $90,000.

362
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,920
And so if you divide that by
10,000 shares you'd say that

363
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,960
I'm willing to pay
$9 per share.

364
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,710
So if you believe that the
enterprise value of these

365
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,100
pizzerias are identical and
that they're both worth

366
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,520
$180,000, you should
be willing to pay

367
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,700
$18 for Company A.

368
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,450
And if you're completely
equivalent to it, you should

369
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,369
pay $9 for Company B.

370
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,420
And now if you're a little bit
more aggressive you might like

371
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,550
the leverage, you might
like how Company B

372
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,440
is growing, et cetera.

373
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,170
Maybe you would like to pay a
premium for that leverage or

374
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,250
maybe you wouldn't, because it
also increases your risk.

375
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,599
Because you get leverage on the
upside or on the downside.

376
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,369
But anyways I wanted to
introduce you to value.

377
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,690
On the next video I'll introduce
you to EBITDA.

378
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,533
