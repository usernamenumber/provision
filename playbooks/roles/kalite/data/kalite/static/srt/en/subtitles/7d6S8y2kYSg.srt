1
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:09,983
We are at the Musee d'Orsay and we are looking at a really early and important Henri Matisse.

2
00:00:09,983 --> 00:00:12,278
This is Luxe, Calme et Volupte.

3
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:17,638
The title, and the subject, comes from a poem by Baudelaire,

4
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:22,828
and it's a really enigmatic painting and one that I think we should locate in its making.

5
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:25,624
It was made during a summer trip to a seaside,

6
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:31,763
with one of the great post-impressionist painters Signac who was a pointillist

7
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:37,398
And so you can clearly say the influence of that art and the art of Seurat and Signac here,

8
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:40,086
But this is not pointillism.

9
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:44,415
It does use these little brushstrokes which have pieces of independent color

10
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:53,061
but it's using it in a way that really, in a sense, doesn't understand or isn't interested in the optical effects that Signac was interested in.

11
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:58,773
They are much more intense colors. They are very vivid and saturated colors,

12
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:03,192
used very unnaturalistically -- not used in the way that Seurat was interested in.

13
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:05,716
In terms of increasing luminosity

14
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:08,733
Here the colors are almost an affront to the senses

15
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:12,213
There are reds and purples and oranges

16
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:14,324
Well that's perfect because the next year Matisse

17
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,326
With a number of other painters will become known as "Les fauves"

18
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:18,890
The wild beasts

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,173
That's right using color in such radical and aggresive ways

20
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:23,986
that they are accused of being madmen.

21
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:27,224
And you can definitely see that beginning to happen here.

22
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:31,295
But this is a painting that's meant to have a kind of classical aspect to it

23
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:34,471
It's not meant to be sort of aggresive in that sense. There is a real tension here

24
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:42,096
There is, between the notion of luxury, of calm, of this kind of ideal almost classicized past

25
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:46,825
and of course this wildly imaginative use of color.

26
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:51,472
But there is also a tension between the forms themselves which seem classical

27
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:56,646
and created in a way where line is primarily important.

28
00:01:56,646 --> 00:02:02,130
These beautiful harmonious lines and the arrangement between the figures

29
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,830
That might remind us of the art of Puvis de Chavannes or in Cezanne's bathers

30
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:14,418
Structured relationship of forms and that in contrast with this wild color...

31
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:21,659
it's creating this tremendously activated surface where it seems like the paint is constantly shifting and in motion.

32
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,812
It seems so antithetical to the calm

33
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:30,772
To the very subject matter. It's an artist who is in total flux, who is looking for a pathway

34
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:33,775
Who's looking to understand what painting can now do.

35
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:38,990
What to do with this extraordinary freedom that is available to the artist at the beginning of the 20th century.

36
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,261
Exactly, I think that the artist at the end of the 19th century had bequethed to the artist of the early 20th century

37
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:53,180
this incredible freedom in terms of color, thinking about the painting as an independent unit and structure

38
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,376
That could have its own internal organizaiton.

39
00:02:56,376 --> 00:03:01,499
A sense of subjectivity of the interiority of the artist as important

40
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:05,602
One feels that this is a moment of transition

41
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,869
and yet the painting itself is a tour de force, it's an incredibly beautiful thing to look at

42
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:11,916
Even with all of its internal contradictions
