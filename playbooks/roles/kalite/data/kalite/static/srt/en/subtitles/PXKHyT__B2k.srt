1
00:00:00,731 --> 00:00:02,408
PROBLEM: "The government created the following

2
00:00:02,408 --> 00:00:04,696
stem-and-leaf plot showing the number of turtles

3
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:07,169
at each major zoo in the country.

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:10,537
How many zoos have fewer than 46 turtles?"

5
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:12,753
So what the stem-and-leaf plot does

6
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:15,170
is it gives us the first digit in each number –

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,682
(So essentially, you could call this the 10's place.)

8
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:18,972
– and then these numbers represent the 1's place.

9
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:21,434
So there is only 1 zoo that had 4 turtles.

10
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:24,609
So you could view this as (0 × 10) + (4 × 1) –

11
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,199
– or 4 turtles.

12
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,212
So looking at this row –

13
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:30,225
in the 10's place – there's a 1.

14
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:32,240
So we would interpret this number 1 here

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,521
as a 10 + 1, or 11.

16
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:34,803
This is a 14.

17
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:37,670
This right over here would be a 16.

18
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,184
That's a 16.

19
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:40,600
And so forth, and so on.

20
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,267
This would be 17 – then 18.

21
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:44,956
On this row, this is 23. This is 23. This is 26 –

22
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:46,600
because we have a 2 in our tens place right over here.

23
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,933
This is the first digit.

24
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:49,154
So let's answer the question,

25
00:00:49,154 --> 00:00:52,868
"How many zoos have fewer than 46 turtles?"

26
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:56,539
Well, there are no zoos that had 40 or more turtles.

27
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,254
So let's review.

28
00:00:58,254 --> 00:00:59,969
This row shows zoos that had 30-something turtles.

29
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,684
These had 20-something turtles.

30
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,349
These had a number in the teens.

31
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:04,539
This had a single-digit number of turtles (fewer than 10).

32
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:05,846
So the answer is literally

33
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:07,046
as many zoos as we have listed here.

34
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:11,155
So, [COUNTING] 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – 7 – 8 – 9 –

35
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:15,890
10 – 11 – 12 – 13 – 14 – 15 – 16 – 17.

36
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,580
17 zoos have fewer than 46 turtles.

37
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,470
Let's do another one.

38
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,584
PROBLEM: "The buyer for a chain of supermarkets

39
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,253
created the following stem-and-leaf plot showing

40
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:27,768
the number of coconuts at each of the stores:"

41
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:29,863
"What was the smallest number of coconuts

42
00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:33,249
at any one grocery store?"

43
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,084
So the buyer for a chain of supermarkets created

44
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:36,455
the following stem-and-leaf plot

45
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:39,919
showing the number of coconuts at each of the stores.

46
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:42,307
At any one (1) grocery store, the smallest number –

47
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:44,600
well that's this one right over here.

48
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,061
Remember it's not 2.

49
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:47,446
We have our tens place right over here.

50
00:01:47,446 --> 00:01:48,072
It's a 1.

51
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:49,359
So this number right over here represents

52
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,462
12 coconuts at that store.

53
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:53,832
So we'll put 12 right over here.

54
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:55,600
Let's try another one.

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,543
"A statistician for a chain of department stores

56
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:00,095
created the following stem-and-leaf plot

57
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:02,755
showing the number of watches at each of the stores:"

58
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:06,817
"How many department stores have exactly 7 watches?"

59
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:11,303
Well, that's only this one right over here: 0 | 7 watches.

60
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:14,795
This one and that one are not 7.

61
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:16,541
This is representing 17,

62
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,803
because it's in the row with 1 at the beginning.

63
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:22,247
This right over here represents 27,

64
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:24,720
because its in the row with the 2 at the beginning.

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,137
So there's only one store that has exactly 7 watches.

66
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:29,816
Let's do one more.

67
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,418
This is kind of fun.

68
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,592
"A zookeeper created the following stem-and-leaf plot

69
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:34,738
showing the number of tigers

70
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,455
at each major zoo in the country:"

71
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:39,695
"How many zoos have more than 24 tigers?"

72
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:42,824
So, we can ignore the 0s and the teens.

73
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,185
And we get in the 20s.

74
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:45,265
This is 25.

75
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,592
So that meets the criterion.

76
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:48,211
And then you go to 28 – 29.

77
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:50,414
So all of these in the 30s,

78
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:51,818
and all of these right over here.

79
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:53,731
This 3 | 0 , this doesn't mean 0 tigers.

80
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:56,305
This is 30 tigers. This is 40 tigers.

81
00:02:56,305 --> 00:03:01,961
So we count 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – 7 – 8 – 9.

82
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:05,200
9 zoos have more than 24 tigers.

83
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,714
9 zoos.

84
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:08,000
And we're done!
