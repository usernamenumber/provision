1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:03,769
We're asked to multiple the complex number 1 minus 3 i

2
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:08,502
times the complex number 2 plus 5 i. And the general idea here

3
00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:10,277
is you can multiply these complex numbers

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:14,662
like you would have multiplied any traditional binomial

5
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:16,800
you just have to remember this isn't a variable

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,800
this is the imaginary unit i, or it's just i

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,502
but we can do that in two ways

8
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:25,390
we can just do distributive properties twice

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,800
which I like a little bit more just because it actually,

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,400
you're doing it from a fundamental principle, it's nothing new

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,852
or you could use FOIL, which you also used when you first multiplied binomials,

12
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:37,452
and I'll do it both ways.

13
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:42,400
So you could view this as just a number, 1 minus 3 i

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,529
and so we can distribute it over the two numbers inside of this expression.

15
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:48,302
So when we're multiplying times the entire expression

16
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:54,379
We can multiply 1 minus 3 i times two, and 1 minus 3 i times 5 i.

17
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,667
So let's do that. So this can be rewritten as

18
00:00:56,667 --> 00:01:04,129
1 minus 3 i times 2, I'll write the 2 out front.

19
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:13,154
Plus 1 minus 3 i, times 5 i.

20
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:14,964
All I did is a distributive property here.

21
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:19,625
All I said is, look if I have a times b plus c, this is the same things as:

22
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,610
ab plus ac.

23
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,098
I just distributed the a on the b or the c.

24
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:29,687
I just distributed the 1 - minus 3 i on the 2 and the 5 i.

25
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,733
And then I can do it again. I have a 2 now

26
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,200
times 1 minus 3 i. I can distributed it.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,498
2 times 1 is 2.

28
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:41,718
2 times negative 3 i is negative 6 i

29
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,600
And over here I'll do it again.

30
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:48,277
5 i times 1, so it's plus, 5 i times one is 5 i

31
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:52,436
And then 5 i times negative 3 i, so let's be careful here

32
00:01:52,436 --> 00:02:00,667
5 times negative 3 is negative 15, and then I have an i times an i

33
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:06,200
Right, I'm multiplying. Let me do this over here. Five i times negative 3 i

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,887
This is the same thing as 5 times negative 3 times i times i.

35
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:18,154
So the 5 times the negative 3 is negative 15, and then we have i times i,

36
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:20,021
which is i squared.

37
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:26,933
Now we know what i squared is. By definition, i squared is negative 1.

38
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:29,990
i squared by definition is negative 1.

39
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,692
So negative 15 times negative 1, well that's the same thing as positive 15.

40
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:40,154
So this can be rewritten as 2 minus 6 i plus 5 i

41
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:44,164
Negative 15 times negative 1 is positive 15

42
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,985
Now we can add the real parts

43
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:50,492
We have a 2 and we have a positive 15

44
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:55,282
So 2 plus 15, and we can add the imaginary parts

45
00:02:55,282 --> 00:03:00,867
We have a negative 6, or negative 6 i I should say

46
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:05,533
and then we have plus 5 i. So plus 5 i

47
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:09,348
And 2 plus 15 is 17

48
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:12,087
And if I have negative 6 of something plus 5 of that something

49
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:13,110
What do I have?

50
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,338
Or if I have 5 of that something, and I take 6 of that something away,

51
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:19,308
then I have negative 1 of that something.

52
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:22,533
Negative 6 i plus 5 i is negative 1 i

53
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:25,333
Or I could just say minus i. So in this way

54
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,462
I just multiplied these two expressions

55
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:29,462
or these complex numbers, really

56
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:32,600
I multiplied them just using the distributive property twice.

57
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,969
You could also do it using FOIL.

58
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:36,933
And I'll do that right now really fast.

59
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:40,467
It is a little bit faster, but it's a little bit mechanical

60
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:43,067
So you might forget why you're doing it in the first place

61
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:46,215
But at the end of the day, you are doing the same thing here

62
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:49,600
You're essentially multiplying every term of this first number

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,656
or every part of this first number,

64
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,871
times every part of the second number.

65
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:55,467
And FOIL just makes sure that we're doing it.

66
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:56,477
Let me just write FOIL out here,

67
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:59,467
which I'm not a huge fan of, but I'll do it

68
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:00,667
just in case that's the way you're learning it.

69
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:03,871
So FOIL says let's do the first numbers, let's multiply the first numbers

70
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:08,415
so that's going to be the 1 times the 2. So 1 times the 2.

71
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,200
That is the "F" in FOIL.

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,471
Then it says, let's multiply the outer numbers

73
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:16,395
times each other, so that's 1 times 5 i.

74
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:21,867
So plus 1 times 5 i. This is the "O" in FOIL.

75
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:25,333
The outer numbers. Then we do the inners numbers.

76
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:30,467
Negative 3 i times 2. So this is negative 3 i times 2.

77
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,308
This is, those are the inner numbers.

78
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:34,431
And then we do the last numbers.

79
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:39,431
Negative 3 i times 5 i. So negative 3 i times 5 i.

80
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:43,400
These are the last numbers. That's all that FOIL is telling us.

81
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,136
It's just making sure we're multiplying every part of this number, times every part of that number.

82
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:52,031
And then when we simplify it: 1 times 2 is 2

83
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:58,200
1 times 5 i is 5 i. Negative 3 i times 2 is negative 6 i

84
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,795
And negative 3 i times 5 i, well we already figured out what that was,

85
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:07,533
negative 3 i times 5 i turns out to be 15.

86
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:11,667
Negative 3 times 5 is negative 15. But i times i is negative 1

87
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:16,933
negative 15 times negative 1 is positive 15.

88
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:21,800
Add to the real parts: 2 plus 15, you get 17

89
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,071
Add to the imaginary parts: you have 5 i minus 6 i. You get negative i

90
00:05:28,071 --> 99:59:59,999
And once again, you get the exact same answer.
