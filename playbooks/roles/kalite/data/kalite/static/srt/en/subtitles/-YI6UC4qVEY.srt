1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,240
I think it's pretty common
knowledge how to find the area

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,030
of the triangle if we know the
length of its base

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,250
and its height.

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,540
So, for example, if that's my
triangle, and this length right

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,910
here-- this base-- is of length
b and the height right here is

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,080
of length h, it's pretty common
knowledge that the area of this

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,170
triangle is going to be equal
to 1/2 times the base

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,440
times the height.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,240
So, for example, if the base
was equal to 5 and the height

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,180
was equal to 6, then our area
would be 1/2 times 5 times 6,

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,770
which is 1/2 times 30--
which is equal to 15.

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,120
Now what is less well-known is
how to figure out the area of a

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,250
triangle when you're only given
the sides of the triangle.

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,740
When you aren't
given the height.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,470
So, for example, how do
you figure out a triangle

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,570
where I just give you the
lengths of the sides.

18
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,530
Let's say that's side a, side
b, and side c. a, b, and c are

19
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,640
the lengths of these sides.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,360
How do you figure that out?

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,270
And to do that we're
going to apply something

22
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,430
called Heron's Formula.

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,210
   

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,790
And I'm not going to
prove it in this video.

25
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,200
I'm going to prove it
in a future video.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,400
And really to prove it you
already probably have

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,720
the tools necessary.

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,480
It's really just the
Pythagorean theorem and

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,220
a lot of hairy algebra.

30
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,230
But I'm just going to show you
the formula now and how to

31
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,760
apply it, and then you'll
hopefully appreciate that it's

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,590
pretty simple and pretty
easy to remember.

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,660
And it can be a nice trick
to impress people with.

34
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,320
So Heron's Formula says first
figure out this third variable

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,640
S, which is essentially
the perimeter of this

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,660
triangle divided by 2.

37
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,810
a plus b plus c, divided by 2.

38
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,480
Then once you figure out S, the
area of your triangle-- of this

39
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,840
triangle right there-- is going
to be equal to the square root

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,710
of S-- this variable S right
here that you just calculated--

41
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:10,540
times S minus a, times S
minus b, times S minus c.

42
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,480
That's Heron's
Formula right there.

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,830
This combination.

44
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,130
Let me square it off for you.

45
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,700
So that right there
is Heron's Formula.

46
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,610
And if that looks a little bit
daunting-- it is a little bit

47
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,290
more daunting, clearly, than
just 1/2 times base

48
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,290
times height.

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,040
Let's do it with an actual
example or two, and actually

50
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,350
see this is actually
not so bad.

51
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,320
So let's say I have a triangle.

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,300
I'll leave the
formula up there.

53
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,460
So let's say I have a
triangle that has sides

54
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:44,920
of length 9, 11, and 16.

55
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,040
So let's apply Heron's Formula.

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,190
S in this situation is going to
be the perimeter divided by 2.

57
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,630
So 9 plus 11 plus
16, divided by 2.

58
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,430
Which is equal to 9 plus
11-- is 20-- plus 16 is

59
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,660
36, divided by 2 is 18.

60
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,430
And then the area by Heron's
Formula is going to be equal to

61
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:19,380
the square root of S-- 18--
times S minus a-- S minus 9.

62
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:27,790
18 minus 9, times 18 minus
11, times 18 minus 16.

63
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,490
   

64
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:38,200
And then this is equal to
the square root of 18

65
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,730
times 9 times 7 times 2.

66
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,340
Which is equal to-- let's
see, 2 times 18 is 36.

67
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,900
So I'll just
rearrange it a bit.

68
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:56,700
This is equal to the square
root of 36 times 9 times 7,

69
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:05,540
which is equal to the square
root of 36 times the square

70
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,330
root of 9 times the
square root of 7.

71
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,130
The square root
of 36 is just 6.

72
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,040
This is just 3.

73
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,750
And we don't deal with the
negative square roots,

74
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,920
because you can't have
negative side lengths.

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,460
And so this is going to
be equal to 18 times

76
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,120
the square root of 7.

77
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,060
So just like that, you saw it,
it only took a couple of

78
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,760
minutes to apply Heron's
Formula, or even less than

79
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,420
that, to figure out that the
area of this triangle

80
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,710
right here is equal to 18
square root of seven.

81
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,040
Anyway, hopefully you
found that pretty neat.

82
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,331
