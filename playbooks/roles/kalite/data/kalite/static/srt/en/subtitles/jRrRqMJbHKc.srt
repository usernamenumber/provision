1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,270
All right.

3
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,860
We're on problem 26.

4
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,250
For the quadrilateral shown
below, a quadrilateral has

5
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,120
four sides, measure of angle A
plus the measure of angle C is

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,310
equal to what?

7
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,770
And here, you should know that
the sum of all the angles in a

8
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,890
quadrilateral are equal
to 360 degrees.

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,410
And you might say, OK, I'll add
that to my memory bank of

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,290
things to memorize.

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,340
Like the angles in a triangle
are equal to 180.

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,110
And I'll show you no, you don't
have to memorize that.

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,010
Because if you imagine any
quadrilateral, let me draw a

14
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,960
quadrilateral for you.

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,970
And this is true
of any polygon.

16
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,770
So let's say this is
some quadrilateral.

17
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,660
You don't have to memorize that
the sum of the angles is

18
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,270
equal to 360.

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,880
Although it might be useful
for a quadrilateral.

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,040
But I'll show you how to always

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,630
prove it for any polygon.

22
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,160
You just break it up
into triangles.

23
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,770
Then you only have to
memorize one thing.

24
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:57,660
If you break it up into
triangles, this angle plus

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,080
that angle plus that angle
has to be equal to 180.

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,480
And this angle plus that angle
plus that angle have to be

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,710
equal to 180.

28
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,630
So the angles in the
quadrilateral itself are this

29
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,970
angle and this angle.

30
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,550
And then this angle
and this angle.

31
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,680
Well this one is just the sum
of those two, and this one's

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,180
just the sum of those two.

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,340
So if these three
added up to 180.

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,150
And these three added
up to 180.

35
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,870
This plus this plus this, plus
this will add up to 360.

36
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,150
And you can do that with an
arbitrarily shaped polygon.

37
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,760
Let's do five sides, let's
do a pentagon.

38
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,290
So one, two, three,
four, five sides.

39
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,230
Wow, how many angles are
there in a pentagon.

40
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,180
Just break it up
into triangles.

41
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,760
How many triangles can
you fit in it?

42
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's see.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,060
One, two.

44
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,670
Each of these triangles, their
angles, they add up to 180.

45
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:59,970
So if you want to know that,
that, that, plus that, that,

46
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,560
that, plus that,
that, and that.

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,490
That would just be 180 times
3, which is 540.

48
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,080
And that also would be the angle
measures of the polygon.

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,440
Because these three angles
add up to that angle.

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,150
That's that.

51
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,940
Those angles add
up to that one.

52
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,300
Those angles add up to that one,
and those angles add up

53
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,960
to that one.

54
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,670
So now hopefully, if I gave you
a 20 sided polygon, you

55
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,030
can figure out how many times
can I fit triangles into it.

56
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,670
And you'll know how many
angles there are.

57
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,910
And the sum of all of them.

58
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,980
But anyway, back to
the quadrilateral.

59
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,610
A quadrilateral, the sum
of the angles are

60
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,530
going to be 360 degrees.

61
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,540
So, if we say, measure of angle
A, plus measure of angle

62
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,530
C, plus these two angles.

63
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,130
Let me write it down.

64
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,940
Plus 95 plus 32 is going
to be equal to 360.

65
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,620
So I'll just write A plus C,
just a quick notation.

66
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,060
Let's see, 95 plus 32 is 127.

67
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,020
Plus 127 is equal to 360.

68
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,062
A plus C is equal to
360 minus 127.

69
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:06,070
And what is that?

70
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,680
That is 233.

71
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,190
Right, and that's the choice.

72
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,520
Fair enough.

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,370
Question 27.

74
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,330
If ABCD is a parallelogram,
that's the sides are parallel,

75
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,810
what is the length
of segment BD?

76
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,960
So they want from
here to here.

77
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,730
And this is just another
interesting thing, I'm not

78
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,320
going to prove it right now,
but this is a good thing to

79
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,350
know, especially if you
become a mathlete.

80
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,010
Because it shows up in
math competitions

81
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,340
every now and then.

82
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,020
If you have a parallelogram,
the opposite sides are

83
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,070
parallel, then their diagonals
are actually

84
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,640
bisecting each other.

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,950
Which means that they split
the other diagonal in two.

86
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,160
So this diagonal splits
this diagonal in two.

87
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,180
So if this is 6, this is
also going to be 6.

88
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,570
And this diagonal splits
BD in two.

89
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,010
So if this is 5, then
this is also 5.

90
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,390
So BE is 5, ED is 5, then
BD has to be 10.

91
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,640
Choice A.

92
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,040
   

93
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:15,950
Let me copy and paste
28 in here.

94
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,110
A right circular cone
has radius 5 inches

95
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,089
and height 8 inches.

96
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,620
Fair enough, they've
drawn it for us.

97
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,160
What is the lateral
area of the cone?

98
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,370
Good, they gave us
a definition.

99
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:34,720
Lateral area of a cone is equal
to pi times r times l,

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,730
where l is the slant height.

101
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,500
So we know what r is, they
give us r. r is 5.

102
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,780
So we just have to figure
out what the slant

103
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,330
height is, this l.

104
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,430
Well this looks like a
Pythagorean theorem problem.

105
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,280
This is a right angle, I know
it's all weird because it's

106
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,040
three dimensions.

107
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,170
But this forms a
right triangle.

108
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,360
We're just kind of picking one
slice of the cone that

109
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,630
includes the pointy part.

110
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:09,500
We say 5 squared, plus 8 squared
is equal to l squared.

111
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,960
This is a right angle,
l is the hypotenuse.

112
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,610
So we get 25 plus 64 is
equal to l squared.

113
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:26,820
So that's 89 is equal
to l squared.

114
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,760
And so, l is equal to the
square root of 89.

115
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,140
Unless, I've made a
mistake someplace.

116
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,160
Square root of 89.

117
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,170
Oh good, I see a square root
of 89 there already.

118
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,130
So we probably are on
the right track.

119
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,430
So l is equal to the
square root of 89.

120
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,650
And they give us the formula
for the lateral area of a

121
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,530
cone as pi r l.

122
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:53,120
So pi r l is equal to pi times
r, the radius of the base,

123
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,760
which is 5.

124
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:01,255
Times this slant height, which
is the square root of 89.

125
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:04,730
This equals 5 pi times the
square root of 89.

126
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,690
Which is, I just peeked
and saw, choice D.

127
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,510
Whenever you see a number like
89, you begin to get worried.

128
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,070
But it's good that that was
one of the choices.

129
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,150
Problem 29.

130
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,285
OK.

131
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:20,870
Let me copy and paste it.

132
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,460
   

133
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,710
Clear this image.

134
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,885
   

135
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:30,760
It's early on a Saturday
morning, my

136
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,310
wife is still sleeping.

137
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,370
We're expecting our first
child in a month.

138
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,560
So I figure the sleep
is good for her.

139
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,140
Gives me more time to
record math videos.

140
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,480
OK, I don't know why I go
onto those tangents.

141
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,140
OK, figure ABCD is a kite.

142
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,440
And it looks like a kite.

143
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,350
What is the area of figure ABCD
in square centimeters.

144
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,540
Well everything they're giving
us is in centimeters.

145
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,030
So if we just stay
in centimeters we

146
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,590
won't have a problem.

147
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,520
So what's the area of this?

148
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,730
So we just figure out the area
of each of these triangles.

149
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,170
And what's the area
of a triangle?

150
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,860
The area of a triangle
is equal to

151
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,540
1/2 base times height.

152
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,880
So what's the area
of this triangle?

153
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,380
Well, actually, this
is symmetric.

154
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,310
If we know the area of this
triangle, we know the area of

155
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:20,970
this triangle.

156
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,550
Because this is 6 and
8, this is 6 and 8.

157
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,570
So the area of this one
is 6 times 8 is 48.

158
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:32,450
48 times 1/2 is 24.

159
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,950
This one is also going to be
24 by the same argument.

160
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,580
So when you add them together,
you get 48.

161
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,150
Those two combined are
going to be 48.

162
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,330
Now, this triangle, 8
times 15 times 1/2.

163
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,120
That's 4 times 15, which
is equal to 60.

164
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
And this is going
to have the same

165
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,960
area by the same argument.

166
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,460
60.

167
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,410
We don't even have to multiply
by 1/2, because we're going to

168
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,070
multiply by 2 eventually.

169
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,090
Or add it to each other again.

170
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,840
So anyway, we have 60 plus 60
plus 24 plus 24, that's 120

171
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,470
plus 48, so 168.

172
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,660
Choice C.

173
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,030
Next problem.

174
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,750
Problem 31.

175
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,500
I like these problems. Now that
we're out of the whole

176
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,490
part that they were
getting into

177
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,606
congruencies and similars.

178
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:21,830
And I thought they
made a couple of

179
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,920
mistakes on some of those.

180
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,210
Anyway, if a cylindrical barrel
measures 22 inches in

181
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,390
diameter, how many inches will
it roll in 8 revolutions along

182
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,320
a smooth surface?

183
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,679
So we could imagine a wheel.

184
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,740
It's a tire of some kind.

185
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,309
So let me draw a circle.

186
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,440
So if we look at the cylindrical
barrel from the

187
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,440
side, because I think that's
all we care about.

188
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,390
That's its side.

189
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,190
They say, a cylindrical
barrel measures

190
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,700
22 inches in diameter.

191
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,090
So this distance right here.

192
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,650
   

193
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,260
That distance right
there is 22.

194
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,450
And what they say is, this
thing is going to roll 8

195
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,670
revolutions on a
smooth surface.

196
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,980
It's going to go
around 8 times.

197
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,220
It's going to roll and
move to the right.

198
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,090
So how long will it roll?

199
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,070
So if you think about it,
it's going to cover its

200
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,080
circumference 8 times.

201
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,460
If this point is starting
touching the ground, after it

202
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,610
moves a circumference of
distance, that point will be

203
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,040
touching the ground again.

204
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,590
An easy way to think about it
is, as this thing moves to the

205
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:35,240
right, as it rolls, when it
moves 1 foot, 1 foot along of

206
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,880
circumference will then be
touching the ground.

207
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,770
Or 1 cm, or 2 inches
or whatever.

208
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,080
Then 2 inches along its
circumference will be touching

209
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,470
the ground.

210
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,860
So it's going to go 8
circumferences in 8

211
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,070
revolutions.

212
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,370
So what's the circumference
of this?

213
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,700
Circumference is equal to
pi times the diameter.

214
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,410
The diameter they already
gave us is 22.

215
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,360
So the circumference
is equal to 22 pi.

216
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,630
So it's going to move 8
circumferences in 8

217
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,830
revolutions.

218
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:12,970
So 22 pi times 8 is 176 pi.

219
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,570
And that's choice C.

220
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,450
See you in the next video.

221
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,500
