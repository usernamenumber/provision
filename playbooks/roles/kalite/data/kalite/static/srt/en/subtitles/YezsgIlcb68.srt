1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,920
Let's do another problem
with repeated roots.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,375
So let's say our differential
equation is the second

4
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:15,620
derivative of y minus the first
derivative plus 0.25--

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,800
that's what's written here--
0.25y is equal to 0.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,100
And they've actually given us
some initial conditions.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:32,750
They said that y of 0 is equal
to 2, and y prime of 0 is

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,550
equal to 1/3.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,130
So like we've done in every
one of these constant

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,360
coefficient linear second order
homogeneous differential

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,820
equations, let's get the
characteristic equation.

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:54,360
So that's r squared minus r
plus 0.25-- or we can even

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,726
call it plus 1/4.

14
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:59,020
So let's see, when I just
inspected this, it always

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,310
confuses me when I
have fractions.

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,740
So it becomes very
hard to factor.

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,750
So let's just do the
quadratic formula.

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,770
So the roots of this are
going to be r is

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,410
equal to negative b.

20
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,930
Well, b is negative 1.

21
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,580
So negative b is
going to be 1.

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,780
Plus or minus the square
root of b squared.

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,860
b is negative 1.

24
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,530
So that squared is 1.

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,920
Minus 4 times a, which
is 1, times c.

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,970
Well, 4 times 1 times
0.25, that's 1.

27
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:32,470
Ah-ha.

28
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,570
So notice that when you have a
repeated root, this under the

29
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,430
square root becomes 0.

30
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,970
And that makes sense, because
it's this plus or minus in the

31
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,360
quadratic formula that gives you
two roots, whether they be

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,210
real or complex.

33
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,100
But if the square root is 0,
you're adding plus or minus 0

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,520
and you're only left
with one root.

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,060
Anyway, we're not done yet.

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,830
What's the denominator of
a quadratic equation?

37
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,470
2a.

38
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,860
So a is 1, so over 2.

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,080
So our one repeated root is 1
plus or minus 0 over 2, or it

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,230
equals 1/2.

41
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:07,110
And like we learned in the last
video, you might just

42
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,150
say, oh well, maybe the solution
is just y is equal to

43
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,460
ce to the 1/2 x.

44
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,450
But like we pointed out last
time, you have two initial

45
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,230
conditions.

46
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,060
And this solution is not general
enough for two initial

47
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,740
conditions.

48
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,630
And then last time, we said,
OK, if this isn't general

49
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,610
enough, maybe some solution that
was some function of x

50
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,990
times e to the 1/2 x, maybe that
would be our solution.

51
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,980
And we said, it turns
out it is.

52
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,140
And so that more general
solution that we found, that

53
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,030
we figured out that v of x
is actually equal to some

54
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,290
constant plus x times
some other constant.

55
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:56,170
So our more general solution is
y is equal to c1 times e to

56
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:04,460
the 1/2 x soon. plus c2
times xe to the 1/2 x.

57
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,380
I forgot the x here.

58
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,530
Let me draw a line here so
you don't get confused.

59
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,920
Anyway, that's the reasoning.

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,050
That's how we came up
with this thing.

61
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,300
And it is good to know.

62
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,200
Because later on when you want
to know more theory of

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,840
differential equations-- and
that's really the whole point

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,450
about learning this if your
whole goal isn't just to pass

65
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,090
an exam-- it's good to know.

66
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,210
But when you're actually solving
these you could just

67
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,540
kind of know the template.

68
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,200
If I have a repeated root, well
I just put that repeated

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,390
root twice, and one of them gets
an x in front of it, and

70
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,700
they have two constants.

71
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,570
Anyway, this is our general
solution and now we can use

72
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,490
our initial conditions to
solve for c1 and c2.

73
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,950
So let's just figure out the
derivative of this first. So

74
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,150
it becomes easy to substitute
in for c2.

75
00:03:46,150 --> 00:04:01,410
So y prime is equal to 1/2 c1
e to the 1/2 x, plus-- now

76
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,102
this becomes a little bit more
complicated, we're going to

77
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:08,520
have to use the product rule
here-- so plus c2 times--

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,320
derivative of x is 1-- times
e to the 1/2 x, that's the

79
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,140
product rule.

80
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,959
Plus the derivative of e
to the 1/2 x times x.

81
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,620
So that's 1/2 xe to the 1/2 x.

82
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,930
Or we can write-- I don't want
to lose this stuff up here--

83
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:38,940
we can write that it equals--
let's see, I have 1/2-- so I

84
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,210
have c2 times e to the 1/2
x and I have 1/2 times c1

85
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,050
e to the 1/2 x.

86
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,360
So I could say, it's equal
to e to the 1/2 x

87
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,370
times c1 over 2.

88
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,340
That's that.

89
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,190
Plus c2.

90
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:01,945
That takes care of these two
terms. Plus c2 over 2

91
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:06,250
xe to the 1/2 x.

92
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,370
And now let's use our
initial conditions.

93
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,030
And let me actually clear up
some space, because I think

94
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,340
it's nice to have our initial
conditions up here where we

95
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,400
can see them.

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,800
So let me delete all
this stuff here.

97
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,910
That, hopefully, makes
sense to you by now.

98
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,670
You know the characteristic
equation.

99
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,860
We figured out the general
solu-- I don't want to erase

100
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,740
our initial conditions-- we
figured out the general

101
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,040
solution was this.

102
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,950
   

103
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,030
I'll keep our general
solution there.

104
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,640
And so, now we just substitute
our initial conditions into

105
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,950
our general solution and the
derivative of the general

106
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,510
solution, and hopefully we can
get meaningful answers.

107
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,010
So substituting into our general
solution, y of 0 is

108
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,680
equal to 2.

109
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,940
So y is equal to 2 when
x is equal to 0.

110
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,386
So c1-- when x is equal
to 0, all the e terms

111
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,370
you become 1, right?

112
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,440
This one will become 1.

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,890
And then notice, we have
an xe to the 0.

114
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,390
So now this x is 0.

115
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,880
So this whole term is going
to be equal to 0.

116
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,890
So we're done. c1
is equal to 2.

117
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,430
That was pretty straightforward.

118
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,500
This x actually made
it a lot easier.

119
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,290
So c1 is equal to 2.

120
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,750
And now we can use
the derivative.

121
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,710
So let's see, this is the
first derivative.

122
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,530
And I'll substitute c1
in there so we can

123
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,420
just solve for c2.

124
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:30,280
So our first derivative is y
prime is equal to-- let's see

125
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:40,790
c1-- 1/2 plus c2-- so it's--
well I'll write this first--

126
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,100
it's equal to 2 over 2.

127
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:56,006
So it's 1 plus c2 times e to the
1/2 x plus c2 over 2 times

128
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:58,950
xe to the 1/2 x.

129
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,370
There was an x here.

130
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,600
So when x is equal to 0, y
prime is equal to 1/3.

131
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,810
So 1/3 is equal to-- well, x is
equal to 0, this'll be 1--

132
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,440
so it's equal to 1 plus c2.

133
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,610
And then this term, when x is
equal to 0, this whole thing

134
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,300
becomes 0, right?

135
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,400
Because this x just cancels
out the whole thing.

136
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,310
You multiply by 0 you get 0.

137
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,950
So then we get 1/3 is equal to 1
plus c2, or that c2 is equal

138
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,830
to 1/3 of minus 1 is
equal to minus 2/3.

139
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,010
And now we have our particular
solution.

140
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,980
Let me write it down and
put a box around it.

141
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,380
So this is our general
solution.

142
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,680
Our particular solution, given
these initial conditions for

143
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,890
this repeated root problem, is
y is equal to c1-- we figured

144
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:52,640
that out to be 2 fairly
quickly-- 2e to the 1/2 x plus

145
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
c2. c2 is minus 2/3.

146
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,940
So minus 2/3 xe to the 1/2 x.

147
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,300
And we are done.

148
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,580
There is our particular
solution.

149
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,940
So once again, kind of
the proof of how

150
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,160
do you get to this.

151
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,420
Why is there this x in there?

152
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,384
And it wasn't a proof, it was
really more of just to show

153
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:14,240
you the intuition of where
that came from.

154
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,350
And it did introduce you to a
method called, reduction of

155
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,200
order, to figure out what that
function v was, which ended up

156
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,280
just being c1 plus c2 times x.

157
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,800
But all that can be pretty
complicated.

158
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,790
But you see that once you know
the pattern, or once you know

159
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,970
that this is going to be the
general solution, they're

160
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,870
pretty easy to solve.

161
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,400
Characteristic equation.

162
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,080
Get your general solution.

163
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,340
Figure out the derivative
of the general solution.

164
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,690
And then substitute your initial
conditions to solve

165
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,470
for your constants.

166
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,799
And you're done.

167
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,840
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

168
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,240
And actually, we're going to
start solving non-homogeneous

169
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,630
differential equations.

170
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,880
See

171
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,400
