[Intro Music]

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're in the Louvre and we're looking at a large alter panel by Giotto of St Francis.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's really spectacular painting.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is. It shows St Francis receiving the stigmata from Christ who appear to him in the form of seraphim.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what's striking is that this is not St Francis in a very iconic frontal way.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As we might've expected in the more medieval tradition.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly. Instead, St Francis is kneeling;

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He's in a naturalistic landscape, or a beginnings, we could say, of a naturalistic landscape

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and as he receives the stigmata, he looks up in wonder, in awe, and in confusion, and even some anxiety.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A little fear there, right?

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yeah.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But they're very human emotions. It's really an expression of, you're right, not an eternal iconic image

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but rather of a moment of a man responding.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And his body is rendered naturalistically, too.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have modelling.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We see the folds in the drapery.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We see his left knee, his right knee folded under him.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The modelling in his hands where we see the stigmata.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Modelling in his face.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So he really seems like this bulky three-dimensional presence.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Really different from the flat transcendent figures of only a little bit earlier.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And actually other artists that are still painting.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want to go back to the point that you made a moment ago,

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the naturalistic landscape.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is certainly not naturalism as we would expect now in the 21st century.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it is at the very beginning of the 14th or the very end of the 13th century

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
quite extraordinary innovation to place this really physical figures you had described him, in an environment

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with trees with mountain.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Clearly his scale doesn't match the buildings and the trees

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but there's an effort here by Giotto to place him on Earth not just in a heavenly space.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we see this extraordinary gold filled background the light of heaven pours down

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we see that literally in the divine rays that go from the seraphim-from Christ, down to Francis, down to his feet to his hands and to the wound in his side.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This gift from heaven for his faithfulness.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now it's important to remember that Francis was a mendicant.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Was a beggar.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That he'd given up his worldly possessions and like the Dominicans,

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Franciscans would renounce worldly possessions in honour of Christ

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and initially there are some reports that the church was not sure that it wanted to accept St Francis'

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ideas
