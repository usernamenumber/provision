1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,940
Express the area of a rectangle
with length 4xy and

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,580
width 2y as a monomial.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,360
Monomial just means
just one term.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,710
So let's think about
a rectangle.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,910
So let me draw a
rectangle here.

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,350
   

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,860
And they're telling us that the
length is 4xy and they're

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,850
telling us that the
width is 2y.

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,610
And just as a bit of a
refresher, we know the area of

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,950
a rectangle is just the width
times the length, or the

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,045
height times the width, or
however you want to view it--

13
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:40,680
just the product of its
two dimensions.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,390
So the area of this rectangle,
the area is going to be equal

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:58,390
to this length, 4xy times
the width times 2y.

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,860
We can simplify this.

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,540
We have a 4 times a 2.

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,570
   

19
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,660
Whenever you're just taking a
product of a bunch of things

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,680
you can switch the order however
you like, as long as

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,500
it's all multiplication.

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,620
So 4 times 2, that gives us 8.

23
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,590
Then we have this
x sitting here.

24
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,380
That is the only x we have
there, so it's 8 times x.

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,310
And then we have a y here.

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,260
We could view that as y to the
first. And then we have

27
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,220
another y there.

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,550
We could view that as y to
the first. So y times y.

29
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,140
You could view that
as y squared.

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,160
Or you could say look, y to
the first times y to the

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,140
first-- same base, add the two
exponents-- 1 plus 1 is 2.

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,970
So it's 8xy squared.

33
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,670
This y squared covers both that
y and that y over there.

34
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,230
And we're done.

35
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,855
We've expressed the area of this
rectangle as a monomial.

36
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:51,733
