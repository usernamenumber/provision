1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,060
Let's say I've got some type of book over here. There is my book

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,480
I'll write it down, book

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,030
Draw the entire book

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,590
So this is my entire book just like that

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,840
and then I have a mirror over here

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,570
This is our mirror. We're looking at from the side

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,990
So that is a mirror

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,700
I'm really picking an arbitrary point of this book

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:36,610
We know that there's light that is coming on this book

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,050
We're assuming that the book will reflect the light diffusely

11
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,210
like most books do. It's not a shiny book

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,860
And so any point on this book--we can pick any arbitrary point on this book

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,040
It's going to be emitting light at a whole bunch of directions

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,180
I'm going to pick 2 light rays that's being emitted from this point on the book

15
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,810
It'll be more than 2, but this will help us understand what's going on here

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:06,980
So let me pick one light rays that goes like this and hits the mirror

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,400
Incident angle is equal to reflected angles

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,260
So it'll reflect off at the same angle just like that

19
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:26,260
Let me pick another ray that is coming out radially from that same point like that

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,020
It has a larger incident angle, so it'll have a larger reflected angle, just like that

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:42,820
And now let's think about what an observer--someone who has their eyeball right over here

22
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:53,760
So let's think about what this person right over here will actually see

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:00,080
Now their eye--all reality is really just a big simulation just going on in our brains

24
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,980
Now this person's eye is going to see these 2 light rays diverging from some common point

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,970
If you were to look straight at the book--

26
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,200
let me just do another examples

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,420
Someone's looking any arbitrary object

28
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,700
Let's say, that's some orange right over there

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,860
Just ignore all the stuff on the left

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,820
Look at the orange. No mirror, nothing, no reflection or anything

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,260
If I look at a certain point on the orange

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,100
light from that point would be diverging out radially

33
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,790
and if my eyes were right over there

34
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,010
my brain says, okay, I have these light rays diverging from a single point

35
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,720
It will show me that point, that orange in my brain

36
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,570
Now the same thing is going to happen here

37
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:54,800
even though these 2 rays actually aren't diverging a point out here

38
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,370
Your brain will say, okay, I've got

39
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,000
2 rays that are coming out from what looks like a point over here

40
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,280
It'll really just extrapolate these lines backwards

41
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,540
It'll take that green ray and say, it must be coming from a point out there

42
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,300
and it'll take that magenta ray and say, it must be coming from a point out there

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,780
Even here, your eye is just seeing these two light rays

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
It doesn't know what's going on over here. It just says

45
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,660
okay, they're converging from a point

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,570
And so in this person's reality or my rally, I think that there is an orange there

47
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,960
Likewise, I see these two light rays diverging from some common point

48
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,800
I will extrapolate to figure out or my brain will try to think about where that

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,990
point is in a three-dimensional space. It says, look

50
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,750
these two rays look like are coming from a point back over here

51
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,750
Now the reality is, they're not back over here

52
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,510
There it nothing behind the mirror

53
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,720
but to this observer, it looks like the light is being emitted behind the mirror

54
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:02,100
So what the person would actually see is something like this

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,080
and this is probably not too foreign to anyone's experiences

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,290
We've all looked in mirrors

57
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,560
Remember, this is the right side of this book

58
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,840
This is the side that has the curvy part of the B

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,770
So this side has the curvy part of the B. So it looks like this

60
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,470
So what this observer sees is an image that looks like this

61
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,800
This is what people call the mirror image

62
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,890
It flipped the left and the right and you can think about why that is

63
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,410
I could draw another ray here to make it clear

64
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,940
This ray is coming like this. Now it will reflect and come out back like this

65
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,820
To this observer it came from that point right over there

66
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,590
So he sees a flipped version of the book

67
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,150
There's a whole reason why I did this

68
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,160
One's to make you feel a little comfortable with these reflecting lines and all of that

69
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,500
but I guess more importantly, to make you more comfortable with the idea of a virtual image

70
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,680
This right here is a a virtual image

71
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,460
We are going to compare it with a real image in the next video

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
To some degree, a virtual image is more intuitive

73
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,760
because we have so much experience with it when we think about mirrors or reflective surfaces

74
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,170
So it's a virtual image

75
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,630
We call it a virtual image because we can't--the book really isn't there

76
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,580
It's virtually there. There is no actual physical space for that image

77
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,220
Our brain just uses this diverging light

78
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:29,280
and creates a model inside of our brain to say, okay, that book exists there

79
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,230
even though the source of the light is over here

80
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,420
Now I'm going to draw another diagram. This is more--

81
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,030
you normally won't have the diagrams that have this type of perspective

82
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,310
but just to give you a sense of the same thing, of some of these diagrams we're gonna do

83
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,610
when we study mirrors and lenses

84
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,720
As we can imagine, let's say that this is the ground

85
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,930
This is our mirror

86
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,170
And let's say that this is--this actually could be somebody standing in front of a mirror

87
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,510
Usually people will draw an arrow here, just saying an arbitrary object

88
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,270
Let's just say we have an arrow in front of the mirror, just so you get used to this notation

89
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,010
This is just a physical arrow; this is not a light ray

90
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,290
Now let's think about what the image of this arrow

91
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,060
Let's say this arrow had eye. So it's actually a person

92
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,950
This arrow had eyes. What would this arrow see?

93
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,270
Let's just pick an arbitrary point of this arrow; you can do with any point

94
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,890
of this object, because every point will be reflecting light diffusely

95
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,170
So I'm gonna take one point that's coming straight out of the mirror

96
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,420
One light ray that goes straight to the mirror. Parallel to the ground

97
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:41,880
It's going to reflect straight off and then come back to the source of that light

98
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,050
may be that arrow's eye if you view it as a person

99
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:51,550
Let's just do another ray coming from that point. It might come out like that

100
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,270
Incident angle is equal to reflected angle. So it would come back like that

101
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,280
Now maybe this whole thing is an eye. Maybe that will simplify things

102
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:09,460
Let's say it's really close to the mirror. This whole thing is an eye

103
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,160
Now what would the eye see?

104
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,370
Well, this ray looks like it's coming from back over here

105
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,490
And this ray looks like it's coming from back over here

106
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,280
This is where they converge

107
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,700
So the eye would see this point of the eye over there

108
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,250
So it will actually see itself

109
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,320
And in general, this type of diagrams are used to think about

110
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:39,440
what would the real or virtual image be of an object

111
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,330
once the light from that object either is reflected off a mirror

112
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,940
or goes through some type of lens

113
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,050
We'll be doing this a lot more in future videos

114
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,630
but anyway, hopefully that gets you a little bit familiar with the things we'll be dealing with
