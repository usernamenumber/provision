1
00:00:00,564 --> 00:00:03,484
In the last video, we touched a bit on the idea of

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:05,751
final goods and services

3
00:00:05,751 --> 00:00:07,845
and we talked about the situation

4
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:11,103
in which in the given period that we're calculating GDP

5
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:12,832
so this might be in a given year,

6
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:14,612
where we're essentially starting from scratch

7
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:17,146
and we put in the labour, the land, we get the cotton

8
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:19,943
the market value of that is ten dollars at raw cotton

9
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:21,549
and then we are able to turn that into thread

10
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:23,015
with the market value of twenty dollars

11
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:24,899
and we keep on going and going

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,444
all the way until we get the finished product of jeans,

13
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:30,413
which has a market value of fifty dollars.

14
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:32,817
We saw in the last video

15
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:36,950
that the contribution to GDP will just be this final product

16
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,494
it will just be the fifty dollars worth of jeans

17
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:41,501
and we know its value based on its market value,

18
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:43,199
what people are willing to pay for it.

19
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:48,117
We will not count all of these intermediary goods,

20
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:50,766
but that probably raised a question in your head:

21
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:55,297
What if all these does not happen in a given year?

22
00:00:55,297 --> 00:01:01,583
What if the year were to end right over here?

23
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,750
So we're thinking about GDP in a year

24
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,748
but we could think about GDP in a quarter, whatever.

25
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:07,083
What if the period under question ends over here?

26
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,599
so this is period one, let's call this period one

27
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:13,549
period one

28
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,582
and then this is going to be period two

29
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:20,717
so period one, we get to the point that we have a market value of twenty dollars worth of thread

30
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:23,593
and then period two, we get all the way to the jeans.

31
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:26,617
So this is period two over here.

32
00:01:26,617 --> 00:01:29,112
So this might be one year and this might be the year after that.

33
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:33,596
But what happens is that in period one, we would look at this good

34
00:01:33,596 --> 00:01:34,943
this intermediary good,

35
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:36,566
that's sitting in someone's inventory some place,

36
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:39,496
it's getting ready to be used, to get more finished,

37
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:45,629
we would say this is the contribution to GDP.

38
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:49,559
And we consider this as an investment that's going to be used in the future to produce other things

39
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:55,051
So in period one the contribution will be twenty dollars,

40
00:01:55,051 --> 00:02:01,216
and then in period two, the contribution won't be just be the fifty dollars.

41
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:04,641
So we do get to a point where the jeans are worth fifty dollars,

42
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:10,400
but so that we haven't double counted the same twenty dollars in both period one and period two,

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,388
we'll subtract out what our starting point was

44
00:02:13,388 --> 00:02:16,693
or essentially we'll subtract out the contribution

45
00:02:16,693 --> 00:02:20,134
the intermediary products that were already counted in previous periods.

46
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:25,400
Or you could say we'll subtract out the market value of the input

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,745
at the beginning of that period.

48
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:33,900
So you'd say fifty dollars minus the twenty dollars.

49
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,545
And so you would get a contribution to GDP by taking this twenty dollar intermediary good

50
00:02:39,545 --> 00:02:43,097
and turning it into a fifty dollar final good

51
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:49,277
the contribution to GDP in period two would be thirty dollars.
