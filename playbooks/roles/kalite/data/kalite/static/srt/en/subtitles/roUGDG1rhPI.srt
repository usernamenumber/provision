1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
We've already touched on ethers
in several videos.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,080
They've been our useful aprotic
solvent in several of

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,800
our reactions.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,130
But I thought it was about time
that we actually devoted

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,460
a video or two to ethers.

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,820
And like all things that we've
done in organic chemistry, a

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,950
good way to familiarize
ourselves with the molecules

9
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,210
and how they look, is to
actually name them.

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,130
So let's do a couple.

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,280
And the first few you've
seen already.

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,210
So let's say we have this
molecule right here.

13
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,640
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to teach you two

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,430
ways to name it.

15
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,740
The common name, and that's
probably the more important

16
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,270
one, especially with ethers.

17
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,860
Because, as you could imagine,
that is the more common name.

18
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,050
That is what people say.

19
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,940
And then I'll also show
you how to name it

20
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,350
using the IUPAC name.

21
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,140
So let me write this down.

22
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:50,950
IUPAC name, which is the
International Union of Pure

23
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,490
and Applied Chemistry.

24
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,420
And they've come up with kind
of the official naming

25
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,410
protocols for all of these
organic molecules.

26
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,070
This is actually the convention
that we used

27
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,260
earlier when we did the alkanes
and the alkenes.

28
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,420
But in the case of ethers, the
common name is more common.

29
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,280
So the common name for this
molecule right here.

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,350
You look at the two carbon
groups here.

31
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,770
So let's see.

32
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,630
You have this one right here.

33
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,900
That is an ethyl group.

34
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,190
That's an ethyl group
right there.

35
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,010
You have one, two carbons.

36
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,910
And then you look at the other
carbon group right over there.

37
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,280
That's also an ethyl group.

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,340
You have one, two carbons.

39
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,250
So you call this-- let me just
write this down-- that is also

40
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,000
an ethyl group.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,075
So the common name for this
is just diethyl ether.

42
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:38,820
   

43
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,610
And the ether tells you, this
part tells you, that you have

44
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,600
an oxygen in between your
two ethyl groups.

45
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,085
This is the common name.

46
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:50,460
   

47
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,710
Now the International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry

48
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,290
official name for it.

49
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,870
You kind of do something similar
to how we named other

50
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,450
things before.

51
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,260
You look for the
longest chain.

52
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,940
Let me redraw it.

53
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,280
So maybe on the left hand side
I'll do the common names.

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,669
On the right hand side I'll
do the IUPAC names.

55
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,630
So let me redraw what
the common name

56
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,010
of the diethyl ether.

57
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,520
You look for the
longest chain.

58
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,580
In this case, there's
two longest chains.

59
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,980
There's this one that has
one, two carbons.

60
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,260
And then you have this one,
that has one, two carbons.

61
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,590
So you can pick either one.

62
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,450
I'll just pick this one as the
main chain right over there.

63
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,180
It has two carbons,
no double bonds.

64
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,430
It is an ethane.

65
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,640
   

66
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,870
And then you say, OK, I have
this alkoxy group.

67
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,820
We put the oxy at the end of it
because it has this oxygen

68
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,530
right here.

69
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,330
But it's the alk part of it
has two carbons, one, two.

70
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,360
So we call this right here,
we call this ethoxy.

71
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,940
   

72
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,190
So one other way to name this,
we have this ethoxy group

73
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,390
attached to the one carbon.

74
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,490
We're just going to start
numbering on this side of the

75
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,910
ethane, just because that's
where the group is, attached

76
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,070
to the one carbon.

77
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,390
So we call this 1-ethoxyethane.

78
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:15,200
   

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,120
You'll almost never see it
actually named this way, even

80
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,860
though this is the
official name.

81
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,840
You're much more likely to see
this as diethyl ether.

82
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,140
And at least in my brain, this
resonates a lot more.

83
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,920
You just say what are
the two groups.

84
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,080
And you throw the
ether at end.

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,130
You know that there's an
oxygen in between.

86
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,870
Let's do a couple
more of these.

87
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,990
So let's say I have this
molecule right here.

88
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,810
I have this molecule
right over here.

89
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,490
The common way is you look at
the two groups on either side

90
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,010
of the oxygen.

91
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,260
So this right here-- let me do
this in a different color--

92
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,810
this group on the left
right here, we have

93
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,830
one, two, three carbons.

94
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,610
It's a propyl group,
but we're attached

95
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,580
to that middle carbon.

96
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,190
So this is an isopropyl group.

97
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,550
   

98
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,170
And on the right hand
side right here, we

99
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,560
just have one carbon.

100
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,780
So this is right here-- I keep
using that blue-- this right

101
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,820
here, this is a methyl group.

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,470
So the common way of naming
it, you just list both of

103
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,880
these groups and then
you write ether.

104
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,730
And you list them in
alphabetical order.

105
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,560
I comes before m.

106
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:32,703
So this is, the common name
is isopropyl methyl ether.

107
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:36,890
   

108
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,140
Now if we were to do the IUPAC
naming, we look for the

109
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,310
longest carbon chain.

110
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,110
Let me redraw the
molecule itself.

111
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,380
So let me redraw the same
thing right there.

112
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,880
So what's the longest
carbon chain here?

113
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,660
Well we have one, two, three
carbons right there.

114
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,300
We only have one carbon
right there.

115
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,020
So this thing right here is
our longest carbon chain.

116
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,950
It has three carbons on it, and
it had no double bonds.

117
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,610
So eth, meth, prop, propyl,
or it's actually propane.

118
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,120
So this is our longest. So we
write propane right there,

119
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,130
because we're using the IUPAC
naming mechanism.

120
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,110
And then we look at this methoxy
group right here.

121
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,740
And I call this a methoxy group,
because I have the o.

122
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,860
That gives us the oxy.

123
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,200
And I just have a methyl
group right here.

124
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,450
So this is methoxy.

125
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,530
   

126
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,090
You remember that meth is the
prefix for just having only

127
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,920
one carbon.

128
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,950
We add the oxy because
that oxygen is there.

129
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,010
And it's attached to the two
carbons on the propane chain,

130
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,190
no matter what direction you
start naming from, or

131
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,870
numbering from.

132
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,390
One, two, three.

133
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,640
So this is 2-methoxypropane.

134
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:51,300
   

135
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,120
Let's do another one.

136
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,940
Let's do one more.

137
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,620
And I think you'll get the
gist of at least the

138
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,070
reasonably simple
ethers to name.

139
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:05,090
So let's put a ring
over there.

140
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,620
And then that's attached
to an oxygen.

141
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,640
And then we have another carbon
chain right here.

142
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,610
And then we have another carbon
chain right there.

143
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,360
Let me just copy and paste
that so that I don't

144
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,110
have to redraw it.

145
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,080
So let me copy and paste.

146
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,090
All right.

147
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,050
So let's do the common name
first. That always tends to be

148
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,220
a little bit more fun.

149
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,780
So on this side, we have one,
two, three, four, five, six

150
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,850
carbons in a cycle.

151
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,620
This right here on the
left hand side is

152
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,190
a cyclohexyl group.

153
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,080
   

154
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,910
This on the right hand side,
we have one, two, three.

155
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,380
This is just a straight-up
propyl group.

156
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,960
   

157
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,970
And so when you name the ether,
you just put these two

158
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,050
groups in alphabetical
order, and you add an

159
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,990
ether at the end.

160
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,470
So it's cyclohexyl.

161
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,570
C comes before p.

162
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,670
So it's cyclohexyl propyl.

163
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,860
Let me get that shade
of yellow right.

164
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,750
Cyclohexyl propyl ether.

165
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,580
   

166
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,670
Now let's do the IUPAC
way to name it.

167
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,870
So you look for the longest
carbon chain here.

168
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,090
In this case, it's going to be
the cyclohexane right here.

169
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,540
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six carbons there.

170
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,310
We only have one, two,
three there.

171
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,020
So this is kind of
our backbone.

172
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,370
So we write down cyclohexane.

173
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,950
   

174
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,080
No double bonds, so
it's a hexane.

175
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,410
So that's the cyclohexane
right there.

176
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,920
If you just had these three
carbons, it would be a propyl.

177
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,170
But this is not just
three carbons.

178
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,020
It's three carbons and
then an oxygen.

179
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,200
So we would call it a propoxy.

180
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,920
So this is propoxy group.

181
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,890
   

182
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,710
And you don't have to number
it because it can just be

183
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,080
attached to any of
these carbons.

184
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,670
It would essentially be
the same molecule.

185
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,930
So you can just call this
propoxy cyclohexane.

186
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,790
   

187
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,160
Let me make it a little bit
closer to the cyclohexane.

188
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,750
Propoxy cyclohexane.

189
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,020
But once again the common
name is what you're

190
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,980
more likely to see.

191
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,990
Now that we've named a few of
them, let's think a little bit

192
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,660
about their properties.

193
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,680
What we've seen already is
that-- and we've used it

194
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,180
several times, especially in our
Sn2 reactions and things

195
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,960
like that-- places where
we didn't want

196
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,120
protons floating around.

197
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,559
We used actually
diethyl ether.

198
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,760
And in general ethers do
make for good solvents.

199
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,409
They tend to be fairly
unreactive.

200
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,140
So good solvents.

201
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,160
Especially when you're looking
for an aprotic solvent.

202
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,060
Remember, aprotic means you
don't have hydrogens that can

203
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,710
kind of lose their electron to
maybe an electronegative atom

204
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,640
like an oxygen.

205
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,395
And then the proton just floats
around, and then can go

206
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:02,450
and react with other things.

207
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,865
This does not have any hydrogens
directly bonded to

208
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:06,980
an oxygen in any
of these cases.

209
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,500
So it is an aprotic solvent.

210
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,930
And because it doesn't have any
hydrogens bonded to the

211
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,670
oxygen, you also have
no hydrogen bonding.

212
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,970
And just as a bit of a review,
you know that in water you

213
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,740
have the situation-- let me draw
some water molecules-- in

214
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,400
water you have the situation
where the

215
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,610
oxygen hogs the electrons.

216
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,630
So it has a partial
negative charge.

217
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,830
Hydrogen gets its electrons
hogged or taken away, or it

218
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,860
spends less time with them.

219
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,550
So it has a partial
positive charge.

220
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,130
So this oxygen will have a
partial negative charge.

221
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,520
And so the hydrogens with the
partial positive charge are

222
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,260
attracted to the oxygens with
the partial negative charge.

223
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,000
And you have this hydrogen
bonding.

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,220
And this hydrogen bonding
makes water.

225
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,710
It pulls the molecules
together.

226
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,080
So you need to put more energy
into it for it to either melt,

227
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,015
or for it to actually boil.

228
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,260
And for the molecules to
kind of get ripped

229
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,440
away from each other.

230
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,120
And that's also true
with alcohols.

231
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,990
Alcohols only have one hydrogen
to each oxygen, but

232
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,640
they still have the hydrogen
bonding going on.

233
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,390
In the case of ethers, there
is no hydrogen bonding.

234
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,060
I'll represent each of
the carbon chains

235
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,740
with an R and an R.

236
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,820
I'll write R prime right here
to show that it could be a

237
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,680
different carbon chain
than this right here.

238
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,400
And the R stands for radical.

239
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,410
Not to be confused with
free radical.

240
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,090
Completely different things.

241
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,470
This R just means really
a carbon chain

242
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,535
attached to this oxygen.

243
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:37,890
But here there's no hydrogen
getting its electrons hogged

244
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,730
by oxygens with partial
positive and

245
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,060
partial negative charges.

246
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,570
So you're not going to have that
type of hydrogen bonding.

247
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,380
And because of that, ethers have
much lower melting and

248
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,170
boiling points.

249
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:50,960
It's much easier.

250
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,430
You have to put less heat into
the system for these molecules

251
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,260
to break away from each other,
because they aren't attracted

252
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,510
to each other as much.

253
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,867
