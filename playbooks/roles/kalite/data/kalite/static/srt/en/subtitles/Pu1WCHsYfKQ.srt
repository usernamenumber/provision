00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:06,455
Dr. Steven Zucker: We're in the National Gallery in London

3
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:09,641
and we're looking at a really rare painting

4
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:11,176
--a painting by Duccio

5
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:12,543
--there are very few in the world

6
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:14,171
--this is a virgin child with saints

7
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:16,661
--it's got at the top of it a little teeny

8
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:17,820
image of King David

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,174
Dr. Beth Harris: From the Old Testament

10
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:22,625
Dr. Zucker: And he's surround by Old Testament prophets

11
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,384
who are identified with their scrolls

12
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:27,713
Dr. Harris: It's sort of standard iconography

13
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:29,889
--so you have the prophets who foretell

14
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:31,404
the coming of Christ

15
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:34,175
--and then below here we have a triptych

16
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:35,936
so that when the wings are open

17
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,358
--Mary and Christ are revealed

18
00:00:37,358 --> 00:00:38,875
--so it's kind of wonderful in that

19
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,205
you have the prophets at the top

20
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:42,126
--who are always there with King David

21
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:45,060
--and then when the triptych is open the revealing

22
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,875
of the truth of their prophecy comes to be

23
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,674
--and King David was thought to be or understood to be

24
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:52,360
an ancestor of Christ

25
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,575
Dr. Zucker: And is wearing a blue that relates

26
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:56,853
directly to the blue that Mary wears

27
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:58,872
--there is a kind of intimacy here

28
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:01,417
that is absolutely revolutionary and is the foundation

29
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:02,744
of the Renaissance later

30
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:04,790
--look at the way the Christ child looks up

31
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,417
really adoringly at his mother

32
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:08,906
Dr. Harris: Sort of grabs hold of her vail

33
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:11,101
to sort of make sure he sees her face

34
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,673
Dr. Zucker: And look at the delicacy

35
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,656
of that vail--I think that's one of the most

36
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:16,340
beautiful areas of this painting

37
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,961
--the way in which he gathers her vail in one hand

38
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:21,276
and pulls on it with the other

39
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:23,020
--and creates this very soft kind of arc

40
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,508
between them--this bridge between them

41
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:26,895
--Duccio is a Sienese artist

42
00:01:26,895 --> 00:01:29,736
and certainly Duccio's work is characterized

43
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:32,510
by the sensitivity to the decorative

44
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,926
both in the subtlety of color but also in form

45
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:37,995
--a kind of interest in the decorative

46
00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:38,943
for its own sake

47
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:40,341
--and I think you really see that in the way

48
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:42,309
that Christ pulls at the inner garment

49
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:44,790
around Mary's neck and creates

50
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,103
a series of really beautiful and rhythmic folds

51
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:49,843
Dr. Harris: Ya--and playful lines and curves

52
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,971
that carry down around the golden hem

53
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:56,329
of Christ's garment and Mary's garment

54
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,984
Dr. Zucker: You see it also in the rendering

55
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:01,923
of St. Aurea whose a rare saint

56
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:03,976
to shown in paintings of this time

57
00:02:03,976 --> 00:02:05,439
-- I think of any time

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,391
-- And St. Dominic on the left as well

59
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:08,906
-- both of those saints are so direct

60
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:12,721
that they seem to be almost stepping out of the picture plane

61
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:15,858
--there's a sense of truthfulness--of veracity almost

62
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:18,807
that seems so precocious for this moment

63
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:21,137
Dr. Harris: I think when we look overall

64
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:23,644
at the painting--at this little altar piece

65
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,245
that would have been a private altar piece

66
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,637
for private devotion that someone could carry around

67
00:02:28,637 --> 00:02:31,708
if they moved and wanted to have the ability

68
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:32,937
to worship and pray

69
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:34,668
--so it's important to remember that

70
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:35,938
this is an aid in prayer

71
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:37,709
--but when we look at it there is a real sense

72
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,842
of the physical presence of the saints on either side

73
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:42,977
and of that emotion connection

74
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:45,522
with Mary and her physical presence

75
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:47,604
--so we are seeing the beginnings

76
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:49,989
of this change to the Renaissance

77
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:51,890
Dr. Zucker: It's so interesting that Duccio

78
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,027
is creating these connections which will lay

79
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:57,844
foundation for the Renaissance

80
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,155
which will come a century later

81
00:02:59,155 --> 00:03:02,190
--but at the same time this is so firmly rooted

82
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,705
also in the medieval tradition

83
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:06,345
and we're never very far from that

84
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:08,021
--not only do we have these broad gold

85
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,924
fields which are really representation

86
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,662
of the divine light of heaven

87
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:14,194
--there's no rational relationship

88
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,802
between the figures in terms of scale

89
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:18,291
--and then of course there's that strong

90
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,577
byzantine influence still in the elongation

91
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:23,391
of the nose--look at Mary--of her fingers

92
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:28,418
--even as Duccio begins to explore the possibility

93
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:30,738
of creating a more intimate

94
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:33,076
and I think emotionally charged rendering

95
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:47,078
