1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:07,709
I'm gonna draw for you two of the most important organs in the body.

2
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:13,871
They're on the left and right side of the body and look pretty much like that.

3
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:18,058
They look like kidney beans and that's what they are, they're kidneys.

4
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:25,176
So we have some arteries, the renal arteries, that flow into them.

5
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:30,835
And renal is just a word referring to kidneys.

6
00:00:30,835 --> 00:00:37,277
And we've got renal veins with blood flowing back out of them.

7
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:43,437
Once the blood is headed back to the heart, 
we call it renal vein.

8
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:46,343
And there are two of them.

9
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:50,674
The most important part of these kidneys,
certainly the part that makes them unique,

10
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:53,938
is that they have these ureters.

11
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:59,800
And these ureters drain urine into a bladder.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,100
I'm gonna draw that right here, that's the bladder.

13
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:10,176
The ureters are the third tube coming out of our kidney.

14
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:17,404
When you're ready to urinate you can release all that urine from your bladder into the outside world.

15
00:01:17,404 --> 00:01:21,773
There's three basic things that I want you to remember coming into or out of kidneys.

16
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:25,600
The renal arteries, the renal veins and the ureters.

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,000
To really make sense of it, you gotta think about how the artery might split up.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,105
So we go back to the artery and we follow it.

19
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:38,873
It starts kind of branching into five little branches,
it might have more branches out of those branches,

20
00:01:38,873 --> 00:01:44,725
and finally maybe even some more branches,
eventually it's not even an artery anymore, right?

21
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:50,520
All these little branches are so tiny, 
you would call them arterioles.

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,896
Let's just take this arteriole, this little guy
and let's see what happens.

23
00:01:54,896 --> 00:02:02,293
So let's take that little guy and show you on the left side of the screen what he looks like.

24
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:05,462
Let's look at this arteriole a little bit closer.

25
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:10,836
This is our Afferent arteriole.

26
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:17,944
It's called afferent because it's headed towards something.
Afferent arteriole.

27
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:21,957
Don't forget where it comes from, 
it's coming from the renal artery.

28
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:29,332
The blood is coming from the renal artery 
and it's headed towards something and that's this.

29
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:38,635
The artery or the arteriole rather starts making a lot of little turnbacks on itself and finally straightens out.

30
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:42,352
When it does it's called the Efferent arteriole.

31
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:52,861
That's how we keep straight whether it's coming or going from this little network of blood vessels.

32
00:02:52,861 --> 00:03:02,938
This little network of blood vessels, if you look under a microscope, is actually being hugged by something like this.

33
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:07,443
This is the first time we're taking a look at something that isn't a blood vessel in the kidney,

34
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:10,859
it begins our journey of urine.

35
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:21,632
This thing is called the Bowman's capsule, 
this is the thing in yellow I've drawn for you.

36
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:25,865
Whenever things are named like this, you have to wonder 'Who was mister Bowman?'

37
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:34,062
Mister Bowman, turns out, was from England,
actually he was a very curious fellow.

38
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:43,465
So he looked under a microscope and he noticed that, if you look right where the little cups of blood vessels are,

39
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:51,162
you can actually see that there's something surrounding them, each of them. 
So he called that Bowman's capsule.

40
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:54,403
And that's what we still call it today.

41
00:03:54,403 --> 00:04:00,960
England was laying claim on parts of the kidney anatomy, we might not even have known then.

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,522
So that's Bowman's capsule.

43
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:09,670
That's the first part of the nephron.
I'll actually show you all the parts of the nephron.

44
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:17,859
The next part of the nephron, nephron just means kind of the unit of the kidney we care about.

45
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:22,193
The next part is looking really squiggly, 
very convoluted, right?

46
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:29,061
I'm trying to draw it that way purposefully, because I want you to remember it's called the proximal,

47
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:39,359
because it's near the Bowman's capsule, thus proximal, convoluted tubule.

48
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:43,523
Because this is one long tubule, like a little tube.

49
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:55,097
This is the proximal convoluted tubule, the part of the nephron after Bowman's capsule is the proximal convoluted tubule.

50
00:04:55,097 --> 00:05:01,661
Then it gets into a long deep loop, long loop like that that.

51
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:10,069
This loop is called the loop of Henle.

52
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:15,328
You're seeing now part three is called the loop of Henle.

53
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,427
Loop makes sense, but 'of Henle'?

54
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:22,194
You've got to wonder again 
'Is this another British guy, who's mister Henle?'

55
00:05:22,194 --> 00:05:27,769
Mister Henle, turns out, is actually not British, 
he's from another part of Europe,

56
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:30,758
maybe you can guess before I finish this drawing.

57
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:38,005
He discovered that if you follow the nephron deep into the middle of the kidney,

58
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:43,791
it has this little loops, very delicate loops, but very important in helping urine form.

59
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:53,165
He was a German scientist. If the British are going to identify something, so will the Germans.

60
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:54,893
We still call that the loop of Henle.

61
00:05:54,893 --> 00:06:04,025
After the loop of Henle we have another area that is very convoluted.

62
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:05,859
You can guess how we'll call this.

63
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:09,669
When we call things, we try to stay consistent,

64
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,126
If the first part was called the proximal convoluted tubule,

65
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:19,126
we would call this not the proximal, because it's not near anymore, but a little further away,

66
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:28,072
we call this the distal, meaning further away, convoluted, 'cause it's still convoluted, tubule.

67
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:30,597
This is the distal convoluted tubule.

68
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:40,294
Finally there's a fifth part of all this,
the fifth part of this is a giant tube of collection.

69
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:43,263
All this stuff goes to a collection tube.

70
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:51,399
I'm actually showing you where all the other distal convoluted tubes might be dumping in as well.

71
00:06:51,476 --> 00:07:00,512
Eventually all this stuff is gonna go to the same place, 
which is down to the ureter.

72
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:03,636
We've seen now how things go to the ureter.

73
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:08,333
You can see how things come from the renal artery,
but you're probably still wondering,

74
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:15,779
(oh, I see I didn't label this for you,
this is the collecting tube)

75
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:21,755
You're probably still wondering
'Where is the renal vein in all this?'

76
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:26,662
I still drew the efferent arteriole as being red,
it has oxygen.

77
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:30,857
Where does the venous blood come from?

78
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:42,928
The answer is right here, so you basically get red blood, 
oxygenated blood, flowing over all these parts of the tubule.

79
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:47,493
Oxygenated blood.

80
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:58,189
The proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, all get wonderful blood.

81
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:07,121
Finally, when all that is set and done, 
it all drains into one thing, one final renal vein.

82
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:11,659
And that's with all of the blood coming together.

83
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:28,124
This little network of capillaries are considered the peritubular, going around the tubule, peritubular capillaries.

84
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:29,823
That makes sense.

85
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:35,825
You can see the renal artery blood coming in, going through the afferent arteriole, the efferent arteriole,

86
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:41,623
draining back into the peritubular capillaries 
and finally the renal vein.

87
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:48,663
This important structure in yellow that I've drawn,
has five parts to it.

88
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:55,291
All five parts together are called the nephron.

89
00:08:55,291 --> 00:09:02,228
This is an important structure and we'll talk about the different parts of the nephron in future videos.

90
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:06,228
This is an important structure, at least you'll get a sense of what it looks like and what the different parts are called.
