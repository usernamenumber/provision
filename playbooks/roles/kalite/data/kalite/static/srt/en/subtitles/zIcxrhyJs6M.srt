1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,830
Our question asks us, how many
toothpicks will be needed to

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,780
form the 50th figure
in this sequence?

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,010
So let's look at
this sequence.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,500
So the first figure in our
sequence-- they look like

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,470
little houses-- how many
toothpicks are here?

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,600
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six toothpicks.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,550
So our first object here, or
our first figure, has six

9
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,660
toothpicks.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,640
How many do we have in
our second figure?

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,350
Well we're going to have
these six that we had

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,320
in the first, right?

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,850
This is the first figure,
right here.

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,580
Let me just trace it.

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,820
That's the first figure,
right there.

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,290
And then how many
new toothpicks

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,380
are we going to have?

18
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,410
We have one, two, three,
four, five.

19
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,830
So we have six plus
another five.

20
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,930
So we have the six in the
original one, plus another

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,670
five, which is equal
to 11 toothpicks.

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,440
Now what happens in this third
object, or this third little

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,430
toothpick house looking
drawing thing?

24
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,280
So we have our figure
from the two houses.

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,690
So we have those right there.

26
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,630
This is the exact same
thing that we had

27
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,450
as our second object.

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,660
So that's that right there.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,850
And how many more do we have?

30
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,840
Well it's going to be
the same thing.

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,340
We've just added on this other
extension to our house.

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,630
You can view it that way.

33
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,060
So we have one, two,
three, four, five.

34
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,810
So it looks like every time we
go down this sequence, or we

35
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,870
add a new term to the sequence,
or a new object to

36
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,420
the sequence, we're adding
five toothpicks.

37
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,500
So here, we're going
to have 11 plus 5.

38
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,780
There's 11 toothpicks in this
part of it, and then we

39
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,420
have another 5.

40
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,680
11 plus 5, which is 16.

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,970
Same thing over here.

42
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,840
We have 16 in this part
of the drawing.

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,320
That part of the drawing is
going to be 16 toothpicks, if

44
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,920
you draw all of that.

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,680
And then we're going to have
another five right here.

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,960
So this is going to be
16 plus 5 or 21.

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,340
So how can we figure out how
many toothpicks we're going to

48
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,840
have in the 50th figure?

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
I mean, we could draw 50 of
them, but it's going to take

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,720
us forever.

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,440
So all we have to do is
realize the pattern.

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,780
Every one, we're just
going to add 5.

53
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,180
Or, we could even come up with
a formula for the nth figure.

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,940
How many toothpicks
in the nth figure?

55
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,020
So here, in the first figure,
we have-- you could view it

56
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,140
this way-- in this first figure,
we have 1 plus 5

57
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,730
toothpicks.

58
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,010
Right?

59
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,170
We have this 1.

60
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,980
You could imagine that was
always there, and then you

61
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,140
added 5 right there.

62
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,860
So that's our first term
in our sequence.

63
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,600
Our second term in our sequence,
what do we have?

64
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,090
We have 6, which is 1 plus 5.

65
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,160
So we have that 1 plus
5, plus another 5.

66
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,510
Plus this 5 right here,
plus another 5.

67
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,810
And then our third term in our
sequence, what do we have?

68
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,540
We have all of this business
that we had

69
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,880
in the second term.

70
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,355
So 1 plus 5 plus 5, and then
we have another 5.

71
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:01,410
Let me do it in green.

72
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,390
We have another 5.

73
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,630
And then, finally, in this
fourth term, what do we have?

74
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,270
We have-- so the fourth one-- we
have everything that we had

75
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,840
in the third figure, so 1
plus 5 plus 5 plus 5.

76
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,700
And then we add another 5.

77
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,460
We add a fourth 5.

78
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,930
We add a fourth 5 right there.

79
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,420
So why did I do it this way?

80
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,060
Because I wrote this first one
as 1 plus 5 instead of just a

81
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,220
6 because you could say, well
look, I had a 1, and

82
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,280
then I had one 5.

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,780
Now I have a 1, and
I have two 5's.

84
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,630
Now I have a 1 and
I have three 5's.

85
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,850
Now I have a 1 and
I have four 5's.

86
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,020
So you might see the pattern.

87
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,790
If I had the nth term, if I had
the nth term right here, I

88
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,400
will have a 1 plus
n 5's, right?

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,620
The first term has one 5.

90
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,780
The second term has two 5's.

91
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,060
Third term has three 5's.

92
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,900
Fourth term has four 5's.

93
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,730
So the nth term, if this is, you
know, if this is 10, it's

94
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,690
going to be 1 plus 10 5's.

95
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,970
Or if it's n, if I'm kind of
abstracting a little bit, I'm

96
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,730
going to have 1 plus
10-- sorry-- 1

97
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,660
plus 5 times n, right?

98
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,420
And try it out.

99
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,010
If n is equal 1, it's going
to be 5 times 1.

100
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,260
If n is equal to 2, it's
going to be 5 times 2.

101
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,350
If n is equal to 3, it's
going to be 5 times 3.

102
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,520
So that when the 50th term, if
we're talking about the 50th

103
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,890
term, how many toothpicks
are we going to have?

104
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:35,930
Well we're going to have 1 plus
5 times 50, right? n is

105
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,690
50 here, which is
equal to what?

106
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,240
5 times 50 is 250.

107
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,390
That's 250 and then we add 1,
we're going to have 251

108
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,390
toothpicks will be needed
to form the 50th

109
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,300
figure in this sequence.

110
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,800
