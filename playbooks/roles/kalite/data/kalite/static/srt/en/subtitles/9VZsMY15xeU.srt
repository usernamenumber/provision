00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,510
Welcome to the
presentation on averages.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,980
Averages is probably a concept
that you've already used

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,020
before, maybe not in
a mathematical way.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,790
But people will talk in terms
of, the average voter wants a

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,750
politician to do this, or the
average student in a class

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,760
wants to get out early.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,760
So you're probably already
familiar with the

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
concept of an average.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,230
And you probably already
intuitively knew that an

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:27,710
average is just a number that
represents the different values

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,290
that a group could have.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,970
But it can represent that as
one number as opposed to giving

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,350
all the different values.

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,010
And let's give a couple of
examples of how to compute

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,070
an average, and you might
already know how to do this.

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:47,150
So let's say I had the
numbers 1, 3, 5, and 20.

17
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,980
And I asked you, what is the
average of these four numbers?

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,380
Well, what we do is,
we literally just

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,280
add up the numbers.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,410
And then divide by the
number of numbers we have.

21
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,220
So we say 1 plus 3 is 4.

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:01,960
So let me write that.

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:10,630
1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 20 equals,
let's see, 1 plus 3 is 4.

24
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,190
4 plus 5 is 9.

25
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,310
9 plus 20 is 29.

26
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,430
And we had 4 numbers;
one, two, three, four.

27
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,210
So 4 goes into 29.

28
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,300
And it goes, 7, 7, 28.

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,900
And then we have 10, I didn't
have to do that decimal

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,260
there, oh well.

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,845
2, 8, 25.

32
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:36,910
34
00:01:36,91 --> 00:01:40,88
So 4 goes into 29 7.25 times.

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:49,590
So the average of these four
numbers is equal to 7.25.

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,450
And we can kind of view this,
7.25, as one way to represent

35
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,090
these four numbers without
having to list these

36
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,990
four numbers.

37
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,480
There are other representations
you'll learn later on.

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,960
Like the mode.

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,700
You'll also the mean, which
we'll talk about later,

40
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,610
is actually the same
thing as the average.

41
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,680
But the average is just one
number that you can use to

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,400
represent a set of numbers.

43
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,730
So let's do some problems
which I think are going to

44
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,180
be close to your heart.

45
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,830
Let's say on the first four
tests of an exam, I got a--

46
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:39,690
let's see, I got an 80, an 81.

47
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,250
An 87, and an 88.

48
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,580
What's my average in
the class so far?

49
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,890
Well, all I have to do is
add up these four numbers.

50
00:02:50,890 --> 00:03:00,790
So I say, 80 plus 81
plus 87 plus 88.

51
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,370
Well, zero plus 1 is 1.

52
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,190
1 plus 7 is 8.

53
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,490
8 plus 8 is 16.

54
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,770
I just ran eight miles,
so I'm a bit tired.

55
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,310
And, 4/8, so that's 32.

56
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,210
Plus 1 is 33.

57
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,950
62
00:03:16,95 --> 00:03:20,75
And now we divide
this number by 4.

58
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,300
4 goes into 336.

59
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,850
67
00:03:31,85 --> 00:03:34
33 minus 32 is 1, 16.

60
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,750
So the average is equal to 84.

61
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,220
So depending on what school you
go to that's either a B or a C.

62
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,250
So, so far my average after the
first four exams is an 84.

63
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,740
Now let's make this a
little bit more difficult.

64
00:03:51,740 --> 00:04:00,150
We know that the average
after four exams, at four

65
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,980
exams, is equal to 84.

66
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,200
If I were to ask you what do I
have to get on the next test to

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,010
average an 88, to average
an 88 in the class.

68
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,310
78
00:04:20,31 --> 00:04:23,49
So let's say that x is what
I get on the next test.

69
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,180
80
00:04:28,18 --> 00:04:31,99
So now what we can say is, is
that the first four exams, I

70
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,910
could either list out the
first four exams that I took.

71
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,950
Or I already know
what the average is.

72
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,210
So I know the sum of the
first four exams is

73
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,470
going to 4 times 84.

74
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:51,420
And now I want to add the, what
I get on the 5th exam, x.

75
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,640
And I'm going to divide
that by all five exams.

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,770
So in other words, this
number is the average

77
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,220
of my first five exams.

78
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,510
We just figured out the average
of the first four exams.

79
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,620
But now, we sum up the
first four exams here.

80
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,220
We add what I got on the fifth
exam, and then we divide it

81
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,940
by 5, because now we're
averaging five exams.

82
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,030
And I said that I need to
get in an 88 in the class.

83
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,230
And now we solve for x.

84
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,080
Let me make some space here.

85
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,710
97
00:05:22,71 --> 00:05:25,08
So, 5 times 88 is, let's see.

86
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,110
5 times 80 is 400, so it's 440.

87
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,030
440 equals 4 times 84,
we just saw that, is

88
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,910
320 plus 16 is 336.

89
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,210
336 plus x is equal to 440.

90
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,200
Well, it turns out if you
subtract 336 from both sides,

91
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,550
you get x is equal to 104.

92
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,560
So unless you have a exam that
has some bonus problems on it,

93
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,760
it's probably impossible for
you to get ah an 88 average in

94
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,180
the class after just
the next exam.

95
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,380
You'd have to get 104
on that next exam.

96
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,810
And let's just look
at what we just did.

97
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,380
We said, after 4
exams we had an 84.

98
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,530
What do I have to get on that
next exam to average an 88

99
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,090
in the class after 5 exams?

100
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,920
And that's what we solved
for when we got x.

101
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,670
Now, let's ask
another question.

102
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:29,830
I said after four exams,
after four exams, I

103
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,080
had an 84 average.

104
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,670
117
00:06:34,67 --> 00:06:39,05
If I said that there are 6
exams in the class, and the

105
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,170
highest score I could get on an
exam is 100, what is the

106
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,730
highest average I can finish in
the class if I were to really

107
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,030
study hard and get 100
on the next 2 exams?

108
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,250
Well, once again, what we'll
want to do is assume we get

109
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,520
100 on the next 2 exams
and then take the average.

110
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,890
So we'll have to
solve all 6 exams.

111
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,820
So we're going to have the
average of 6, so in the

112
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,710
exams times the 84 average.

113
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,590
And this dot is just times.

114
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,140
Plus, and there's going to
be 2 more exams, right?

115
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,740
Because there's 6
exams in the class.

116
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,550
And I'm going to
get 100 in each.

117
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,260
So that's 200.

118
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,230
And what's this average?

119
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,050
Well, 4 times 84, we
already said, is 336.

120
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,250
Plus 200 over 6.

121
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,090
So that's 536 over 6.

122
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,840
6 goes into 5 36.

123
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,580
I don't know if if I gave
myself enough space.

124
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,190
But 6 goes into 53, 8 times.

125
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,990
48.

126
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,940
56.

127
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,640
9 times.

128
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,850
9 times 6 is 54.

129
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,730
6 minus is 20 6 goes into--
so we'll see it's actually

130
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,630
89.333333, goes on forever.

131
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,770
So 89.3 repeating.

132
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,950
So no matter how hard I try in
this class, the best I can do.

133
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,970
Because I only have two exams
left, even if I were to get

134
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,740
100 on the next two exams.

135
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,090
I can finish the class
with an 89.333 average.

136
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,180
Hopefully, I think some of
this might have been a little

137
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,990
bit of a review for you.

138
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,170
You already had kind of a
sense of what an average is.

139
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,340
And hopefully these last two
problems not only taught you

140
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,100
how to do some algebra problems
involving average, but they'll

141
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,830
also help you figure out how
well you have to do on your

142
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,350
exams to get an A in
your math class.

143
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,310
I think you're now ready
for the average module.

144
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,860
Have fun.

145
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,833
