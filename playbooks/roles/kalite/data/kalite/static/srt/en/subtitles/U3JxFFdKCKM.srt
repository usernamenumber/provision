1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,770
The distance a person can see on
a clear day is estimated by

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,930
the formula v is equal to 1,225
times the square root of

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,760
a, all of that over 1,000,
where v is visibility.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,540
So that right there is
visibility in miles, and a is

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,460
equal to altitude.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,750
Fair enough.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,770
Now, they say if Jerome can see
for 150 miles-- so that's

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,960
how far he could see; so that is
the visibility, that is v--

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,680
about how far above
the ground is he?

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,250
So they want to know what
the altitude is.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,250
About how far off the
ground is he?

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,130
This is a.

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,540
And this is what
we don't know.

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,040
We know that his visibility
is 150 miles.

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,800
We want to know what a is.

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,680
So we could look at this formula
for visibility as a

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,310
function of altitude here.

19
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,770
We know what the
visibility is.

20
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,580
It is 150 miles.

21
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,830
v is 150 miles.

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:08,560
So we can say that v, or 150
miles, is equal to 1,225 times

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,790
the square root of a-- a is how
far above the ground he

24
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:21,860
is-- times the square root of
a, all of that over 1,000.

25
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,420
Now we can multiply both
sides of this equation.

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,700
We want to isolate this radical
here, so that we can

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,680
solve for it.

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,910
What we can do is we can
multiply both sides of this

29
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:39,140
equation times 1,000
over 1,225.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,200
Let me scroll to the
left a little bit.

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,130
1,000 over 1,225.

32
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,170
And the whole point of that is
so that we can isolate the

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,120
square root of a.

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,760
This 1,000 cancels
with that 1,000.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,280
That 1,225 cancels
with that 1,225.

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,080
And we get-- and I always like
to have the variable I'm

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,220
solving for on the left-hand
side, so let's put it there.

38
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,150
So let me just switch
sides as well.

39
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,540
So we get the square root of
a is equal to all of this

40
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:17,270
business over here, is equal to
1,000 times this 150, all

41
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:24,050
of that over 1,225.

42
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,400
And it looks like there's
some simplification

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,610
that we can do here.

44
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,010
Both of these numbers seem
divisible by 25.

45
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,850
This number up here, 150,
that's 25 times 6.

46
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,880
So let me write this.

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,280
This is 25 times 6.

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,030
And this number right
here, what is this?

49
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:51,740
This is 25 times-- let's
see, 12 times 4 is 48.

50
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,190
And you're going to
have one more.

51
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,740
25 times 49, if I'm doing
my math right.

52
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,130
Let me double check that.

53
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,130
49 times 25.

54
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,300
9 times 5 is 45.

55
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,280
4 times 5 is 20, plus 4 is 24.

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,340
Get rid of that, put a 0 here.

57
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,710
2 times 9 is 18.

58
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,805
2 times 4 is 8, plus 1 is 9.

59
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:17,280
We get a 5.

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,140
Get a 12.

61
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,640
Yep, it's 1,225.

62
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,820
So this is 25 times 49.

63
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,450
This is 25 times 6.

64
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,770
Let me cancel this.

65
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,350
Cross that out.

66
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,350
This 25 cancels with that 25.

67
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,540
And so, does it look-- you
know, 49 is 7 times 7.

68
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,380
So that looks about as simple
as we can get it.

69
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,210
So this is equal to-- we could
write it as 6,000 over 49 is

70
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,870
equal to the square root of a.

71
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,810
So if we want to solve for a,
we can square both sides of

72
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,870
this equation.

73
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,260
So let's do that.

74
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,090
Let me rewrite this.

75
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:58,300
So you have the square root of
a is equal to 6,000 over 49.

76
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,890
We want to square both sides
of this equation.

77
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,770
So we square both sides of this
equation and we will get

78
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,960
a, the altitude, that how far
above the ground Jerome is, is

79
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,970
going to be equal to-- well,
6,000 squared over 49 squared.

80
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,542
Or you could view it as 6,000
divided by 49 squared.

81
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:27,530
So let's figure out what
that number is just to

82
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,540
get a sense of things.

83
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,862
And let me get a calculator
out for this one.

84
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:34,890
I'll just get a calculator
out.

85
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,450
Let me clear it out.

86
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:46,570
All right, so we want to do
6,000 squared divided by 49

87
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:54,000
squared, which is equal to
1,400-- or, we'll round up,

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,350
14,994 feet.

89
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:07,070
This is equal to 14,993 feet.

90
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,190
I'm assuming that this equation
is taking our feet,

91
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,550
our altitude in feet.

92
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,380
They didn't mention it here, but
I'm assuming that in feet,

93
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,490
because that makes sense.

94
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,510
If you can see for about 150
miles, it makes sense that

95
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,220
you're about 15,000
feet in the air.

96
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,066
