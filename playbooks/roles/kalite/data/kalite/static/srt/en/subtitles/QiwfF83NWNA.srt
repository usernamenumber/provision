1
00:00:00,372 --> 00:00:09,400
Now that we've seen that as we take i to higher and higher powers it cycles between 1, i, negative 1, negative i, then

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,067
back to 1, i, negative 1 and negative i. I wanna see if we can tackle some -- I guess you could call them

3
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:19,133
trickier problems -- and you right see them in this surface and they are also a kind of fun to do them

4
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:24,381
and realise that you can use this the fact that I the powers of I cycle through these values you can use this

5
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:31,718
to really, on the back of an envelop, take arbitrarily high powers of i. So let's try, just for fun,

6
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:40,078
let's see what i to one hundredth power is and the realisation 
here is that 100 is a mutiple of 4, so you could

7
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:48,267
say this is the same thing as i to the, i to the 4 times 25th power and this is the same thing,

8
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:56,400
just from our exponent properties i to the 4th power raised to the 25th power, right, if you have

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,600
something raised on an exponent and that is raised to an exponent that's the same

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,900
thing as multiplying the two exponents and we know that i to the 4th, that's pretty

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,733
straightforward; i to the 4th is just 1, i to the 4th is 1 so this is 1 so this is equal to

12
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:17,021
the 1 to the 25th power which is just equal to, just equal to 1. So once again we use

13
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:21,200
this kind of cycling ability of i when it takes its powers to figure out very high

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,267
exponent of i. Now let's say we try something a little bit stranger, lets try i to the,

15
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:33,600
let's try it i to the five hundred and first power. Now in this situation 501 is not a

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,826
multiple of 4 so you can't just do that simply but what you could do is you could write

17
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:41,262
this is a product of two numbers; one that is a multiple, one that is i to a multiple

18
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:49,482
of 4th power and then one that isn't, also you could rewrite this: 500 is, is a multiple of

19
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:52,667
4, so you could write this is i to the five hundredth power, i to the five hundredth

20
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:59,333
power, times i to the first power, right? you have same base, when you multiply

21
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:03,693
them you can add exponents, so this is i to the five hundred and first power. And we

22
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:07,933
know that this is the same thing as i to ... i to five hundred power is the same thing as i to

23
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:15,156
the fourth power four times what? Four times one hundred and twenty-five is 500, so

24
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:19,413
that's this part right over here: i to the 500 is the same thing as i to the 4th to the

25
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:27,168
125th power and then that times i to the first power, times i to the first. Well i to the

26
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:33,275
4th is 1, 1 to the 125th power is just going to be 1, this whole thing is 1 and so we

27
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:39,962
are just left with, we are just left with i to the first, so this is going to be equal to i. So

28
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:43,600
it seems really daunting problem, something that you have to sit and do all day

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,667
but you can use the cycling result; i to the 500 is just going to be 1 and so i to the

30
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:54,405
501 is just going to be i just times that. So i to any multiple of 4 -- let me write this

31
00:02:54,405 --> 00:03:01,867
generally -- so if you have i to any multiple of 4, so this right over here is, well we'll just

32
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:06,201
restrict k to be non negative right now; k is greater or equal to zero

33
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:13,067
so if we have i to any mutiple of 4 right over here we are going to get, we are going to get

34
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:19,133
1 because this is the same thing as i to the fourth power to the kth power and

35
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:24,733
that is the same thing as 1 to the kth power which is clearly equal to 1 and if we have

36
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:30,333
anything else, if we have i to the fourth k plus 1 power or plus 2 power we can then just

37
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:34,333
do this technique right over here. So let's try with a few more problems, just to

38
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:39,638
make it clear that you can really really arbitrarily crazy things. So let's take i to the

39
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:46,975
seven thousand three hundred and twenty-first power. Now we just have to figure out

40
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:55,102
-- this is going to be some multiple of 4 plus something else, so to do that, well you

41
00:03:55,102 --> 00:04:00,867
could just do that by sight 7320 is dividable by 4, you can verify that by hand and then you have one left

42
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:10,474
over also this is going to be i to the 7320 times i to the first power, this is a multiple

43
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:15,467
of 4 this right here is just a multiple of 4, I know that because any 100 is a multiple of

44
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:20,272
4, any 1000 is a multiple of 4 and any 100 is a multiple of 4 and the 20 is a multiple of

45
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:31,418
4 and so this right over here simplified to 1... sorry, that's not ??? to the ith power either the first power, 7321 is 7320 plus

46
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:41,078
1 and so this part right over here is going to simplify 1 and its going to be left

47
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:48,533
with i to the first power or just i. Let's do another one. i to the, i to the ninety, ninety,

48
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:55,799
ninety, let me try something interesting, i to the ninety-ninth, i to the ninety-ninth power.

49
00:04:55,799 --> 00:05:05,459
So once again, what's the highest multiple of 4 that is less than 99? It is 96, it is 96,

50
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:12,067
so this is same thing as the i to the 96th power times i to the 3th power, right? If you

51
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:17,765
multiply these same base, add the exponent, you'll get i to the 99th power, i to the

52
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:23,431
96th power, so this is a multiple of 4, this is i to the 4th and then that to the 16th

53
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:28,467
power, so that's just 1 in the 16, so this is just 1 and then you'll just lift with i to the

54
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:35,412
third power and you could either remember that i to the 3th power is equal to... you

55
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:39,333
could remember its equal to negative i or if you forget that you could just say look

56
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:46,140
this is just samething as i squared times i, this is equal to i squared times i, i

57
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,800
squared by definition is equal to negative 1 so you have negative 1 times i, is equal

58
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:59,886
to i, is equal to negative i. Let me do one more, just for, just for the fun of it. Let's take i

59
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:07,549
to the 38th power. Well once again this is equal to the i to the 36th times i squared, I'm

60
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:13,467
doing i to the 36th power just largest multiple 4 that goes into 38 what's left over is 2

61
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:19,809
this simplifies to 1 and I'm just left with i squared which is equal to negative 1.
