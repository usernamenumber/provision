1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,900
In the last video, we found the
slope at a particular point of

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,035
the curve y is equal
to x squared.

4
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:09,700
But let's see if we can
generalize this and come up

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,780
with a formula that finds us
the slope at any point of the

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,350
curve y is equal to x squared.

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,000
So let me redraw
my function here.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,720
It never hurts to
have a nice drawing.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,530
So that is my y-axis.

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,420
That is my x-axis right there.

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,580
My x-axis.

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,670
Let me draw my curve.

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,900
It looks something like that.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,210
You've seen that
multiple times.

15
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,970
This is y is equal
to x squared.

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,740
So let's be very
general right now.

17
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,600
Remember, if we want to find--
let me just write the

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,600
definition of our derivative.

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,450
So if we have some point right
here-- let's call that x.

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,630
So we want to be very general.

21
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,470
We want to find the
slope at the point x.

22
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,190
We want to find a function
where you give me an x

23
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,010
and I'll tell you the
slope at that point.

24
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,800
We're going to call
that f prime of x.

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,210
That's going to be the
derivative of f of x.

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,830
But all it does is, look, f of
x, you give-- it's a function

27
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,670
that you give it an x, and it
tells you the value of that.

28
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,810
And we draw the curve here.

29
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,470
With f of x, you give that same
x but it's not going to tell

30
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,050
you the value of the curve.

31
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,760
It's not going to say,
oh, this is your f of x.

32
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,855
It's going to give you the
value of the slope of

33
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:26,280
the curve at that point.

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,790
So f of x, if you put it into
that function, it should tell

35
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,540
you, oh, the slope at that
point, is equal to-- you know,

36
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,360
if you put 3 there, you'll say,
oh, the slope there

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,220
is equal to 6.

38
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,590
We saw that in the
last example.

39
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,410
So that's what we want to do.

40
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,600
And we saw on the last-- I
think it was 2-- videos ago,

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,130
that we defined f prime of x
to be equal to-- just the--

42
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,470
well, I'll write it this way.

43
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,210
It's the slope of the secant
line between x and some

44
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,540
point that's a little
bit further away from x.

45
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,640
So the slope of the secant
line is change in y.

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,940
So it's the y value of the
point that's a little

47
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,290
bit further away from x.

48
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:07,630
So f of x plus h minus
the y value at x, right?

49
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,600
Because this is right here.

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,200
This is f of x.

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,820
So minus f of x.

52
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,830
All of that over
the change in x.

53
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,620
So if this is x plus h
here, the change in x

54
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,740
is x plus h minus x.

55
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,470
Or this distance right
here is just h.

56
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,830
The change in x is going
to be equal to h.

57
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,150
So that's just slope of
the secant line, between

58
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,240
any 2 points like that.

59
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,880
And we said, hey, we could find
the slope of the tangent line

60
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,390
if we just take the limit of
this as it approaches--

61
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,060
as h approaches 0.

62
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,930
And then we'll be finding the
slope of the tangent line.

63
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,060
Now let's apply this idea to
a particular function, f of

64
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,970
x is equal to x squared.

65
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,430
Or y is equal to x squared.

66
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,800
So here, we could have the
point-- we could consider this

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,910
to be the point x-- x squared.

68
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,380
So f of x is just
equal to x squared.

69
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,040
And then this would be the
point-- let me do it in

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,140
a more vibrant color.

71
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,510
This is the point x plus h--
that's this point right here.

72
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,040
It's a little bit further down.

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,770
And then x plus h squared.

74
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,450
   

75
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,880
And you know, in the
last video, we did this

76
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,500
for a particular x.

77
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,590
We did it for 3.

78
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,330
But now I want a
general formula.

79
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,300
You give me any x and I won't
have to do what I did in the

80
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,330
last video for any
particular number.

81
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,490
I'll have a general function.

82
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,570
You give me 7, I'll tell you
what the slope is at 7.

83
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,260
You give me negative 3, I'll
tell you what the slope

84
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,300
is at negative 3.

85
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,450
You give me 100,000,
I'll tell you what the

86
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,690
slope is at 100,000.

87
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,310
So let's apply it here.

88
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,740
So we want to find the change
in y over the change in x.

89
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,410
   

90
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,190
So first of all, the change
in y is this guy's y value,

91
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,975
which is x plus h squared.

92
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:57,410
   

93
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,290
That's this guy's y
value right here.

94
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,270
That's this right here.

95
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,730
That's x plus h squared.

96
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,380
I just took x plus h,
evaluated, I squared it, and

97
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,820
that's its point on the curve.

98
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,930
So it's x plus h squared.

99
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,630
So that's there right there.

100
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,080
And then what's this value?

101
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,230
f of x right here is equal to--
I know it's getting messy--

102
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,310
is equal to x squared.

103
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,530
If you take your x, you
evaluate the function

104
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,600
at that point, you're
going to get x squared.

105
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,300
So it's equal to
minus x squared.

106
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,900
This is your change in y.

107
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,090
That's this distance
right there.

108
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,110
And just to relate it to our
definition of a derivative,

109
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,820
this blue thing right here is
equivalent to this

110
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,570
thing right here.

111
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,140
We just evaluated our function.

112
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,850
Our function is f of x
is equal to x squared.

113
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,310
We just evaluated when x
is equal to x plus h.

114
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,920
So if you have to square
it, if I put an a there,

115
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,540
it'd be a squared.

116
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,200
If I put an apple there,
it'd be apple squared.

117
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,970
If I put an x plus h in
there, it's going to

118
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,580
be x plus h squared.

119
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,210
So this is that thing.

120
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,420
And then, this thing right here
is just the function evaluated

121
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,810
at the point in question.

122
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,440
Right there.

123
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,120
So this is our change in y.

124
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,920
And let's divide that
by our change in x.

125
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,730
Our change in x-- if this is x
plus h and this is just x, our

126
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,360
change in x is just
going to be h.

127
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,880
So that's where we
get that term from.

128
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,670
So this is just a slope
between these 2 points.

129
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,350
This is just a slope
between those two points.

130
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,690
But, of course, we want to
find-- the limit at this point

131
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,500
gets closer and closer to this
point, and this point gets

132
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,790
closer and closer
to that point.

133
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,530
So this becomes a tangent line.

134
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,480
So we're going to take the
limit as h approaches 0, and

135
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,250
this is our f prime of x.

136
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,580
And this is the exact same
definition of this, instead

137
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,400
of being general and saying,
for any function, we know

138
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,380
what the function was.

139
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,680
It was f of x is
equal to x squared.

140
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,660
So we actually applied it.

141
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,350
Instead of f of x,
we wrote x squared.

142
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,950
Instead of f of x plus h,
we wrote x plus h squared.

143
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,180
So let's see if we can
evaluate this limit.

144
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:04,680
So this is going to be equal
to the limit as h approaches

145
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
0 to square this out.

146
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,160
I'll do it in the same color.

147
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:19,230
That's x squared plus 2xh plus
h squared, and then we have

148
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,320
this minus x squared over here.

149
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,790
I just multiplied this
guy out over here.

150
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,635
And then all of that
is divided by h.

151
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:30,850
Now let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

152
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,610
Well, you immediately see you
have an x squared and you

153
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,390
have a minus x squared,
so those cancel out.

154
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,570
And then we can divide
the numerator and the

155
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,185
denominator by h.

156
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:44,780
So this simplifies to-- so we
get f prime of x is equal to--

157
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,590
if we divide the numerator and
the denominator by h--

158
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,260
we get 2x plus h.

159
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,070
I'm sorry, I forgot my limit.

160
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,420
It equals the limit.

161
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,330
Very important.

162
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:01,200
Limit as h approaches 0 of
divide everything by h, and

163
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,640
you get 2x plus h squared
divided by h is h.

164
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,440
And if you remember the last
video, when we did it with a

165
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,780
particular x, we said x is
equal to 3, we got 6

166
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,920
plus delta x here.

167
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,420
Or 6 plus h here, so
it's very similar.

168
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,130
So if you take the limited h
approaches 0 here, that's

169
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,010
just going to disappear.

170
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,240
So this is just going
to be equal to 2x.

171
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,540
So we just figured out that if
f of x-- this is a big result.

172
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,180
This is exciting!

173
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,130
That if f of x is equal
to x squared, f prime

174
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,910
of x is equal to 2x.

175
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,470
That's what we
just figured out.

176
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,570
And I wanted to make
sure you understand

177
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,880
how to interpret this.

178
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,780
f of x, if you give me a value,
is going to tell you the value

179
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,560
of the function at that point.

180
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,920
At prime of x it's
going to tell you the

181
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,960
slope at that point.

182
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,180
Let me draw that.

183
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,490
Because this is a
key realization.

184
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,220
And you might, you know, it's
kind of maybe initially

185
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,590
unintuitive to think of a
function that gives us the

186
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,040
slope, at any point,
of another function.

187
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,070
So it looks like this.

188
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,650
Let me draw a little
neater than that.

189
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,290
Ah, it's still not that neat.

190
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,280
That's satisfactory.

191
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,650
Let me just draw it in
the positive coordinate.

192
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,640
Well, I'll just draw the
whole-- the curve looks

193
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,450
something like that.

194
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,090
Now this is the
curve of f of x.

195
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,050
This is the curve of f of
x is equal to x squared.

196
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,230
Just like that.

197
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,490
So if you give me a point.

198
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,840
You give me the point 7.

199
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,610
You apply, you put it in
here, you square it.

200
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,460
And it is mapped
to the number 49.

201
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,170
So you get the number
49 right there.

202
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,620
This is the number 7, 49.

203
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,940
You're used to dealing with
functions right there.

204
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,630
But what is f prime of 7?

205
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,000
f prime of 7.

206
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,740
You say, 2 times 7
is equal to 14.

207
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,990
What is this 14 number here?

208
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,380
What is this thing?

209
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,440
Well, this is the slope
of the tangent line

210
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,030
at x is equal to 7.

211
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,330
So if I were to take that point
and draw a tangent line-- a

212
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,930
point that just grazes our
curve-- if I were to just

213
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:03,890
draw a tangent line.

214
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,410
That wasn't tangent
enough for me.

215
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,790
So that's my tangent
line right there.

216
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,200
You get the idea.

217
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,660
The slope of this guy-- you do
your change in y over your

218
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,260
change in x-- is going
to be equal to 14.

219
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,880
The slope of the curve
at y is equal to 7-- is

220
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,270
a pretty steep curve.

221
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,990
If you wanted to find the
slope, let's say that this

222
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,910
is y-- let's say it's
x is equal to 2.

223
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,290
I said at x is equal to
7, the slope is 14.

224
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,900
At x is equal to 2,
what is the slope?

225
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,230
Well, you figure out f prime of
2, which is equal to 2 times

226
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,880
2, which is equal to 4.

227
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,990
So the slope here is 4.

228
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,520
You could say m is equal
to 4. m for slope.

229
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,560
What is f prime of 0?

230
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,170
f prime.

231
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,120
We know that f of
0 is 0, right?

232
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
0 squared is 0.

233
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,710
But what is f prime of 0?

234
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,180
Well, 2 times 0 is 0.

235
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,480
That's also equal to 0.

236
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,350
But what does that mean?

237
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,100
What's the interpretation?

238
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,850
It means the slope of
the tangent line is 0.

239
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,390
So a 0 sloped line
looks like this.

240
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,920
Looks just like a
horizontal line.

241
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,370
And that looks about right.

242
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,220
A horizontal line would
be tangent to the

243
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,910
curve at y equals 0.

244
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,620
Let's try another one.

245
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,190
Let's try the point minus 1.

246
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,290
So let's say we're right
there. x is equal to minus 1.

247
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,220
So f of minus 1, you
just square it.

248
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,380
Because we're dealing
with x squared.

249
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,570
So it's equal to 1.

250
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,180
That's that point right there.

251
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,680
What is f prime of minus 1?

252
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,050
f prime of minus 1
is 2 times minus 1.

253
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,340
2 times minus is minus 2.

254
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,650
What does that mean?

255
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,680
It means that the slope of the
tangent line at x is equal to

256
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,050
1, to this curve, to the
function, is minus 2.

257
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,600
So if I were to draw the
tangent line here-- the tangent

258
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,140
line looks like that-- and
look, it is a downward

259
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,700
sloping line.

260
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,450
And it makes sense.

261
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:04,700
The slope here is
equal to minus 2.

262
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:04,733
