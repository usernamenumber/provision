1
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:12,268
almost always when we are looking at greek sculpture

2
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:15,408
we re looking at roman carvings, we aare looking at marble copies

3
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:18,381
of what had once been bronze. but bronze is

4
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:21,320
expensive.and it is reusable. so 2000 years

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,506
after these objects were made, there is ample

6
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:26,217
opportunity for it to be melted down.but

7
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:27,833
once in a while we find a greek original. we are

8
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:32,102
looking at the seated boxer,agreek helenistic

9
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:33,831
sculpture from about 100B.C. now helenitic

10
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:37,739
refers tothis period after alexander the great,

11
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,849
so this is the last phase of the ancient greek ode.

12
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:42,967
because the helenistic were and then the romans

13
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:45,437
conquered greece.now because it is bronze we have an opportunity to understand

14
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:49,651
how the greeks constructed their flarge scale

15
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:53,934
sculpture.this is last wax casting and you would be chased and so

16
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:56,572
you could call it in portions, that you can

17
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:59,466
actually see in the beard, and in the hair

18
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:01,185
so that the lines would cut into the surface

19
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:04,507
so this sculpture is hollow in other words. we can see that

20
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:06,820
if you look into the eyes, if you look into the mouth, you

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,708
can see the hollowness. now originally there

22
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,919
would have been eyes that are missing. they would have been

23
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:15,401
of ivory or some sort of glass paste, something reflective, well

24
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:19,216
polished yes we can see that this is quite thin and that if we knocked on it,

25
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:21,621
it would ring like a bell. a few moments ago

26
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,822
as we were looking at it, there was someone standing

27
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:27,498
in the veryplace that he seems to be looking

28
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:30,156
and i almost thought likehe was in actual dialogue with someone

29
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,701
he has a tremendous sense of presence. doesn't he?

30
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:37,499
he does. during the dhelenistic period we

31
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:40,115
see the real expansion of the subject matter that we really think of

32
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:44,139
the god. usually we think of ideal beautiful

33
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:47,708
nude athletic young, figures. but this is

34
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,698
an athletic figure, but he is not young and

35
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:54,299
he is not beautiful in the traditional sense

36
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,125
when i look at him i find, part of him beautiful,

37
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:02,318
but his face is certainly not.oh , the beauty

38
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:05,206
comes from our understanding his life,and his

39
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:08,819
suffering instead of the elegance of perfection of

40
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,573
his body, his muscular he is powerful that he is defeated

41
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:15,765
yes that is the the main kind of pathos, the sculpture engages

42
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:18,837
us emotionally. the artist has been careful

43
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:21,523
to make sure the we are into sympathy. he has

44
00:02:21,523 --> 00:02:24,163
inlaid copper into parts of the face wher he

45
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:26,723
has defined wounds, so that the copper

46
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:29,024
functions as a more red color than bronze,

47
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:29,600
and we can see him bleeding. boxing is into greece

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,190
and focussed mainly on blows to his head and his face

49
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:39,904
and thats why his body, is still so beautiful and

50
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:42,709
perfect and when i said the forer that i think was mightly beautiful

51
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,634
i was thinking about the incredible muscles in his torso

52
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:51,470
he is so really fine and athletic but his face

53
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,206
is in such a contrast, and also his hands are

54
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:59,099
wrapped in leather.the face and the hands ground him in a kind of

55
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,368
reality of a moment. well thst is specially

56
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:04,331
true of his posture. we can see him i htat he is not

57
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:05,786
simply seated. his torso is collapsing,

58
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:09,704
his head is down. he is looking up but you can feel the exhaustion.

59
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:11,592
you can also say the way in which his body

60
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,916
has been beaten, the broken nerves give ashes

61
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:18,783
on his face.look at his ear which is swollen and distorted

62
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:24,044
we verily see seeded figures, and the classic

63
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:30,545
appears standing , if he is a standing a noble. he is heroic

64
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:34,547
just by virtue of his being defeated thare is a humility and

65
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,414
humanity to the figure. well this is also a sort of

66
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:42,561
informality.his right leg is alled upon his heel

67
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:45,347
and his left leg is still unde the weight of his arm

68
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:50,502
this is a man who'd like to lie down. so this

69
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:51,820
is a period, in recall when there really is an interest in

70
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,102
pathos in moving beyond the era, in moving

71
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:57,197
beyond subjects in that age and world and

72
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:59,184
its really beginning to explore the wider

73
00:03:59,184 --> 00:04:02,077
variety. it is facinating, its incredibly

74
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:06,077
sophisticated moment
