1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let omega be the complex number,

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Cosine of 2 pie over 3 + i Sin of 2 pie over 3

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then the number of distinct complex numbers,

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
z satisfying with this determinant equaling zero

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets have the 3 by 3 determinant equaling zero,

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets just evaluate this determinant and see if we

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can solve for z or figure out how many

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
complex number z we get satisfying this with

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
esentially an equation, so lets evaluate the determinant

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if we start with this term up here

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's going to be this term times the determinant

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the sub 2 by 2 matrix, so it's going to be z + 1,

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
z+1 times z + omega squared, times z + omega,

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus 1, so this is the determinant of the sub,

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the sub 2 by 2 matrix right over here, the sub

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2 by 2 derterminant and this is z + 1 and then we're

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to, we have to swap signs, we go here,

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we want to put a negative sign out front,

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have a kind of checker-board pattern when you

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
evaluate the determinants, so minus omega times,

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you black out that row, that column, so omega

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the sub determinant is omega times z + omega,

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me just multiply that out right now, so that's

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
z omega + omega squared, minus omega squared times 1,

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so minues omega squared, so thats pretty,

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we already got something that simplifies a little bit.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we have to worry about this omega squared,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's going to be plus omega squared times,

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
omgea times 1, omega times 1 is omega,

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus omega squared times z + omega,

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so minues omega squared z, omega squared z,

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus omega to the 4th.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And remember this whole expression needs to be equal to zero,

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this whole thing needs to be equal to zero,

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now lets see if we can, lets see if we can simplify this thing

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a little bit, so let me first multiply these two guys in here,

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so z times z is z squared, z times omega is z omega,

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
omega squared times z is omega squared z,

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then omega squared times omega is omega

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the third power.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then we have this minus 1,

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then all of that is going to be

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
multiplied by z + 1, let me just continue with these

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
blue parts since we're already focused here.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is going to be z times all of this,

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's going to the third power, plus z squared omega,

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus omega squared z squared plus omega to the third z,

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus z, I just multiplied z times all of this,

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then plus 1 times all of this,

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so plus this thing again, z squared plus z omega,

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus omega squared z, plus omega to the third,

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus, minus 1, and then let's simplify this over here,

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so in the green, these canceled out,

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we're just left with, I'll do this in the green,

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative omega times z omega, so it's minus z omega squared,

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
omega, and then over here in magenta,

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here in magenta we have plus, plus omega to the third power,

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
omega to the third power, minus omega to the third z,

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right, oh let me be careful, that would be omega,

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
omega to the 4th, omega square times omega squared is

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
omega to the 4th, omega to the4th z, and then

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
omega squared times omega to the 4th is omega to the 6th,

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we have a negative sign, so negative omega to the 6th,

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and of course this whole thing needs to be equal to zero.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now there's probably, let's see if we can simpliy this,

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's just group the terms, the different powers of z,

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we have a z to the 3rd, a z to the 3rd,

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
z to the 3rd, and that is the only z to the 3rd we have,

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then let's group, let's group the z squared terms,

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is a z squared term, this is a z squared term,

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's a z squared term, and then we don't have any more

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
z squared terms, and so the co-efficients,

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is going to be the same thing as omega squared,

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's this one right over here, plus omega,

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus omega, plus 1, plus 1, times, times z squared,

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we've taken care of everything that I've underlined

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in pink over here, now let's worry about the z terms,

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the z terms, I'll do it in this color, so this is a z term,

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're just multiplting times z, this is a z term,

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is a z, term, that is also a z term, and then

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
do we have any other z terms, well this is a z term

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here, and in fact, these two cancel out,

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you have negative z omega squared, positive

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
z omega squared, so this and this cancel out,

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so our only z terms are these 3 over here,

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we have plus omega to the 3rd, and then we have

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus omega to the third, oh wait, this color is too close,

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus omega to the 3rd, and our next z is minus 1,

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but we actually have this omega over here,

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so plus omega - 1, I was getting confused,

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because this white is so close to this pink,

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's omega to the 3rd, omega to the 3rd,

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus 1 + omega, times z, and then.

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Oh! We can't forget this, we have this term

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over here, we have omega to the 4th times z,

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
omega to the 4th times z, so we have minus 1,

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right, omega to the 3rd z, then we have minus 1 z

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then we have, then we have plus omega z, and then

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have negative omega to the 4th z,

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so I'll just put it out here, I'm not doing in the

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
nice descending power order, but I don't want to

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
have to re-write all of this.

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we took care of all the z terms, and then what

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have left is what we can kind of call the

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cost of terms from the z point of view,
