1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,758
Lets think about what would happen inside of China.

2
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:09,107
If the government would allow its currency to completely float against the dollar,

3
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:12,522
so, we know that the by-product would be its currency would strengthen.

4
00:00:12,522 --> 00:00:16,000
So far, they are artificially weakening it. So, you would have a

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,050
[stronger yuan] and you would have a [weaker dollar]. I want to be clear

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,990
that the Chinese government actually has been allowing yuan to slowly strengthen against the dollar,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,030
but it's keeping maintaining a peg. We want to just think about

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,990
what would happen if it's completely float.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,030
Now, the obvious by-product of this that we know kept the currency weak that favors its exports.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,522
It would allow the exports to be cheaper, creating demand for the exports.

11
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:45,990
Now, they allowed their currency to strengthen.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,348
Then their exports would be more expensive than the other countries. So, it would [decrease demand for exports].

13
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:59,000
Now, with fewer exports, fewer production perhaps in their factories now.

14
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:09,080
This, obviously, would [slow down the Chinese economy]. Now, this we have to be careful here.

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,050
When we say slowdown, just that doesn't mean that they necessarily fall into a recession.

16
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,010
They have been growing at high single digits to low double digits for many many many years now.

17
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,040
When we talk about slowing down, they might slow down to may be 4 to 5% growth,

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,649
which is still super fast by any other nation's standards.

19
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:30,060
We have also seen that there is ton of inflation in China.

20
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,040
And, to some degree, it kind of hints that the Chinese consumer is ready to take up the slack from foreign consumers.

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,030
So, may not even slow down as we might first think.

22
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,030
That brings up the first unambiguous positive behind allowing the currency to strengthen.

23
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,030
If they would actually stop printing the Yuan, and start buying other currencies.

24
00:01:51,030 --> 00:02:01,251
It would actually [slow down inflation]. And, we know that we are dangerously close to kind of inflationary spiral.

25
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:04,813
They have been reporting 5 to 6% of inflation.

26
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:07,357
The reality might be closer to 10%.

27
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:11,911
And, the inflation is actually going to be mitigated not just from the fact that you have lesser yuan running around,

28
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:14,260
and the economy is slowing down.

29
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,491
But, it is also because Yuan is strengthening. When it is stronger, it allows them to buy imports more cheaply.

30
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:24,589
For the Chinese, perhaps the most important import is import of commodities.

31
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:26,308
And, most important of the commodities is Oil.

32
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:31,000
So, the price of Oil would go down.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,645
Now, the bigger question that is harder to answer is what happens to Chinese manufacturing in general?

34
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:41,070
Lot of the people the argument why China is able to build its manufacturing basis is that

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,030
they have this weak currency. That has allowed them to build ecosystems, get to scale in its factories.

36
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,060
Will the manufacturing then go back to US or Europe?

37
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,060
My gut is that it would not go back to US or Europe. Because, any thing that requires huge amount of scale

38
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,990
and huge amount of labor is going to be very hard for the Chinese to compete with Chinese,

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,050
even if the currency was stronger. I think at that point of time, China has to worry about other developing nations

40
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,090
may be India, may be Latin America. While they have labor advantages relative to China

41
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,030
and if they were able to have same kind of efficiencies in the infrastructure and in the same scale

42
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,020
then they would be able to give them a run for their money.

43
00:03:22,030 --> 99:59:59,999
