1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:02,627
So, we've been going through all of the others things

2
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:04,953
that we were assuming are held constant

3
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:08,370
in order to be moving along one demand curve.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,033
And now let's list a few other[s].

5
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:11,511
And before I do any more of them,

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,996
let's talk about the ones we already talked about.

7
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:16,322
So – one– we said that one of the things we held constant –

8
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:17,452
(Let me write this down.)

9
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:22,258
So – (WRITING: held constant.)

10
00:00:22,258 --> 00:00:25,712
One of the things that we held constant to move along

11
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:28,503
one demand curve, for the demand itself not to shift –

12
00:00:28,503 --> 00:00:30,067
for the curve not to shift –

13
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:37,756
is price of related goods. [WRITING]

14
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:40,898
The other thing we assumed that's being held constant

15
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:45,764
is price expectations for our good. [WRITING]

16
00:00:45,764 --> 00:00:48,176
And now we'll list a couple of them that are fairly intuitive.

17
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:49,762
But you'll see that in the next few videos,

18
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:52,717
that there are often special cases even to this.

19
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:55,344
So, the other thing that we've been holding constant

20
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:59,464
to stay on one demand curve is income.

21
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:01,192
And this one is fairly intuitive.

22
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:05,122
What happens if everyone's income were to increase?

23
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:07,712
And, in real terms, it were to actually increase?

24
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:08,682
Well, then, all of a sudden,

25
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:10,328
they have more disposable income –

26
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:12,636
naybe to spend on something like e-books.

27
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:14,670
And so, for any given price point,

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,940
the demand would increase.

29
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,380
And so, it would increase the demand.

30
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,109
And once again, when we talk about increasing demand,

31
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:22,931
we're talking about shifting the entire curve.

32
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:25,814
We're not talking about a particular quantity of demand.

33
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:30,014
So, income goes up, then [that] increases demand.

34
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:32,610
[WRITING] Demand goes up.

35
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,024
And remember ... when demand goes up,

36
00:01:36,024 --> 00:01:37,084
we're talking about the whole curve shifting to the right.

37
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,901
At any given price point,

38
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:42,366
we are going to have a larger quantity demanded.

39
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:43,987
So the whole curve,

40
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,268
this whole demand schedule would change.

41
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:48,826
And likewise, if income went down, demand would go down.

42
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:49,872
And [as] we're going to see in a future video,

43
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:51,561
it's actually quite interesting,

44
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:53,428
that's not, always ... the case.

45
00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:58,380
This is only true for normal goods.

46
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,533
[WRITING] "normal goods."

47
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:03,226
And in a future video we'll see goods called "inferior goods,"

48
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:05,426
where this is NOT necessarily the case.

49
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,456
Or, by definition, for an inferior good,

50
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:09,820
it would not be the case.

51
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,138
Now the other ones that are somewhat intuitive

52
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:15,628
are population. [WRITING]

53
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:18,135
Once again, if population goes up --

54
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:20,143
obviously -- at any given price point,

55
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:21,798
more people will want it.

56
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:23,397
So, it would shift the demand curve to the right --

57
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:25,212
or it would increase demand.

58
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,888
If population were to go down, it would decrease demand,

59
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:32,201
which means shifting the whole curve to the left.

60
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:33,679
And then the last one we'll talk about --

61
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,647
And remember, we're holding all these things constant

62
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,487
in order for demand not to change.

63
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:40,572
The last thing is just preferences.

64
00:02:40,572 --> 00:02:42,078
We're assuming that people's tastes

65
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,752
and preferences don't change

66
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:46,903
while we move along a specific demand curve.

67
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:50,574
If preferences actually change, then it will change the curve.

68
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:56,484
So, for example, if, all of a sudden ... the author of [a] book

69
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:58,575
is on some very popular show --

70
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:01,082
talk show -- that tells everyone

71
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,346
that this is the best book that was ever written,

72
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:05,302
then preferences would go up,

73
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:07,902
and that would increase the total demand.

74
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:09,516
At any given price point,

75
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:11,322
more people would be willing to buy the book.

76
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:13,665
If, on the other hand, on that same talk show,

77
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:16,160
it turns out that they do an exposé

78
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,617
on the author having this sordid past

79
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,486
and [they state that] the author plagiarized the whole book,

80
00:03:20,486 --> 00:03:22,800
then the demand will go down.

81
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,050
The entire curve, regardless of the price point --

82
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,429
at any given price point --

83
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:32,380
the quantity demanded will actually go down.
