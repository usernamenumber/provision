1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,290
In this problem we're asked to figure out the length of BC

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,470
We have a bunch of triangles here in some lengths of sides

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,120
and a couple of right angles,

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,030
and so maybe we can establish similarity between some

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,320
of the triangles

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,640
There's actually 3 different triangles that I can see here,

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,460
this triangle, this triangle and this larger triangle

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,240
If we can establish some similarity here,

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,330
maybe we can use ratios between sides

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,920
somehow to figure out what BC is

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,000
So when you look at, you have a right angle right over here,

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,200
so, you, in triangle BDC, you have one right angle,

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,450
in triangle ABC you another right angle

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,730
If can we share, if we can show that they have another angle

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,650
or another corresponding set of angles

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,120
that are congruent to each other,

17
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,770
then we can show that they're similar

18
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,060
And actually both of those triangles, both BDC and ABC,

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,220
both share this angle right over here

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,270
So if they share that angle, then they definitely share two angles

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,730
So they both share that angle right over there

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,820
Let me do that in a different color just for

23
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,770
just to make it different than those right angles

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,490
They both share that angle there,

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,900
and so we know that two triangles

26
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,610
that have at least two of their angles

27
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,880
are, are that at least have two congruent angles,

28
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,890
they are going to be similar triangles

29
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,930
so we know, we know that triangle, I'll write this,

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,260
triangle ABC, ABC, we went from the unlabeled angle

31
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,690
to the right, yellow right angle to the orange angle

32
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,080
So let me write it this way

33
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,070
Went from the unlabelled angle right over here

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,980
to the orange angle or to the yellow angle

35
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,450
I'm having trouble with colors

36
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,030
to the orange angle, ABC

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,150
And we want to do this very carefully here,

38
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,470
because the same points or the same vertices may not say,

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,460
play the same role in both triangles

40
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,450
We want to make sure we're getting the similarity right

41
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:55,440
White vertex to the 90 degree angle vertex to the orange vertex

42
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,510
That is going to be similar to, to triangle

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,050
So which is the one that is neither right angle?

44
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,770
So we're looking at the smaller triangle right over here

45
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,910
Which is the one that is, neither a right angle

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,460
or the orange angle what's going to be vertex B

47
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,820
Vertex B had the right angle

48
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,100
when you think about the larger triangle but we haven't thought

49
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,590
about just that little angle right over there

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,180
So we have started vertex B then we're going to go to the right angle,

51
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,210
the right angle is vertex D, vertex D,

52
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,720
and then we go to vertex C which is in orange

53
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,320
Show, so we have shown that they are similar

54
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,260
And now that we're si that we know

55
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,490
that they're similar, we can attempt to take ratios between the sides

56
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,720
And so let's think about it, we know what the length

57
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,840
of AC is AC is going to be, AC is going to be equal to 8, 6 plus 2

58
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,770
So we know that AC, AC, what's the corresponding side

59
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,420
on this triangle right over here

60
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,980
So you can learn to look at the letters, A and C

61
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,080
is going to corres is going to correspond to BC,

62
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,520
the first and the third, first and the third

63
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,290
AC is going to correspond to BC

64
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,850
And what is and so this is interesting

65
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,910
cause we're already involving BC

66
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,560
And so, what is going to correspond to

67
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,510
And then if we look at BC on the larger triangle,

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,630
so if we look at BC on the larger triangle,

69
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,380
BC is going to correspond to what on the smaller triangle?

70
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,920
It's going to correspond to DC

71
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,410
And it's good because we know what AC is and we know what DC is

72
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,000
And so we can solve for BC

73
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,670
So I want to take one more step to fi

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,990
to show you what we just did here

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,970
Cause BC is playing two different roles

76
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,930
On this first statement right over here,

77
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,100
we're thinking of BC, BC corresponds

78
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,640
BC on our smaller triangle corresponds to AC on our larger triangle

79
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,760
And then in our, in the second statement BC

80
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,680
on our larger triangle corresponds to DC on our smaller triangle,

81
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,290
so in both of these cases, so these are our larger triangles

82
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,280
And then these are, this is from the smaller triangle right over here,

83
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,650
corresponding sides

84
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,040
And this is a cool problem because BC plays two different roles

85
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,530
in two, in both triangles

86
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,000
But now we have enough information to solve for BC

87
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,140
We know that AC is equal to 9

88
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,140
We know that A oh sorry, AC is equal to 8,

89
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,960
AC is equal to 8, 6 plus 2 is 8

90
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,910
And we know that DC is equal to 2, that's given

91
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,660
And now we can cross multiply,

92
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:30,510
8 times 2 is 16 is equal to BC times BC is equal to BC squared

93
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,030
And so BC is going to be equal to the principle root of 16 which is 4

94
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,950
BC is equal to 4, BC is equal to 4 and we're done

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,170
And the hardest part about this problem is just realizing that BC

96
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,070
plays two different roles and just keeping your head straight is,

97
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,100
and just keeping your head straight on those two different roles

98
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,940
And just to make it clear,

99
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,370
let me actually draw these two triangles separately

100
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,890
So if I drew ABC separately it would look like this,

101
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,960
it would look like this

102
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:07,510
So this is my triangle ABC and then this is a right angle,

103
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,580
this is our orange angle

104
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,770
We know that the length of this side right over here is 8

105
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,270
And we know that the length of this side,

106
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,820
what we figured out thru this problem is 4

107
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,360
Then if we want to draw BDC we would draw it like this

108
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,290
So BDC BDC looks like this

109
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,840
So this is BDC, that's a little bit easier

110
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,110
to visualize cause we've already

111
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,770
this is our right angle,

112
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,150
this is our orange angle and this is four

113
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,540
and this right over here is two

114
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,900
And I did it this way to show you that you kinda have to flip

115
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,990
this triangle over and rotate it

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,820
just to have kind of a similar orientation

117
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,780
and then it might make it look a little bit clearer

118
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,250
So if you've found this part confusing,

119
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,440
I encourage you to try to flip and rotate BDC

120
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,750
in such a way that it seems to look a lot like ABC

121
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,220
And then this ratio should hopefully make a lot more sense
