00:00:00,722 --> 00:00:02,911
PROBLEM: "Mitchell ran 8 miles today.

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:05,383
Sabrina ran 7 miles.

3
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:07,608
Which of the following statements is true?"

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,267
And I can choose more than one answer here.

5
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:10,525
So let's think about this.

6
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:12,890
The ratio of Mitchell's distance

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,593
to Sabrina's distance is 2:1 (SPOKEN AS "2 to 1.")

8
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:18,028
Well, that's not right – because the ratio is 8:7.

9
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:20,693
And 8:7 is not the same as 2:1. 
(i.e., 8:7 cannot be reduced to 2:1).

10
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:21,792
"The ratio of Mitchell's distance

11
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:25,020
to Sabrina's distance is 16:14."

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,238
Well, that look's right.

13
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:28,057
If I double Mitchell's distance,

14
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:29,825
and double Sabrina's distance,

15
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:31,827
I would get [CALCULATING] 8 × 2 is 16 (for Mitchell),

16
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:33,483
and 7 × 2 is 14 (for Sabrina).

17
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:34,940
So that seems right.

18
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,128
"The ratio of Mitchell's distance

19
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:39,487
to Sabrina's distance is 7:8."

20
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:40,827
Well it looks like they've swapped it around.

21
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:43,915
The ratio of Mitchell's distance to Sabrina's is 8:7.

22
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:45,472
So that's not right.

23
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:47,363
The ratio of Mitchell's distance

24
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:49,668
to Sabrina's distance is 8:15.

25
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:51,936
Well, that's also not right. It's 8:7.

26
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:54,475
So I'll just go with that one right over there.

27
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:56,362
Let's do one more of these.

28
00:00:56,362 --> 00:00:58,328
PROBLEM: "Jessica makes a cake using

29
00:00:58,328 --> 00:01:01,537
4 cups of flour and 6 cups of milk."

30
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:02,406
Fair enough.

31
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:03,844
"Which of the following are correct statements?"

32
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:05,997
And I can pick more than one.

33
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:11,817
"The ratio of flour to milk is 2:3." Let's see.

34
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:14,702
So 4 cups of flour for every 6 cups of milk.

35
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:16,655
So that's 4:6.

36
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:17,831
If I were to divide both the numerator

37
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:18,712
and the denominator by 2,

38
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,083
that's the same thing as 2:3.

39
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,177
So, that's right.

40
00:01:21,177 --> 00:01:25,789
The ratio of milk to flour is 8:6.

41
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,345
Is that right?

42
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:30,393
So, I have 6 cups of milk for every 4 cups of flour.

43
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:33,275
So, it's a ration of 6:4.

44
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:38,105
6:4 is not the same thing as 8:6.

45
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:41,057
So I will not choose that one right over there.

46
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:45,528
"The ratio of flour to milk is 10:15."

47
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:46,127
So, let's think.

48
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:49,857
We already know that the ratio of flour to milk is 2:3.

49
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:53,658
If we were to multiply 2 times 5, you'll get 10 –

50
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:57,522
and 3 times 5 you get 15. So this is right.

51
00:01:57,522 --> 00:02:00,856
And then, "The ratio of flour to milk is 1:2."

52
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:01,628
Well, now that's not right.

53
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:04,533
2:3 is not the same thing as 1:2.

54
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,967
And I think we are done.
