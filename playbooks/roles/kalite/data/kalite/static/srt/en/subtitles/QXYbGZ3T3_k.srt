00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:06,541
In the last video on quasars I think I sparked some interest when I think I threw out the idea of the...

2
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:10,067
Milky Way Galaxy actually colloding with the Andromeda Galaxy.

3
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:13,938
Which people think will happen in three to five billion years.

4
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:20,000
I threw out in the context of maybe, maybe the super massive black holes at the core.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,421
The galactic cores of each of those galaxys will start getting a little bit more material when that...

6
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:25,200
collision happens.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,667
And maybe quasars will happen.

8
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:27,667
I don't know.

9
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:31,590
But given the interest in that what I wanted to do here is kind of an unconventional thing for the Khan...

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,123
Academy.

11
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:33,456
And actually show a video.

12
00:00:33,456 --> 00:00:35,800
And before I play the video I have to give credit where credit is due.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,467
This is a super computer simulation made at the National Center for super computing applications at NASA.

14
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:47,200
And it's by B. Robinson of Cal Tech and L. Hernquist of Harvord University.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,067
And what I want you to remember is this is super sped up in time.

16
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:56,585
Just to give an idea the amount of time it takes for a star about as far away as the sun to make one...

17
00:00:56,585 --> 00:01:01,702
orbit around the galactic core is two-hundred and fifty million years.

18
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:06,005
And you're going to see that this is happening multiple times over the course of this video.

19
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:09,200
So this video is actually spanning billions of years.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,467
But when you actually speed up time like that you'll see that it really gives you the sense of the actual

21
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,000
dynamics of these interactions.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,133
The other thing that I want to talk about before I actually start the video is to make you realise that

23
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:23,267
when we talk about galaxies colliding it doesn't mean that the stars are colliding.

24
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:26,133
In fact there are going to be very few stars that actually collide.

25
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,667
The probability of a star, star collision is very low.

26
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:33,667
And that's cause we learned when we learned about interstellar scale that there's mostly free space...

27
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:34,467
inbetween stars.

28
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:37,667
The closest star to us 4.2 light-years away.

29
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:42,800
And that's roughly thirty-million times the diameter of the sun.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,600
So you have a lot more free space than star space...

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,933
or even solar system space.

32
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,667
So lets start up this animation

33
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:51,667
It's pretty amazing.

34
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,729
And what you're going to see here, so these are just the...

35
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,600
obviously, so one rotation is actually 250,000,000 years give or take.

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,600
But now you see these stars right here...

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,067
are starting to get attracted to this core.

38
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,333
And then they're actually attracted to that core.

39
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:08,333
And then some of the stuff in that core was attracted to those stars.

40
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,733
And they get pulled away.

41
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:12,200
That was the first pass of these two galaxies.

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,400
Some stuff is just being thrown off into intergalactic space.

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,533
And you might worry, maybe that'll happen to the Earth.

44
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:20,133
And there's some probability that it would happen to the Earth.

45
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:24,267
But it really wouldn't affect what happens within those stars solar systems.

46
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:25,733
This is happening so slow.

47
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,667
You wouldn't feel like some type of acceleration or something.

48
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,733
And then this is the second pass.

49
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:35,867
They've passed one pass and this is occurring over hundreds of millions or billions of years.

50
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:40,133
And on the second pass they finally are able to merge.

51
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:43,000
And all of these interactions are just due to the gravity over interstellar

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,533
Or almost, you could call it, intergalactic distances.

53
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:51,641
You can see they merge into what could be called a Milkomeda or maybe the Andromedy Way.

54
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:53,333
I don't know, whatever you want to call it.

55
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:58,133
But even though they've merged a lot of the stuff has still been thrown off into intergalactic space.

56
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:01,800
But this is a pretty amazing animation to me.

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,267
One; it's amazing to think about how this could happen over galactic space scales...

58
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,267
and time scales.

59
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:13,467
But it's also pretty neat how a super-computer can do all the computations...

60
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:18,133
to figure out what every particle, which is really a star, or cluster of stars, or group of stars...

61
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:22,667
is actually doing to actually give us a sense of the actual dynamics here.

62
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:25,841
But this is, this is pretty neat, this is pretty neat.

63
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,133
Look at that.

64
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:30,015
I mean these are, you know, every little dot is whole groups of stars.

65
00:03:30,015 --> 99:59:59,999
Thousands of stars potentially.
