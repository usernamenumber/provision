1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,550
Multiply 1 and 3/4
times 7 and 1/5.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,760
Simplify your answer and write
it as a mixed fraction.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,080
So the first thing we want to
do is rewrite each of these

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,990
mixed numbers as improper
fractions.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,790
It's very difficult, or at least
it's not easy for me, to

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,680
directly multiply
mixed numbers.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,560
One can do it, but it's much
easier if you just make them

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,180
improper fractions.

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,620
So let's convert each of them.

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,380
So 1 and 3/4 is equal to-- it's
still going to be over 4,

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,810
so you're still going to have
the same denominator, but your

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,710
numerator as an improper
fraction is going to be 4

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,615
times 1 plus 3.

15
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:43,390
   

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,750
And the reason why this makes
sense is 1 is 4/4, or 1 is 4

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,790
times 1 fourths, right?

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,480
1 is the same thing as 4/4, and
then you have three more

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,670
fourths, so 4/4 plus 3/4
will give you 7/4.

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,760
   

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,670
So that's the same thing
as 1 and 3/4.

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,319
Now, let's do 7 and 1/5.

23
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,590
   

24
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,580
Same exact process.

25
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,860
We're going to still be talking
in terms of fifths.

26
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,710
That's going to be
the denominator.

27
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,600
You take 5 times 7, because
think about it.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,960
7 is the same thing as 35/5.

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,150
So you take 5 times 7 plus this
numerator right here.

30
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,670
So 7 is 35/5, then you have
one more fifth, so you're

31
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,870
going to have 35 plus 1,
which is equal to 36/5.

32
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,320
So this product is the exact
same thing as taking the

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:51,350
product of 7/4 times 36/5.

34
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,220
And we could multiply
it out right now.

35
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,100
Take the 7 times 36 as our new
numerator, 4 times 5 as our

36
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,780
new denominator, but that'll
give us large numbers.

37
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,370
I can't multiply 7 and
36 in my head, or I

38
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,890
can't do it too easily.

39
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,590
So let's see if we can
simplify this first.

40
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,320
Both our numerator and our
denominator have numbers that

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,220
are divisible by 4, so let's
divide both the numerator and

42
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,740
the denominator by 4.

43
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,100
So in the numerator, we can
divide the 36 by 4 and get 9.

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,360
If you divide something in the
numerator by 4, you need to

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,020
divide something in the
denominator by 4, and the 4 is

46
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,890
the obvious guy, so 4
divided by 4 is 1.

47
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,700
So now this becomes 7 times 9,
and what's the 7 times 9?

48
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,900
It's 63, over 1 times 5.

49
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,920
So now we have our answer as an
improper fraction, but they

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,020
want it as a mixed number
or as a mixed fraction.

51
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,120
So what are 63/5?

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,120
So to figure that out-- let me
pick a nice color here-- we

53
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,260
take 5 into 63.

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,420
5 goes into 6 one time.

55
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,320
1 times 5 is 5.

56
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,260
You subtract.

57
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,260
6 minus 5 is 1.

58
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,330
Bring down the 3.

59
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,220
5 goes into 13 two times.

60
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,160
And you could have immediately
said 5 goes into 63 twelve

61
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,480
times, but this way, at
least to me, it's a

62
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,960
little bit more obvious.

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:27,305
And then 2 times 5 is 12,
and then we have sorry!

64
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:32,390
2 times 5 is 10.

65
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,660
That tells you not to
switch gears in the

66
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,560
middle of a math problem.

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,600
2 times 5 is 10, and then you
subtract, and you have a

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,165
remainder of 3.

69
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:42,040
   

70
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:51,070
So 63/5 is the same thing as 12
wholes and 3 left over, or

71
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,800
3/5 left over.

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,460
And if you wanted to go back
from this to that, just think:

73
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,030
12 is the same thing as
60 fifths, or 60/5.

74
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,950
60/5 plus 3/5 is 63/5,
so these two things

75
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,720
are the same thing.

76
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,810
These two things
are equivalent.

77
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,980
This is as an improper
fraction.

78
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,390
This is as a mixed number
or a mixed fraction.

79
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,130
But this is our answer right
there: 12 and 3/5.
