1
00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:03,251
We know that new plate material is being formed

2
00:00:03,251 --> 00:00:07,200
and these lithospheric plates on the surface of the earth

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,600
are moving around,

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,667
and that might raise the question in your brain,

5
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,200
"What happens if we kind of reverse things?

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,067
We know the direction that they're moving in;

7
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:18,576
what does that tell us about where they came from?"

8
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:20,248
So let's just do the thought experiment.

9
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:23,667
Right now South America and Africa are moving away from each other

10
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:27,533
because of new plate material being created

11
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:28,600
at the Mid-Atlantic Rift.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,667
Let's rewind it.

13
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's bring them back together.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We know that India is jamming into the Eurasian plate right now,

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,600
causing the Himalayas to get higher and higher.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,267
What if we rewind that?

17
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:45,488
Let's bring India back down towards Antarctica.

18
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:46,742
Same thing with Australia.

19
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:54,333
We have new plate material being formed between Australia and Antarctica,

20
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,333
that's making the continents move apart.

21
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's bring them back together.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,400
Let's rewind the clock.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,226
Even North America — it's not as obvious from this diagram

24
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:07,408
but if you look at the GPS data, it's pretty obvious

25
00:01:07,408 --> 00:01:09,867
that North America right now is kind of

26
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:13,909
moving in a counterclockwise rotation.

27
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,067
So let's rewind it. Let's rewind it into a —

28
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:20,600
let's go back, moving it in a clockwise direction.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Instead of Eurasia going further away from North America,

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,333
let's bring it back together.

31
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,133
So what you can imagine is a reality where

32
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:33,158
India and Australia are jammed down into Antarctica,

33
00:01:33,158 --> 00:01:35,333
South America and Africa are jammed together,

34
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,267
North America is jammed in there,

35
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:40,148
and essentially Eurasia's also jammed in there.

36
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:42,533
So it looks like they're all kind of clumped together

37
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,676
if you go back a few hundred million years.

38
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:49,482
And, based on literally just that thought experiment,

39
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:50,736
you can imagine that at one point,

40
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,667
all of the continents on the world

41
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:56,820
were kind of merged into one supercontinent.

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,070
And that supercontinent is called "Pangaea."

43
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:04,157
"Pan-" for "entire" or "whole,"

44
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,333
and "-gaea," coming from "Gaia," for "the world."

45
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,667
And it turns out that all of the evidence that we've seen

46
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,000
actually does make us believe

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
that there was supercontinent called —

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,733
well, we call it Pangaea now, obviously

49
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:17,933
there weren't things on the planet

50
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,400
calling it anything back then,

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,667
well, there were things back then,

52
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:24,823
but not things that would actually go and try to label continents,

53
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:25,800
that we know of,

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,133
but all of the evidence tells us that Pangaea existed

55
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:32,133
about 200 million to 300 million years ago —

56
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:36,400
roughly maybe 250 million, give or take, years ago.

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,200
And I want to be clear, this was not the first supercontinent.

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
To a large degree, it was the most recent supercontinent,

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,736
it's easiest for us to construct because it was the most recent one,

60
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:54,267
but we believe that there were other supercontinents before this.

61
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,239
if you rewind even more,

62
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,733
you would have to break up Pangaea and it would reform

63
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,071
but we're now going back in time.

64
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,200
But there were several supercontinents in the past

65
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,227
that broke up, reformed, broke up, reformed,

66
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:06,467
and the last time that we had a supercontinent

67
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:09,893
was Pangaea, about 250 million years ago.

68
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:15,733
And now it's broken up into our current-day geography.

69
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,647
Now, I won't go into all of the detail why we believe

70
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:22,867
that there was a Pangaea about 250 million years ago,

71
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:25,733
or this diagram tells us, about 225 million year ago,

72
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:26,933
give or take.

73
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:29,267
But I'll go into some of the interesting evidence.

74
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:32,733
On a very high level, you have a lot of rock commonalities

75
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:36,467
between things that would have had to combine during Pangaea.

76
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,800
And probably the most interesting thing is the fossil evidence.

77
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:42,867
There's a whole bunch of fossils,

78
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,235
and here's examples of it.

79
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:50,067
From species that were around between 200 and 300 million years ago.

80
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,800
And their fossils are found in a very specific place.

81
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,868
This animal right here, Cynognathus

82
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,267
— I hope I'm pronouncing that right —

83
00:03:57,267 --> 00:04:02,133
Cynognathus, this animal's fossils are only found

84
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:05,333
in this area of South America, the nice clean band here,

85
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,200
and this part of Africa.

86
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,333
So not only does South America look like it fits very nicely

87
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,867
into Africa,

88
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:15,907
but the fossil evidence also makes it look like

89
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:19,133
there was a nice clean band where this animal lived

90
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,644
and where we find the fossils.

91
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:23,733
It really makes it seem like these were connected,

92
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,333
at least when this animal lived.

93
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,562
Maybe on the order of 250 million years ago.

94
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:30,333
This species right over here,

95
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,133
its fossils are found in this area.

96
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,901
Let me do it in a color that has more contrast —

97
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:37,933
in this area right over here.

98
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,733
This plant, its fossils

99
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:42,733
— now this starts to connect a lot of dots between a lot of continents —

100
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:45,884
its fossils are found in this entire area,

101
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:51,573
across South America, Africa, Antarctica, India, and Australia.

102
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:54,333
And so not only does it look like

103
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,333
the continents kind of fit together in a puzzle piece,

104
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,267
not only do we get it to a configuration like this

105
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:01,000
if we essentially just rewind the movement that we're seeing now,

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,667
but the fossil evidence also kind of confirms

107
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:05,900
that they fit together in this way.

108
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,407
This animal right here,

109
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:11,933
we find fossils on this nice stripe that goes

110
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:14,933
from Africa through India all the way to Antarctica.

111
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,000
Now this only gives us evidence of

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,900
kind of the more, the Southern Hemisphere of Pangaea.

113
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,333
But there is other evidence.

114
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:28,867
We find continuing mountain chains between North America and Europe.

115
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:31,070
We find rock evidence where,

116
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,000
just the way you see fossils that line up nicely,

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
we see common rock that lines up nicely

118
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,333
between South American and Africa

119
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,067
and other continents that were at once connected.

120
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,983
So all of the evidence so far as we can tell now

121
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:46,070
does make us think that there was at one time a Pangaea.

122
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,737
And, for all we know, all the continents are going to keep moving,

123
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:53,533
and maybe, in a few hundred million years,

124
00:05:53,533 --> 99:59:59,999
we'll have another supercontinent. Who knows.
