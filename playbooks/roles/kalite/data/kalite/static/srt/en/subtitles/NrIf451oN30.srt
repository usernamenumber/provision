1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,430
We're on problem 103.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:14,040
And it says, if n and k are greater than 0,

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,850
is n over k an integer?

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,440
So essentially they're asking, is k divisible into n.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,800
So let's see, statement 1 says, n and k are both integers.

6
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,100
And that's good that they told me that,

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,430
because I was assuming it incorrectly.

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,350
So they're saying n and k are both integers.

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,810
Well that still doesn't help me much.

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,880
n could be 2 and k could be 100. And 2 over 100, is 1/50.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,370
That's not an integer.Although n could be 4 and k could be 2.

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,120
And that would be an integer. 4 over 2 is 2.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,060
So statement 1 by itself doesn't help me.

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:02,090
Statement 2 says n squared and k squared are both integers.

15
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,070
Well once again, I don't see as helping me much.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,650
If n and k are both integers, of course when you square them

17
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,380
they're going to integers.

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,540
You take any integer and you square it you get an integer.

19
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,720
You take any other integer and you square

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,320
it you get an integer.

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,510
So this actually gives me no new information relative to 1.

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,220
So, I'm just trying to see if I'm missing something.

23
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,290
But as far as I can tell it's E.

24
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,530
Both statements together are not sufficient

25
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,080
to answer this question.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,650
I mean, I can give you a case. n could be 4, k could be 2.

27
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,020
And then, n over k would be an integer.

28
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,010
And both of these would satisfy both of these conditions.

29
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,070
Or it could be, 2 and 4.

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,180
In which case, n over k aren't integers.

31
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,570
They don't actually differentiate between n and k at all.

32
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,000
So it's E.

33
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,130
Next problem. 104.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,700
If the average arithmetic mean of six numbers is 75,

35
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,440
how many of the numbers are equal to 75?

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,470
OK, so six numbers are equal to 75.

37
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,090
How many of them are equal to 75?

38
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,090
Let me go scroll down a little bit.

39
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,810
The first statement says, none of the six numbers

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,260
is less than 75. So none less than 75.

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,860
So this is interesting. If I have six numbers.

42
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,010
And their average is 75 and none of them are less than 75,

43
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:58,010
they essentially all have to be 75.

44
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,020
Let's say the first number is 75.

45
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,830
Now let's just say that I had some number above 75in the list

46
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,920
Let's just say for argument that there was a 76 in the list.

47
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,070
It doesn't have to be an integer. They're not assuming that.

48
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,340
But let's say I had 76 in the list. In order for the average

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,620
to be 75, I would have to offset this number that's one

50
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,050
more than 75 with another number that's one less than 75.

51
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,040
But they told us that none of the numbers are less than 75.

52
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,590
So if I have a number greater than 75, I have to have a

53
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,640
corresponding number less than 75,

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,150
or several of them to balance off that number.

55
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,900
Or you could have several balancing several.

56
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,020
It can get complicated.

57
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,000
But the general idea is, is that if no numbers are less

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,450
than 75, you can't have any numbers greater than 75 either.

59
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:51,020
So this actually tells you that all six are 75.

60
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,000
So statement 1 alone is sufficient.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,180
Statement 2 says, none of the six numbers is greater than 75.

62
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,570
Well it's the same argument. If I have a number,

63
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,040
let's call it a.

64
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,290
Let's say it's one of the numbers that's in my list.

65
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,000
And it's greater than 75.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,910
In order to average down to 75, I'm going to have to

67
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,480
have-- well let's say a is less than 75.

68
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,010
Because we're using statement number 2.

69
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,830
If a is less than 75--let's say 75 is here in the number line

70
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,910
I'm just doing ad hoc diagrams. So a is less than 75.

71
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,190
In order for the whole group to average to 75, I have to

72
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,410
have some number that's bigger than 75 to balance off the a.

73
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,580
Let's call that b.

74
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,430
But they're saying that we have no numbers greater than 75.

75
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,380
So we have no numbers greater than 75.

76
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,210
We can't have any numbers less than 75 either and all the

77
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,560
numbers have to be equal to 75. All six of them.

78
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,570
So once again 2 is also sufficient.

79
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,410
So each of these statements, independently, are sufficient

80
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,980
to answer this question. Actually

81
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,000
they both answer the question that all six are equal to 75.

82
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,600
That was interesting.

83
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:17,450
Problem 105. Is the absolute value of x equal to y minus z?OK

84
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,040
Absolute value of x equal to y minus z. All right.

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,480
So in statement number 1, they tell us that x plus

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,670
y is equal to z.

87
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,710
So let's see if we can do some substitution.

88
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,400
z is equal to x plus y.

89
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,720
So if we substitute z into this top equation we get the

90
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,650
absolute value of x is equal to y minus x plus y.

91
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,450
So that means that the absolute value of x is equal

92
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,980
to y minus x minus y.

93
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,540
And that says that the absolute value of x is equal

94
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,030
to minus x. Because the y's cancel out.

95
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,110
Well I don't know if this is true still.

96
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,510
This would apply to any negative number.

97
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,700
If I have a negative 1, negative 1 absolute value is 1.

98
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,310
And negative negative 1 is 1 as well.

99
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,790
So this would apply if x is 0 or some negative number.

100
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,730
But they don't tell us that.So we don't know if this is true.

101
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,710
Statement 2 tells us-- well there you go-- statement 2

102
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,960
tells us that x is less than 0.

103
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,520
So this tells us x is definitely a negative number.

104
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,320
And if you put any negative number into this, which we got

105
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,580
from this condition and this condition, if you put this

106
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,330
into that, you know this is true for any negative number.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,440
The absolute value of any negative number is the

108
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,610
opposite of that number.

109
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,390
So you need both of these statements.

110
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,000
And obviously statement 2 alone is useless.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,050
Because if you just say x is less than 0, you don't know

112
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,060
anything about y or z without this condition right here.

113
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,920
So both statements together are sufficient.

114
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,000
But individually, they are reasonably useless.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,010
106. We're getting up there.

116
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,780
What was the total amount of revenue that a theater

117
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,450
received from the sale of 400 tickets, some of which were

118
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,660
sold at x percent of full price and the rest of which

119
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,910
were sold at full price?

120
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,570
So let's say we have the reduced price tickets and the

121
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,050
full price.

122
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,470
So R is the number of reduced price tickets and F is the

123
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,990
number of full price tickets. So R plus F.

124
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,070
So the the total number of tickets was 400.

125
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,450
What was the total amount of revenue?

126
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,870
And then the total amount of revenue generated is going to be

127
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:54,720
equal to the price of full price times the full price tickets

128
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,000
So P times F where P is the price of full priced.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,570
Plus the number of reduced tickets and that's sold at x

130
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:10,710
percent of the full price tickets. Whatever x is. x percent.

131
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,930
we'll convert it to a decimal at the appropriate time.

132
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,710
So this is what the initial problem description tells us.

133
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,450
That the total number of tickets is 400 and then

134
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,570
whatever-- of its x percentage of P-- so whatever the full

135
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,470
price is times the full price tickets plus-- this would be

136
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,460
the reduced price times the reduced price tickets-- equals

137
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,060
the total revenue.Now let's see if we can figure this one out

138
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,060
x is equal to 50.

139
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,040
Well this by itself just tells us that this is p

140
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,120
over 2 right here. This x is 0.5. It's 50%.

141
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,710
Remember they said x percent.

142
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,540
So this just makes this equation, it turns it into,

143
00:08:50,540 --> 00:09:00,510
0.5 times P times R plus P times F is equal to the revenue.

144
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,590
And we still have one, two, three unknowns and two equations.

145
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,370
So that by itself isn't enough.

146
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,530
We actually have four unknowns. R, P, F and revenue.

147
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,170
Four unknowns, two equations. Not good enough.

148
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,030
2, full price tickets sold for $20 each.

149
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,030
So the price of a full price ticket is $20.

150
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,760
So now, this is interesting.

151
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,880
Now we could take this and substitute it into this equation.

152
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,050
Because we now know what the price is, the P variable.

153
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,570
And so if we use both of these conditions, we have 50% of a

154
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,420
full price-- well, that's $10-- times the number of

155
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,570
reduced price tickets plus $20, times the number of full

156
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:51,000
price tickets, is equal to the revenue generated.

157
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,510
And then we know that a total of 400 tickets are sold.

158
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,070
R plus F is equal to 400.

159
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,000
Well even now, we still just don't have enough information.

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,400
They would have to tell us either R or F.

161
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,890
Or they would have to tell us the total amount of revenue

162
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,210
generated in order for us-- well, actually that's what

163
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,750
they want to figure out.

164
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,460
They want to know the total amount of revenue.

165
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,560
So in order to figure that out, we would have to have at

166
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,750
least one more condition to solve for R.

167
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,820
And then be able to solve for F.

168
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,100
We have to know R or F to figure out the revenue.

169
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,390
Let me just make sure I'm not missing something here.

170
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,750
Yeah, there's no other way to just-- you can't just separate

171
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,000
out an R plus F. So I'm going to say that E,

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
both statements together are not sufficient.

173
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,620
I'm pretty sure I'm right.

174
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,070
I'm don't think I'm missing anything right here.

175
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,820
Some of which were sold at x percent of full price and the

176
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,010
rest were sold at full price,which is $20. So R plus F is 40.

177
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:56,030
And then we have 10R is equal to revenue. Yeah.

178
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,510
We have three unknowns and two equations,two linear equations

179
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,750
Not good enough. Next problem. Oh, I'm over time.

180
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,050
See you in the next video.
