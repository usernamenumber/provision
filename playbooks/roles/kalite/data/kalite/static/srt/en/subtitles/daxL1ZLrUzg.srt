Based on the last two videos we've been able to figure out what a marginal revenue curve looks like

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for the monopolist here, for the monopolist in the orange market.This is what we got.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right over here is a line with a slope twice as, twice as steep as the slope of the main curve.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we'll see that's actually generalisable. There's an optional video that I'll do very shortly where I'll prove it with a little bit of calculus.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it is very important to realise that this marginal revenue curve looks very different than the marginal revenue curve if we were dealing with perfect competition.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we were dealing with perfect competition there would be some equilibrium price in the market and all the competitors would essentially just have to take that price.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's say that the equilibrium price was $3 per pound.THen our marginal revenue curve would look like this.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we were not a monopolist. If we were a one of the many perfect competitiors. I guess you could view it that way.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because we would have to just take that price. If we wanted to sell 1000 pounds, each of those, each of those pounds

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we would get $3 per pound and then if we wanted to sell 1001 we will just get $3 per pound for the next one.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It doesn't change. We are just taking that price.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
With the monopolist things do change because we are the only producer in the market.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The price at what which we can get changes depending on what we produce because we are the entire supplier for the market.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we have this downward sloping marginal revenue curve.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now with that all the way, let's think about what would be the optimal quantity for us to produce if we wanted to maximise profit.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if we think in pure economic terms that's what firms try to do.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They try to,their exist to maximise profit and to do that we are going to think about.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Remember it is not to maximise revenue.To maximise revenue we would say oh they should just produce 3000 pounds.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it is not about maximising revenue. It's about maximising profit we have to take the cost into consideration

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and to do that we'll have to draw a marginal cost curve and so let's see i did the research so let's say the owners of this firm

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we have a marginal cost curve that looks something like this.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let' say our marginal cost curve looks like this.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is important to realise we are the market.We are the only producers here.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this isn't just our marginal cost curve. This is the marginal cost curve for the market.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or in another way to think about it. This is the supply curve for the market.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It tells you in any given price how much the market is going to supply.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You could view as the marginal cost or you could view it as a supply curve and we have talked about it before - you could view a supply curve as a marginal cost curve.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you want the market to produce one extra pound what's the minimum price you would have to give and that is the marginal cost.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now with this out of the way let's think about what you would produce.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well you would definetly, you would definetly want to produce something, you definetly start to produce a few, a few pounds right over here

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because the marginal revenue that you are getting is way above your marginal cost/

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Each incremental pound you are producing right over here, you are getting much more revenue.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You are getting you know 5 or 6 dollars of revenue it's only costing you a little over a dollar.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
SO you just think, ok i'm gonna keep producing, i'm gonna keep producing over here.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Your still, each incremental unit you are getting, you are getting more revenue than the cost of that incremental unit.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then it keeps being true all the way until you get to, all the way until you get to 2000 pounds right over here.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at this point right over here you don't want to produce an incremental unit.
