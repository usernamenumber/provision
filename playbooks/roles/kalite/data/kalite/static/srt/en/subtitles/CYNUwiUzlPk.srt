00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:04,133
What we have got over here is a triangle

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:06,467
where all 3 sides have the same length.

3
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:10,600
All 3 sides are congruent, a triangle like this,

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:17,600
we call as equilateral triangle

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,867
Now what i want to do is to prove that

6
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:22,800
if all 3 sides are the same then all

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,000
all 3 angles will measure the same

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,800
So let us think how we can do this.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,600
First we know that AB = AC,

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,800
Let us pretend that we do not know that it is equal to BC

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,333
for an isosceles triangle, two sides have the same length

12
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:51,667
the base angles will be the same.

13
00:00:51,667 --> 00:01:06,600
We know that angle ABC = angle ACB

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:38,667
because side AB= side AC

15
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:46,267
So if two sides are equal, base angles are equal

16
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:48,933
We can also view this triangle from the other way

17
00:01:48,933 --> 00:02:00,733
maybe sides BC & side BA have the same length

18
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:24,067
that means angle CAB& angle ABC are the same

19
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:36,000
If the sides are AC & BC, then these will be base angles.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,467
So let us review what we have said so far

21
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:40,000
Sides AB and AC are same so

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,400
angle ABC = angle ACB

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,000
and sides BA = BC so angle ABC = angle CBA

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,667
If angle ABC = angle ACB = angle CAB

25
00:02:49,667 --> 00:03:08,933
then all the angles are congruent to each other

26
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:14,333
so equilateral triangle is one in which all 3 angles are

27
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:22,533
the same . All angles add up to 180

28
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:26,733
so if we call the angle as x, then x + x + x = 180

29
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:34,667
or 3x = 180, so x = 60 degrees.

30
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,933
In equilateral triangle are three angles are the same

31
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:44,933
and are equal to 60 degrees

32
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,067
Now let us think about it the other way round

33
00:03:47,067 --> 00:04:09,933
I have a triangle where all teh angles are the same

34
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,400
Point X, Y ,Z of the triangle , what we showed in the last video

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,067
is if 2 bases angles are the same then the corresponding

36
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:20,400
sides are going to be the same

37
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:30,067
We know YX = YZ and we know that because the

38
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:41,600
base angles YXZ = YZX

39
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:57,667
now we also know that YZ = XZ

40
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:15,933
here the base angles are XYZ = YXZ

41
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,800
The base angles in the first case are

42
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:49,333
angles YXZ = angle YZX

43
00:05:49,333 --> 00:06:10,200
in the second case the angle XYZ = angle YXZ

44
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:21,933
we said that all sides are equal to each other.

45
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:25,800
If we have a triangle with all 3 angles at 60 degrees

46
00:06:25,800 --> 99:59:59,999
then all 3 sides will be the same
