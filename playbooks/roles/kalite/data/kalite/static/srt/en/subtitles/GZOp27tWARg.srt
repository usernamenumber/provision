1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,590
We are in Section 8 on the
seventh test. We're almost

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,960
done with this book,
so let's start.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,210
Problem number one.

5
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,760
   

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:19,520
If 6,700 is equal to 100 times
6k plus 7, then k equals what?

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,060
So let's divide both sides
of this by 100.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,060
So you get 100 and you get these
two zeroes, so you get

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,310
67 is equal to 6k plus 7.

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,520
I just divided both
sides by 100.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,980
Subtract 7 from both sides.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,490
You get 60 is equal to 6k.

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,310
Divide both sides by 6, you
get 10 is equal to k.

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,740
That's choice C.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,040
Problem 2.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,850
If 3 more than n is a negative
number-- so n plus 3 is a

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,270
negative number-- that's
what that says, right?

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,210
And 5 more than n is a positive
number, so n plus 5

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,320
is greater than 0, which of
the following could be the

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,770
value of n?

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,810
So n plus 3 is negative, n plus
5 is greater, so n plus 3

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,710
has to be less than
negative 3, right?

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,500
This means that n is less
than negative 3.

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,180
How did I get that?

25
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,970
I subtracted 3 from both sides
of this equation, right?

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,520
If I subtract 5 from both sides
of this equation, I

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,570
would get that n is greater
than negative 5.

28
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,460
So you have to be greater than
negative 5 and less than

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,780
negative 3.

30
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,240
What's the only number that I
can think of that's that?

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,140
Well, there's a lot of numbers,
but a simple one is

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,230
minus 4, right?

33
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,140
Minus 4 is less than
negative 3, right?

34
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,540
If I draw a number line, this is
minus 3, minus 4, minus 5.

35
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,280
So minus 4 is less than negative
3 and it's greater

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,100
than minus 5.

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,120
So that's the answer.

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,310
Choice B.

39
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,100
And you can try it
out with minus 4.

40
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,110
Minus 4 plus 3 is minus 1.

41
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,520
So that works.

42
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,830
Minus 4 plus 5 is plus 1.

43
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,270
So that works.

44
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,520
Problem three.

45
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,960
   

46
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,090
OK in the figure above-- OK let
me see if I can draw this.

47
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,640
I'll draw it big because
it looks complicated.

48
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:26,800
A line like that, a line like
that, and one like that.

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:41,180
They tell us this is x, this is
y, and then they tell us in

50
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,020
the figure above, if x is equal
to 70, so this is equal

51
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,710
to 70, and y is equal to 40,
so this is equal to 40, and

52
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,030
the dotted lines bisect the
angles with measure x and y

53
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,180
degrees, what is
the value of z?

54
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,370
OK, so the dotted lines, instead
of drawing dotted

55
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,950
lines, I'm going to draw green
lines, so this green line will

56
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,450
bisect this angle, so it
goes right in between.

57
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,600
So if it bisects the angle, what
is the measure of this

58
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,350
angle right here?

59
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,630
Well, it's going to be half of
this angle that it bisected.

60
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,240
So this whole thing
is 70, so this is

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,860
going to be 35 degrees.

62
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,990
Similarly, this other green line
is going to bisect this

63
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,960
y-- oh, I thought I was
using the line tool.

64
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,490
This other green line is going
to bisect y right here, right?

65
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,380
So it bisects it.

66
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,100
So if it bisects it, what's
this angle going to be?

67
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,280
Well, it's going to be half of
angle y, and they tell us

68
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,240
angle y is 40.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,810
I wrote that.

70
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,800
I just wrote over it.

71
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,910
So this has to be 20
degrees, right?

72
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,600
Because it's half
of the full y.

73
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,770
And they say, what is
the values of z?

74
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,840
Well, z is just this
whole thing.

75
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,890
So it's this angle plus this
angle, so it's 55 degrees.

76
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,140
And that's choice E.

77
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,840
   

78
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,090
Problem four.

79
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,800
   

80
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,960
A piece of fruit is to
be chosen at random

81
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,700
from a basket a fruit.

82
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,560
The probability that the piece
of fruit chosen will be an

83
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,610
apple is 2/5.

84
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:19,589
So the probability of an
apple is equal to 2/5.

85
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,620
Which of the following could not
be the number of pieces of

86
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,760
fruit in the basket?

87
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,350
Could not be.

88
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:35,280
So the secret here is you take
2/5 and whatever 2/5 is times

89
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,610
the number of fruit, right?

90
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,410
2/5 times the number of
fruit has to equal

91
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,660
the number of apples.

92
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,970
   

93
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,430
And implicitly, there's not
going to be a fractional

94
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,980
number of apples
in the basket.

95
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,840
You can't pick up a
piece of an apple.

96
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,450
So this is going to have to be
an integer, the number of

97
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,140
apples, right?

98
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,020
So if 2/5 times some number is
going to be an integer, then

99
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,020
this number has to be
divisible by 5.

100
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,140
It makes sense, you know?

101
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,810
If there are 10 fruit,
then this is going

102
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,640
to be equal to 4.

103
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,040
If there are 20 fruit, then
this is going to be what?

104
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,740
What's 2/5 of 20?

105
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,350
It's going to be 8.

106
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,605
But if there were 6 fruit, or
if we thought the number of

107
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:28,860
fruit was 6, 2/5 times
6 is 12/5.

108
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,650
That means that there are
2 and 2/5 apples.

109
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,650
That's not right.

110
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,740
So what we have to find is the
number of fruit, and it has to

111
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,822
be some number divisible by 5.

112
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:40,140
And if you look at the choices,
they give you 20,

113
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,200
that's divisible by 5.

114
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,720
35 is divisible by 5.

115
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,840
Choice C, 52.

116
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,020
That's not divisible by 5.

117
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,100
And then the other two choices,
70 and 80 are

118
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,010
divisible by 5.

119
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,650
So only C is not
divisible by 5.

120
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,920
So that's our choice.

121
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,180
That could not be the number
of fruit in the basket.

122
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,260
And you could figure it out.

123
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,770
If there were 52 fruit, and 2/5
were apples, you'd get a

124
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,020
fractional number of apples.

125
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,740
And that's not cool.

126
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,990
Next problem.

127
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,080
   

128
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,590
Problem five.

129
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,960
A square and an equilateral
triangle have equal

130
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,130
perimeters.

131
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,740
If the square has sides of
length 3, what is the length

132
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,190
of one side of the triangle?

133
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:29,340
So a square and a triangle
have equal perimeters.

134
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,240
And the square has--
what does it say?

135
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,050
It has sides of length 3.

136
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,740
So 3, 3, 3, 3.

137
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,300
So what's this perimeter?

138
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,020
It's 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3.

139
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,010
That's 12.

140
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,500
Perimeter is 12.

141
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,420
Well, this triangle is also
going to have a perimeter of

142
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:50,050
12, but it's going to have it
amongst 3 equal sides, right?

143
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,140
Because there's only 3
sides of a triangle.

144
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,315
So it's going to have 12 divided
by 3, so it's going to

145
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,640
have to be 4, 4, and 4,
so one side of the

146
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,750
triangle has length 4.

147
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,100
That's choice C.

148
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,400
   

149
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,134
Problem six.

150
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:10,930
We'll do it here.

151
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:18,540
If x is equal to negative 1 and
k is greater than 0, which

152
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,110
of the following has
the greatest value?

153
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:29,080
OK, so choice A is 2
times k times x.

154
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,550
So k is positive, x is minus
1, so this is going to

155
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,230
be less than 0.

156
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,890
So this is going to be a
negative number, right?

157
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,860
And so we know that's probably
not going to be the answer.

158
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,740
So if we look at all of the
choices, the only positive

159
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,650
answers, the only positive
choices, are going to be the

160
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,280
ones where I raise x to an
even exponent, right?

161
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,840
Because if I raised x to an odd
exponent, like let's see,

162
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,195
choice C, choice C
is 6k x cubed.

163
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:02,600
And that's equal to 6k times
minus 1 cubed, right?

164
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,980
Because x is minus 1.

165
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,530
So that's going to
be minus 6k.

166
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,220
And we know k is a
positive number.

167
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,440
I mean, really, you could just
ignore the k's, really.

168
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,580
k is just a positive number.

169
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,700
It's just kind of a
scaling factor.

170
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,050
And they all have k in them.

171
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,660
So you just have to worry about
the coefficient in the x

172
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,850
terms. So one thing we can--
if x has an odd exponent on

173
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,440
it, it's going to be a negative
number, so that's not

174
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,990
going to be the greatest
value.

175
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,560
So there are only two that
have x with a-- so

176
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,260
you have 4k x squared.

177
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,690
That's choice B.

178
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:40,900
And then you have choice D,
which is 8k x to the fourth.

179
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,230
Well, in both of these cases,
x squared is equal to 1.

180
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,950
Negative 1 squared is 1.

181
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,170
Negative 1 to the fourth is
also equal to 1, right?

182
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,020
And if k is positive,
what's bigger?

183
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,710
8k or 4k?

184
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,930
Well, 8k is going
to be bigger.

185
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,420
As I said, they all have k in
them so you could kind of

186
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,310
ignore k because it's
a positive number.

187
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,000
So the answer is choice D.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,860
I'll see you in the
next video.
