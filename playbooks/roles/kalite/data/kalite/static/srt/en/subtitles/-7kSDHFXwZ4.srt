99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we've been discussing this amazing second paragraph of the declaration of independence

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where we've gotten through what past is for the first two sentences and we've also used some punctuation here

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then they're going on to say that when any form of government becomes destructive of these ends

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
its the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
laying its foundations on principles as organizing

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
its powers in such forms as to them shall seem most likely to affect their

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
safety and happiness

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and just to make sure that I.. cuz they've been writing.. uh, they get a bit ornated.. and its not very clear but this sentence

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is a little bit ornate but when they write that when any form of government becomes destructive of these ends

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they're talking again of the life, liberty and persuit of happiness

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right.. in other words if you have a king whose taken away people's lives, liberty and the persuit of happiness

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so they;re talking about the English government not just

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the parliament but the king nail has become destructive

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of these inalienable rights that they were supposed to protect

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and therefore form a new government to affect their safety and happiness

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right.. but most importantly its the right of the people to alter or abolish

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it.. in other words they're saying something thats not yet been accepted by history which is you're people and if you dont like your government

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can overthrow it. We hadnt had so many revolutions in on the past 200 years leading up to that and this is the beginning of an age of revolution

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where people say "oh yeah.. we have the right to abolish our government".. woah thats holy cow people doing it

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not another king not another ruler.. right

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
exactly most of history I mean for 100 years leading up to this document
