1
00:00:00,435 --> 00:00:02,944
"You are given two dice to roll.

2
00:00:02,944 --> 00:00:07,069
One is black with six sides, the other is white with four sides."

3
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:10,471
So a 4-sided die is kind of a pyramid looking thing.

4
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:15,271
And it has exactly 4 sides. So it would be a pyramid with a triangular base.

5
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:20,429
"For a given roll, what is the probability that the dice add up to 10?

6
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:26,071
If it helps, you may select the matching outcomes below. Your selections aren't checked with your answer."

7
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:27,486
So this might look a little bit strange at first.

8
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,032
You're like: "what is this triangle?".

9
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:33,317
This triangle is the face of the 4-sided die.

10
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:37,297
That is facing you. This is the roll of the 4-sided die.

11
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:41,297
And so this is a roll of "1" and "1" so these clearly are not adding up to 10.

12
00:00:41,297 --> 00:00:42,963
So let's think about all the ones that add up to 10.

13
00:00:42,963 --> 00:00:47,804
This adds to 2, this adds up to 3, this adds up to 4.

14
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:50,213
This adds up to 5.

15
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:52,438
Let's see what actually adds up to 10. So...

16
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:58,271
Clearly if we get a 4 and a 6, that's going to add up to 10.

17
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:02,212
And are there any other possibilities that add up to 10?

18
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:06,630
Well, the highest possible roll I can get on the 4-sided die is a 4.

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,536
So that's my best scenario - that's the highest possible roll.

20
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:14,670
And even if I get that, I still need the highest possible roll on the 6-sided die.

21
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,804
So this is the only scenario that adds up to 10.

22
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:20,296
You can look at any of these other ones, and they'll add up to something less than 10.

23
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:25,880
So there's one possibility that satisfies our constraint: "the dice add up to 10".

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,630
And how many total, equally likely, possibilities were there?

25
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,738
Let's see: this grid is shows all the equally likely possibilities.

26
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:36,787
This is 1-2-3-4 times 1-2-3-4-5-6.

27
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:40,779
There are 24 equally likely possibilities, and that comes from:

28
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:45,056
you have 6 possibilities from the 6-sided die times

29
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:49,801
4 possibilities from the 4-sided die, gives you 24 equally likely possibilities.

30
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:56,661
Only 1 satisfies the constraint that the dice add up to 10.

31
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:59,459
Let's do a few more of these.

32
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,060
"You are give two six-sided dice to roll.

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,459
For a given roll, what is the probability that the dice add to 6?"

34
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,260
So here we have the tops of both of my dice.

35
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,626
And what are all the scenarios where the dice add up to 6?

36
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:18,134
Well.. let's think about this.

37
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:22,594
If I have a 1 and a 5, that's going to add up to 6.

38
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:26,328
In this entire column, that's the only way that I add up to 6.

39
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:28,394
Right over here, let's see..

40
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:33,265
If I have a 2 on the black die, then I need 4 on the white die.

41
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:34,860
To add up to 6.

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,431
If I have a 3 on the black die, I'm going to need a 3 on the white die to add up to 6.

43
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:43,011
If I have a 4 on the black die, I'm going to need a 2 on the white die.

44
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:45,795
If I have a 5 on the black die, I'm going to need a 1 on the white die.

45
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:50,127
And then if I have a 6 on the black die, it is actually impossible that the sum will be exactly 6.

46
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,860
There is no 0 on the white die.

47
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,527
So none of these meet the constraint.

48
00:02:54,527 --> 00:03:00,997
So, here I have 1-2-3-4-5 possibilities where my dice add up to six.

49
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:06,080
So I have 5 possibilities out of a total of 36 equally likely ones.

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,996
This is a 6 by 6 grid, and it comes from 6 possibilities

51
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:11,329
for 1 die times 6 possibilities for the other die.

52
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:18,594
So 5 possibilities satisfy my constraint out of a total of 36.

53
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:22,194
Let's do one more, this is actually a lot of fun.

54
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:26,596
"You are given two six-sided dice to roll.

55
00:03:26,596 --> 00:03:31,378
For a given roll, what is the probability at least one die is a 6?"

56
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,448
At LEAST ONE die is a six?

57
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:39,493
So, let's see. We just have to look for all of the situations where at least one of the dice is a six.

58
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:44,609
So, that one, that one, every time I see a six, I should just click on it.

59
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,402
That one... that one..

60
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:50,088
and then obviously, all of these scenarios right over here.

61
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:52,827
So these are all the scenarios where at least 1 of the dice is a 6.

62
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:55,593
Here, of course, is where both of the dice are 6.

63
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:57,194
So, how many scenarios are there?

64
00:03:57,194 --> 00:04:03,261
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-11.

65
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:09,260
So there are 11 possibilities out of a total of 36 equally likely ones.

66
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,827
Remember: 6 x 6. There's 36 equally likely outcomes.

67
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:15,572
So, let's check our answer.

68
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:19,000
And we got it right!
