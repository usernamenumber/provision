In this video i wanna expose you to a special class

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of mirrors called "PRABOLIC MIRRORS" or " PARABOLIC

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
REFLECTORS"

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We need a parabolic mirror and i'll draw cross-section of one

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right here...

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if you are familiar with algebra they are essentially

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the cross section ,the cross section is in the shape of a parabola !

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me draw a parabolic mirror right here.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is the shape of a parabola

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what we need about a parabolic mirror and i'm not g

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
gonna go into the math right here

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
jus gonna give you the general idea

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me just draw its principal axis, so this is kind of the line of

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
symmetry of the parabola

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is its principal axis right over here and it divides it
