1
00:00:00,646 --> 00:00:06,144
The idea of Nash equilibrium is important enough but I think it deserves it's own video.

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:12,574
And you may never know it's name for John Nash, who's played by Russel Crowe in the movie of Beuatiful Mind.

3
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:18,659
And it's a game-theoretical concept and you know game theory sounds very fancy but it really is just theory of

4
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:23,768
games. In this Prisonner's dilemma, that we have talked about in the previous video, really is a game.

5
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:29,507
Different players have different strategies and based on the intearacting strategies, you can adopt in different states

6
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:34,834
and you can put different outcomes. And here's a definition of Nash equillibrium from Princeton.

7
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:39,476
That's a good place to get a definition, because that's were John Nash spent a good bit of his career.

8
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:45,973
And it's defined or this definition - it's a stable state of a system, but involved several interacting participants in

9
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:55,112
our Prisoner's dilemma. We had 2 participants in which no participant can gain by a change of strategy as long

10
00:00:55,112 --> 00:01:02,645
as all the other participants remain unchanged. So let's think about the different states of this system right

11
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:10,065
over here and think of wheter any of them meet this criteria. So let's say, let me number this one, let's say

12
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:22,513
that is state 1, this is state 2, this is state 3, and this is state 4 right over here. So if we're sitting in state 1

13
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:29,315
can any of the participants change the strategy, can gain by changing the strategy assuming that other

14
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:37,449
participants just constant. So if we're sitting here in state 1 right over here, so Al is denying and Bill is denying.

15
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:47,234
But Al can improve his situation by changing his strategy. He can go from denying, which is a scenario here

16
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:54,309
to confessing. So Al can change his strategy and gain or you could gain the other assuming Bill was consent into

17
00:01:54,309 --> 00:02:04,571
deny or you can go the other way. If we're sitting in state 4 and we assume all is consent Bill can improve his

18
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:11,990
situation by going from deny to confession. We can go from 2 year to 1 year. So for both of those reasons if I

19
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:22,240
do this true but this would not be Nash equilibrium but both of those are true so this is definitely not a Nash equillibrium.

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,508
I give 2 examples in which A participant can gain by change of strategy as long as the other participant

21
00:02:28,508 --> 00:02:35,578
remains unchanged. This move was one example and this is a move by Al, what Bill's deny to consent.

22
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:45,171
This was a move by Bill what Al's deny to consent. Not a Nash equillibrium. Now let's think about state 2.

23
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:59,434
If we're sitting in state 2 can assuming Bill is constant can Al change to improve his outcome. In state 2 Al is

24
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:07,067
only getting 1 year. If Al goes from confession to deny he's going to get 2 years. So Al cannot change his

25
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:16,211
strategy and get again here. So sofar it's looking good. But let's think from a Bill's point of view. So if we're in

26
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:24,977
state 2 right over here and we assume Al is constant can Bill do something that changes things. We're sure

27
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:30,846
Bill can go from denying to confessing. If he goes from denying to confessing he goes from 10 years

28
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:37,511
in prison to 3 years in prison. So I give an example of a participant who can gain by change of strategy

29
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:42,142
as long as all other participants remain unchanged. Both of them don't have to be able to do this.

30
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:48,106
You just need one of them for to not to be Nash equillibrium. Because Bill can have again

31
00:03:48,106 --> 00:03:55,505
by change of strategy holding Al's strategy constant. So holding Al's strategy in the confession -

32
00:03:55,505 --> 00:04:03,581
that is not a Nash equillibrium. Because you have this movement can a curve to a more favourable

33
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:13,225
state for Bill holding Al constant. Now let's go to state 3. Let's think about this. So for in state 3, so this is

34
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:20,392
Bill's confessing and Al denying, so let's first think about Al's point of view. If we assume Bill is constant

35
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:27,168
in his confession can Al improve his scenario. We're sure he can go from denying which is what have to be

36
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:34,507
about we're in state 3 to confessing. So he can move in this direction right over here. And that by self is

37
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:39,641
not enough evidence this is not a Nash equillibrium. We don't need to think about Bill, that's the metric,

38
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:43,819
we actually nothing that Bill can do in this scenario holding Al constant. That could improve things

39
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:49,105
Bill would not go from here to here but just by the fact that Al can go from here to here holding Bill

40
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:57,146
constant tells you that this is not a Nash equillibrium. Now let's go to scenario 4 and you know where this

41
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:04,888
is going as you watch the last video. But now it's going to a little bit in more detail. In state 4 they're both

42
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:11,476
confessing. Now let's look at from Al's point of view and we're holding Bill constant. We're holding Bill

43
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:18,476
unchanged. So we stay in this corn, we assume that Bill is confessing. From Al's point of view if we're

44
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:23,438
in state 1 can he change his strategy to get better outcome? But the only thing he can do is go

45
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:30,725
from confession to deny but that is not going to be good. He going to get 3 to 10 years. So Al cannot

46
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:36,060
gain by change of strategy as long as all of the participants remain unchanged. Now let's think about

47
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,973
from Bill's point of view. We're in this state right over here we're going to assume that Al is constant.

48
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:49,180
That Al is in the confession mode so Bill right now in state 4 is confessing his only option is to deny.

49
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,733
But by doing that he will go from 3 years in prison to 10 years in prison. So he's not going to gain so he too

50
00:05:55,733 --> 00:06:02,509
cannot gain so we've just found a state, in state 4 which no particapants can gain by change of strategy as long

51
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:08,733
as all participants remain unchanged. And this part is important because we're not saying that both can

52
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:15,311
change simultaneously. You were not in this pay-off matrix allowing a diagonal move. And so no participant

53
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:27,644
can gain neither Al nor Bill holding the other one constant. This is a Nash equillibrium. This one right here

54
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:31,000
and this is a stable state.
