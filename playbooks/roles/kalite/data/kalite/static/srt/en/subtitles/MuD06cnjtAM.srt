1
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:08,157
Well, there's the head,

2
00:00:08,157 --> 00:00:09,690
And elbow.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,503
I see a knee and a finger pointing up.

4
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:14,976
And a shin and a foot.

5
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:16,228
And another foot.

6
00:00:16,228 --> 00:00:22,292
We're looking at the remains of a colossal marvel representation of the emperor Constantine.

7
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:28,521
And this colossal sculpture was originally, we think, about 40 feet high, so really big.

8
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:35,589
And it would have filled this extraordinary space at the end of the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine.

9
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:43,541
This was a very large public space, right here on the Forum and at the end of it was a rounded area,

10
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:48,557
A niche and the sculpture was found there, so we think, it was meant for that space.

11
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:54,142
Michelangelo is the one who actually brought it up to the Capitoline Hill which was the ancient government's center.

12
00:00:54,142 --> 00:01:02,590
Constantine is certainly a Roman emperor but he is the last pagan Roman emperor and the person who really ushers in Christianity

13
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,360
And all the changes that will take place in Italy and in former Empire.

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,804
Well, and he moves the capital of the Empire to Constantinople, the city of Constantine, all the way in East,

15
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:19,508
And so in a way begins the decline of the city of Rome that we see happen in the Middle Ages.

16
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:23,056
So maybe, it's no so inappropriate that we see him in fragments in the city.

17
00:01:23,056 --> 00:01:23,638
Maybe not.

18
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:28,757
I find this portrait so interesting, we think his body had a core of wood and mud brick,

19
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:33,836
And maybe was covered in gilded bronze. We're not really sure.

20
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:38,628
But I find him so different-looking than other images of emperors.

21
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:43,353
Well, you know this is a really interesting stylistic moment when we think about ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

22
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:49,678
I think most people just think of the high classical moment and all of its naturalism.

23
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:54,904
We're talking about a long period of time in the classical era and styles change there also.

24
00:01:54,904 --> 00:02:03,410
If you think about the history of Roman emperors and their images, you often see a combination of realism and idealism,

25
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,409
So that the citizens of the Roman Empire could identify that particular emperor,

26
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:12,342
So we know what Hadrian looked like, or Trajan looked like, or Vespasian looked like.

27
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:16,559
Right, there has to be enough specificity, so you can say: Ah, that's my emperor!

28
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:21,196
Exactly, but at the same time, they were idealized to greater or lesser extends,

29
00:02:21,196 --> 00:02:29,641
And thereby recalled ancient Greek sculptor and by idealizing them they were made to seem divine or god-like.

30
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:33,697
But here Constantine doesn't look like either of those traditions to me.

31
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:39,635
Well, this was a moment of a real transition. It's not a shift between a kind of a really high-pitch naturalism

32
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,822
That can actually capture the characteristics of an individual's face

33
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:47,528
And kind of idealism. This is actually a kind of abstraction of the human body.

34
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:55,068
There's something abstract and I think about the overall shapes of his eyes where we have a sense of them being reduced

35
00:02:55,068 --> 00:03:02,290
To geometric shapes the way that his eyebrows form the semi-circles around the ovals of his eyes.

36
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:09,383
There's something that looks geometric about not only his face but his hair and maybe this is

37
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:16,071
A sign of moving toward that symbolic way of representing that we see with the beginnings of Christianity.

38
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:23,182
I think it's impossible to untangle it from the rise of Christianity because of our subsequent knowledge

39
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:29,670
Of what will happen and I think we perhaps don't know enough about the subtle shifts in Roman style.

40
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:38,109
But my understanding is that there was also different kind of representation for different strata of society.

41
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:47,110
And that one could recall that in sort of imperial past, one could recall the more intellectual pursuits of the Greeks

42
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:55,438
Through kind of naturalism but one might speak to the here and now and the broader population through a greater degree of abstraction.

43
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:01,877
A few figures that look to us as disproportionate maybe stocky and stiff in their movements

44
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:06,544
Without the lovely Contrapposto that we see in ancient Greek and Roman Art.

45
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:12,802
So he seems to be looking beyond us and not really in the here and now

46
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:18,207
And maybe in that way too there's some suggestion of the Christian and heavenly.

47
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:20,540
Well, certainly of his divinity.
