1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,750
I've talked a lot about how our
change in internal energy

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,830
of a system can be due to some
heat being added to the

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,530
system, or some work being added
to the system, or being

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,840
done to the system.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,700
And I'm going to write it again
the other way, just

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,900
because you see it both ways.

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,370
You could say that the change
in internal energy could be

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,900
the heat added to the
system minus the

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,500
work done by the system.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,820
So there's two questions
that might naturally

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,000
spring up in your head.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,250
One is, how is heat added to or
taken away from a system?

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,000
And how is work done, or done
by, or done to a system?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,370
The heat, I think, is
fairly intuitive.

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,720
If I have a-- and we'll be a
little bit more precise in the

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,510
future of this, but I just want
to give you the sense of

18
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,500
what we're talking about-- if I
have some system here, some

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,560
particles in some type
of a canister.

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,650
And it's at temperature, I don't
know, let's say it's a

21
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,820
temperature T1.

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:10,170
I'll even give it a-- say
it's at 300 kelvin.

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,860
If I want to add heat to this
system, what I can do is I can

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,010
place another system right
next to it, maybe

25
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,900
right next to it.

26
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,610
Who knows what size it is.

27
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,280
And it's got some
particles there.

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,610
But its temperature is much,
much, much higher.

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,620
   

30
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,095
So this system's temperature,
I'll say temp T2 is equal to,

31
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:39,210
I don't know, let's say
it's 1000 kelvin.

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,810
I'm just making up numbers.

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,900
So what's going to happen in
this situation, you're going

34
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,880
to have heat transferred from
this second system to the

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,560
first system.

36
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,780
So you're going to have heat
going into the system.

37
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,870
Now, heat and, work and even
internal energy, this goes

38
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,290
back to our conversation
of macrostates versus

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,240
microstates.

40
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,620
Heat is changing the macrostate
of our systems.

41
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,120
This system is going to
lose temperature.

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,750
This system's going to
gain temperature.

43
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,110
But we know what's happening
on a micro level.

44
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,650
These molecules are going
to lose kinetic energy.

45
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,665
These molecules are going
to gain kinetic energy.

46
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,600
How is that actually
happening?

47
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,040
Well, we assume that there's
some type of a container here.

48
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,170
Maybe it's a solid wall.

49
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,320
These molecules are going to
bump into that wall, and are

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,260
going to make the particles in
that wall vibrate, and then

51
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,350
they're going to make the
particles in the green

52
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,150
container's walls vibrate.

53
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,860
And so when the green
container's molecules touch

54
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,960
the wall, they're going to
bounce off with even more

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,250
kinetic energy, with even more
velocity, because of that

56
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,300
vibration in the wall will push
them back even further.

57
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,090
So that's essentially how you
get this transfer of kinetic

58
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,690
energy, or this transfer
of heat.

59
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,820
I think that's fairly
intuitive.

60
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,240
If we put this next to a cooler,
a system with lower

61
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,330
temperature, we would
lose kinetic energy,

62
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,120
or would lose heat.

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,390
And there's other ways
that we can do it.

64
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,580
We could compress the-- well,
I don't want to talk about

65
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,050
that just now, because that'll
be touching on work.

66
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,740
So, how can we add or subtract
work to a system?

67
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,420
And this one's a little
bit more interesting.

68
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,255
Let's go back to our
piston example.

69
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,185
   

70
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:14,280
Let me just draw some
lines here.

71
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,680
So I have my container.

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,580
There you go.

73
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,240
It's got a little movable
ceiling to it.

74
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,930
That's my piston.

75
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,150
And go back to the example.

76
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,530
Because what we're going to be
dealing with-- especially once

77
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,810
I go into the pressure volume
diagram, the PV diagram that

78
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,610
I'm about to go into--
we want to deal with

79
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,270
quasi-static processes.

80
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,440
Processes that are always close
enough to equilibrium

81
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,990
that we feel OK talking
about macrostates like

82
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,110
pressure and volume.

83
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,020
Remember, that if we just did
something crazy and the whole

84
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,040
system is in flux,
those macrostates

85
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,260
aren't defined anymore.

86
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,140
So we want to do a quasi-static
process.

87
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,660
So I'll have pebbles instead
of one big rock.

88
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,280
I'll draw the pebbles a little
bigger this time.

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,270
And I have some pressure.

90
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,250
So that's my piston and
it's being kept

91
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,120
down by these rocks.

92
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,430
It's being kept up by the
pressure of the gas.

93
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,700
The gas is bumping into
this ceiling.

94
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,770
It's bumping into everything.

95
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,310
The pressure at every point in
the container is the same.

96
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,110
It's at equilibrium.

97
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:21,300
Now, what happens in that
example where I removed one

98
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,350
rock from that?

99
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,445
So let me copy and paste that.

100
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:29,270
So if I remove one rock from
this thing right here.

101
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,130
   

102
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,000
Copy and paste.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,910
So that's the same thing.

104
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,060
Now let me remove a rock.

105
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,900
I'll remove this top
one, was removed.

106
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,220
What's going to happen?

107
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,150
Well I now have less weight
pushing down on the piston,

108
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,600
and I have a certain amount
of pressure pushing up.

109
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,620
The system, it'll very
temporarily go out of

110
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,220
equilibrium, but it'll be a very
small difference in how

111
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,120
much we're pressing down on it,
so hopefully it won't be a

112
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,940
huge change in our
equilibrium.

113
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,500
We'll stay pretty close to it.

114
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,790
But we know from the previous
example, instead of this thing

115
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,390
flying up, it's going to
shift up a little bit.

116
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,300
This is just going to shift
up a little bit.

117
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,690
Right when we do it it's going
to be like that, right there.

118
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,150
And let me fill in that part
with black, because it's not

119
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,553
like the space disappeared.

120
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:26,450
So let me fill that
in right there.

121
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,570
So our little piston will move
up a very small amount.

122
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,040
And what I claim is, when this
happened, when I removed this

123
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,110
little pebble from here, the
system did some work.

124
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,010
And let's just think
about that.

125
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,800
So work, according to the
definitions that you learned

126
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,810
in first-year physics, and when
you're using classical or

127
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,200
dealing with classical
mechanics, you learn that work

128
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,160
is equal to force
times distance.

129
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,780
   

130
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,910
So if I'm claiming that when
this piston moved up a little

131
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,570
bit, when I removed that pebble,
I'm claiming that this

132
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,420
system here did some work.

133
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,820
So I'm claiming that it applied
a force to this

134
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,200
piston, and it applied
that force to the

135
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,160
piston for some distance.

136
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,660
So let's figure out what that
is, and if we can somehow

137
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,380
relate it to other macro
properties that we know

138
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,890
reasonably well.

139
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,940
Well we know the pressure
and the volume, right?

140
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,760
We know the pressure that's
being exerted on the piston,

141
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,070
at least at this
point in time.

142
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,750
And what's pressure?

143
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,845
Pressure is equal to
force per area.

144
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:42,720
   

145
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,420
Remember, this piston, you're
just seeing it from the side,

146
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,630
but it's a kind of a flat plate
or a flat ceiling on top

147
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,800
of this thing.

148
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,330
And at what distance
did it move it?

149
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,860
You know I could blow
it up a little bit.

150
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,980
It moved it some-- I didn't draw
it too big here-- some x,

151
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,230
some distance x.

152
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,800
   

153
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,520
So this change, it moved it up
some distance x there, right?

154
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,640
So what is the force that
it pushed it up?

155
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,300
Well, the force, we know
its pressure, the

156
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,720
pressure's force per area.

157
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,550
So if we want to know the force,
we have to multiply

158
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,020
pressure times area.

159
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,370
If we multiply both sides of
this times area, we get force.

160
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,620
So we're essentially saying
the area of this little

161
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,025
ceiling to this container right
there, you know, it

162
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:34,060
could be, I could draw with some
depth, but I think you

163
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,800
know what I'm talking about.

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,032
It has some area.

165
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:39,870
It's probably the same area as
the base of the container.

166
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,450
So we could say that the force
being applied by our system--

167
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,280
let me do it in a new color--
the force is equal to our

168
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:57,580
pressure of the system, times
the area of the ceiling of our

169
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,470
container of the piston.

170
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,950
Now that's the force.

171
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,080
Now what's the distance?

172
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,390
The distance is this
x over here.

173
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,680
The distance is-- I'll do it
in blue-- it's this change

174
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,090
right here.

175
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,510
I didn't draw it too big,
but that's that x.

176
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,850
Now let's see if we can
relate this somehow.

177
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,190
Let me draw it a little
bit bigger.

178
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,035
And I'll try to draw in
three dimensions.

179
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:21,650
So let me draw the piston.

180
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,100
What color did I do it in?

181
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,460
I did it in that brown color.

182
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,480
So our piston looks something--
I'll draw it as a

183
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,300
elipse-- the piston
looks like that.

184
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,679
And it got pushed up.

185
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,130
So it got pushed up
some distance x.

186
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,669
Let me see how good
I can-- whoops.

187
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,400
Let me copy and paste
that same--

188
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,503
So the piston gets pushed
up some distance x.

189
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:51,711
Let me draw that.

190
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,217
It got pushed up some
distance x.

191
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:56,900
   

192
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,930
And we're claiming that our--
oh sorry, this is the force.

193
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,180
Sorry, let me be clear.

194
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,700
This is the force, and
this is the distance.

195
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,650
So work is equal to our force,
which is our pressure times

196
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:16,670
our area, times the distance.

197
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,870
I want to be very
clear with that.

198
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,990
Because when I wrote this I
said, OK, the force that we're

199
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,430
applying is the pressure we're
applying, times the area of

200
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,670
our cylinder.

201
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,620
This is the area of our
cylinder right here.

202
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,130
That's the area of our
cylinder right there.

203
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,880
So if you do the pressure
times this

204
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,610
area, you get the force.

205
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,940
And then we moved it
some distance x.

206
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,800
Now, we could rearrange this.

207
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,230
We could say that the work is
equal to our pressure times

208
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,480
our area, times x.

209
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,660
What's this?

210
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,620
What's this area, this area
right here, times x?

211
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,420
Well that's going to be our
change in volume, right?

212
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,530
This area times some height
is some volume.

213
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,090
And that's essentially how
much our container

214
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,210
has changed in volume.

215
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,060
When we pushed this piston up,
the volume of our container

216
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,760
has increased.

217
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,610
You can see that, even looking
from the side.

218
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,760
Our rectangle got a
little bit taller.

219
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,500
When you look at it with a
little bit of depth, you see

220
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,450
the rectangle also didn't
get taller.

221
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,240
We have some surface area.

222
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,560
Surface area times
height is volume.

223
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,840
So this right here, this
term right here,

224
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,820
is a change in volume.

225
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,000
So we can write work now in
terms of things that we know.

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,220
We can write work done
by our system.

227
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,985
Work done is equal to pressure
times our change in volume.

228
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:46,840
   

229
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,560
Now this has a very interesting
repercussion here.

230
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,800
So we could-- actually many--
we can rewrite our internal

231
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,050
energy formulas.

232
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,970
So, for example, we can write
internal change and internal

233
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,640
energy is now equal to heat
added to the system, plus the

234
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,565
work-- let me say minus the
work done by the system.

235
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:12,450
   

236
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,430
Well what is the work
done by the system?

237
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,010
Well it's the pressure of the
system times how much the

238
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,990
system expanded.

239
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,470
In this case, the system is
pushing these marbles, or

240
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,940
these pieces of sand up.

241
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,470
It's doing work.

242
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,140
If we were doing it the other
way, if we were adding the

243
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,430
sand, and we were pushing down
on our little canister, we

244
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,300
would be doing work
to the system.

245
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,460
So this is the situation where
I'm doing here, where I'm

246
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,880
removing the sand and the piston
goes up, essentially

247
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,300
the gas is pushing up on
the piston, the system

248
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,880
is doing the work.

249
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,000
So if we go back to our little
formula, that internal energy

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,170
is heat minus the work done by
a system, so done by, then we

251
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,430
can write this as, this is equal
to the heat added to the

252
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:05,460
system minus this quantity, the
pressure of the system,

253
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,565
times the change in volume.

254
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:11,020
And it's interesting, if the
volume is increasing, then the

255
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,520
system is doing work.

256
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,230
And this applies-- we're going
to talk a lot more about

257
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,640
engines in the future-- but
that's how engines do work.

258
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,410
They have a little explosion
that goes on inside of a

259
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,580
cylinder that pushes up on the
piston, and then that piston

260
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,150
moves a bunch of other stuff
that eventually turns wheels.

261
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,850
So the volume increases, you're
actually doing work.

262
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,590
So I'm going to leave you
there in this video.

263
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,470
In the next video, we're going
to relate this, this new way

264
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,780
of writing our internal energy
formula, and we're going to

265
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,050
relate it to the PV diagram.

266
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,267
