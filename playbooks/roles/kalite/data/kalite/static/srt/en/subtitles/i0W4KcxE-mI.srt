1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,910
   

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,120
We're on problem 79.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,360
A small business owner must hire
seasonal workers as the

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,760
need arises.

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,950
The following list shows the
number of employees hired

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,600
monthly for a five-month
period.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,090
OK, so we hired 4 in the first
month, 13 in the second

8
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,110
month and so on.

9
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,480
If the mean of these data--
remember, data is plural.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,520
I always say this data, but if
they correctly say if the mean

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,210
of these data is approximately
7.

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,710
So the mean is the
average, right?

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,640
So they're saying the average
of these numbers is 7.

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,270
Fair enough.

15
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,070
If you add all of these up and
divide by 5, you'll get

16
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,290
approximately 7.

17
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,190
What is the population standard

18
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,580
deviation for these data?

19
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,780
So, with population-- I'll make
a statistical playlist

20
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,020
one day where I talk about
the difference between a

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,990
population, standard deviation,
and a sample

22
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,320
standard deviation
and all that.

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,880
But the population standard
deviation, just you have an

24
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,890
intuition, it's a measure of,
on average, how far are each

25
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,300
of these numbers
from the mean?

26
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,940
And it's not exactly the average
of how far they are

27
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,640
from the mean, but I'll show
you that in a second.

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,410
It's actually the square root of
the average of the squared

29
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,970
distances of how far each of
these are from the median.

30
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,310
And that might sound crazy for
a second, but when you

31
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,220
actually work it all out
the math isn't too bad.

32
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,250
So what we'll do first is
figure out the variance.

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,020
   

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,960
That's the notation
for the variance.

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,820
And the standard deviation
actually is just the square

36
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,870
root of this.

37
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,880
So if you have the variance,
it's very easy to figure out

38
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,410
the standard deviation.

39
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,090
But the variance-- and just to
give you the intuition-- it's

40
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:37,940
equal to the average
of the squared

41
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:44,070
distances from the mean.

42
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,180
   

43
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,730
So essentially I say, OK
how far is 4 from 7?

44
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,510
Oh it's 3 away.

45
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,206
And I square it.

46
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:54,410
I say, OK, the squared
distance is 9.

47
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,620
The squared distance here,
let me figure it out.

48
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,040
So let's actually
write them down.

49
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,240
Let me actually calculate it.

50
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,910
So I'll do it here.

51
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,790
4 minus 7 is minus 3.

52
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,220
If I were to square
that, I'd get 9.

53
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,520
So the square of the distance
from 4 to 7 is 9.

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,280
So that's a squared distance.

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,750
So the squared distance
from 13 to 7.

56
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,820
See, they're 6 apart.

57
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,040
You square them.

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,610
And because we're squaring it
doesn't matter if we do 7

59
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,100
minus 12 or 13 minus 7.

60
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,360
Because a negative times a
negative is a positive.

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,870
Anyway 13 minus 7 is 6.

62
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,760
That squared is 36.

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,930
Then I have 5 minus 7.

64
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,960
That's minus 2 squared
is equal to 4.

65
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,050
Then I have 6 minus 7.

66
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,410
That's negative 1.

67
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,930
Squared is equal to 1.

68
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,800
And then I have 9 minus 7.

69
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,520
That's 2.

70
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,330
Squared is equal to 4.

71
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,950
So the 9 is the square of
how far 4 is from 7.

72
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,630
36 is a square of how
far 13 is from 7.

73
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,020
So each of these are the squared
distances of each the

74
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,600
data points from the mean.

75
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,450
That's where we got
the 7 from, the

76
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,610
average of these numbers.

77
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,500
Now, we said the variance
is the average

78
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,720
of the squared distances.

79
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,210
So it's just the average
of these five numbers.

80
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,580
So what's the average of
these five numbers?

81
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,600
It's going to be 9
plus 36 is 45.

82
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,790
Plus 4 is 49.

83
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,900
Plus 1 is 50.

84
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,270
Plus 1 is 54.

85
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,300
So it's going to be 54 divided
by, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

86
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,570
Divided by 5.

87
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,610
So the variance is equal
to the average

88
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,960
of the squared distances.

89
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,710
And that's-- what?

90
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,870
10 and 4/5 is equal to 10.8.

91
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,720
So that's the variance.

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,160
They don't want the variance.

93
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,260
They don't want the population
variance.

94
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,490
They want the population
standard deviation.

95
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,320
Well that's just the square
of the variance.

96
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,990
And you can see, since you're
taking the square of the

97
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,090
square distances, it kind of
becomes close to the average

98
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,060
of the real distances.

99
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,690
But it's actually not that
and I don't want to

100
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,020
confuse you right now.

101
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,130
For the sake of this problem,
let's just take the square

102
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,580
root of this.

103
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,310
So the standard deviation
is just equal to the

104
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,640
square root of the.

105
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,250
Variance Which is equal to
the square root of 10.8.

106
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,560
And what is that?

107
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,420
Let's see, 3 squared is 9.

108
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,980
4 squared is 16.

109
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,830
So the square root of 10.8 is
going to be pretty close to 3.

110
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,160
Between 3 and 4 but
a lot closer to 3.

111
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,779
And if we look at all the
choices, the only one that

112
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,500
even comes close is this one.

113
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,050
I think if you actually found
the square root it's actually

114
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,180
very close to 3.3.

115
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,430
Next problem.

116
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,900
   

117
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,470
James found the mean and
standard deviation of the set

118
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,840
of numbers given above.

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,960
If he adds 5 to each number,
which of the

120
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,380
following will result?

121
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,640
All right.

122
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,370
If you add 5.

123
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,610
The mean will be multiplied
by 5.

124
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,090
No, no, no.

125
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,810
That's not right.

126
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,170
Because if you add 5 to each
of these numbers, the mean

127
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,990
will just become 5 bigger.

128
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,400
You're kind of just
shifting over the

129
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,030
center to some degree.

130
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,250
Where you're measuring the
center by the average over 5.

131
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,390
Actually I could even
show it to you.

132
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:00,110
If I said 3 plus 5, and I'm
going to add that to 6 plus 5

133
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,320
plus 2 plus 5.

134
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,010
I'm adding 5 to every number.

135
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,400
Plus 2 plus 5.

136
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,890
Plus 1 plus 5.

137
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,430
Plus 7 plus 5.

138
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,440
Plus 5 plus 5.

139
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,800
All of that divided
by-- there's, 1,

140
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,590
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 numbers.

141
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,780
All of that divided by 6.

142
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,080
This is the same thing as-- let
me write this-- if we, we

143
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,010
can get rid of parentheses.

144
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,300
All we're doing is adding.

145
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,350
So that's the same thing
as 3 plus 6 plus 2 plus

146
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,780
1 plus 7 plus 5.

147
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,640
I just took the first terms
in each of these.

148
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,160
   

149
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,380
Plus-- how many 5s do we have?

150
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,580
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

151
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,090
Plus 6 times 5.

152
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,540
All of that over 6.

153
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:02,470
Well, this is going to be equal
to 3 plus 6 plus 2 plus

154
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,520
1 plus 7 plus 5, over 6.

155
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,790
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

156
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,440
Plus-- what's 6 times
5 divided by 6?

157
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,610
Well that's just 5.

158
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,600
So this is the average of the
original set of numbers.

159
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,860
And now, when you add 5 to all
of them, the average of all of

160
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,730
them combined is just going
to be the original

161
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,330
average plus 5.

162
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,810
So you're just shifting the
average to the right.

163
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,590
So this is not right.

164
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,250
You're not multiplying
the mean by 5.

165
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,790
You're just adding
5 to the mean.

166
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,160
That's not right.

167
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,590
The standard deviation
will increase by 5.

168
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,040
Well, in the last video you
saw that the standard

169
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,300
deviation is the square
root of the variance.

170
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,130
But both of them are a measure
of the average distance of the

171
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,350
numbers from the mean,
or from the average.

172
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,720
So even if you shift everything
by 5-- the mean

173
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,680
shifts by 5, all the numbers
shift by 5-- their distances

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,580
from the mean aren't going
to change, actually.

175
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,760
The standard deviation actually
won't change.

176
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,530
So this isn't right.

177
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,900
The standard deviation
won't increase by 5.

178
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,500
These numbers aren't going
to become further

179
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,270
away from the average.

180
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,260
So that's not right.

181
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,420
The mean will not change.

182
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:07,870
Well, no.

183
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,400
We know that the mean
will change.

184
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
I just showed you that
the mean will

185
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,620
actually increase by 5.

186
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,220
When all the numbers have
increased by 5.

187
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,020
That's not right.

188
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,730
So we already know that D
is probably the answer,

189
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,540
but let's make sure.

190
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,090
The standard deviation
will not change.

191
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,140
Right.

192
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,040
In general, the average
dispersion, or how far on

193
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,180
average the numbers are away
from the mean, won't change.

194
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,650
All the numbers are going to
increase by 5 and the mean is

195
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,900
going to increase by 5.

196
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,090
So how far the numbers are from
the mean, their variance

197
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:35,880
won't change.

198
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,250
The square of their distances
won't change.

199
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,730
And if the variance doesn't
change, then

200
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,890
the mean won't change.

201
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,220
So the answer's definitely D.

202
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,550
And we're all done.

203
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,480
See you in the next playlist.

204
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,000
