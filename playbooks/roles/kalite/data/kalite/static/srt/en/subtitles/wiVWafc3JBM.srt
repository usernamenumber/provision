1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're now in the home stretch. We just need to evaluate

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this third surface integral, which is over in this top part

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of our little chopped cylinder over here. So let's try to think

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of a paramaterization- and let me just copy and paste this entire

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
drawing, just so that I can use it down below

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as I parameterize it. So let me copy it, copy...

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
...and then go all the way down here, and let me paste it.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Okay, that is our shape again, our surface,

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we go to the layer that I want to get on

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then let me start. Let me start evaluating it.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what we want to care about is the integral over surface three

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of z, ds.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In surface 3 here, we see that the x and y values essentially

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
take on all the x and y values inside of the unit circle,

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
including the boundary,

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that the z values are going to be a function of the x values.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We know that this plane, that this top surface right over here, s3,

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is a subset of the plane z, z is equal to 1-x.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a subset that's kind of above the unit circle in the x-y plane.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or kind of the subset that intersects with our cylinder

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and kind of chops it.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's think about x and y first.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So first, so x- let's think about it in terms of polar coordinates

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because that's probably the easiest way to think about it.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm going to re-draw kind of a top view,

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so I'm going to re-draw top view so that

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is my y-axis,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is my x-axis,

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the x's and y's can take on any value.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They essentially have to fill the unit circle.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you, if you were to kind of project

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this top surface down onto the x-y plane,

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you would get this Rn surface, that bottom surface,

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which looked like this.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It was essentially the unit circle,

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just like that.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm going to draw it a little bit neater than that,

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I can do a better job, so that'll be...all right.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me draw the unit circle as neatly as I can,

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so there's my unit circle.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so we can have one parameter

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that essentially says how far around

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the unit circle we're going,

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so essentially that would be our angle,

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and let's use theta,

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because that's, what, just for fun,

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because we haven't used theta

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as our parameter yet.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's theta, but if we had x's or y's,

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's just a function of theta and we had a fixed radius,

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that would essentially just give us the points

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the outside of the unit circle.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we need to be able to have all of the

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x-y's that are on the outside AND the inside of the unit circle.

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we actually have to have 2 parameters.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We need to not only vary this angle,

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but we also need to vary the radius.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we would want to trace out the outside of that unit circle,

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and maybe we would want to shorten it at little bit,

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then trace it out again.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then shorten it some more, and then trace it out again.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so you want to actually have a variable radius as well,

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so you could have how far out you're going.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You could call that r.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, for example, if r is fixed

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you change the ranges of theta

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then you would essentially get all of those points

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over there.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You would do that for all of the r's,

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and from r to zero, all the way to r1,

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you would essentially fill up the entire unit circle.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so let's do that.

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So r is going to go between 0 and 1,

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
r is going to go between 0 and 1,

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and our theta is going to all the way around.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So our theta is going to go between 0 and 2π.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is- let me write this down;

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I wrote 0 instead of theta.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Our theta is going to be greater than or equal to 0,

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
less than or equal to 2π,

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and now we're ready to parameterize it.
