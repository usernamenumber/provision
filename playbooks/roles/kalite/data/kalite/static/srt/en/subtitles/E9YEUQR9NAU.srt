1
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:04,733
Given "g" of "x" is equal to eight "x" plus two

2
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:08,533
find "g" of zero, "g" of negative five and "g" of

3
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,533
two "x" plus three

4
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:12,600
So all this is when they say "g" of "x" is equal

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,800
to eight "x" plus two. This is a function definition

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,200
They're saying you give me any "x"

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,933
and you input it into my function of "g"

8
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:24,200
and my function "g" will output

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,600
It will associate with with that number "x"

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,333
another number that happens to

11
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,600
be eight "x" plus two

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,600
This is one way to create an association,

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,267
it's going to associate. If you were to put,

14
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,467
If you were to put one here, if this "x"

15
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,000
is one, you're going to do eight times one

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,267
plus two. So you would associate one

17
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:42,933
through "g", you would assocate one with

18
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:46,800
eight times one plus two which is ten.

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,667
So, its just another way of creating an association

20
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,867
that you could do with sets of ordered pairs

21
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:53,000
or you could do it graphically. But this is one of

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,800
the most typical ways you that you will see a

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,333
function defined. It says look, input an "x"

24
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,267
over here and I'm going to output eight "x" plus two

25
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:03,467
So with that out of the way lets think about what

26
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:06,867
the "g" of zero is. "G" of zero literally just means

27
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,667
we're inputting zero into this function and this

28
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,800
function says, whatever your inputting, I'm going

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,467
output eight times that plus two. So "g" of zero

30
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:17,800
is going to be, let me write it this way, so it

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,267
becomes clear what I'm doing

32
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:23,000
"G" of zero is going to be eight times zero

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,733
eight times zero, eight times zero plus two, plus

34
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:31,800
plus two. So where ever we saw the "x"

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,333
we replaced it with whatever we're inputting

36
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,200
that is our "x" in this situation right over here

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,267
and so this is equal to eight times zero plus two

38
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,267
is just equal to two. So

39
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:45,267
"g" of zero is equal to two, let me just write that

40
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:47,933
right here "g" of zero is equal to two

41
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,133
Now lets try "g" of negative five

42
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:55,600
so let me write it this way "g" of... I'll write "g" of negative

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,133
five is equal to, I'll try to do the color coding

44
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,533
a little bit better this time. It's going to be equal

45
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:06,333
to eight times our "x" which in this case is negative

46
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:12,800
five, eight times negative five plus two, eight times negative five plus two

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
we're inputting a negative five and we're going

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
to output eight times negative five plus two

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,200
wherever we saw the "x" we just replaced

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,867
it with a negative five. And this is just equal

51
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:25,267
to eight times negative five

52
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:30,667
is negative forty plus two is equal to negative

53
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,933
thirty-eight. So I'll write this over here on the right

54
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:39,133
We have "g" of negative five is equal to

55
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:42,733
negative thirty-eight. Now this

56
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,133
last one is a little bit interesting,

57
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,267
So we just did this one,

58
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:49,400
now let's do "g" of... "g" of two "x" plus three.

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,267
So now they're not inputting a number, they're

60
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:52,533
inputting an expression

61
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,267
and what we have to do, everywhere where we see

62
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,333
a "x" here, we're going to replace it with that

63
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,467
expression. If I did "g" of a circle

64
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:02,467
Let me write this down, if I did "g" of

65
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:06,667
an orange circle, an orange circle right over here

66
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:10,267
By this function definition, by this function definition

67
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:12,600
if I'm inputting an orange circle, I should output

68
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,933
an orange circle eight times

69
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:18,600
the orange circle, eight times the orange circle

70
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,733
which doesn't make a lot of sense

71
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,000
but hopefully you get the idea that whatever you're

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,867
inputting you're just going to multiply it times eight and add two

73
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:27,800
so if we input two "x" plus three we're going to output

74
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
this times eight plus two

75
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,600
wherever we see an "x" we replace it

76
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,467
with this right over here. So let's try that out

77
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:38,800
so now we have "g" of

78
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,800
two "x" plus three, "g" of two "x" plus three

79
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,533
is going to be equal to...

80
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:47,533
is going to be equal to eight times whatever

81
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:50,067
we're inputting, eight times whatever were inputting

82
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,600
plus two. If we're inputting an orange, if this was

83
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,267
orange, we'd put an orange here, if this is a negative

84
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,867
five here we'd put a negative five here, if this is a zero

85
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:59,467
we'd put a zero here. In this case, we're inputting two "x"

86
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:03,000
plus three into our function, so we put two "x" plus three

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,333
where the "x" is right over there. So two "x" plus

88
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,733
three. Whatever we input this function says

89
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:10,400
multiply it by eight and add two

90
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,467
we're inputting two "x" plus three, multiply it by

91
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:15,733
eight and then add two, and so this is going to be equal

92
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,933
to, we just distribute the eight... we just distribute the

93
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:22,133
eight and you get sixteen "x" plus

94
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:25,267
twenty-four and you still have this plus two out over here

95
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:28,133
you still have this plus two out over here

96
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:32,067
so this is going to be equal to sixteen "x", sixteen

97
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:34,533
"x" plus these two, you add them up you get

98
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:37,333
twenty-six. So we can write over here and I'll do

99
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,267
that same color so to be consistent

100
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:43,467
We have "g" of two "x" plus three is equal to

101
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:47,400
sixteeen "x" plus twenty-six and we're done.

102
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,333
I know this can be confusing because you're

103
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,533
inputting, you're replacing "x"

104
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:53,400
with something that has "x" in it.

105
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,267
But you really should just view this as if

106
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:56,533
this were an orange ball or a star

107
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,600
or even if this had "y's" in it

108
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,533
Wherever you see an "x" you replace it

109
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,800
with whatever you are inputting it. So in every

110
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,867
instance we replace the "x" with two "x" plus three.
