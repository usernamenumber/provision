1
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,191
In this video we're going to explore a little about the cell membrane.

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:11,987
Just as a little refresher, Let's say this is a picture of our cell with a little tiny nucleus in the middle.

3
00:00:11,987 --> 00:00:16,539
Our cell membrane is what's on the outside of our cell.

4
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:21,236
So our cell membrane is what protects our cell from a really harsh outside environment.

5
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:28,424
If it weren't for the cell membrane we wouldn't be alive today because there would be nothing to protect us from the outside world.

6
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:33,721
We're going to talk about the main three things that make up the cell membrane.

7
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:38,305
The first Phospholipids The second Cholesterol and the third Proteins

8
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:45,399
The first one we're going to talk about and it makes up the majority of what's in our cell membranes are phospholipids

9
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,184
And just for the sake of time I've pre-drawn a picture of the cell membrane here.

10
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:56,919
And you'll notice that all of these individual pieces are phospholipids

11
00:00:56,919 --> 00:01:03,245
And a phospholipid looks like this. It has that polar head group, that polar phosphate group

12
00:01:03,245 --> 00:01:10,984
And it has two fatty acid tails. And so this is the way that we normally represent what a phospholipid looks like.

13
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:16,307
And in the cell membrane you see that these phospholipids are packed pretty closely, pretty tightly together.

14
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:21,657
all throughout the entire membrane. And we're looking at this membrane, this is kind of like a cross section

15
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:24,513
You can imagine that we've cut the membrane in half.

16
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:33,921
So what we have here is actually what we call our phospholipid bilayer. Sometimes it is also called the lipid bilayer

17
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:43,745
The second thing that we can find in our membrane is cholesterol. Now we often hear of cholesterol in foods and cholesterol in our blood

18
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:49,225
and we think it's a bad thing. But in this case cholesterol is actually very important for our cell membrane.

19
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:55,494
And cholesterol looks this this.. Again for the sake of time I've pre-drawn what cholesterol looks like.

20
00:01:55,494 --> 00:02:02,860
And you'll notice that cholesterol has a lot of rings. And this gives cholesterol a pretty stable structure.

21
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:09,661
And what cholesterol does is cholesterol kind of inserts itself between phospholipids, kind of like that.

22
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:13,198
And the way I think about it is cholesterol is kind of like a buffer.

23
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:21,747
It maintains the fluidity of our cell membranes. So as temperatures become lower, cholesterol will help to increase the fluidity.

24
00:02:21,747 --> 00:02:26,768
And as temperatures become higher, cholesterol will help reduce the fluidity of the cell membrane.

25
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:32,302
So cholesterol keeps our cell membrane in kind of a happy middle ground of fluidity.

26
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:36,316
And the third thing that makes up our cell membrane are proteins.

27
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:38,430
And proteins are actually a big one.

28
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,152
Depending on the cell, some cells will actually have a significant amount of protein in the membrane.

29
00:02:43,152 --> 00:02:46,754
And so proteins can take two major forms.

30
00:02:46,754 --> 00:02:52,927
The first is you can have a protein that crosses the entire membrane. We call this an integral protein.

31
00:02:52,927 --> 00:03:02,172
We also can call this a trans-membrane protein. And this can occur throughout different areas of the cell, like that.

32
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:07,632
And some proteins actually kind of sit on top of the membrane, like this.

33
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:12,565
Or they might sit on another protein, like that. And these are what we call peripheral proteins.

34
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:18,851
There are some very rare proteins that actually can go half way through the membrane.

35
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:26,670
And even rarer there are occasionally a few proteins that actually can be found inside the cell membrane.

36
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,820
Like this between the two phospholipids inside our bilayer.

37
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:41,281
Now proteins are very big player in the function of cell membranes. They actually carry out nearly all of the membrane processes that we can think of.

38
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:47,622
And the two biggest things that proteins do is, The first they can actually act as receptors.

39
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:53,099
So the proteins can actually tell the cell what's going on in the outside world. They act as communication.

40
00:03:53,099 --> 00:04:03,060
And the second thing that proteins can do, which generally occur in trans-membrane proteins, it that proteins can actually help transport molecules in and out of the cell.

41
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:15,309
So now that we know the function of proteins, why do you think proteins that are lipid bound, or bound within our lipid bilayer like this one here, is so rare?

42
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:21,683
Well it's because if the role of proteins is primarily to act as receptors, to communicate with our outside world

43
00:04:21,683 --> 00:04:27,683
or to act as transport to allow things to go from the inside to the outside or the outside to the inside.

44
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:32,861
The proteins that are kind of stuck in between don't have a really big role in our cell membrane.

45
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:41,070
And lastly there is one very important type of molecule that actually binds to our lipids or our proteins.

46
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,348
And these are carbohydrates. And we call these GLYCO for short.

47
00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:51,802
So they would be glycoproteins. Or they might be glycolipids.

48
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:55,394
And what these do is they play a big role in communication.

49
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:59,823
So, for example, it allows a cell to recognize another cell in our body.

50
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:06,145
If they play a role in communication in cells recognizing other cells, where do you think these sugars would go?

51
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:14,436
Well, these sugars would mainly occur on the outside of our membrane so they would kind of stick out on proteins.

52
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:15,938
These would be glycoproteins.

53
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:19,302
And they can be on peripheral or integral proteins.

54
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:25,177
Or they might stick out on lipids like this. And these would be glycolipids.

55
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:31,923
Now this is a little confusing to look at. What we have just drawn is a cross section of our cell membrane.

56
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:38,867
But what if we were looking at the cell membrane from the outside, kind of like a top view. What would that look like?

57
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:46,331
For the sake of time I've pre-drawn our phospholipid. So if we were looking at our cell membrane from the outside,

58
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:53,346
looking onto the top of the cell membrane, all we would see are these head groups of our phospholipids.

59
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:58,354
We might see some cholesterol in between our cell membranes like this.

60
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:07,721
And we might see some larger proteins that are on the top of our cell membrane like this scattered throughout our cell.

61
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:15,489
And lastly we might actually see some glycoproteins and glycolipids on the outside.

62
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:26,219
And these would attach themselves to our proteins and our phospholipids, like that.

63
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,103
So from the top, this is what our cell membrane would look like.

64
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:38,138
And you know something really special about this, this kind of looks like a piece of art.

65
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:45,530
So we think back to elementary school where we had the project where we would put a lot of beans or different macaroni together to create a piece of art

66
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:51,034
This kind of reminds me of that. So this is actually what we call a mosaic.

67
00:06:51,034 --> 00:07:00,083
So scientists kind of thought the same thing. And so they actually, so scientists actually named this model of the cell the Fluid Mosaic Model.

68
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:06,242
And so the mosaic portion of our cell can be described here.

69
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:14,103
Again you can see that there are a lot of different pieces, different colorful, different types of pieces put together to create this beautiful cell membrane.

70
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:20,813
But why do we call it fluid? Well the reason we call the cell membrane fluid

71
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:27,067
is because these pieces in our cell membrane can actually move around. They're not set in stone.

72
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:31,994
So the proteins and phospholipids in our cell membrane can move around like that.

73
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:37,667
This is why we call it fluid. What would that look like if we look at the cell membrane from the top?

74
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:43,104
Well the movement is actually not two dimensional like just up and down or just left and right

75
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:51,548
It can actually go in a lot of different directions. So our proteins can move all around the cell membrane and so can our phospholipids.

76
00:07:51,548 --> 00:08:00,255
So this is what we call the fluid mosaic model and this is a little bit of a fun fact.

77
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,579
This was only really discovered in 1972.

78
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:11,017
So it was only 40 years ago that we really figured out that our cell membrane was actually the fluid mosaic model.

79
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:16,523
So in summary our cell membrane is made up of three major things.

80
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:20,679
The first are phospholipids. These make up the most of the cell membrane.

81
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:25,036
And they are kind of like a basic building block for our cell membrane to exist.

82
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:33,470
The second are cholesterol. Our cholesterol is scattered randomly through our cell membrane and it helps maintain the fluidity of the cell membrane.

83
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:39,709
And the third are protein. And proteins carry out nearly all the essential cell membrane functions.

84
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:46,493
And together we call this our Fluid Mosaic Model because our cell membrane is made up of so many different things

85
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,347
and all these things are always moving around like a fluid.
