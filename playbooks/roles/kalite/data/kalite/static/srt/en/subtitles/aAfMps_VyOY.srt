1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,780
So just a bit of review.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,650
What happened from
2000 to 2004?

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,029
Actually I should really say,
from 2000 to 2006, because

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,700
that really was when the housing
bubble happened.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,270
Well financing got easier.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,640
Or essentially they lowered
their standards.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,230
And it got progressively easier
and easier and easier,

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,400
every year we went.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:36,630
So then that allowed more
people to bid on homes.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,110
So it increased the demand
artificially in certain ways.

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,670
Because we saw from that New
York Times article that

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,360
people's incomes weren't
increasing, and the population

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,160
wasn't increasing anywhere
near as fast

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,470
to soak up the supply.

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,110
So all it did is allow people
who were renting before, and

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,900
who couldn't save the money for
the down payment, now to

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,490
participate.

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:59,480
So now you had more people
bidding for the same house, to

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,550
bid up houses.

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,530
But that led to the
obvious question.

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,050
Why did financing get
easier and easier?

22
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,980
So let's go back to the good old
days, like the early '90s.

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,370
Or actually, let's go
even before that.

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,990
Let's go to the classic, what
happens to get a housing loan?

25
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,260
Well traditionally, if I
want to get a loan I

26
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,535
would go to my bank.

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,330
And that loan officer at the
bank, he's going to be giving

28
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,370
the bank's money for
your house, right?

29
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,210
He gives you money.

30
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,200
And you're going to pay
him interest. Right?

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,800
This is me.

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,390
And so that loan officer at the
bank, he really cares that

33
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,460
they're not going to lose money
on the transaction.

34
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,860
If he's going to give you $1
million, he wants to make sure

35
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,820
that no matter what happens, if
you lose your job, if you

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,750
get arrested, if you skip town,
that he's still going to

37
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,260
be able to get his
$1 million back.

38
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,630
And if you go back to our
equity and balance sheet

39
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,180
presentations, that's why, back
in the day, they made

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,480
sure that you put 20%, 25% down
payment on your house,

41
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,650
that you had a good credit
rating, that you had a good

42
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,660
steady income.

43
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,080
Because that banker, that
loan officer, was

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,890
going to be in trouble.

45
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,860
And his bonus was based
on how good the loans

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,770
he gave held up.

47
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,280
So that was the traditional
model.

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,190
What happened-- started to
happen the mid-90s, especially

49
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,760
in California, and then
nationwide in about 2001,

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,670
2002-- is you had what we call
a securitization of the

51
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,100
mortgage market.

52
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,170
And this, in all fairness, this
actually happened a while

53
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,230
before, with things like Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac.

54
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,830
And I'll do a completely
separate video on those.

55
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,000
But Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac essentially

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,390
had the same standards.

57
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,550
They had the standards of, we
call them, conforming loans.

58
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,740
I think the numbers -- you
have to have 20% down.

59
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,310
You have to have a certain
credit score,

60
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,550
certain steady income.

61
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,190
So Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
were these entities that might

62
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,420
buy the loan from your
local banker.

63
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,950
But their standards were just as
high as the local banker's.

64
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,110
And they were based -- I think
they were actually, they had

65
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,390
oversight by Congress.

66
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,050
So they weren't giving
away loans for free.

67
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,116
But I'll do a whole other
presentation on Fannie Mae and

68
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:12,140
Freddie Mac.

69
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,800
What you had happen in the late
'90s, and especially in

70
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,550
the early part of this decade,
is you had a whole industry

71
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,120
outside of the
government-sponsored entities.

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,550
The government-sponsored
entities are Fannie Mae and

73
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,510
Freddie Mac.

74
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,280
And this is essentially --
instead of you going to your

75
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,810
local bank for a loan -- this
is me again -- I would go to

76
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,700
my local mortgage broker.

77
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,400
Countrywide is the most
famous of them.

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,440
I think they're CFC.

79
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,840
That's their stock ticker.

80
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,380
They're not bankrupt yet.

81
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,630
So I would go to Countrywide.

82
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,010
And essentially I would
get $1 million from

83
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,170
them, a home loan.

84
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,470
I would get $1 million
from them.

85
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,520
And I'd agree to pay interest
to Countrywide.

86
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,890
But then Countrywide would do
this like, a million times.

87
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,600
So times a million, right?

88
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,670
They'll give home loans
to a million people,

89
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,120
put them all together.

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,320
And then they'll
sell the loans.

91
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,090
They'll sell the loans to like,
let's say, Bear Stearns.

92
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,060
So that's an investment bank.

93
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,420
Let's call it Bear Stearns.

94
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,890
Hope none of these
people sue me.

95
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,860
I guess they have bigger
troubles now, then wondering

96
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,579
about my YouTube videos.

97
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,620
They sell it to Bear Stearns.

98
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,070
And then Bear Stearns will
package a bunch of these

99
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,550
mortgages together, essentially
IOU's from people.

100
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,770
And then they would sell
those to investors.

101
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,980
Right?

102
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,540
So essentially, instead of
Countrywide being responsible

103
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,580
for my loan, my payments now
go to these investors.

104
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,380
And you could watch the--
that says investors.

105
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,190
I know my penmanship
is horrible.

106
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,030
But you should watch the videos
on mortgage-backed

107
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,530
securities and collateralized
debt obligations, if you want

108
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,800
to get a better understanding
of exactly how

109
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,080
the money flows go.

110
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,810
But the bottom line is, because
of this process,

111
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,150
what's happening?

112
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,860
Countrywide is just being
a transactional.

113
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,200
They're just doing the paperwork
for my loan.

114
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,920
They're temporarily
holding the loan.

115
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,780
And they're doing a little
bit of due diligence.

116
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,640
And in return for that, that
Countrywide mortgage broker

117
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,020
will just get a fixed fee for
doing that transaction.

118
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,000
Maybe they'll get like $5,000
for just doing the paperwork

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,090
for my mortgage.

120
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:26,570
Right?

121
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,160
And then Bear Stearns will
package a bunch of these

122
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,710
mortgages up-- and now it's
going to be in the billions--

123
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,320
and then repackage them and
sell them to investors.

124
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,700
In the process, Bear
Stearns gets a cut.

125
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,430
And Bear Stearns is doing
this for millions of

126
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,420
mortgages at a time.

127
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,580
It's in the billions of
dollars, and Bear

128
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,600
Stearns gets a cut.

129
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,570
So Bear Stearns essentially
just gets a fee, like the

130
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,180
mortgage broker.

131
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,630
Of course it's a huge fee.

132
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,290
And then the investors
are going to

133
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,766
get my interest payments.

134
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:55,670
Right?

135
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,220
And let's say if the interest
rates, if I'm paying 7%, and

136
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,710
the other million people are
paying 7%, the investors are

137
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,380
going to get 7% on
their money.

138
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,800
And that seems like a pretty
reasonable proposition.

139
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,960
And of course the investors
would care that the money that

140
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,950
they're essentially giving --
because they're giving money

141
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,520
to the investment bankers
who are giving money to

142
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,250
Countrywide.

143
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,100
And that's where my $1 million
is essentially coming from.

144
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,460
The only reason why the
investors would give their

145
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,490
money, is if they have a lot of
confidence that these are

146
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,580
really really good loans.

147
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,150
Well the investors, they
don't know who I am.

148
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,745
They don't know what my
job is, how likely I

149
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:28,540
am to pay the loan.

150
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,820
So the investors have to rely
on someone to tell them that

151
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,290
these are good loans.

152
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,410
And that's where the rating
agencies come in.

153
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,170
And these are Standard
& Poor's and Moody's.

154
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,720
And they rate these assets,
these mortgage-backed

155
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,530
securities.

156
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,100
And what they say is, well,
they'll look at this big

157
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,210
package of mortgages, these
million mortgages that Bear

158
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,300
Stearns has packaged together.

159
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,430
And they'll look at the
historical default rate.

160
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,320
And they'll say, wow, these
mortgages really haven't been

161
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,050
defaulting.

162
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,760
And you can think about
why they haven't.

163
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,590
Because housing prices
been going up.

164
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,060
So these mortgages really
haven't been defaulting.

165
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,770
There's a very high chance
you're going to be able to get

166
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,810
all your money back.

167
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,870
So we're going to give these
what they call, let's say they

168
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,920
say AAA rating.

169
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,730
So this investor, who knows,
it could be the

170
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,850
Central Bank of China.

171
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,880
It could be a hedge fund.

172
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,930
It could be a whole
set of people.

173
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,910
It might be the investment
banks themselves.

174
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,630
Sometimes they actually
bought these just to

175
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,090
make some extra money.

176
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,270
These investors, they don't know
who actually borrowed the

177
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,330
money, or what kind of credit
rating they had, or anything.

178
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,170
But they just took
a leap of faith.

179
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,320
They said well, Standard
& Poor's or

180
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,650
Moody's did the work.

181
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,320
They're telling me that this
is AAA, which means the

182
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,430
highest level of debt.

183
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,490
Or you know, whatever
they told them.

184
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,140
Maybe it was A.

185
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,860
I forget all the different
qualities of debt.

186
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,280
But they just took their
word for it.

187
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,525
And they got their 7% interest
on their money-- whatever it

188
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,000
was, 6% money.

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,210
And that worked out
pretty well.

190
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,020
And so these guys, they liked
the fact that they were

191
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,790
getting the 7%.

192
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,220
They said, this is a
good asset class.

193
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,150
So then they funneled
even more money.

194
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,680
So then there were even more
investors that wanted do this.

195
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,620
They're like, this is great,
with very little risk I'm

196
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,930
getting a pretty good
return on my money.

197
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,160
That's better than putting
it in the bank.

198
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,960
That's better than buying
Treasury Bills, right?

199
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,790
So then even more
money flowed in.

200
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,220
Well, more money wanted to
invest in people's mortgages.

201
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,130
But Countrywide would say, well,
we're already giving

202
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,300
mortgages to all the
people who qualify.

203
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,860
So in order to actually find
more people who want mortgages

204
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,480
from us, we'll just
have to lower the

205
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,770
standards a little bit.

206
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,400
Right?

207
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,080
And we can lower the standards,
because we find

208
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,130
even when we do lower the
standards, no one's defaulting

209
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,100
on their mortgages.

210
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,350
And in the next video, I'll
maybe give a little bit more

211
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:42,610
[? color ?]

212
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,250
why.

213
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,190
So Countrywide will issue even
more mortgages, and give them

214
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,210
to these investors with
even lower standards.

215
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,050
Of course, the mortgage
brokers at

216
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,880
Countrywide, they love it.

217
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,300
Because every time they do a
transaction, they just get

218
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,730
some money.

219
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,800
And then they give the mortgage
to the investment

220
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,850
banker, which packages
them up and then

221
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,810
sells them to investors.

222
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,490
So they get it off
their hands.

223
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,350
And they just got the fee.

224
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,100
So they just collect
the big cash.

225
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,430
The investment banks
love it, right?

226
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,120
They just love doing the
transactions, because they get

227
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,380
more and more money every time
they do the transactions.

228
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,530
And for the moment, the
investors seem pretty happy,

229
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,960
because they keep giving money
into this system, so to speak.

230
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,840
Even though they might be
reading the newspaper and

231
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,450
seeing that the standards
are going down.

232
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,240
But they're consistently
getting their return.

233
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,575
And because the defaults were
very low over this time period

234
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:29,950
-- and I'll explain in the next
video why the defaults

235
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,520
were very low -- they felt that
they were getting a good

236
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,460
return, maybe 6% or 7%, on
investments that had very,

237
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,300
very low risk.

238
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,680
So in the next video, I'll
explain why the defaults were

239
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,400
very low in that time period.

240
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,030
See you soon.

241
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Time period: 2000-2006

242
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1.Main years of the Housing Bubble in the U.S., 2. Availability and cost of credit declined immensly.

243
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Eaiser for people to obtain Mortage credit.

244
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Increased Demand by increaeing the number of investors per home. Wasn't artifical, it was a mispricing

245
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of credit, by the private financial system. Aided by Fed Low interest rate Monetary Policy.
