1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,950
I'll now do a couple of more
momentum problems.

4
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,060
So this first problem, I have
this ice skater and she's on

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,630
an ice skating rink.

6
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,360
And what she's doing is
she's holding a ball.

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,740
And this ball-- let me draw
the ball-- this is a 0.15

8
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,990
kilogram ball.

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,610
   

10
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,580
And she throws it.

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,640
Let's just say she throws it
directly straight forward in

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,200
front of her, although
she's staring at us.

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,230
She's actually forward
for her body.

14
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,790
So she throws it exactly
straight forward.

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,075
And I understand it is hard to
throw something straight

16
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:38,490
forward, but let's assume
that she can.

17
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,510
So she throws it exactly
straight forward with a

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,280
speed-- or since we're going to
give the direction as well,

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,000
it's a velocity, right, cause
speed is just a magnitude

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,200
while a velocity is a magnitude
and a direction-- so

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,160
she throws the ball at 35 meters
per second, and this

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,160
ball is 0.15 kilograms.

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,560
Now, what the problem says is
that their combined mass, her

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:17,520
plus the ball, is 50 kilograms.
So they're both

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,130
stationary before she does
anything, and then she throws

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,990
this ball, and the question is,
after throwing this ball,

27
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,000
what is her recoil velocity?

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,930
Or essentially, well how much,
by throwing the ball, does she

29
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,230
push herself backwards?

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,060
So what is her velocity in
the backward direction?

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,340
And if you're not familiar with
the term recoil, it's

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,600
often applied to when someone,
I guess, not that we want to

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,250
think about violent things, but
if you shoot a gun, your

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,830
shoulder recoils back,
because once

35
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,900
again momentum is conserved.

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,270
So there's a certain amount of
momentum going into that

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,020
bullet, which is very light
and fast going forward.

38
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,940
But since momentum is conserved,
your shoulder has

39
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,780
velocity backwards.

40
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,250
But we'll do another
problem with that.

41
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,960
So let's get back
to this problem.

42
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,410
So like I just said, momentum
is conserved.

43
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,760
So what's the momentum at the
start of the problem, the

44
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,289
initial momentum?

45
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,690
Let me do a different color.

46
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,730
So this is the initial
momentum.

47
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,060
Initially, the mass is 50
kilograms, right, cause her

48
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,110
and the ball combined are 50
kilograms, times the velocity.

49
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,810
Well the velocity is 0.

50
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,800
So initially, there is 0
velocity in the system.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,060
So the momentum is 0.

52
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,430
The P initial is equal to 0.

53
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,560
And since we start with a net 0
momentum, we have to finish

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,880
with a net 0 momentum.

55
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,030
So what's momentum later?

56
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,730
Well we have a ball moving at
35 meters per second and the

57
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:58,040
ball has a mass of 0.15
kilograms. I'll ignore the

58
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,710
units for now just
to save space.

59
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,930
Times the velocity
of the ball.

60
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,060
Times 35 meters per second.

61
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,930
So this is the momentum of the
ball plus the new momentum of

62
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,020
the figure skater.

63
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,060
So what's her mass?

64
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,440
Well her mass is going
to be 50 minus this.

65
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:21,550
It actually won't matter a ton,
but let's say it's 49--

66
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,330
what is that-- 49.85 kilograms,

67
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,180
times her new velocity.

68
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,040
Times velocity.

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,410
Let's call that the velocity
of the skater.

70
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,890
So let me get my trusty
calculator out.

71
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,910
   

72
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,640
OK, so let's see.

73
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:50,780
0.15 times 35 is
equal to 5.25.

74
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,260
So that equals 5.25.

75
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:02,350
plus 49.85 times the skater's
velocity, the final velocity.

76
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,550
And of course, this equals
0 because the initial

77
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,930
velocity was 0.

78
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,000
So let's, I don't know, subtract
5.25 from both sides

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,200
and then the equation becomes
minus 5.25 is equal to 49.85

80
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,279
times the velocity
of the skater.

81
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,480
So we're essentially saying that
the momentum of just the

82
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,380
ball is 5.25.

83
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,480
And since the combined system
has to have 0 net momentum,

84
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,660
we're saying that the momentum
of the skater has to be 5.25

85
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,960
in the other direction, going
backwards, or has a momentum

86
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,230
of minus 5.25.

87
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,480
And to figure out the velocity,
we just divide her

88
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,780
momentum by her mass.

89
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,380
And so divide both sides by
49.85 and you get the velocity

90
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,695
of the skater.

91
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:50,725
So let's see.

92
00:04:50,725 --> 00:05:01,520
Let's make this a negative
number divided by 49.85 equals

93
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,370
minus 0.105.

94
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:15,520
So minus 0.105 meters
per second.

95
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,270
So that's interesting.

96
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,370
When she throws this ball out at
35 meters per second, which

97
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,670
is pretty fast, she will
recoil back at about 10

98
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,440
centimeters, yeah, roughly 10
centimeters per second.

99
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,530
So she will recoil a lot
slower, although

100
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,740
she will move back.

101
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,350
And if you think about it, this
is a form of propulsion.

102
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,790
This is how rockets work.

103
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,120
They eject something that maybe
has less mass, but super

104
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,500
fast. And that, since we have a
conservation of momentum, it

105
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,740
makes the rocket move in
the other direction.

106
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,550
Well anyway, let's see if we
could fit another problem in.

107
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,600
Actually, it's probably better
to leave this problem done and

108
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,760
then I'll have more time for the
next problem, which will

109
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,515
be slightly more difficult.

110
00:05:58,515 --> 00:05:59,765
See you soon.

111
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:00,150
