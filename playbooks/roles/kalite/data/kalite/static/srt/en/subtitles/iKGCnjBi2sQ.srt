1
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:08,302
1913 was a banner year for Léger.

2
00:00:08,302 --> 00:00:11,068
It was the year in which he figured out

3
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:13,458
how to become a Léger,

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:17,103
instead of a follower of Picasso or Braque.

5
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:19,219
He did a large series of paintings

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,629
entitled "Contrast of Form."

7
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,745
Each of these examined the ways in which

8
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:26,698
these basic primary and secondary colors

9
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:29,165
could be put together with black and white

10
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:32,200
in order to make a canvas that, like music,

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,894
could be appreciated without having to "read it"

12
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:39,438
as a certain kind of scene or narrative.

13
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:42,109
"Contrast of Forms," what does that tell you?

14
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:42,890
Not a whole lot.

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,026
So what he's not telling you, very deliberately,

16
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:49,335
is that this painting would have been figures.

17
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:52,290
And you see these kind of mechanical shapes --

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,908
almost like manikins or tin men --

19
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:56,319
that form these vertical stacks --

20
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:57,840
very much like bodies.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,765
Like any painter at that time,

22
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:01,222
Léger would have had

23
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:03,660
training from life to do anatomy.

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,959
Now he's trying to put that behind him --

25
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,428
trying to turn what might be a rather calm image

26
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:15,775
into one that almost seems like a snapshot caught

27
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,971
at an accident moment in mid-motion.

28
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:21,792
He wants you to look at this painting as a painting.

29
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:24,840
He leaves so much of that burlap canvas

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,552
blank and raw.

31
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:30,257
Those pigments on it, they feel kind of crusty

32
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,495
and almost like they're put there --

33
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:35,098
not by a painter with a fine brush --

34
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:36,919
but somebody applying things

35
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,992
in a much more rugged way --

36
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:40,877
in a much more hands-on way.

37
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:43,915
The white is applied almost like chalk --

38
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:46,883
it's so rough -- to make this picture pop.

39
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:50,320
An offsetting "contrast" as Léger knew,

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,921
to these reds and blues, yellows and greens,

41
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:54,489
that would have been unthinkable

42
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,547
in painting a mere ten years before this.

43
00:01:57,547 --> 00:02:01,980
I bet you when this painting was put on view in 1913,

44
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,250
most of the viewers would have thought,

45
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,248
"When is the painter going to come along

46
00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:09,392
and turn this sketch into something that's actually

47
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:11,812
a final product?"
