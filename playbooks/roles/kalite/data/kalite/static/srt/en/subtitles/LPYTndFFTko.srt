Conflict theory is a way of studying society

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that focuses on the inequalities

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of different groups in society.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is based on ideas of Karl Marx in the 19th century

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who believed a society evolved

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
through several stages.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The most important which were:

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Feudalism, Capitalism and finally Socialism.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
19th century Europe was a capitalist society

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where rich upper class called "Bourgeoisie"

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were minority of the population

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and poor lower class

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
called "Proletariat" were majority.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now you may think that majority would have

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
more sway over the society

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it was actually Bourgeoisie

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that had the power.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They owned the factories

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that produced everything people needed

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they sold what they produced

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to earn living.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Proletariat only had their labour to sell

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to make a living and

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they were dependent on factory owners to get paid.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But this wasn't just one side of dependence.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The factory owners were also dependent on workers

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to work in the factories though they've never admit it

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because they would lose some of their power.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There is a significant economic inequality

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
between factory owners and the workers.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It was this economic inequality that

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Marx believed would fuel change in society.
