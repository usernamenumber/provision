2
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:08,754
We're in the Museum of Modern Arts

3
00:00:08,754 --> 00:00:13,444
and we're looking at Edvard Munch's "The Storm", from 1893.

4
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:16,602
This is an amazing representation of something

5
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:18,924
both psychic and naturalist.

6
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:22,872
Yeah, external and internal, simultaneously.

7
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:26,099
The one thing that has really struck me about this painting

8
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,629
is how dark it is compared to "The Scream".

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,951
Which is the same here. There is such contrast.

10
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:35,109
It's interesting to think about dark and light, and external and internal.

11
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:41,285
If you look at the house - the lights inside are the only source of bright warmth.

12
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:44,025
I'm then drawn to the woman who's standing right in the front.

13
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:47,833
This is called "The Storm". They must be in the midst of a storm,

14
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:52,198
which we can tell if we look around and see the tree bending,

15
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:54,242
and their hair flying behind them.

16
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:57,632
They're standing right near a harbour...

17
00:00:57,632 --> 00:00:58,979
Right, or on the water's edge.

18
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:04,041
The painting was made in a small Norwegian seaside resort

19
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,595
that Munch frequented in the summer.

20
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:09,288
So all these women gathered together in this mob scene,

21
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:14,443
they all look really frantic, worried about their fishermen husbands out at sea.

22
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:16,997
They're not sure if their men are going to come back because of the storm.

23
00:01:16,997 --> 00:01:20,852
What do you make of the townscape? It's such an overwhelming presence.

24
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:23,592
The women are human anchors in the picture,

25
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:27,261
but there is something really animate about those houses.

26
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:30,860
Those windows look like eyes, kind of staring back at us.

27
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,507
The distance between those women and the house

28
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:35,782
is somehow psychologically really far.

29
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:40,194
The houses on the sides blur into the background,

30
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:41,945
and it almost looks like a twilight scene.

31
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:43,259
You know what it is?

32
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,535
It's the Northern Lights!

33
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:48,275
It looks... in the upper left there's a bit of green,

34
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:54,219
and it blends in the corner but it also calls your eye back to the center green of the trees.

35
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:58,909
I've seen pictures of the Northern Lights and those can be really green in the sky.

36
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,674
They look otherwordly.

37
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:05,272
It looks like Munch is working on the emotion of the women.

38
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,779
And proto-Expressionism, too.

39
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:10,426
The Expressionist painters of Die BrÃ¼cke and Der Blaue Reiter,

40
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:15,535
both really looked to Munch in terms of guidance in terms of how brushstrokes

41
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,995
and mark making become an index of emotion.

42
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:21,595
You see that especially in the sky. You can actually feel

43
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:25,961
how his paintbrush moves back and forth, back and forth.

44
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:28,050
You can see that also in the women.

45
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,137
The gestural stroke that represents their hair flying off.

46
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:36,131
The woman in the center does anchor the picture now that I look at it more.

47
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:39,521
If you put your hand up to the image, and you take her form out,

48
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:41,286
the composition becomes unmoored.

49
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,094
She's the central figure in terms of the painted composition.

50
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:47,602
Everything swirls around that.

51
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:51,270
Psychologically, who knows how she linked to these other women...

52
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,961
All angst-ridden and worried, their looks similar to Munch's "Scream".

53
00:02:55,961 --> 00:03:03,391
They are bringing their arms up to their faces, gasping with expressions of fear and anxiety.

54
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:08,360
The woman in the center has the most easily readable bodily feature.

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,029
You can really see some sort of anxiety externalized.

56
00:03:12,029 --> 00:03:14,955
In an abstract way, too. You can see the gesture more,

57
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:19,645
and the white-clad solitary woman, whereas this clutch, their arms,

58
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:21,503
their facial features are indistinct.

59
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:23,453
It almost becomes an abstract picture.

60
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,704
If you take out that piece, it's an abstract painting.

61
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:30,187
The rocks are all gathered up at the bottom of the painting,

62
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:31,580
on the right side, in the right corner.

63
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,924
And then look behind the wall that bears down the lane.

64
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,664
You can see the woman in the middle with the blue dress.

65
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:41,611
There's something that feels very claustrophobic, but also very open at the same time,

66
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:44,583
in the way that the composition is mapped out.

67
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,277
Munch is also pulling you in to the space.

68
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:50,806
He's using a very Renaissance technique of using the orthogonal

69
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:53,035
to bring us into that vanishing point.

70
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:54,522
It's an amazing painting.

71
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:56,855
