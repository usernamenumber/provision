1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,680
Our problem tells us that when
1.125 grams of a liquid

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,540
hydrocarbon, CxHy-- so we don't
know how many C's and

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,320
H's there are, so it's a mystery
liquid hydrocarbon.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,520
It was burned in an apparatus
like that shown in figure

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,470
4-7-- this is the apparatus,
this is our mystery

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,470
hydrocarbon getting burned, or
it's combusting with oxygen--

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,090
you need oxygen for the
combustion to occur.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,480
So when it burns in this
apparatus, and it burns with

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,890
oxygen, it tells us -- and we
have 1.125 of it to start

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,330
with-- it tells us that 3.447
grams of carbon dioxide and

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,360
1.647 grams of water
were produced.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,080
So let me write that reaction
right there.

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,360
So let me just write this first
sentence right here.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,100
Write all of the information
that they're giving us in that

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,910
first sentence.

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,000
They're saying that when we
start off with that liquid

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,350
hydrocarbon that has x C's and
y H's in it, and it's in its

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,670
liquid state, they say it's
a liquid hydrocarbon.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:13,960
And when we combust it using
oxygen in its gaseous state,

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:25,340
we will produce carbon
dioxide and water.

22
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,270
And you can't even really
realistically balance this

23
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,110
equation because you don't
know how many carbons and

24
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,060
hydrogens you have on
the left-hand side.

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,450
But what they do tell us is how
many grams of everything,

26
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,670
of at least this we start with,
and how many grams of

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,270
each of these we end up with,
and we're assuming that we

28
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,050
have an excess of oxygen.

29
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,290
That this hydrocarbon is
the limiting reactant.

30
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,730
   

31
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,860
We just have an abundance
of oxygen.

32
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,470
Just enough oxygen to turn all
of this hydrocarbon, to

33
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,970
combust all of it into carbon
dioxide and water.

34
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,970
And they tell us that we have
1.125 grams of the mystery

35
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:11,510
substance, and then it produces
3.447 grams of carbon

36
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:20,470
dioxide, and 1.647
grams of water.

37
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,180
Now to solve this-- well let me
finish reading the problem.

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,430
It tells in a separate reaction
or in a separate

39
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,100
experiment, the molar mass of
the compound was found to be

40
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,740
86.2 grams per mole.

41
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,970
So I'll write that down here.

42
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:44,200
So CxHy molar mass is equal to--
let me write it this way

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,300
instead just to go with the
convention that I've been

44
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:58,620
doing-- we have 86.2 grams of
our mystery substance, CxHy

45
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,140
per mole of our mystery
substance, CxHy.

46
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,890
And then they're asking us
in this problem, they say

47
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,220
determine the empirical and
molecular formulas for the

48
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,200
unknown hydrocarbon CxHy.

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,950
And just as a refresher,
empirical means just the

50
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:23,550
simplest whole number ratio of
the atoms in our molecule.

51
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,120
So the simplest ratio of our
carbons to hydrogens, or

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,220
hydrogens to carbons, will give
us the empirical formula.

53
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,610
The molecular formula is how
many carbons, exactly how many

54
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,370
carbons and hydrogens do
we have in each atom.

55
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,100
And I suspect we're going
to be able to use this

56
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,420
information to come up, once
we have the empirical

57
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,090
formulation, the empirical
formula, we then can use this

58
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,070
molar mass right here to
figure out the actual

59
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,950
molecular formula.

60
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,340
But let's figure out the
empirical formula first.

61
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,300
And the way we can do it is we
could say, well gee, how many

62
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,590
moles of carbon dioxide
we get produced, how

63
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,290
many moles of hydrogen?

64
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,040
And then we could say, well in
the final product, how many

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,530
moles of carbon do
we have then?

66
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,130
And how many moles of hydrogen
do we have there?

67
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,950
And then we can figure
out the ratio.

68
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,620
And the ratio of carbons to
hydrogens or hydrogens to

69
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,340
carbons in the product, that's
going to have to be the same

70
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,320
as the ratio in the reactants.

71
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,010
And they all came from this
reactant right there.

72
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,120
They didn't come
from the water.

73
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,570
And then hopefully we'll be
able to figure out the

74
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,950
simplest whole number ratio
of hydrogens to carbons or

75
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,180
carbons to hydrogens is.

76
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,740
That sounds very complicated I
think, but I think if we take

77
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,440
it step-by-step it
won't be too bad.

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,980
So a good place to start, let's
figure out how many

79
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,000
moles of each of these
substances we have. I'll start

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,580
off with the carbon dioxide.

81
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,260
So if I start off with the
carbon dioxide, what is the

82
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,450
molar mass of carbon dioxide?

83
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:53,990
So its atomic weight, carbon is
12 plus you have 2 oxygens,

84
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,480
so 2 times-- the atomic weight
of oxygen is 16, you could

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,870
look that up if you like--
but that's equal to

86
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,440
44 atomic mass units.

87
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,640
That's its atomic weight, which
is the weighted average

88
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,330
of all of the isotopes and
all of that business.

89
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,620
But if you have a whole mole of
carbon dioxide, 6.022 times

90
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,780
10 to the 23rd of these
molecules, then you're going

91
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,000
to have 44 grams of
the substance.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:30,680
So we have 44 grams of
CO2 per mole of CO2.

93
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,540
And if we want to figure out
how many moles we have with

94
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,690
us, we know that we're
starting off with

95
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:45,840
3.447 grams of CO2.

96
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,810
And we want to multiply this by
something that has grams of

97
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,580
CO2 in the denominator.

98
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,870
So we want to multiply it by
something that looks like

99
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,270
this-- and we want to turn
it into moles of CO2.

100
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,420
So it should have moles of
CO2 over grams of CO2.

101
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,740
Well that's the inverse
of this right here.

102
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,010
This is grams per mole, we
want moles per gram.

103
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:14,920
So instead of 44 grams per mole,
we have 1 over 44 moles

104
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,190
per gram, or for every 44 grams
we have 1 mole, for

105
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,550
every 1 mole we have 44 grams.
I just inverted this.

106
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,890
So let's multiply.

107
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,530
The grams of CO2 cancel out with
the grams of CO2, and you

108
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,890
are left with 3.447
divided by 44.

109
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,040
So let's figure out
what that is.

110
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,780
   

111
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:55,020
So you have 3.447 divided by 44,
which is equal to 0.07834.

112
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,450
So 7-8-3-4.

113
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,760
Let me remember that.

114
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,020
So that is 0.07834 moles
of CO2-- that's

115
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,270
our only units left.

116
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,370
   

117
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,320
Now let's figure out how many
moles of water we have. So I

118
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,920
could do the exact same thing
over-- let's see,

119
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,080
where should I do that.

120
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,900
Let me write it over here.

121
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,830
So let's do the water in
orange right here.

122
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:30,780
So we're starting off with
1.647 grams of H2O.

123
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,710
And what is water's
molar mass?

124
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,160
Same argument, its atomic mass
is-- each hydrogen is 1.

125
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,750
But you have 2 of them so it's
2 times 1 plus 16, which is

126
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,380
the atomic weight of oxygen.

127
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,910
So 2 times 1 plus 16 is 18.

128
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,470
That's also its molar mass.

129
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:59,810
You could say 18 grams of
H2O per mole of H2O.

130
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,330
Now to convert this, the amount
of grams we have to

131
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,810
moles, what we want to do is
multiply it by something that

132
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,890
has moles in the numerator and
grams in the denominator.

133
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:18,600
We want grams of H2O in the
denominator and moles of H2O

134
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,930
in the numerator.

135
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,820
And that's the exact
inverse of this.

136
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,450
So if we have 18 grams per
mole, we have 1 over

137
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,310
18 moles per gram.

138
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,400
And what is this going
to be equal to?

139
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,549
So this cancels out with that,
so we're left with 1.647

140
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,006
divided by 18 moles of H2O.

141
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:42,549
Let me scroll over
a little bit.

142
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,780
Get the calculator out.

143
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,850
Clear it out.

144
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:56,360
And so we have 1.647 divided
by 18, which is 0.0915.

145
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,970
Let me do this in a new color.

146
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:06,310
We have a 0.0915 moles of H2O.

147
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,360
So so far we figured out in our
products how many moles of

148
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:17,770
carbon dioxide we have, and
how many moles of water.

149
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,520
Now, I said we want to figure
out the ratio of hydrogens to

150
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,700
carbons or carbons to hydrogens
to figure out the

151
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,630
empirical formula right here.

152
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,800
And to do that we can say hey
look, all of the carbons and

153
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,590
the hydrogens in our products,
they all had to come from our

154
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,420
mystery hydrocarbon.

155
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,100
So if we can figure out the
ratio of hydrogens to carbons

156
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,470
in our products, we'll know
the ratio of hydrogens to

157
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,490
carbons in our reactants.

158
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,470
Because they all had to come
from this guy right here.

159
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,890
The oxygen, obviously, had no
hydrogens and carbons in it.

160
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,950
So all of these hydrogens
and carbons came

161
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,520
from our mystery substance.

162
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,450
So how many moles of
carbon do we have?

163
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,390
How many moles of carbon do we
have in the carbon dioxide, in

164
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,600
our products?

165
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,470
Well the only product with
carbon is the carbon dioxide.

166
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,660
This has no carbon in it.

167
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:12,200
So if we have this many carbon
dioxides, we also have the

168
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:22,830
same number of carbon atoms,
moles of atomic carbon.

169
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,780
And you might say hey,
that's just a number.

170
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,870
This is saying 0.07 times 6.022
times 10 to the 23rd

171
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,760
times that huge number.

172
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,690
A mole is just a number-- very
important to remember.

173
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,120
So this means we have the
same number of carbons.

174
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,060
And if we have that many
waters, how many

175
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,670
hydrogens do we have?

176
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,680
Well for every water molecule
we have 2 hydrogens.

177
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,960
So we're going to have twice
as many hydrogen atoms.

178
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,780
So let's multiply
that times 2.

179
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:57,670
So times 2 is equal to 0.183.

180
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:03,600
So we have 0.183.

181
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,980
I could even put a trailing 0,
because we actually had-- well

182
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,680
I think I lost the significant
digit here.

183
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,890
I could have put a
zero right there.

184
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,360
But anyway, I won't worry
too much about that.

185
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,300
0.183 moles of atomic hydrogen,
because for every

186
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,710
water molecule we have
2 hydrogens.

187
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,610
So I just took this number
and multiplied by 2.

188
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:29,630
And now let's figure out the
ratio of hydrogens to carbons,

189
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,260
and that's pretty easy.

190
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,470
We just take a ratio
of that to that.

191
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:42,750
So the ratio of hydrogens to
carbons is 0.183 moles of

192
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:52,400
hydrogen in our product for
every 0.07834 moles of the

193
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,330
carbon in our product.

194
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,590
And somehow we have to make this
into some type of a whole

195
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,400
number ratio.

196
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,780
Let's see whether we can
do anything here.

197
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,560
Let's just divide this right
here and see what we get.

198
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,690
So if we just take-- well we
have the 0.183 there, so let's

199
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:20,600
divide it by 0.07834,
and you get 2.336.

200
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,410
So this is approximately equal
to-- I'll do a new color-- is

201
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:36,590
approximately equal to 2.336
moles of hydrogen for every 1

202
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,530
mole of carbon.

203
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,520
This doesn't look like that neat
of a ratio, but this is

204
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,790
pretty close to 1/3.

205
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,130
So maybe if we multiply the
numerator and the denominator

206
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,680
by 3 what do we get?

207
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,060
Well 3 times 2 is 6 and 3
times 1/3 is another 1.

208
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,670
So this will be 7.

209
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,590
7 moles of hydrogen.

210
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,850
I'm approximating it.

211
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,640
I'm trying to get to some
reasonable whole number.

212
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:11,350
7 moles of hydrogen for every
3 moles of carbon.

213
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,510
And this was a little
bit of an art to it.

214
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:18,890
I said OK, 2.33:1 or 2.336:1,
well gee, this looks like,

215
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,010
over here, this part of it looks
like if we multiplied

216
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,140
that by 3 we're going
to get pretty

217
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,330
close to a whole number.

218
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,670
So let me multiply the
numerator and the

219
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,040
denominator by 3.

220
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,990
That's kind of the art there to
recognize what do you have

221
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,590
to multiply this to turn
it into a whole number.

222
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,460
And if you don't believe me, we
could take that number and

223
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,720
multiply it by 3 and you get
something very, very, very,

224
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,820
very close to 7.

225
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,200
So that's enough for me.

226
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,100
So you're multiplying both by 3,
you get 7 moles of hydrogen

227
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,950
for every 3 moles of carbon.

228
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,610
And we've figured out our
empirical formula.

229
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,420
We have 7 hydrogens for
every 3 carbons.

230
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:55,640
Right?

231
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,710
If we have 7 moles, for every
3 moles that means we have 7

232
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,300
hydrogens for every 3 carbons.

233
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:13,430
And so the empirical formula of
our mystery hydrocarbon is

234
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:21,590
for every 3 carbons we
have 7 hydrogens.

235
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,960
Now the next thing we want
to figure is the

236
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,280
exact molecular formula.

237
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,740
The exact number of-- this is
just the minimum ratio.

238
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,400
But maybe we have 9 carbons
for every 21 hydrogens.

239
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,310
We don't know.

240
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,070
So let's use the other
information they gave us in

241
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:41,210
the problem where they told us
that the molar mass is 86.2

242
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:47,310
grams per mole-- this
information right here.

243
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,510
Let me copy that.

244
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,350
86.2-- that looks like
an 80, but we'll

245
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,060
remember it says 86.2.

246
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,540
So let me paste it over here.

247
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,250
That's what they gave
us in the problem.

248
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,190
So just for kicks, what would be
the molar mass if this was

249
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,120
the molecular formula?

250
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,910
So as it's written right now--
well there's a couple of ways.

251
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,440
We could do it algebraically
and all of that.

252
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,520
But the simplest way is to say
as it's written right now what

253
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,780
would be the molecular
mass of this?

254
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,140
Or the molar mass,
I should say.

255
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:29,580
So it would be 3 times
12, plus 7, times 1.

256
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:36,120
3 times 12 is 36 plus
7 is equal to 43.

257
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,710
So if this was the molecular
formula, its molecular mass

258
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,510
would be 43 grams per mole.

259
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,060
But they tell us in the problem
that the molecular

260
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,900
mass is 86 grams per mole.

261
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,110
So they're saying that the mass
is twice as much as this.

262
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,810
We must have twice as many
atoms in the same ratio.

263
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,660
So the molecular formula for
this-- we're in the home

264
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:09,560
stretch now-- the molecular
formula must have twice as

265
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,740
many atoms in the exact
same ratio.

266
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:27,180
So it must be C3H7 times 2, or
we could write that as C6H14.

267
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,590
So this is still a ratio
of 14:6, which is 7:3.

268
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,030
But using this information, we
were able to figure out the

269
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,320
exact number of carbons and the
exact number of hydrogens

270
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,230
in this molecule.

271
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,040
Anyway, hopefully you
found that fun.

272
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,400
