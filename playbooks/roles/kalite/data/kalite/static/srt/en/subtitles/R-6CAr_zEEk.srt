1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
In this first problem over here, we're asked to find out

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,980
the length of this segment, segment CE.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,626
And we have these two parallel lines,

4
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:10,732
AB as parallel to DE.

5
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:12,840
And then we have these two – essentially – transversals

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,440
that form these two triangles.

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,670
So let's see what we can do here.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,060
So the first thing that might jump out at you

9
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,100
is that this angle and this angle are vertical angles.

10
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,550
So they are going to be congruent.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,950
The other thing that might jump out at you

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,870
Is that angle CDE is an alternate interior angle with CBA.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,050
So we have this transveral right over here,

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,060
and these are alternate interior angles –

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,900
and they are going to be congruent.

16
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,170
Or you could say that if you continue this transversal,

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,020
you would have a corresponding angle

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,980
with CDE right up here.

19
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,550
And this one is just vertical.

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,510
Either way, this angle and this angle are going to be congruent.

21
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,910
So we've established that we have two triangles.

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,950
And they have two corresponding angles which are the same.

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,710
And that, by itself, is enough to establish similarity.

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,090
You can actually –

25
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,300
We actually could show that this angle and this angle

26
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,120
are also congruent by alternate interior angles.

27
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,010
But we don't have to.

28
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,070
So we already know that they are similar.

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,160
Actually, we could just say it just by alternate interior angles.

30
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,820
These are also going to be congruent.

31
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,670
But we already know enough to say that they're similar,

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,170
even before doing that.

33
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,130
So we already know that triangle.

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,250
I'll try to write it color coded, so that we have

35
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,730
the same corresponding vertices.

36
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,930
And it's really important to know what angles

37
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,750
and what sides correspond to what side,

38
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,400
so that you don't mess up your ratios,

39
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,560
or so that you do know what is corresponding to what.

40
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:47,720
So we know triangle ABC is similar to triangle –

41
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:52,220
So A – this vertex A – corresponds to vertex E over here –

42
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,710
Is similar to vertex E.

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,940
And then vertex B right over here

44
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:03,300
corresponds to vertex D, EDC.

45
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,150
Now what does that do for us?

46
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Well that tells us that the ratio of corresponding sides

47
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,870
are going to have the same.

48
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,470
They're going to be the same.

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,930
They're going to be some constant value.

50
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,710
So we have corresponding side

51
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,140
So the ratio for example, the corresponding side for BC

52
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,600
Is going to be DC

53
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,370
We can see it

54
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,340
Just for the way that we've written down the similarity

55
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,060
If this is true then BC is the corresponding side to DC

56
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:36,310
So we know that BC, the length of BC over DC

57
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,390
Right over here

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,550
Is going to be equal to the length of,

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,030
Well, we wanna figure out what CE is,

60
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,760
That's what we care about

61
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,650
And I'm using BC and DC cause we know those values

62
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,670
So BC over DC is going to be equal to

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,250
A coresponding side to CE

64
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,180
The corrresponding side over here is CA

65
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:07,230
Is going to be equal to CA over CE

66
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,550
Corresponding sides

67
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,470
This is the last and the first, last and the first

68
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,130
CA over CE

69
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,280
And we know what BC is

70
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,780
BC right over here is 5

71
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,520
We know what DC is

72
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,920
It is 3

73
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,270
We know what CA or AC is right over here

74
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,430
CA is 4

75
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,100
And now we can just solve for CE

76
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,430
So we can,

77
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,080
There's multiple ways that you can think about this

78
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,540
You could cross multiply and you get,

79
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,390
Which is really just multiplying both sides by both denominators

80
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,880
So you get 5 times the length of CE

81
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,080
Is equal to 3 times 4

82
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,550
Which is just going to be equal to 12

83
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,060
And then we get CE

84
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,550
CE is equal to 12 over 5

85
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,650
Which is the same thing as 2 and 2 fifths

86
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,020
2 and 2 fifths or 2 4

87
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,700
This is gonna be 2 and 2 fifths

88
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,740
And we're done

89
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,360
We're able to use similarity to figure out this side

90
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,950
Just knowing that the ratio between corresponding sides

91
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,320
Are going to be the same

92
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,800
Now let's do this problem right over here

93
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,280
Let's do this one.

94
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,440
Let me draw a little line here.

95
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,820
So this is a different problem now.

96
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:27,810
So in this problem we need to figure out what DE is

97
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,230
And we all once again

98
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,580
We have these 2 parallel lines like this

99
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,690
And so we know corresponding angles are congruent

100
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,490
So we know that angle is going to be congruent to that angle

101
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,750
Cause you could view this as a transversal,

102
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,330
We also know that this angle right over here

103
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,750
Is going to be congruent to that angle right over there

104
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,220
Once again, corresponding angles for transversal

105
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,080
And also in both triangles,

106
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,250
So I'm looking at triangles CBD and triangles CAE,

107
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,530
They both share this angle up here

108
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,110
So we've actually shown,

109
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,110
Once again, we could have stopped at two angles

110
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,250
But we've actually shown

111
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,440
that all three angles of these two triangles,

112
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,210
all three of the corresponding angles

113
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,500
are congruent to each other

114
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,780
So we now know,

115
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,610
And once again this is an important thing to do,

116
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,970
Is to make sure that you get

117
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,800
Is that you write it in the right order

118
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,870
when you write your similarity,

119
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:33,310
We now know that triangle CBD is similar

120
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,600
Not congruent,

121
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:46,560
It is similar to triangle CAE

122
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,190
Which means that the ratio of corresponding sides

123
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,460
Are going to be constant

124
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,330
So we know for example, that the ratio between CD

125
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,710
Is going to be the same

126
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,250
That the ratio between CB to CA,

127
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,980
Lets write this down,

128
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,500
We know that the ratio of CB over CA

129
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:14,340
Is going to be equal to the ratio of CD over CE

130
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,380
And we know what CB is,

131
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,140
CB over here is 5

132
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,010
We know what CA is

133
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,540
And we have to be careful here

134
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,140
It's not 3

135
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,570
CA this entire side is gonna be 5 plus 3

136
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,870
So this is going to be 8

137
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,680
And we know what CD is

138
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,740
CD is going to be 4

139
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,910
And so once again, we can cross multiply

140
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,420
We have 5 CE, 5 times CE is equal to

141
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,060
8 times 4

142
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,530
8 times 4 is 32

143
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:57,180
And so CE is equal to 32 over 5

144
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,500
Or this is another way to think about that

145
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,550
6 and 2 fifths

146
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,810
Now we're not done because they didn't ask for what CE is

147
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,950
They're asking for just this part right over here

148
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,060
They're asking for DE

149
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,270
So we know that this entire length, CE right over here

150
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,310
This is 6 and two fifths,

151
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,680
And so DE right over here,

152
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,160
what we actually have to figure out

153
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,440
It's going to be this entire length 6 and 2 fifths minus 4

154
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,480
Minus CD right over here

155
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,120
So it's going to be 2 and 2 fifths

156
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,320
6 and 2 fifths minus 4 is 2 and 2 fifths

157
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,490
So we're done

158
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,210
DE is 2 and 2 fifths
