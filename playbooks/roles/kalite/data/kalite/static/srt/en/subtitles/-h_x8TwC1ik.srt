1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
   

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,750
We now know how long the object
is going to be in the

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,500
air, so we're ready to
figure out how far

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,860
it's going to travel.

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,030
So we can just go back to kind
of the core formula in all of

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,140
really kinematics, all of kind
of projectile motion or

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,690
mechanical physical problems,
and that's distance is equal

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,940
to rate times time.

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,460
   

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,310
Now, we're talking about the
horizontal distance.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,170
So our distance is going to be
equal to-- what's our rate in

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,060
the horizontal direction?

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,960
We care about horizontal
distance traveled, so our rate

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,550
needs to be the horizontal
component of the velocity, or

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,190
the magnitude of the horizontal

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,400
component of the velocity.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,430
And we figured that out
in the first video.

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,540
That is s cosine of theta.

19
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,440
So let's write that
down right here.

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,610
So our rate is s cosine
of theta.

21
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,850
And how long will we
be traveling at

22
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,420
this horizontal speed?

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,930
   

24
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,240
Well, we'll be going at
that speed as long as

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,460
we are in the air.

26
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,780
So how long are we in the air?

27
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,630
Well, we figured that out
in the last video.

28
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,600
We're going to be in the air
this long-- 2 s sine of theta

29
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,210
divided by g.

30
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:29,870
So the time is going to be
2 s sine of theta over g.

31
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,170
So the total distance we're
going to travel, pretty

32
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,320
straightforward, rate
times time.

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,160
It's just the product
of these two things.

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,230
And we could put all of the
constants out front, so it's a

35
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,940
little bit clearer that it's
a function of theta.

36
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,730
So we can write that the
distance traveled-- let me do

37
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,360
that same green.

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,670
The distance traveled as a
function of theta is equal

39
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,790
to-- I'll do that
in this blue.

40
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,460
This s times 2s divided by g
is-- I'll do it in a neutral

41
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,020
color actually.

42
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:08,220
This s times 2s divided by g is
2 times s squared over g.

43
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:15,440
So 2s squared over g times
cosine of theta

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,110
times sine of theta.

45
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,730
   

46
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,450
So now we have a general
function.

47
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,830
You give me an angle that I'm
going to shoot something off

48
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,540
at and you give me the magnitude
of its velocity, and

49
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,860
you give me the acceleration
of gravity.

50
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,620
I guess if we were on some
other planet, who knows?

51
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,350
And I will tell you
exactly what the

52
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,180
horizontal distance is.

53
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,799
