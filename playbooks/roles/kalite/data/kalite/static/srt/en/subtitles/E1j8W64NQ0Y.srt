1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,670
Working together Anya and
Bill stained a large

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,930
porch deck in 8 hours.

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,920
Last year Anya stained
the deck by herself.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,550
The year before Bill painted it
by himself, but took twice

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,350
as long as Anya did.

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,770
How long did Anya and Bill take
when each was painting

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,960
the deck alone?

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,060
So let's define some
variables here.

10
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,440
Let's define A.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:32,619
Let's define A as number
of hours for

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,310
Anya to paint a deck.

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,940
   

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,770
And so we could say that
Anya paints, or has A

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,800
hours for one deck.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,850
Or we can invert this and
say that she can do

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,910
1/A decks per hour.

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,420
Now, let's do another variable
for Bill just like that.

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:10,470
Let's define B as the
number of hours for

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,730
Bill to paint a deck.

21
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,860
   

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:24,710
And so for Bill, he can paint--
it takes him B hours

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,530
per deck, per one deck.

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,440
We could put it over
1 there if we want.

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,710
We don't have to.

26
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:36,650
And this is the same thing as
saying that he can do 1 deck

27
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,220
per every B hours.

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,890
Or another way to think
of it, is he can do

29
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,280
1/B deck per hour.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,970
Now, when they work together,
Anya and Bill stained a large

31
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,280
porch deck in 8 hours.

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,320
So let's write this down.

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,850
Anya plus Bill-- I'll
do it in orange.

34
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,490
Anya and Bill.

35
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,640
This information right here.

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,759
Anya and Bill stained a large
porch deck in 8 hours.

37
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,410
So we could say 8
hours per deck.

38
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,510
Or 8 hours per 1 deck, which is
the same thing as saying 1

39
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:26,150
deck per 8 hours.

40
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,640
And this is going to be
the combination of

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,000
each of their rates.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,020
So this 1 deck of per 8 hours,
this is going to be equal to

43
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:44,290
Anya's rate, 1/A decks per
hour, plus Bill's rate.

44
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,150
Plus-- do that same color.

45
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,880
Plus 1/B decks per hour.

46
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,960
   

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,540
So we have one equation
set up.

48
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,870
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

49
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,360
And I won't write the
units any more.

50
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,050
We have 1/8 is equal
to 1/A plus 1/B.

51
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,970
   

52
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,910
Now, we have two unknowns, so
we need another equation if

53
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,820
we're going to solve these.

54
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,200
Let's see.

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,450
It tells us, it tell this right
here the year before

56
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,120
Bill painted it by himself,
but took twice as

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,350
long as Anya did.

58
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,160
So the number of hours it takes
Bill to paint the deck

59
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,720
is twice as long as the number
of hours it takes Anya to

60
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,560
paint a deck.

61
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,360
So B is equal to 2A.

62
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,260
The number of hours Bill takes
is twice as the number of

63
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,010
hours Anya takes per deck.

64
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,340
So B is equal to 2A.

65
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,250
So we can rewrite this equation
as-- I'll stick to

66
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,140
the colors for now.

67
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,660
We could say 1/8 is equal
to 1 over Anya.

68
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,650
Instead of writing 1 over Bill
we would write, so plus 1 over

69
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,460
Bill is 2 times Anya.

70
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,210
The number of hours Bill takes
is two times the number of

71
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,970
hours Anya takes.

72
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,290
So 2 times Anya.

73
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,050
And now we have one equation
and one unknown.

74
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,170
And we can solve for A.

75
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,150
And the easiest way to solve for
A right here is if we just

76
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,040
multiply both sides of
the equation by 2A.

77
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,890
So let's multiply both
sides of this by 2A.

78
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,920
Multiply the left side by 2A.

79
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,380
Actually, let's multiply both
sides by 8A, so we get rid of

80
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,630
this 1/8 as well.

81
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,680
   

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,610
And then multiply the right-hand
side by 8A as well.

83
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,050
The left-hand side, 8A divided
by 8 is just A.

84
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,060
A is equal to-- 1/A times 8A
is just going to be 8.

85
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,340
1/2A times 8A.

86
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,930
8A divided by 2A is 4.

87
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,100
   

88
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,930
So A, the number of hours it
takes Anya to paint a deck--

89
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,290
and I made it lowercase, which
I shouldn't have. Well, these

90
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,650
should all be capital A's.

91
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,460
   

92
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,270
This is A is equal to
8A over A is 8.

93
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,810
8A over 2A is 4.

94
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,390
So the number of hours it takes
Anya to paint a deck, or

95
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,050
A, is 12 hours.

96
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,300
Now what are they asking
over here?

97
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,940
They're asking, how long did
Anya and Bill take when each

98
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,810
was painting alone?

99
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,650
So we figured out Anya.

100
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,100
It takes her 8 hours.

101
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,360
And then we know that it takes
Bill twice as long as Anya.

102
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,170
Bill is two times A.

103
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,120
So bill is going to
be 2 times 12.

104
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,020
So Bill is equal to 2 times
Anya, which is equal to 2

105
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,350
times 12 hours.

106
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,190
Which is equal to 24 hours.

107
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,430
So when they're alone it would
take Anya 12 hours, it would

108
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,720
take Bill 24 hours.

109
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,580
When they do it combined,
it takes 8 hours.

110
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,710
Which makes sense.

111
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,200
Because if Bill took 12 hours
by himself, combined they

112
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,940
would take 6 hours, they would
take half as long.

113
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,690
But Bill isn't that efficient.

114
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,840
He's not as efficient as
Anya, so it takes them

115
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,590
a little bit longer.

116
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,560
Takes them 8 hours.

117
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,590
But it makes sense that combined
they're going to take

118
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,920
less time than individually.

119
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,600
