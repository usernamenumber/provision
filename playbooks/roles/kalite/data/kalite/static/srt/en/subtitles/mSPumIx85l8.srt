1
00:00:00,268 --> 00:00:02,120
(piano music)

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:06,356
We're in the GemÃ¤ldegalerie in Berlin

3
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:09,930
and we're looking at Peter Bruegel's "Netherlandish Proverbs"

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,927
which is wonderfully fun.

5
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:15,442
It is, and it really suggests that not all that much has changed

6
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:17,648
in the last four-five hundred years.

7
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:20,577
It depicts well over a hundred proverbs

8
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:26,108
that is sayings, and they speak too often in a humorous way - the foibles of humanity.

9
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:28,074
It's interesting, because it's not a condemnation.

10
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:30,561
There is a sense of joining in.

11
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:32,843
Let's take a look at some of these images.

12
00:00:32,843 --> 00:00:36,639
Not all these parables have modern English equivalents,

13
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:37,743
but some of them do.

14
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:39,890
Some of the more obvious ones in the foreground

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,578
can be seen pretty clearly.

16
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:43,489
On the bottom left you see a man

17
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:46,807
who seems to be intent on hitting his head

18
00:00:46,883 --> 00:00:47,899
against a brick wall.

19
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,993
I know very well what that feels like.

20
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:53,433
Of course, this is the expression "hitting your head against a wall".

21
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:57,145
That is to do things repeatedly even though you have no chance of success.

22
00:00:57,145 --> 00:00:58,879
How about the figure on the lower right

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,062
who seems to be stretching his arms toward two loaves of bread

24
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,295
that he can barely reach?

25
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:06,631
In fact, he can't quite reach from one to the other

26
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:11,059
and we all know the expression "living from paycheck to paycheck". That is: "living from loaf to loaf".

27
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:13,358
He can't quite make ends meet.

28
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:16,327
Right next to him, and just below the table,

29
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:17,816
you see somebody who's holding his head

30
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,833
and rather upset that he spilled his porridge.

31
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,311
"It's useless to cry over spilt milk."

32
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:26,795
He's realizing that he can't scoop it back in his vessel.

33
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,999
These are all things that we do anyway.

34
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:33,477
We know they're silly and fruitless, and we do them anyway.

35
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:36,850
There's real pleasure in moving through this

36
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,834
and recognizing visually what is always an auditory saying.

37
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:45,067
One of my favorites and one of the silliest

38
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:48,446
is showing the pies or tarts that are being used as roofing material

39
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:50,050
on the house on the upper left.

40
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,848
This is a reference that doesn't really have an equivalent in modern English

41
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:56,342
and it is "tiling one's house with pies".

42
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:59,397
That is: "use one's wealth in vain".

43
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:03,062
The image as a whole creates this child booklike landscape

44
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:06,031
where we can wonder with our eyes and explore

45
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:09,497
and be delighted and in a sense make fun of ourselves.

46
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:11,851
