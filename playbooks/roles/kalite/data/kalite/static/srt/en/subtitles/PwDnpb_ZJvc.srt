1
00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:03,201
Let's think a little bit about powers of zero.

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:10,230
What do you think zero to the first power is going to be?

3
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:12,483
I encourage you to pause this video.

4
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:14,809
Let's just think about it.

5
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:19,347
One definition of exponentiation is that you start with a one,

6
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:21,510
you start with a one,

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,535
then you multiply this number times a one once.

8
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:29,758
This is going to be one times--

9
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:31,501
Let me do it in the right color.

10
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,635
one times zero.

11
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:36,042
You're multiplying the one by zero once.

12
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:38,011
One times zero.

13
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:40,752
That's just going to be equal to zero.

14
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:45,229
What do you think zero squared,

15
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:48,453
or zero to the second power is going to be equal to?

16
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:50,419
Once again you could--

17
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:52,799
One way of thinking about this is, you start with a one,

18
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,898
you start with a one and we're going to multiply it by zero two times.

19
00:00:57,898 --> 00:01:01,103
So, times zero, times zero.

20
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,534
Well, what's that going to be?

21
00:01:02,534 --> 00:01:04,868
You multiply anything times zero, once again,

22
00:01:04,868 --> 00:01:07,317
you are going to get zero.

23
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,460
I think you see a pattern here.

24
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,320
If I take zero to any non-zero number,

25
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:19,096
so to the power of any non-zero--

26
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:22,782
This is a non-zero number.

27
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,936
Non-zero number.

28
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:29,070
Then this is going to be equal to zero.

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,900
This is going to be equal to zero.

30
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:36,837
This raises a very interesting question.

31
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:40,392
What happens at zero to the zeroth power?

32
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,237
So here, zero to the millionth power is going to be zero.

33
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,477
Zero to the trillionth power is going to be zero.

34
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:47,655
Even negative, or frational, exponents--

35
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:49,234
Which we haven't talked about yet.

36
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:53,040
As long as they're non-zero this is going to be equal to zero.

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,679
It kind of makes sense.

38
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:57,228
Now let's think about what zero--

39
00:01:57,228 --> 00:02:00,492
Let's think about what zero to the zeroth power is,

40
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:02,080
'cause this is actually a fairly deep question.

41
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:03,873
I'll give you a hint.

42
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,771
Actually, why don't you pause the video,

43
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:11,340
and think a little bit about what zero to the zeroth power should be.

44
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,970
There are two trains of thought here.

45
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,203
You could say, well, zero to some non-zero number is zero,

46
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:21,826
so why don't we just extend this to all numbers,

47
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:23,789
and say zero to any number should be zero.

48
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:27,209
Maybe you should say zero to the zeroth power is zero.

49
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,163
Then there was another train of logic that we already learned,

50
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:32,453
that any non-zero number--

51
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:36,467
So, non-zero number.

52
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:41,915
If you take any non-zero number and you raise it to the zeroth power, is--

53
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:43,671
we have already established that this is--

54
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:46,325
You start with a one and you multiply it times that

55
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:50,942
non-zero number zero times, so this is always going to be equal

56
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:53,107
to one for non-zero numbers.

57
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,938
This is always going to be equal to one.

58
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:57,465
Maybe say, 'hey, maybe we should extend

59
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:59,126
this to all numbers including zero.

60
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:02,028
Maybe zero to the zeroth power is going to be equal to one.

61
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,286
We could make the arguement that zero to

62
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:09,422
the zeroth power should be equal to one.

63
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:13,022
You see a conundrum here, and there are actually really good cases.

64
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:15,265
You could get fairly sophisticated with your mathematics.

65
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:19,349
There are really good cases for both of these.

66
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:23,880
For zero to the zeroth being zero and zero to the zeroth power being one.

67
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,047
So, when mathematicians get into this situation where they say,

68
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:28,884
'There are good cases for either.

69
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:31,003
There is not a completely natural one.

70
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,090
Either of these definitions would lead to difficulties in mathematics.'

71
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,633
What mathematicians have decided to do is, for the most part,

72
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:41,767
and you will find people who dispute this will just say,

73
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,767
'I like one more than the other',

74
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:48,356
but for the most part, this is left undefined.

75
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:55,079
Zero to the zeroth is not defined by, at least, more conventional mathematics.

76
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,025
In some use cases it might be defined to be one of these two things.

77
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:04,457
So zero to any non-zero number, you are going to get zero.

78
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:09,860
Any non-zero number to the zeroth power you are going to get one.

79
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,637
But zero to the zero, that's a little bit of a question mark.
