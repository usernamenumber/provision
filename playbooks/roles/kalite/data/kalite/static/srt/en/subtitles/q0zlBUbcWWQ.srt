00:00:11,056 --> 00:00:13,857
This is a papyrus book of the dead

2
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,935
which will be on display in the exhibition:

3
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:21,237
“Journey Through the Afterlife: Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead”

4
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:23,791
Before it goes on display

5
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:27,811
the old Victorian paper backing needs to be removed.

6
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:32,630
So Bridget places the papyrus in a fume hood

7
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:36,355
and applies strips of paper to protect the front.

8
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:41,840
The papyrus is faced down and wetted on the table

9
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:47,164
with tracing paper mapping the delicate areas of the papyrus at hand.

10
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:50,709
Both conservatives peel off the top backings.

11
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:55,015
The last backing needs to be picked off with tweezers.

12
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:58,973
The back of the paper coming off is brown

13
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:02,235
because it previously was painted to blend in with the papyrus.

14
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:05,853
Whilst the conservatives continue to take off the backing,

15
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:09,486
they ensure the papyrus is moist by spraying water on it.

16
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:13,681
Picking off the backing took over two hours,

17
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:17,580
so to save you time we sped up the process.

18
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:25,164
Once the old backing is removed,

19
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:28,308
a fine, high quality lining is put on to support it.

20
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:38,111
The newly line papyrus is dried between blotting paper,

21
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:42,351
under glass and weights and lies there for several weeks.

22
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:47,293
When Helen and Bridget are confident the newly lined papyrus is dried,

23
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:51,331
they remove the facing that was put on to provide temporary protection.

24
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:55,838
Once this is done they examine the result

25
00:01:56,223 --> 00:01:59,225
and are pleased with the new lining on the papyrus.

26
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,129
They will soon get going with the rest of the conservation work that is needed

27
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:08,026
on the papyri featuring at the next major exhibition.
