00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:03,918
This right here is our derivative intuition module.

2
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:08,150
It was contributed by Ben Eater, and it is a pretty intresting module.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:16,333
What is cool about it is it really helps to conceptualize what a derivative is all about.

4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:19,969
All it really is [derivatives] is the slope of the tangent line at any point.

5
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:26,146
So in this exercise over here they have graphed f(x) = 2x^3

6
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:29,914
So this is 2x^3 over here

7
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:34,482
and what we need to do is to move these orange dots up and down

8
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:39,641
so these orange dots right now show a line so when I highlight that orange dot,

9
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,678
you see the line down here become orange.

10
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:47,800
And right now the dot is on zero as the slope of the line right here is zero

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,800
but we see that that line is definitely not the tangent,

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,333
the slope at that point is definitely not zero.

13
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:01,231
So what we need to do is move this so it becomes pretty close,

14
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:05,785
or as close as we can eye-ball it to the slope of the tangent line.

15
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:10,403
and so that looks about right, as it looks about right.

16
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:14,867
It looks pretty close to the slope of the line at that point.

17
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:21,913
And you can even see while I do it up here, you see d/df of f(x) at -2

18
00:01:21,913 --> 00:01:27,626
So the derivative at f equal to negative 2 what is the derivartive there

19
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:30,318
that is the slope, so by putting it all the way up here I am saying

20
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:33,190
that the slope is equal to 24 at that point.

21
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,000
So that is my approximation, eye-balling it like that.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,333
Lets do this point right here. It looks like the slope is decressing

23
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,000
a little bit but it is still very positive

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,133
so mayby the slope is around 14 or 15

25
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:52,800
and then here, once again the slope has decressed but it is still reasonbly positive

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,566
the slope looks like it is about 5.

27
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:58,036
So our slope is drcressing

28
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:01,400
right over here the slope dose look like it is about zero (0)

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,354
it looks like an inflection point actully, so our slope is zero right there.

30
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:08,785
You can see that the derivative at f(0) is 0 which just means

31
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:14,733
that this fancy notation to say that the slope of the tangent line / curve at this point is zero

32
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:17,400
it is flat there, you can see that it realy is flat

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,467
and you go over here, and we want to find the derivative at

34
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:28,964
f(1) and so again it looks like the slope is increasing.

35
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:36,031
So this interesting, up here the slope was very positive but it was decressing as we went over here

36
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,109
notice how it is getting flatter and flatter

37
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,067
but it goes to zero and now the slope is incressing again

38
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,561
so at this point we want to make a tangent,

39
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:47,333
and notice that the slope has gone up relative to where we were at one

40
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,467
so that looks like the slope right over there

41
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:52,333
and we do the slope over there

42
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:56,667
and if we get pretty close it will actully draw the curve of the derivative

43
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,561
So there you go

44
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:02,200
and so we didn't find the derivative at evey point in the curve

45
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,000
we found it just at these special points we have the orange dots for

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,404
but since we gots the orange dots close enough to the actual derivative

47
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:15,651
just by eye-balling it to try and find, trying to look at what the slope of the tangent line is.

48
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:20,226
It says, ok you have done it right and it then drew the whole slope of the derivative

49
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:23,821
and what the entire derivative is saying, is at any point this is the slope of the tangent line.

50
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:28,000
So even though you didn't move a dot around at

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,477
-0.5 if you go right up here that looks like it is around 2.5.

52
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:37,475
So this will be a little bit over 1, this looks like that will be the slope of the tangent line right over there.

53
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:45,000
Or if we went all the way over to -2.25, the slope will be aproximatly

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,648
30 right over there, so once you have the curve

55
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:50,333
you now have the slope of the tangent line

56
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,267
or if you have the slope of the curve at every point we see over here.

57
00:03:54,267 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is just a pretty neat exercise.
