1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,580
Our goal is to simplify this
expression for the squared

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,740
error between those n points.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,960
Just to remind ourselves
what we're doing, we

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,420
have these n points.

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,470
And we're taking the sum of the
squared error between each

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,930
of those n points and
our actual line, y

8
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,620
equals mx plus b.

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,720
And we get this expression over
here, which we've been

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,720
simplifying over the
last couple videos.

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,190
We're going to try
to simplify this

12
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,570
expression as much as possible.

13
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,940
And then, we're going to
try to to minimize this

14
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,620
expression.

15
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,740
Or find the m and b values
that minimize it.

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,790
Or I guess you could call it
the best fitting line.

17
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,835
Now to do that, it looks like
we were just making the

18
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:39,940
algebra even hairier
and hairier.

19
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,910
But this next step is going to
simplify things a good bit.

20
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:48,260
So just to show you that, if I
want to take the mean of all

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,610
of the squared values of the
y's-- So that would be this.

22
00:00:52,610 --> 00:01:03,990
That would be y1 squared plus y2
squared plus all the way to

23
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,750
yn squared.

24
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,900
So I've summed n values,
n squared values.

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,376
And then I want to divide
it by n, since there

26
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:13,480
are n values here.

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:19,560
And this is the mean
of the y's squared.

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,240
That's how we can denote
it, just like that.

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,390
Or, if you multiply both sides
of this equation by n, you get

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:41,160
y1 squared plus y2 squared plus
all the way to yn squared

31
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:56,970
is equal to n times the mean
of the squared values of y.

32
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:02,860
And notice, this is exactly
what we have over here.

33
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,280
That is n times the mean of
the squared values of y.

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,830
Or the mean of the y squareds.

35
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:19,580
And we can do that with each of
these terms. What is x1y1

36
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:29,620
plus x2y2 plus all the way
to all the way to xnyn.

37
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,460
Well, if we take this whole
sum and we divide it by n

38
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,690
terms, this is going to be the
mean value for x times y.

39
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,460
For each of those points,
you multiply x times y.

40
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,460
And you find the mean of
all of those products.

41
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,160
That's exactly what this is.

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,180
Well, once again, you multiply
both sides of this equation by

43
00:02:47,180 --> 00:03:01,480
n, and you get x1y1 plus x2y2
plus all the way to xnyn is

44
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,480
equal to n times the
mean of xy's.

45
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,180
   

46
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,990
I think you see where
this is going.

47
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:20,920
This term right here is going
to be equal to n times the

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,200
mean of the products of xy.

49
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,460
This term right here
is n times the

50
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,300
mean of the y values.

51
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,940
   

52
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:42,860
And then, this term right here
is n times the mean of the x

53
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,050
squared values.

54
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,340
This term right here is the
mean of the x's times n.

55
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,530
If you divided this by n,
you'd get the mean.

56
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,570
Since were not dividing it by
n, this is the mean times n.

57
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,860
And then this is, obviously,
we don't

58
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,700
the simplify anything.

59
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,630
So let's rewrite everything
using our new notation,

60
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,490
knowing that these are the
means of y squared,

61
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,450
of xy, and all that.

62
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:11,320
So our squared error to the
line from the sum of the

63
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,150
squared error to the line from
the n points is going to be

64
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:24,160
equal to-- this term right here
is n times the mean of

65
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,370
the y squared values.

66
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:36,550
This term right here is
equal to negative 2m.

67
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,020
That's just that right there.

68
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:44,200
Times n times the mean
of the xy values,

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,730
the arithmetic mean.

70
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,990
And then we have this
term over here.

71
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,060
I think you can appreciate
this is simplifying the

72
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,870
algebraic expression
a good bit.

73
00:04:51,870 --> 00:05:02,060
This term right over here is
going to be minus 2bn times

74
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,900
the mean of the y values.

75
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:16,980
And then we have plus m squared
times n times the mean

76
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,260
of the x squared values.

77
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,450
And then we have-- almost there,
home stretch-- we have

78
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:33,360
this over here which is plus 2mb
times n times the mean of

79
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,670
the x values.

80
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,845
And then, finally, we have
plus nb squared.

81
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:41,480
   

82
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,710
So really, in the last two to
three videos, all we've done

83
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,370
is we simplified the expression
for the sum of the

84
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,520
squared differences from the
those n points to this line, y

85
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,900
equals mx plus b.

86
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,220
So we're finished with the
hard core algebra stage.

87
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:06,140
The next stage, we actually
want to optimize this.

88
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,690
   

89
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:14,070
Maybe a the better way to talk
about it, we want to minimize

90
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,150
this expression right
over here.

91
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,320
We want to find the m and the
b values that minimize it.

92
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,560
And to help visualize it, we're
going to start breaking

93
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,260
into a little bit of

94
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,150
three-dimensional calculus here.

95
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,530
But hopefully it won't
be too daunting.

96
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,620
If you've done any partial

97
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,820
derivatives, it won't be difficult.

98
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,630
This is a surface.

99
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,460
If you view that you have
the x and y data points,

100
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,340
everything here is a
constant except for

101
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,250
the m's and the b's.

102
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,310
We're assuming that we
have the x's and y's.

103
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,020
So we can figure out the mean
of the squared values of y,

104
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,610
the mean of the xy product, the
mean of the y's, the mean

105
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,230
of the x squareds.

106
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,670
We assume that those are
all actual numbers.

107
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,410
So this expression right here,
it's actually going to be a

108
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,550
surface in three dimensions.

109
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:03,380
So you can imagine, this right
here, that is the m-axis.

110
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,620
This right here is the b-axis.

111
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,940
   

112
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:20,780
And then, you could imagine the
vertical axis to be the

113
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,340
squared error.

114
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,770
This is the squared error
of the line axis.

115
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,670
So for any combination of m
and b, if you're in the mb

116
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,710
plane, you pick some combination
of m and b.

117
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,230
You put it into this expression
for the squared

118
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,760
error of the line.

119
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,360
It'll give you a point.

120
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,600
If you do that for all of the
combinations of m's and b's,

121
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,850
you're going to get a surface.

122
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,620
   

123
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,730
And the surface is going to
look something like this.

124
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,670
I'm going to try my
best to draw it.

125
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,170
It's going to look like this.

126
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:01,100
You could almost imagine
it as a kind of a bowl.

127
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,370
Or you could even
think of it as a

128
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,440
three-dimensional parabola.

129
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,070
If you want to think
of it that way.

130
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,670
Instead of a parabola that
just goes like this.

131
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,350
If you were to kind of rotate
it around and distort it a

132
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,700
little bit, you would get this
thing that looks kind of like

133
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,350
a cup, or a thimble,
or whatever.

134
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,970
And so what we want to do is
to find the m and b values

135
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,070
that minimize.

136
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,420
Notice, this is a
three-dimensional surface.

137
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,480
I don't know if I'm doing
justice to it.

138
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,110
So you can imagine a
three-dimensional surface that

139
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,140
looks something like this.

140
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,429
This is the back part that
you're not seeing.

141
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,090
So that's the inside of our
three-dimensional surface.

142
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,169
We want to find the m and b
values that minimize the value

143
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:42,929
on the surface.

144
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:46,040
So there's some m and b
value right over here

145
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,390
that minimizes it.

146
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,120
And I'll actually do the
calculation in the next video.

147
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,500
But to do that, we're going to
find the partial derivative of

148
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,910
this with respect to m.

149
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,500
And we're going to find the
partial derivative of this

150
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,370
with respect to b and set
both of them equal to 0.

151
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,020
Because at this minimum point, I
guess you could say in three

152
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,090
dimensions, this minimum point
on the surface is going to

153
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:18,720
occur when the slope with
respect to m and the slope

154
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,230
with respect to b is 0.

155
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,010
So at that point, the partial
derivative of our squared

156
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,860
error with respect to m is
going to be equal to 0.

157
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,490
And the partial derivative of
our squared error with respect

158
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,020
to b is going to
be equal to 0.

159
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,890
So all we're going to do, in
the next video, is take the

160
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,060
partial derivative of this
expression with respect to m,

161
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,390
set that equal to 0.

162
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,690
And the partial derivative of
this with respect to b, set

163
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,680
that equal to 0.

164
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,590
And then we're ready to solve
for the m in the b.

165
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,580
Or the particular m and b.
