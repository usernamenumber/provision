1
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:08,545
in baseball, in soccer,

2
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:10,291
sometimes sports announcers will look for

3
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,037
the turning point of the game

4
00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:15,055
and the scene that we are looking

5
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:17,196
at is battle, not sport,in fact one of the most

6
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:19,721
important battles in ancient history

7
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,817
is at that particular turning point,

8
00:00:21,817 --> 00:00:26,031
the moment when the great ruler of persia turns and flees

9
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:30,056
under the onslaught of the great Greek general Alexander.

10
00:00:30,056 --> 00:00:33,716
Darius, the king of the Persians, has just ordered his troops to retreat.

11
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:38,459
So this tremendous tension of this moment, because we have this reversal of momentum,

12
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:42,527
we can feel the momentum moving in from the right, because

13
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:46,634
we can still see the Persian guard's spears facing towards the Greeks.

14
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:51,151
But just at that moment, the largest object in this mosaic, the chariot,

15
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,718
is being spun around, and the tension and the torsion that is required

16
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:59,015
for that is creating this is creating this tremendous sense of dynamism.

17
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:02,699
On the ground we see the wounded and the dying.

18
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,131
One of my favorite details is the reflection of one

19
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:10,686
of the Persian soldiers in his own shield. He

20
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:15,233
is looking at himself, fallen in battle, perhaps about to die.

21
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:19,380
I think another favorite is the horse that

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,431
is part of the team leading Darius' chariot.

23
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:26,199
Almost all four hooves are off the ground!

24
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:29,800
As it is being pulled to the left, its head turns to the right.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,190
There is this almost frenetic quality to this image.

26
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,747
And you have a sense of confidence as you look at Alexander's face

27
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:42,966
as he heads towards Darius. Darius looks fearful as he gestures towards Alexander.

28
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:48,318
It looks to me as though Darius is almost pleading for the lives of his soldiers.

29
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:53,997
Well there is a look both of surprise and worry

30
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:56,695
and seeking compassion, I think that's exactly right.

31
00:01:56,695 --> 00:02:01,868
Alexander is known, ultimately, for his compassion, at least towards Darius's family.

32
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:07,916
And Alexander is the great Greek general, the founder of an enormous empire.

33
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,635
Well, that's right, he not only unifies Greece,

34
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:14,143
but he will then move south into Egypt, he moves east into Persia, and he

35
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:18,090
gets actually Indus Valley itself. So he puts under Greece's control

36
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,795
an enormous area of the known world.

37
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:28,003
And all of these details are rendered in tiny pieces of stone and glass.

38
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:32,625
So we're looking at a mosaic that we think is based on

39
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,050
an ancient Greek painting. We hope

40
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,266
it's based on an ancient Greek painting,

41
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:42,185
because almost nothing of ancient Greek paintings survives, as it was talked about

42
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:45,133
how amazing Greek painting was.

43
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:48,216
It's true, when we think of Greek art, we think of Greek art, we think of Greek sculpture,

44
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:50,036
we mayhap think of Greek architecture, perhaps we

45
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:54,487
think of Greek vase painting, but it is right, in the ancient world, literature tells us

46
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:57,822
that the what the Greeks did better than anything was wall painting.

47
00:02:57,822 --> 00:02:59,638
We just dont have any.

48
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,756
So mayhap this gives us some idea.

49
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:04,567
I do find it really interesting that the mosaic is almost

50
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:09,455
empty at the top, and is almost weighted down towards the bottom.

51
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:15,423
Especially when we remember that this is based on a painting that would have been on a wall.

52
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:22,756
And so this was intended to be seen vertically, at least initially, at least that's our best guess.

53
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:30,292
Our historians link this mosaic to a literary description of an ancient Greek painting by an artist

54
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:33,871
named Philoxanes. And in this literary source,

55
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:39,826
by Plinea Philoxanes, is said to have created a painting of the battle of Alexander and Darius.

56
00:03:39,826 --> 00:03:43,670
But here's the problem, there were probably lots of paintings of that subject.

57
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,573
And we know for certain that there was a female artist who painted this subject.

58
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:48,973
And ancient Greece as well.

59
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:52,758
This is an incredibly important confrontation between these to generals,

60
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:56,775
between these two civilizations. I'm sure there were many more.

61
00:03:56,775 --> 00:04:00,426
But this is what we have. This is what was found, and we have it because of

62
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:04,862
the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 which preserved

63
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:09,841
under a layer of volcanic ash, the city of Pompeii.

64
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:16,478
Including this mosaic. This was found on the floor between to paristiles, that is

65
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:24,441
between two open courtyards that were surrounded by columns in the largest and most elaborately decorated

66
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:31,656
mansion in Pompeii, often called the House of the Fawn, after a bronze sculpture of a fawn that was found there.

67
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:38,489
And the mosaic itself is of extraordinary quality and so it's not surpriseing that we find it in such a lavish

68
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:43,792
environment as the House of the Fawn. There are apparently a million and a half pieces of

69
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:50,928
stone and glass that make up this mosaic. And the quality is not just in the fineness of the

70
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:54,905
material, but in the incredible naturalism of what we see here,

71
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:56,721
which is what the ancient Greeks were known for.

72
00:04:56,721 --> 00:05:01,438
We have forms that even with these tiny pieces of stone we have a sense of

73
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:06,608
modeling, of the use of light and dark, to create a sense of 3d forms.

74
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:12,571
If we look at the horses, or the faces of the figures, we see the turn of the face

75
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:17,863
the anatomy of the body. And look at the foreshortening of the animals, for instance, of the horses.

76
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:22,700
That ancient Greek knowledge of the human body of how it moves through space, is so clear here.

77
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,175
And of course all this speaks to the Roman's regard for the achievement

78
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:30,709
of ancient Greek art. Sometimes seems as though everyone in Pompeii

79
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,756
wanted to imitate the ancient Greeks, to to own copies

80
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:36,168
of ancient Greek sculptures, ancient Greek paintings.

81
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:40,920
There was a real mania as in Rome itself for ancient Greek culture.
