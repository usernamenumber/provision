[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,718
   

4
00:00:07,718 --> 00:00:10,770
What I want to do in this video
is to give a not too

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:18,220
mathy explanation of why bond
prices move in the opposite

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,380
direction as interest rates.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,730
So bond prices verses
interest rates.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,770
So to start off, I'll just start
with a fairly simple

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,300
bond, one that does
pay a coupon.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,040
And we'll just talk a little
bit about what you'd be

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,920
willing to pay for that
bond if interest

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,270
rates moved up or down.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,840
So let's start with a bond
from some company.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,600
So let me just write
this down.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,835
This could be company A.

16
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,760
It doesn't just have to be from
a company, it could be

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,520
from a municipality or it
could be from the U.S.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,250
government.

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,100
And let's say it's a bond for
$1,000, let's say it has a

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:09,140
two-year maturity, and let's say
that it has a 10% coupon

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,460
paid semi-annually.

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:17,650
   

23
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,560
So, if we just draw the diagram
for this-- obviously I

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,750
ran out of space on the actual
bond certificate-- let's draw

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,300
a diagram of the payments
for this bond.

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,030
So this is today-- let me do it
in a different color-- let

27
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,750
me draw a little timeline
right here.

28
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,930
This is two years in the future
when the bond matures,

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,770
so that is 24 months in the
future, halfway is 12 months,

30
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,500
then this is 18 months, and this
right here is 6 months.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,180
And we went over a little bit of
this in the introduction to

32
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,300
bond video, but it's a 10%
coupon paid semi-annually, so

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,945
it'll pay us 10% of the par
value per year, but it's going

34
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:01,140
to break it up into two
six-month payments.

35
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,930
So 10% of $1,000 is $100, so
they're going to give us $50

36
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,484
every six months.

37
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:11,890
So they're going to give us of
half of our 10% coupon every

38
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,550
six months.

39
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,250
So we're going to get $50 here,
$50 here, these are

40
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,190
going to be are coupon payments,
$50 there, and then

41
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,740
finally at two years
will get $50.

42
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,440
And we'll also get the par
value of our bond.

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:34,380
We'll also got $1,000 plus
$50 24 months from today.

44
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,520
Now, let's say this is today
that we're talking about, the

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,540
bond is issued.

46
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,850
And you look at that and
you say, you know what?

47
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,030
For a company like Company A,
for this risk profile, given

48
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,880
where interest rates are right
now, I think a 10% coupon is

49
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,130
just about perfect.

50
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,060
   

51
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,620
So you say you know what,
I think I will

52
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,970
pay $1,000 for it.

53
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:03,200
So the price of the bond right
when it gets issued, or on day

54
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,390
0 if you will, you'd be willing
to pay $1,000 for it,

55
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,110
because you say, look you know
I'm getting roughly 10% a year

56
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,250
and then I get my money back.

57
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,100
10% is a good interest rate
for that level of risk.

58
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,520
Now, let's say that the moment
after you buy that bond-- just

59
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,340
to make things a little bit--
obviously interest rates don't

60
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,730
move this quickly-- but let's
say the moment after you buy

61
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,930
that bond, or maybe to be a
little bit more realistic,

62
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,656
let's say the very next day,
interest rates go up.

63
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:31,940
If interest rates go up-- let
me do this in a new color.

64
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:40,400
   

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,160
And let's say they go up in
such a way that now that

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,880
they've moved up for this type
of a company, for this type of

67
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,260
risk, you could go out in the
market and get 15% coupons.

68
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,130
So let's say for this type of
risk you would now expect a

69
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,950
15% interest rate.

70
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,480
Obviously for something less
risky, you'd expect less

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,470
interest. In fact, for a company
just like Company A,

72
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,160
you would now expect a 15%
interest rate, so interest

73
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,950
rates have gone up.

74
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,320
Now let's say you need cash.

75
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,890
And you come to me and you say,
hey Sal, are you willing

76
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,790
to buy this certificate
off of me?

77
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,690
I need some cash, I need
some liquidity.

78
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,590
I can't wait for the two years
for me to get my money back.

79
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,580
How much are you willing
to pay for this bond?

80
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,180
Well I'll say, you know what I'm
going to pay you less than

81
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,640
$1,000 because this bond
is only giving me 10%.

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm expecting 15%, so I want
to pay something less than

83
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,440
$1,000 that after I do all
of the fancy math in my

84
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,660
spreadsheet, it'll come
out to be 15%.

85
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,180
So in this situation, the
price will go down.

86
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,250
And I'll actually do the math
with a simpler bond than one

87
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,520
that pays coupons right after
this, but I just want to give

88
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,420
you the intuitive sense.

89
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,090
If interest rates go up, someone
willing to buy that

90
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,750
bond, they'll say, gee this
only gives a 10% coupon,

91
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,780
that's not the 15% coupon I can
get on the open market.

92
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,670
I'm going to pay less than
$1,000 for this bond.

93
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,410
So the price will go down.

94
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,240
Or, you could essentially say
that the bond would be trading

95
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,495
at a discount to par.

96
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:31,590
   

97
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,610
Now let's say the opposite
happens, let's say that

98
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,580
interest rates go down.

99
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,660
Let's say that we're in
a situation where

100
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,310
interest rates go down.

101
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,250
So now, for this type of
risk like Company A,

102
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:52,660
people expect 5% rate.

103
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,330
So how much could you
sell this bond for?

104
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,010
Well, if you weren't there and
if I had to just to go to

105
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,660
companies issuing their bonds,
I would have to pay $1,000--

106
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,610
or roughly $1,000-- for a bond
that only gives me a 5%

107
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,340
coupon, roughly give or take,
I'm not being precise with the

108
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,550
math, I really just want to
give you the gist of it.

109
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,470
So I would pay $1,000 for
something giving a 5% coupon

110
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,120
now, this thing's giving
me a 10% coupon.

111
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,580
So it's clearly better, so now
the price would go up.

112
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:28,530
So now, I would pay
more than par.

113
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,640
Or you would say that this
bond is trading at

114
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,970
a premium to par.

115
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,800
   

116
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,330
So at least in the gut sense,
when interest rates went up,

117
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,470
people expect more
from the bond.

118
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,840
This bond isn't giving more,
so the price will go down.

119
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,520
Likewise, if interest rates go
down, this bond is giving more

120
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,870
than what people's expectations
are, so people

121
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,740
are willing to pay more
for that bond.

122
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,180
Now let's actually do the math
to figure out the actual price

123
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,110
that someone, a rational person,
would be willing to

124
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,900
pay for a bond, given what
happens to interest rates.

125
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,670
And to do this, I'm going
to do what's called

126
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,910
a zero-coupon bond.

127
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,730
And actually the math is much
simpler on this, because you

128
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,040
don't have to do it for all of
the different coupons, you

129
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,390
just have to look at
the final payment.

130
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:20,120
So a zero-coupon bond is
literally a bond that just

131
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,520
agrees to pay the holder of
the bond the face value.

132
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,310
So let's say the face value, the
par value, is $1,000 two

133
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,560
years from today.

134
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,380
   

135
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,640
There's no coupon.

136
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,220
So if I were to draw a payout
diagram, it would

137
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,780
just look like this.

138
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,470
This Is today, this is one year,
this is two years, you

139
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,620
just get $1,000.

140
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,830
Now let's say on day one, for
interest rates for a company

141
00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:02,570
like Company A-- this is Company
A's bonds-- let's say

142
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:08,560
people's expectations for this
type of bond is they want 10%

143
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,050
per year interest. So given
that, how much would they be

144
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,170
willing to pay for something
that's going to pay them back

145
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,900
$1,000 in two years?

146
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,800
So the way to think about it
is, and I'm going to do a

147
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,440
little bit of math now but
hopefully it won't be too bad.

148
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,320
So let's say P is the price that
someone is willing to pay

149
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,580
for a bond.

150
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,039
So whatever price that is, if
you compound it by 10% for two

151
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,809
years, so I do 1.10,
that's 1 plus 10%.

152
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,809
So after one year, if I compound
it by 10% it'll be p

153
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:43,679
times this.

154
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,620
And then after another
year, I'll

155
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,220
multiply it by 1.10 again.

156
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,600
This essentially is how much I
should get after two years if

157
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,190
I'm getting 10% on my initial
payment, or the initial amount

158
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,810
that I'm paying for my bond.

159
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:03,440
So this should be equal
to the $1,000.

160
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,880
So let me just be
very clear here.

161
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,480
P is what someone who expects
10% per year for this type of

162
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,420
risk would be willing to
pay for this bond.

163
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,110
So when you compound their
payment by 10% for two years,

164
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,580
that should be equal
to $1,000.

165
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,120
So if you do the math here,
when you get P times 1.1

166
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,890
squared is equal to 1,000.

167
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:35,100
Or P is equal to 1,000 divided
by at 1.1 squared.

168
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,760
Another way to think about it
is the price that someone

169
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,980
would be willing to pay if they
expect a 10% return is

170
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,610
the present value of $1,000 in
two years discounted by 10%,

171
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,970
this is 1.10 or 1 plus 10%.

172
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,655
So what is this number
right here?

173
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:55,130
Let's get a calculator out.

174
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,470
   

175
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:07,510
And so if we have 1,000 divided
by 1.1 squared, that's

176
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:18,000
equal to $826 and well I'll
just round down, $826.

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,125
So if you were to pay $826 today
for this bond, and in

178
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:26,120
two years that company would
give you back $1,000, you will

179
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,410
have essentially have gotten a
10% annual compounded interest

180
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,250
rate on your money.

181
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,220
Now, what happens if the
interest rate goes up, let's

182
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,470
say the very next day?

183
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,900
And I'm not going to be very
specific, I'm going to assume

184
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,600
it's always two years out, you
know it's one day less, but

185
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,770
that's not going to change
the math dramatically.

186
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,880
Let's say the very next
second that interest

187
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,000
rates were to go up.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,430
So second one.

189
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,380
So it doesn't affect our math
in any dramatic way.

190
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,970
So let's say interest
rates go up.

191
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,860
So now all of a sudden
people expect more.

192
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:07,110
The new expectation is to have
a 15% return on a loan to a

193
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,810
company like Company A, so now
what's the price we are

194
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,110
willing to pay?

195
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,010
We use the same formula.

196
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:18,380
The price is going to be equal
to $1,000 divided by-- instead

197
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,640
of discounting it by 10% we're
going to discount it by 15%

198
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,490
over two years.

199
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:28,920
So 1 plus 15% compounded
over two years.

200
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,170
Bring out the calculator.

201
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,570
   

202
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,995
And I think you have a sense, we
have a larger number now in

203
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,260
the denominator, so the price
is going to go down.

204
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,240
So let's actually calculate the
math. $1,000 divided by

205
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:50,020
1.15 squared is equal to $756,
give or take a little bit.

206
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,290
So now the price
has gone down.

207
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,550
The price is now $756.

208
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,640
This is how much someone is
willing to pay in order for

209
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,300
them to get a 15% return and
get $1,000 in two years.

210
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,420
Or get $1,000 thousand dollars
in two years and essentially

211
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,310
for it to be a 15% return.

212
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,980
Now, just to finish up the
argument, what happens if

213
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,330
interest rates go down?

214
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,190
So if let's say the expected
interest rate on this type of

215
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,260
risk goes down.

216
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,570
Let's say it's now 5%.

217
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,350
What is someone willing to pay
for this zero-coupon bond?

218
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,600
Well the price, if you compound
it two years by 1.05,

219
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,730
that should be equal to 1,000.

220
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,980
Or the price is equal to 1,000
divided by two years of

221
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,400
compounding at 5%.

222
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,530
Get the calculator out again.

223
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:52,400
We get $1,000 divided by 1.05
squared is equal to $907.

224
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,070
So all of a sudden we're
willing to pay,

225
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,520
price is now $907.

226
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,700
So you see mathematically, when
interest rates went up,

227
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,940
the price of the bond went
from $826 to $756,

228
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,310
the price went down.

229
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,580
When interest rates went down,
the price went up.

230
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,800
And I think it makes sense.

231
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,970
The more you expect, the higher
return you expect, the

232
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,520
less you're willing to
pay for that bond.

233
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,532
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
