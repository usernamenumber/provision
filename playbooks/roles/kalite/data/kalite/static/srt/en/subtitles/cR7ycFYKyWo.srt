1
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:09,442
What I want to do in this video

2
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,862
is think a little bit about

3
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:14,711
how the unemployment rate is actually computed

4
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:16,977
by the bureau of labor statistics.

5
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:18,597
So to figure that out, let's just start off

6
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:22,992
with the entire US population. So let me

7
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:27,976
draw a big circle here that represents the entire US population.

8
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:33,293
US population, and right now, if my numbers are correct

9
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:39,509
the latest numbers are 304,000,000 people.

10
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:45,008
Now, not all of those 304 million people are capable of working

11
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:49,659
including my 2 1/2 year old son, or my new born daughter,

12
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:52,109
so, you have to think, when you think of unemployment

13
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,859
you want to think about the percentage of these people that are actually old enough

14
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,144
to work, that actually can be employed theoretically.

15
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:02,193
So let's take a subset of that US population

16
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:04,223
and let's think about who's essentially an adult

17
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:05,920
who's working age?

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,959
So this subset right over here is 16 years

19
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,100
and older. So people who can legally work

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,959
and the numbers I have here, this is 100

21
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:24,634
sorry, this right here is 237,000,000 people

22
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:28,859
Now, we can't just say all of these people could possibly work

23
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,645
because a lot of them are in college

24
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:33,643
some of them are in high school, some of them might not have

25
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:36,232
the ability to work, some of them might be retired,

26
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:37,796
so what we want to do is take a subset of this

27
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:40,976
population that is essentially you could say,

28
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:44,597
part of the labor force, in that they are working

29
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:48,277
or they are actively looking for work.

30
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:51,743
Let me draw that right over here.

31
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:57,026
So this right over here is the labor force.

32
00:01:57,026 --> 00:02:00,318
So these are not retirees, or people who are in college

33
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:02,459
those people would be sitting right over there

34
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,509
assuming they are 16 years or older.

35
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:11,893
The labor force, this is working and actively looking for work

36
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:15,376
and we'll think about what actively looking for work means

37
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:17,226
in a little bit more depth in a few minutes.

38
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:22,810
Actively looking for work.

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,394
And that number, if my numbers are correct,

40
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:27,535
is right around 154,000,000. Although the numbers

41
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:29,690
here are not so important, the more important thing

42
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,709
is the idea of how the unemployment rate itself is calculated.

43
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,943
And then so within the labor force, you have a subset

44
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:39,462
So this is working and actively looking for work.

45
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:44,904
So you have a subset of the labor force that is actively looking for work.

46
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:47,801
So they don't have a job, but they're actively looking.

47
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:54,645
So this right here is unemployed

48
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:58,776
and actively looking, this actively looking

49
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:02,942
is probably more important than you might realize at first.

50
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:05,442
And this number, let's just say for the sake of argument

51
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:09,644
this is sitting around 15,000,000 people.

52
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:13,060
So if you have a job, you're right over here,

53
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,042
if you don't have a job, but are actively looking

54
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:18,042
you're going to be right over here.

55
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:19,792
What we're going to see in a little bit is

56
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:23,176
if you have, if you don't have a job, but you are

57
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:25,259
not actively looking, you could be working

58
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,644
you would actually be sitting out here.

59
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:30,894
This is going to be interesting when we think of trends

60
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:33,688
and the unemployment rate, when it goes up or down.

61
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:36,175
But just to see how the unemployment is calculated

62
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,143
let's use, let's do it for this example.

63
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:45,844
So the unemployment rate

64
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:50,060
is literally just the number of unemployed,

65
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,977
over the entire labor force.

66
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:55,042
So in this situation, it would be

67
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:58,958
15,000,000, so that's just the number of unemployed

68
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,793
and actively looking, over the entire labor force

69
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:10,042
Over 154,000,000. So if we get my handy TI 85 out

70
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:13,092
that gives us in this example right over here

71
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:19,259
and unemployment rate of 15 divided by 154 million.

72
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:25,359
So it's about 9.7, if we write it as a decimal, it would be 0.097

73
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:28,742
if we write it as a percentage, this would be 9.7%

74
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:35,825
so this is approximately 9.7%.

75
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:39,126
Now I told you that the details are going to be important

76
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:41,543
And the reason why they are is interesting things happen

77
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:44,143
when people stop looking for work, or when they

78
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:46,592
start looking for work.

79
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:49,585
So I said "unemployed and actively looking"

80
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:51,359
puts you in this bucket over here.

81
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,645
If you're unemployed, if you don't have a job

82
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:54,259
and you're not actively looking

83
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,560
you're actually not in the labor force.

84
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,395
And so you might be saying, "Sal, what does it mean

85
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:01,775
to be actively looking for work?"

86
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:04,226
And this means that you've looked for a job

87
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:06,309
or you're actively searching in the past

88
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:08,909
We'll do this in a new color

89
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:13,861
in the past 4 weeks

90
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:19,459
And you might say "Sal, how do they know whether these 15 million people,

91
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:23,473
have actively searched for jobs in the past 4 weeks?"

92
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:25,155
And the answer is they do a survey.

93
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:28,459
They're not going to survey every human being in the labor force

94
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:30,311
or the US population, or all 15 million

95
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:33,759
that are unemployed, that would be logistically impossible

96
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,310
what they do is they do a survey

97
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,559
and right now they do about 60,000 every month

98
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:40,227
and they essentially ask them,

99
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:41,093
are you employed?

100
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:41,978
are you unemployed?

101
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:44,525
if you are unemployed, have you looked for a job

102
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:46,477
in the past 4 weeks?

103
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:48,560
If you have looked for a job in the past 4 weeks

104
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,394
as an unemployed person, you'd get thrown into this bucket

105
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:54,106
right here, you're actively looking, you're still part of the labor force

106
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:57,643
but if you've got so discouraged that you're no longer

107
00:05:57,643 --> 00:06:00,543
looking for work, maybe you've given up

108
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:02,876
then you get thrown out of here, you get thrown

109
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:07,959
out of the labor force. And that is what most people

110
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,343
don't realize, when things get bad enough

111
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:11,965
and people get really discouraged,

112
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:14,317
you have people not going,

113
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:17,679
you have people actually exiting the entire labor force

114
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,644
and see how that affects the numbers

115
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:22,310
imagine a situation, so this is the unemployment rate

116
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,526
right now, there's 15,000,000 who are unemployed

117
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:28,358
and actively looking for work. Let's say that this

118
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,709
is just a horrible recession or depression

119
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,776
and 5,000,000 of these people get so

120
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,993
discouraged, they don't, in the last 4 weeks

121
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,108
they do not look for work anymore.

122
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,409
So they've maybe stopped altogether or they want to take a break

123
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:45,377
so what we're gonna do, is we're going to take

124
00:06:45,377 --> 00:06:48,426
5,000,000 people out of this bucket over here,

125
00:06:48,426 --> 00:06:51,358
so we're going to take 5,000,000 people and move them

126
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:54,678
out over here. Outside of the labor force.

127
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:56,626
If you did that what happens?

128
00:06:56,626 --> 00:07:00,175
Well now, the number, the official unemployed number

129
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:04,101
is now going to be 10,000,000

130
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:06,292
and what's the labor force number?

131
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,608
Remember, they went completely out of this green circle over here

132
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:11,226
So they also left the labor force,

133
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:16,026
so the labor force number is now 149,000,000

134
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:20,743
So in this bad situation, where people have left the labor force

135
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:23,893
the unemployment rate would now be 10 million people

136
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,042
unemployed and actively looking for work

137
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:29,810
over a labor force of 149,000,000.

138
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,926
The labor force has shrunk because they're so discouraged

139
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:35,811
so what do we get there as our unemployment rate?

140
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:40,493
We have 10 divided by 149

141
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,008
it gives us 6.7%

142
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:47,943
So this is fascinating, if things get bad enough

143
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:50,609
and people actually exit the labor force

144
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:53,425
then the unemployment rate could actually go down

145
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:56,059
because the labor force is shrinking.

146
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,654
The other thing could also happen,

147
00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:01,358
maybe things get really good and you have

148
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:06,708
10,000,000 people who are sitting out here

149
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,709
they're either marginally attached to workers,

150
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,376
which are people who are hoping to get a job,

151
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:13,227
but haven't looked for a job in the past 4 weeks

152
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,175
or they could be discouraged workers

153
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:19,209
who would mind working, but they've given up altogether looking

154
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,726
but you can imagine when the economy gets good

155
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:23,676
let's say we're starting from this baseline

156
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:25,727
here, the economy gets good, and all these people

157
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:28,560
who are unemployed, but not part of the labor force,

158
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,893
all of a sudden start looking for work.

159
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:34,700
So then they'd be part of the official unemployed

160
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,109
So 10,000,000 would grow to 20,000,000

161
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:41,609
So now this number is 20 million, and this green area

162
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:43,859
would go up by 10 million,

163
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:46,227
so now this would be 159 million,

164
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:49,125
so in this situation, the official unemployed would be

165
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,625
20 million, and the entire labor force would be

166
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:57,760
159 million, and now you get a situation

167
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,844
so you have 20 divided by 159 million,

168
00:09:02,844 --> 00:09:07,188
which is 12.6%

169
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:09,744
Approximately 12.6%

170
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:11,276
So the whole point of this video,

171
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:12,894
I'm not saying that the unemployment rate is

172
00:09:12,894 --> 00:09:14,644
the way it's calculated is wrong, or that it's

173
00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:16,276
supposed to be misleading,

174
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:18,644
I just want to give you a little bit of nuance

175
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:21,144
that it doesn't always give the complete picture

176
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,059
in particular, that one number, just this

177
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,976
and there's other unemployment rates that give

178
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:26,694
a little bit more nuance here, but this one

179
00:09:26,694 --> 00:09:30,042
headline unemployment rate that's typically given on the news

180
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:32,792
doesn't capture the whole story, in particular

181
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,292
it doesn't capture the people who might be exiting

182
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:38,676
the labor force when things are bad, so in that situation

183
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:40,279
the unemployment rate would probably be

184
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,125
understating how bad things are.

185
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,309
And it also doesn't capture the people who are entering the labor force

186
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:48,101
in that situation the unemployment rate

187
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,523
would probably make things look worse than they are

188
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,823
when things might actually be improving.
