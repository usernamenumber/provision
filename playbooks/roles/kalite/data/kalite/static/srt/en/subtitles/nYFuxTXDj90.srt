1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,067
We finished off the last video in the Hadean Eon.

2
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:10,190
It was named for Hades or the ancient greek Underworld

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,733
Hades is also the name of the guy who ran the ancient greek underworld

4
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:17,415
Zeus's older brother and it was an appropriate name,

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:21,200
although the idea, the ancient greek notion of the underworld

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,533
isn't exactly the modern notion of hell, but it was a

7
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:28,354
hellish environment, you had all this lava flowing around

8
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:32,954
and things impacting the earth from space. As far as

9
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:36,933
we can tell right now it was completely inhospitable

10
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:39,667
to life. And to make matters worse, even though the

11
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:42,533
earth started to cool down a little bit, maybe the crust

12
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:45,267
became a little bit more solid, maybe the collisions

13
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:48,533
started to happen less and less as we started to go

14
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:51,600
a few hundred million years fast forward after

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Theia ran into the early earth and formed the moon

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,533
There is something like the "Late heavy bombardment"

17
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:01,046
and right now the consensus is that life - whatever we

18
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:05,133
are descended from - would have had to come about after

19
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,867
the late heavier bombardment, because this was a time when

20
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,067
so many things from outer space were hitting earth,

21
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,467
it was so violent, that it might have killed off any

22
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,800
kind of primitive, self replicating organisms or molecules

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,533
that might have existed before it. And I won't go into

24
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:20,467
the physics of the late heavy bombardment.

25
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:23,333
What we believe of what happened, because Uranus and

26
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,333
Neptune, so this is the sun right here, That is the sun.

27
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,467
This is the asteroid belt. That's outside the orbit of the

28
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:37,533
inner rocky planets. But Urans and Neptune,

29
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:45,067
their Orbits moved outward. What that caused is

30
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:50,933
gravitationally it caused a lot of the asteroids of the

31
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,400
asteroid belt to move inward and started impacting

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:02,067
the inner planets, and earth was one the inner planets.

33
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:05,667
And also impacted the moon. It also obvious on the moon

34
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,933
The moon doesn't have an atmosphere to smooth over the

35
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:12,200
impacts. The consensus is that only after the late heavy

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,267
bombardment was Earth kindof ready for life.

37
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:19,333
We believe that the first life formed 3.824 billion

38
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:26,600
years ago. Remember, G for Giga, 4 billions years ago.

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,067
When we're talking about life in this period, we're not

40
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,067
talking about squirrels or panda bears. We're talking about

41
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:37,800
extremely simple life forms. Prokaryotes.

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,000
Let me give you a little primer on that.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,067
We're talking about Prokaryotes. I'll compare them

44
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:53,667
to Eukaryotes.

45
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:59,000
Prokaryotes are for the most part unicellular organisms

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,533
that have no nuclei. They also don't have any membrane

47
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:09,067
bound organelles, or what we would call parts of the cells

48
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:12,256
that would perform specific functions, like Mitochondria

49
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,569
So their DNA is just floating around.

50
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,990
Let me draw this character's DNA.

51
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,995
So it's just floating around ,just like that.

52
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:23,308
Prokaryote literrally means : "Before kernel" or

53
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:25,621
"Before Nucleus"

54
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:30,425
Eukaryotes DO have a nucleus with all their DNA.

55
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:34,236
So this is their nuclear membrane with the nuclear

56
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,292
DNA floating inside it

57
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:42,369
It also has other membrane bound organelles, Mitochondria

58
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:45,821
is kindof the most famous of them

59
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:52,200
Mitochondria, we think is basically one prokaryote

60
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,933
crawling into the membrane of another and becoming stuck

61
00:03:54,933 --> 00:04:00,554
and they both becoming a symbiotic organism with each other

62
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:08,236
So at this time we're still talking Prokaryotes at this stage.

63
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:13,267
This shows our current understanding of where things

64
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:18,041
branched off from, at this point of the tree

65
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:23,067
is some common ancestor to prokaryotes and eukaryotes

66
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:25,718
prokaryotes right over here

67
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:28,262
the bacteria and archeae

68
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:31,138
and here is the eucaryotes

69
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:36,467
and this first living thing we think might have been

70
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:41,338
some self replicating molecules, maybe a little bit more

71
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:45,646
organized membrane, DNA and RNA became

72
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:52,738
the method of passing information from one generation to the next

73
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:56,641
It is still an open question what that first life is

74
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:59,662
or how you even define that first life

75
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:04,677
Based on the makeup of DNA molecules of the current

76
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:09,662
organisms, this is how the think the tree of life came about

77
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:15,333
We have one common ancestor, then the Archeae and Prokaryotes

78
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:20,467
have a common Ancestor, it's different from the Bacteria

79
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:30,800
this is an example of Bacteria, Ecoli

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,600
We think that the earliest lifeforms we anaerobes

81
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,400
these did not need oxygen and for the most part

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,200
found oxygen poisonous and the earliest

83
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,000
lifeforms probably also did not perform photosynthesis

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,467
They might have gotten their energy from other sources

85
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:52,133
Chemically probably in that extremely volatile

86
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:56,067
environment that they were in

87
00:05:56,067 --> 00:06:01,800
Lets forward to a major event, these are big time scales

88
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,400
we are talking about here

89
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,067
This is a big timescale, we're talking about 800 million

90
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:12,733
years, humans and chimpanzees have ony

91
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:19,867
diverged 5 million years ago

92
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:25,600
From ancient greece to now we're talking about only

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,733
2,500 years ! You multiply that by 1,000 you get

94
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:39,200
2,5 million years.

95
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,733
And this is 800 million years !

96
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:47,867
These are extremely huge periods of time.

97
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:50,733
That's why we call them Eons.

98
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:55,067
The dividing line between the Hadean Eon and the

99
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:58,733
Archean Eon is a bit fuzzy.

100
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:01,867
Most people place it at about 3.8 Billion years ago.

101
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:09,133
It's about the earliest rocks we can observe.

102
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:14,067
We have rocks from about that time.

103
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:21,067
So there are 2 things, Rocks have survived and that is

104
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:28,000
also when we think life has started. So now we are in the

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,467
the Archean Eon.

106
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:38,400
But there is still none to little oxygen in the Environment

107
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,200
If you went to the earth at this time it would have looked

108
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,467
something like this, a reddish sky. You would have had

109
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:48,467
nitrogen and methane and carbondioxide in the atmosphere

110
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:52,933
There would still have been a lot of volcanic activity

111
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:56,600
This right here, these are pictures of stromatolites

112
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:04,733
These are formed from Bacteria that are bringing in

113
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:07,267
sediment particles, and over time these things get

114
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,400
built up.

115
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,667
The most important even in the Archean Eon in my opinion

116
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:20,933
, we believe this happened about 3.5 billion years ago

117
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:26,400
Prokaryotes, or especially bacteria evolving to use the

118
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,400
energy from the sun

119
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,933
To actually do photosynthesis

120
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:38,954
The side effect from this was the production of oxygen

121
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:48,123
And at first this oxygen didn't really accumulate in the atmosphere

122
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:59,133
because there was a lot of dissolved iron in the oceans

123
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:06,267
All of the life for the next billion years all occured

124
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:09,467
in the oceans. There was no ozone layer.

125
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:13,467
The land was being irradiated, a completely inhospitable

126
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:18,600
environment for life.

127
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,267
The first oxygen that got produced, instead of being

128
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:26,800
released into the atmosphere instead bonded with the

129
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,267
iron that was dissolved in the ocean

130
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:38,467
Once a lot of that iron was oxidized later on and the

131
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:44,400
oxygen did get released into the atmosphere it had

132
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,600
a cataclysmic effect.

133
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,000
Especially on the anaerobic life that existed until then.

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,867
It was neccessary though for us to happen later on.

135
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:16,771
Still a few billions years though before things start

136
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:21,486
flopping around on the land. See you at the next video.
