1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
   

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,646
Problem 15.

3
00:00:03,646 --> 00:00:06,501
Let's see, they have a square.

4
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:07,560
It looks like a square.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,940
I don't know if it's
a square just yet.

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,540
And they have a triangle
that comes off of

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,790
the square like this.

8
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,220
   

9
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,300
Ah, close enough.

10
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,420
And what do they tell us?

11
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,790
They tell us that this
is 90 degrees.

12
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,585
This is 60 degrees.

13
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:30,445
And this is A, B, C, D, and E.

14
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:31,870
And what other thing?

15
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:38,640
In the figure above, E, B, C, D
is a square, OK, and A, E is

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,210
equal to 8.

17
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,030
What is the area
of E, B, C, D?

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,760
So we just have to figure out
one side of the square.

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,040
And it's a square, so all
the sides are equal

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,130
and then we're done.

21
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,080
And this is actually just a
30-60-90 triangle problem.

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,600
How do I know it?

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,700
Because this angle is 60,
this is 90, so this

24
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,590
one has to be 30.

25
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,450
Or I could add it up to 180.

26
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,950
And if you don't even remember
what a 30-60-90 triangle is,

27
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,000
where they add up, you could
go back to page 838,

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,670
and they tell you.

29
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,020
If you look in the middle of
that page, they have special

30
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,920
right triangles, and they tell
you that if the hypotenuse is

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,040
2x that the side opposite the 30
degree side is x, and then

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,060
the side opposite the 60 degree
side is x square root

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,430
of 3, right?

34
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,670
So if x is equal to 8, what's
x squared of 3?

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,500
x squared of 3 is going to be
equal to 8 square roots of 3.

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,680
And, of course, this side will
be 2 times 8, which is 16.

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,760
I always think of the 30 degree
side as half of the

38
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,680
hypotenuse, and then the
60-degree side as square root

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,430
of 3 times the 30-degree side.

40
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,420
That's how I think about it.

41
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,410
But you can just look at
what they do on page

42
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,140
838 and you'll know.

43
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,280
If this is 2x, the side opposite
the 30-degree side is

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,186
x, And the side opposite the
60-degree side is x times the

45
00:01:55,186 --> 00:01:57,153
square root of 3, so this
has to be 8 times the

46
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:58,660
square root of 3.

47
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,790
If this side is 8 square root
times the square root of 3,

48
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,990
then so is this side.

49
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,150
And so to figure out the area of
the square, you just say 8

50
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,170
times the square root of
3 times 8 times the

51
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:08,860
square root of 3.

52
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,930
And what does that equal?

53
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,450
That's 8 times 8, that's
64, times the

54
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,560
square root of 3 squared.

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,540
And what's the square root
of three squared?

56
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,170
That's just 3.

57
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,520
So it would become 64 times
3, and that's what?

58
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,870
180 plus 12, that's
equal to 192.

59
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,120
Next problem.

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,450
   

61
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,660
It's really good to become
comfortable with

62
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,140
the 30-60-90 triangles.

63
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,800
You'll probably get one or two
extra problems on the SAT if

64
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,550
you get really proficient
at that.

65
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,750
In a mixture of peanuts and
cashews, the ratio by weight

66
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,640
of peanuts to cashews is 5:2.

67
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,620
Peanuts to cashews, and that's
really the weight is 5:2.

68
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,380
How many pounds of cashews will
there be in four pounds

69
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,670
of this mixture?

70
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,600
How many pounds of cashews
there'll be in 4 pounds of

71
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,700
this mixture?

72
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,300
So we know that cashews
plus peanuts is

73
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,590
going to be 4 pounds.

74
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,890
And we also know-- I could
multiply both sides of this

75
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,660
equation by C, this top one.

76
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,400
We also know that peanuts are
going to be 5/2 the number of

77
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,160
cashews, right?

78
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,290
Because the weight of peanuts
to cashews is 5:2.

79
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,440
So peanuts is going to
be 5/2 of cashews.

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,890
And the cashews plus the
peanuts is equal to 4.

81
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,850
So why don't we just substitute
this in for this?

82
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:44,550
So we get cashews plus 5/2
of cashews is equal to 4.

83
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,830
And what is this equal to?

84
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,850
This is equal to dot common
denominator 2.

85
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,400
This is like one
cashew, right?

86
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,080
So that's 2/2 plus 5/2 cashews
is equal to 4.

87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,120
So going up here, that's
7/2 times cashews is

88
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,850
equal to the 4.

89
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,800
Let's multiply both sides
of this times 2.

90
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,650
So then you get 7 cashews
is equal to 8.

91
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:18,329
Divide both sides by 7, you get
cashews is equal to 8/7

92
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,770
pounds, right?

93
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,380
8/7 pound, so 1 and 1/7 pound
is going to be cashews.

94
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,930
And this stuff here, I could
just multiply both sides by

95
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,590
2/7, times 2/7.

96
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,040
This would have canceled out,
and I would have gotten the

97
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,000
same thing, 8/7.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,110
So there are 8/7 pounds
of cashews here.

99
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,360
Next problem.

100
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,040
   

101
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,860
Kind of an odd number, but I
think on these free answer,

102
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,480
they sometimes give you problems
that might have not

103
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,810
the most clean numbers
just to trip you up.

104
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,240
OK, so that's the y-axis.

105
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,650
That's my x-axis.

106
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,680
After this problem and the
next, I will go to bed.

107
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,420
So, let's see, that's
the y-axis.

108
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,326
And then they drew
a line here.

109
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,510
It looks something like that.

110
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,760
They call that line l.

111
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,580
   

112
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,185
They draw another
line like this.

113
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:27,070
   

114
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,770
Let's see, this is A, this is
B, and they say that this

115
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,610
point right here is
the point 8, 3.

116
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,580
OK.

117
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,980
line m, not shown, passes
through the origin, that's o,

118
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,370
and intersects A, B
between A and B.

119
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,320
What is one possible value
of the slope of line m?

120
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,440
So line m intersects at the
origin and intersects this

121
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,110
line someplace.

122
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,980
It's going to look something
like this.

123
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,630
So the whole issue here is that
this line is going to

124
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,450
have a lower slope than this
line, than line l.

125
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,860
So what is the slope
of line l?

126
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,210
Well, it goes through the point
8, 3, and it also goes

127
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,330
through the point 0, 0.

128
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,040
So what's the slope of line l?

129
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,780
Change in y over change in x.

130
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,340
   

131
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:25,570
3 minus 0 over 8 minus 0
is equal to 3/8, right?

132
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,780
So this slope is 3/8.

133
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,950
So in order for this slope-- it
has to be less than this.

134
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,750
And it's also going to be
greater than 1, right?

135
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,300
Because it's still in the first
quadrant, so it's still

136
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,580
going to be in this range.

137
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,250
So what's a slope that's less
than 3/8 and greater than 1?

138
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,960
Well, I don't know.

139
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,240
2/8, which equals 1/4?

140
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,190
That would work.

141
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,690
That's less than 3/8
and greater than 1.

142
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,460
I mean, you could say 1/8.

143
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,010
That would work.

144
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,100
1/16 would work.

145
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,410
1/1,000 would work.

146
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,120
Any of those, that's all
possible values for the slope

147
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,770
of m because they just say
it intersects A, B

148
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,610
between A and B.

149
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,000
It doesn't say where.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,685
So any line, you know, it
could look like this.

151
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:07,090
The line could look really
small, so that would be like a

152
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,100
slope of 1/1,000, but
it would still work.

153
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:19,430
Next problem, problem 18.

154
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,990
OK, so they gave us a table.

155
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,030
   

156
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:34,808
So they say year, number
of students.

157
00:07:34,808 --> 00:07:43,410
And then they go 92,
93, 94, 95, 96.

158
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:58,680
In 92, there was x, then 1,552,
1,238 1,459, and 1,351

159
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,320
The table above shows student
enrollment in Weston High

160
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,780
School from 1992 to 1996.

161
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,920
If the median enrollment for the
five years was 1,351-- so

162
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,490
this is the median; this is the
middle number-- and no two

163
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,140
years have the same enrollment,
what is the

164
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,480
greatest possible value for x?

165
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,270
So 1,351 has to be the
middle number.

166
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,440
Let me make another
list. 1,351 has to

167
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,150
be the middle number.

168
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,890
And let's see, what are the
numbers that we know are

169
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,910
definitely greater?

170
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:35,169
We have 1,451, and then
we have 1,552.

171
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,220
And the numbers that
are less, we know--

172
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,630
so this is the median.

173
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,440
We know that 1,238 is less.

174
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,610
And we know that if 1,351 is
the median, then x is also

175
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,850
going to have to be less than--
there has to be two

176
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:57,470
numbers less than 1,351, so x
has to be less than 1,351,

177
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,290
although x could be
here as well.

178
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,880
It could be larger than 1,238.

179
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:10,110
So we know that x is
less than 1,351.

180
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,750
And it could have been equal
to 1,351, but they tell us

181
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,010
that no two years have
the same enrollment.

182
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,770
So what is the largest
possible value for x?

183
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,100
Well, it's 1,350, right?

184
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,040
Because you know that's the
largest number that's less

185
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,180
than 1,351.

186
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,410
And then this would
be 1,350 here.

187
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,505
And then 1,351 would still
be the median.

188
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:29,900
And we are done!

189
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,890
I'll see you in the
next section.
