1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,430
We know that if we have some
linear transformation, that

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,240
the transformation from x to y
-- and these are just sets,

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,170
sets of vectors, and T is a
linear transformation from y

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,850
to z-- that we can construct a
composition of s with T that

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,360
is a linear transformation
from x all the way to z.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,440
We saw this several
videos ago.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,860
And the definition of our linear
transformation, or the

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,930
composition of our linear
transformation.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:36,040
So the composition of s with t,
applied to someone vector x

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:45,980
in our set x, our domain,
is equal to s of t of x.

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,340
This was our definition.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,770
And then we went on and we said,
look, if s of x can be

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,770
represented as the matrix
multiplication a x, the matrix

14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:05,280
vector product, and if T of x
can be represented -- or the

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,850
transformation T can be
represented-- as the product

16
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,690
of the matrix b with x, we saw
that this thing right here --

17
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,820
which is of course, if we just
write this way, this is equal

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,220
to a times T times x, which is
just b x -- we saw in multiple

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,580
videos now that this is
equivalent to, by our

20
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,030
definition of matrix products,
the matrix a b -- right?

21
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,130
When you take the product of
two matrices you just get

22
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,210
another matrix -- the
product a b times x.

23
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,760
So you take essentially the
first linear transformation in

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,200
your composition, its matrix,
which was a, and you take the

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
product with the second one.

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,230
Fair enough, all of this
is review so far.

27
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,440
Let's take three linear
transformations.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,710
Let's say that I have the linear
transformation h, and

29
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,900
when I apply that to a vector
x, it's equivalent to

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,220
multiplying my vector
x by the matrix a.

31
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,490
Let's say I have the linear
transformation g.

32
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,400
When I applied that to a vector
x, it's equivalent to

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,250
multiplying that vectrix -- that
vector, there should be a

34
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,320
new concept called a vetrix --
it's equivalent to multiplying

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,170
that vector times
the matrix b.

36
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,410
And then I have a final linear
transformation f.

37
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,380
When it's applied to some vector
x, it's equivalent to

38
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,280
multiplying that vector
x times the matrix z.

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,810
Now what I'm curious about is
what happens when I take the

40
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:43,570
composition of h with g, and
then I take the composition of

41
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:50,070
that with f -- these are all
linear transformations -- and

42
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,350
then I apply that to
some vector x.

43
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,070
Which is necessarily going to be
in the domain of this guy.

44
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,800
I haven't actually drawn out
their domain and co-domain

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,020
definitions, but I think
you get the idea.

46
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,290
So let's explore what this
is a little bit.

47
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,610
Well by the definition of
what a -- let's go back.

48
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,320
By this definition right here
of what composition even

49
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,270
means, we can just apply that
to this right here.

50
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,240
So we could just imagine this as
being our s, and then this

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,520
is our T right there.

52
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,280
Then what is this going
to be equal to?

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,640
If we just do a straight up
pattern match right there,

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,530
this is going to be equal to
s, the transformation s,

55
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,620
applied to the transformation
f, applied to x.

56
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,830
So s is h of g.

57
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:46,750
So it is h -- or I should say h
of g -- the composition of h

58
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,180
with g, that is our s.

59
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:58,300
And then I apply that
to f applied to x.

60
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,360
f is our t.

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,470
I apply that to f applied
to x, just like that.

62
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,740
Now what is this equal to?

63
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,225
Now we can imagine that
this is our x.

64
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:14,670
If we just pattern match,
according to this definition,

65
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,480
that this and this guy right
here, that this is our t, and

66
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,160
that this is our s.

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,790
And so if we just pattern
match here,

68
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,040
this is equal to what?

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,430
This is just straight from the
definition of a composition.

70
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,720
So it's equal to s of -- s is
our h -- so h of t, which in

71
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,010
this case is g, g
applied to x.

72
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,200
But instead of an x, we have
this vector here, which was

73
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,650
the transformation
f applied to x.

74
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,960
So g of f of x.

75
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,980
That's what this is equal to.

76
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,550
The composition of h with
g, and the composition

77
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,710
competition of f with h, the
composition of h and g, all of

78
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,370
that applied to x is equal
to h of g of f of x.

79
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,310
Now what is this equal to?

80
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,700
Well this is equal to -- I'll
do it right here -- this is

81
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:18,210
equal to h, the transformation
h, applied to -- what is this

82
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:18,530
term right here?

83
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,570
I'll do it in pink.

84
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,080
What is this?

85
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,100
That is the composition of
g and f applied to x.

86
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,620
You can just replace s with g,
and f with T, and you'll get

87
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,920
that right there.

88
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,160
So this is just equal to the
composition of g with f

89
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,110
applied to x.

90
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,420
That's all that is.

91
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,190
Now, what is this equal
to right there?

92
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,280
And it's probably confusing
to see two parentheses in

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,730
different colors, but
you get the idea.

94
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,300
What is this equal to?

95
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,270
Well, just go back to your
definition of the composition

96
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,760
-- I just want to make it very
clear what we're doing.

97
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,500
This is, if you imagine this
being your T and then this

98
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,700
being your s, this is just the
composition of s with T,

99
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,270
applied to x.

100
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,730
So this is just equal to --
I'll write it this way.

101
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,530
This is equal to -- I shouldn't
write s's -- this is

102
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:18,820
a composition of h with the
composition of g and f.

103
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,210
And then all of that
applied to x.

104
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,190
Now why did I do all of this?

105
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,330
Well one, to show you that the
composition is associative.

106
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,710
I went all the way here and then
I went all the way back.

107
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,880
And essentially it doesn't
matter where you put the

108
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,490
parentheses.

109
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,130
The composition of h with g with
f, is equivalent to the

110
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,050
composition of h with the
composition of g and f.

111
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,020
That these two things are
equivalent, and essentially

112
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,800
these two things, you can
just re-write them.

113
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,210
The parentheses are essentially
unnecessary.

114
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,020
You can write this as a
composition of h with g with

115
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,070
f, all of that applied to x.

116
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,400
Now, I took the time to say
that each of these linear

117
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,520
transformations I can
represent as matrix

118
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,250
multiplications.

119
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,930
Why did I do that?

120
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,860
Well we saw before, that any
composition, when you take the

121
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,220
composition of s with T, the
matrix version of this

122
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,900
transformation of this
composition is going to be

123
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,520
equal to the product -- by our
definition of matrix matrix

124
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,480
products -- the product of the
s's transformation matrix and

125
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,690
T's transformation matrix.

126
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,010
So what are these going
to be equal to?

127
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,810
So this one right here --
if you think of this

128
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,260
transformation right here, this
statement right here, its

129
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,540
matrix version of it--
so let me write that.

130
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:49,930
A matrix version of the
composition of h with g, and

131
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:57,300
then the composition of that
with f, applied to x, is going

132
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,930
to be equal to -- and we've
seen this before -- the

133
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,510
product of these matrices.

134
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,500
So this composition, its matrix
is going to be a b.

135
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,620
h and g, their matrices
are a and b.

136
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:19,220
So it's going to be a b -- and
I'll do it in parentheses.

137
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,380
And then you take that matrix,
and you take the product -- so

138
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,420
this guy's matrix representation
is a b, right?

139
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,840
And this guy's matrix
representation is c.

140
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,690
So the matrix representation
of this whole thing is this

141
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,480
guy, taking the product of a b,
and then taking the product

142
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,380
of that with c.

143
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,640
So a b.

144
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,929
and then c.

145
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,179
And then if you look at this
guy right here -- and of

146
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,110
course all of that times a
vector x, all of that time

147
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,430
some vector x, right there.

148
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,860
That's the vector x.

149
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,730
Now let's look at this
one right here.

150
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:59,220
If we take the composition of
h with the composition of g

151
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,550
and f, and apply all of that to
some vector x, what is that

152
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,750
equivalent to?

153
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,180
Well this composition right
here, the matrix version of

154
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,170
it, I guess we can say, is going
to be the product b c.

155
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,012
And we're going to
apply that to x.

156
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,340
So we're going to have
the product b c.

157
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,770
And then we're going to take the
product of that with this

158
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,980
guy's matrix representation,
which is a.

159
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,530
And we've shown this before.

160
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,020
We never showed it with
three, but it extends.

161
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,430
I kind of showed it extends, so
you can just keep applying

162
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,420
the definition.

163
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,290
You can keep applying this
property right here, and so

164
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,900
it'll just naturally extend.

165
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,160
Because every time, we're
just taking the

166
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,630
composition of two things.

167
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,030
Even though it looks like we're
taking the composition

168
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,160
of three, we're taking the
composition of two things

169
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,150
first here.

170
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,640
And then we get its matrix
representation.

171
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,310
And then we take the composition
of that with this

172
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,240
other thing.

173
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,850
So the matrix representation of
the entire composition is

174
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,640
going to be this matrix
times this matrix.

175
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,820
Which I did here.

176
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,240
Similarly, here we take first
the composition of these two

177
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,430
linear transformations, and
their matrix representation

178
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,900
will be that right there.

179
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,550
And then we take the composition
of that with that.

180
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,120
So its entire matrix
representation is going to be

181
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,390
guy's matrix times this
guy's matrix.

182
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,220
So a times b c.

183
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,530
And of course, all of that
applied to the vector x.

184
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,990
Now, in this video I've showed
you that these two things are

185
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,840
equivalent.

186
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,800
If anything, the parentheses
are completely unnecessary.

187
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,920
And I showed you that there.

188
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,420
They both essentially boil
down to h of g of f of x.

189
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,410
So these two things
are equivalent.

190
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,620
So we could say, essentially,
that these two things over

191
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,520
here are equivalent.

192
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,390
Or that AB, the product AB,
and then taking the product of

193
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,290
that matrix with the matrix C,
is equivalent to taking the

194
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,040
product A with the matrix BC.

195
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,290
Which is just another
product matrix.

196
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,590
Or another way of saying it is
that these parentheses don't

197
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:07,030
matter, that all of these
is just equal to ABC.

198
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,430
Or -- I mean, this is just a
statement that matrix products

199
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,315
exhibit the associative
property.

200
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,040
It doesn't matter where you
put the parentheses.

201
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,080
And you know, sometimes it's
confusing me, the word

202
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,680
associative.

203
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,840
It just means it doesn't matter
where you put the

204
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,780
parentheses.

205
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,040
Matrix products do not exhibit
the commutative property.

206
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,140
We saw that in the last video.

207
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,050
In general, we cannot make
the statement that AB

208
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,280
is equal to BA.

209
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,020
We cannot do that.

210
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,550
And in fact in the last video
-- I think it was the last

211
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,720
video -- I showed you that if AB is defined, sometimes BA

212
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,660
is not even defined.

213
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,030
Or if b a is defined, sometimes
a b isn't defined.

214
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,820
So it's not commutative.

215
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,630
It is associative, though.

216
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,050
In the next video, I'll see if
matrix products are actually

217
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,300
distributive.
