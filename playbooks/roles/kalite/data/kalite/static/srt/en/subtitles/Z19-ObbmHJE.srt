1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,170
In the last video we started
off with two linear

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,070
transformations.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,610
We had the linear transformation
s that was a

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,970
mapping from Rn to Rm.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,290
And then we had the linear
transformation t, that was

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,770
also a mapping from Rn to Rm.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,170
And we defined the idea of
the addition of these two

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,010
transformations.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,090
So s plus t, this transformation
of x we defined

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:42,560
as being equal to s of x,
this vector plus t of x.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,530
And of course, this input is
still from Rn, and then each

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,130
of these are vectors in Rm.

13
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,300
If we add two vectors in Rm to
each other, we get another

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,610
vector in Rm because Rm
is a valid subspace.

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,570
It's also closed
under addition.

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,780
So this is still a mapping.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:07,600
So s plus t is still a mapping
from Rn to Rm.

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,970
And we also said that every
linear transformation we've

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,050
shown in a previous video, can
be represented as a matrix.

20
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,640
We could say that s of
x is equal to some

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,120
matrix a times x.

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,590
And we could also say that
t of x is equal to some

23
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,690
matrix b times x.

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,270
And both of these would
be m by n matrices.

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,800
And let me write that m
by n, both of these.

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,085
Because these are both mappings
from Rn to Rm.

27
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:41,680
And what we did is we made
a another definition.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,370
This was a definition right here
and then we made another

29
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,820
definition.

30
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,720
We defined the addition
of two matrices.

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,950
We said any matrix a plus b,
they both have to have the

32
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,200
same dimensions.

33
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,160
So they're both m by
n in this case.

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:09,110
And we defined this addition to
be a new matrix, where each

35
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,920
column of this matrix is the
sum of the corresponding

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,150
columns of these matrices.

37
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,640
So this matrix's first column
will be the sum of a's first

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,870
column and b's first column.

39
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,200
So a1 plus b1, the second column
I'll do a little line

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,000
here is, a2 plus b2.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,515
And it goes all the
way to An plus Bn.

42
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,570
This was a definition.

43
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,080
And the whole reason why we
made this definition, is

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,350
because if you defined matrix
addition in this way, then

45
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:52,410
this thing, when you replace it
with Ax plus Bx, you get to

46
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,220
that this thing over here is
equal to the corresponding

47
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,655
matrices by this definition,
a plus b times x.

48
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,480
This was the motivation to get
to a nice expression, like

49
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,020
this, for defining matrix
addition in this way.

50
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,750
Now this all seems very
abstract, so let's actually

51
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,680
add a matrix, or let's
add two matrices.

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,760
So we'll start off with
a two-by-two case.

53
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,450
So let's say I'm adding the
matrix 1, 3, minus 2, 4 to the

54
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,290
matrix, remember they have to
have the same dimensions, to

55
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:35,020
the matrix 2, 7, minus
3, minus 1.

56
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,350
What do we get?

57
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,440
Well by definition, you
just add up their

58
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,640
corresponding columns.

59
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,760
You add up the first column.

60
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,480
When you add up the
corresponding columns, what

61
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,320
happens when you add up two
columns, two vectors?

62
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,830
Well, you just add up their
corresponding entries.

63
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,800
So essentially, when you add
up to matrices, you're just

64
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,650
adding up all of the
corresponding entries.

65
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,970
I'll talk about it in this way,
just because that's how I

66
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,620
defined it, but they're
all equivalent.

67
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,370
The first thing, the first
column, in this matrix right

68
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,050
here, is going to be this
column plus this column.

69
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,440
So it's going to be 1 plus 2,
let me write it like this, and

70
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,320
then minus 2, minus 3.

71
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,380
And then the second column, that
one right there, is going

72
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:22,160
to be 3 plus 7 and
then 4 minus 1.

73
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,720
And so this will be equal
to 3, 10, minus 5, and

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,760
3, just like that.

75
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,940
And notice, even though the
definition is I'm adding up

76
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,860
corresponding columns.

77
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,660
Well, what in effect happened?

78
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,370
Well, I'm just adding up the
corresponding entries.

79
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,090
I added the 1 to the 2, the 3
to the 7, the minus 2 to the

80
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,300
minus 3, the 4 to the minus 1.

81
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,960
It's that straightforward.

82
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,600
Nothing fancier than that.

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,355
In fact, we could have rewritten
this definition.

84
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,510
If we say that the vector or the
matrix a is equal to a11

85
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,810
a12, all the way to a1n.

86
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,120
And then if you go down this
is a21 all the way to an1.

87
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,910
And then you go all the
way down there to ann.

88
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,980
We've seen that before.

89
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,360
And then the matrix b, just
by the same argument or by

90
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,910
similar definition, this is b11,
that entry is b11, that's

91
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,040
b12, all the way to b1n.

92
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,040
This is b21, second row, all the
way down to bn, sorry this

93
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,540
is m, we have m rows,
so this is mn.

94
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:41,440
So this right here is bm1, this
would be bm2, all the way

95
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,530
down to this is bmn,
right there.

96
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,420
Want to be very careful, these
are m by n matrices.

97
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,150
So this row down here is the
mth row in both cases.

98
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,390
But we could redefine our
matrix, or another way of

99
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,060
stating this matrix addition
definition, is to say, if I'm

100
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,270
going to add a plus b, I'm
just going to add up the

101
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,400
corresponding entries.

102
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,010
So this entry up here is going
to be-- do it in a different

103
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,740
color --it's going to be a11
plus b11 this one's going to

104
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:24,610
be a21 plus b21 all the way
down to am1 plus bm1.

105
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,820
And then this is going to be,
of course, a12 plus b12 all

106
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,620
the way to a1n-- let me scroll
over a little bit --all the

107
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,990
way over to a1n plus b1n,
and then all the way

108
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,510
down to amn plus bmn.

109
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,940
These are equivalent
definitions.

110
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,430
This takes a lot less space
to write in and I felt

111
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,750
comfortable doing it because
we've already

112
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,210
defined vector addition.

113
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,730
But it essentially boils down
to you just add up all the

114
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,990
corresponding entries.

115
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,820
That's all matrix addition is.

116
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,960
It's probably one of the
simplest things that you've

117
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,650
seen in your recent mathematical
experience.

118
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,860
Now, matrix scalar
multiplication,

119
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,500
very similar idea.

120
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,590
We defined scalar multiplication
times a

121
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:19,090
transformation of x to be equal
to a scalar times the

122
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,430
transformation of x.

123
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,680
This was a definition.

124
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:31,380
And we also defined scalar
times some matrix a to be

125
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,300
equal to the scalar.

126
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,450
A new matrix where each of its
columns are the scalar times

127
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,820
the column vectors of a.

128
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,320
So a1, and then the next column
is ca2, and then you go

129
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,730
all the way to can.

130
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,820
And the whole motivation for
this was, because this could

131
00:07:52,820 --> 00:08:00,025
be simplified to-- well t I've
said was equal to Bx, a times

132
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:02,590
the transformation of x
--the transformation t

133
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,350
of x was equal to.

134
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,820
So we still have our c.

135
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,040
So it's going to be c
times the matrix B,

136
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,070
times the vector x.

137
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,240
That's what the transformation
of x could be written as.

138
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:24,690
And so this would be equal to by
just manipulating-- and we

139
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,760
did this in the last video by
actually breaking this up in

140
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,360
the column vectors multiplying
them by each of the components

141
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,309
of x, and then distributing the
c and rearranging them a

142
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,140
little bit.

143
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,720
We can now say, using this
definition, that this is equal

144
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,049
to some new matrix cB.

145
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:43,150
We're using this definition,
some new matrix cB, where it's

146
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,320
essentially c times
each of the column

147
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,930
vectors of B times x.

148
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,730
This right here was
our motivation.

149
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,710
We wanted to be able express
this as a product of a some new

150
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,850
matrix and a vector, because
any linear transformation

151
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,360
should be expressible
in that way.

152
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,580
And that's why we made
this definition.

153
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,600
Now let's apply it.

154
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,070
And I wanted to show you that
this is perhaps even simpler

155
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,500
than matrix addition.

156
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,330
So if we want to multiply the
scalar 5 times the matrix,

157
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,410
I'll do a 3 by 2 matrix.

158
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:20,410
So 1, minus 1, 2, 3, 7, 0.

159
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,440
This will just be equal to--
by this definition I'm just

160
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,430
saying, I'm multiplying the
scalar times each of the

161
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,110
column vectors.

162
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,640
So it's 5 times 1, 2, 7.

163
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,570
But what's that?

164
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,340
That's just 5 times each
of the entries.

165
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,950
It's 5 times 1, which is 5.

166
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,170
5 times 2, which is 10.

167
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,480
5 times 7, which is 35.

168
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,110
Then the next column is going
to be 5 times this column

169
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,580
right here, which is just 5
times each of its entries.

170
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,490
So 5 times minus 1 is minus 5.

171
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,110
5 times 3 is 15.

172
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,340
5 times 0 is 0.

173
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,150
It's that simple.

174
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,770
You literally, if we go back
to this definition, we can

175
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,990
define scalar multiplication
of a matrix.

176
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,680
So we could also define cA as
being equal to, if we'd say

177
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,200
this is a representation for A,
of the scalar c times each

178
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,180
of the entries of A.

179
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,780
That's it.

180
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,380
So it's c times a11,
c times a12 all the

181
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,450
way to c times a1n.

182
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,070
You go down this way, c times
a21 all the way down to c

183
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,410
times am1 and then if you
go down the diagonal,

184
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,540
it's be c times amn.

185
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,080
You literally just take your
scalar and multiply it times

186
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,230
every entry in A.

187
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,720
And that's all you have to do.

188
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,240
So hopefully this clarified
things up a little bit, or

189
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,060
maybe it was a bit of a review
from things you might have

190
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,310
learned in highschool.
