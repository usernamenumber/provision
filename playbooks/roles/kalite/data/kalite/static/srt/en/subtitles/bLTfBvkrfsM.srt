1
00:00:00,273 --> 00:00:05,370
We're asked, "What is the greatest common divisor of 20 and 40?"

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,483
Another way to say this is, "gcd(20, 40) = ?"

3
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:15,672
And "greatest common divisor" sounds like a very fancy term, but it's really just saying:

4
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:22,625
What is the largest number that is divisible into both 20 and 40?

5
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:28,503
Well, this seems like a pretty straightforward situation, because 20 is actually divisible into 40

6
00:00:28,503 --> 00:00:33,774
Or another way to say it is that 40 can be divided by 20 without a remainder

7
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:40,941
So the largest number that is, I guess you could say, a factor of both 20 and 40 is actually 20

8
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:45,860
20 = 20 &times; 1, and 40 = 20 &times; 2

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,190
So in this situation, we don't even have to break out our paper, we can just write 20

10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,172
Let's do a couple more of these

11
00:00:52,802 --> 00:01:00,503
We're asked, "What is the greatest common divisor of 10 and 7?" Let's now break out our paper for this

12
00:01:00,503 --> 00:01:06,367
So, our greatest common divisor of 10 and 7, so let me write that down, so we have 10

13
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:15,026
We want to think about, what is our GCD of 10 and 7

14
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:17,867
And there's two ways that you can approach this

15
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:24,237
One way, you can literally list all of the factors—not prime factors, just regular factors—of each of these numbers

16
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:28,238
And figure out which one is greater—or wait, what is the largest factor of both

17
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:34,022
So, for example, you could say, well, I got a 10

18
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:47,032
And 10 can be expressed as 1 &times; 10 or 2 &times; 5

19
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:54,354
1, 2, 5, and 10, these are all factors of 10. These are all, we could say, <i>divisors</i> of 10

20
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:57,420
And sometimes this is called "greatest common factor"

21
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:04,449
7, what are all of its factors? Well, 7's prime, it only has two factors: 1 and itself

22
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:11,201
So what is the greatest common factor? Well there's only one common factor here: 1

23
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:13,303
1 is the only common factor

24
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:24,339
So the greatest common factor of 10 and 7, or the greatest common divisor, is going to be equal to 1

25
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:27,257
So let's write that down: 1

26
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:29,032
Let's do one more

27
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:34,971
What is the greatest common divisor of 21 and 30? And that's just another way of saying that

28
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:39,032
So, 21 and 30 are the two numbers that we care about

29
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:52,748
So we wanna figure out the greatest common divisor, and I could have written "greatest common factor," of 21 and 30

30
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:56,620
Once again, there's two ways of doing this

31
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,571
There's the way I did the last time where I literally list all of the factors. Let me do that way really fast

32
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:12,762
If I say 21, what are all of the factors? Well, it's 1 and 21, and 3 and 7, and I think I've got all of them

33
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:25,454
And 30 can be written as 1 and 30, 2 and 15, and 3

34
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:29,013
Actually, I'm gonna run out of room, let me write it this way, so, get a little more space

35
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:45,970
1 and 30, 2 and 15, 3 and 10, and 5 and 6. So here are all of the factors of 30

36
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:54,320
And now, what are the common factors? Well, 1 is a common factor. 3 is also a common factor

37
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:04,437
But what is the <i>greatest</i> common factor, or the greatest common divisor? Well, it is going to be 3. So we can write 3 here

38
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:10,462
Now, I keep talking about another technique, let me show you the other technique, and that involves the prime factorization

39
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:17,308
If you say the prime factorization of 21, well, let's see, it's divisible by 3, it is 3 &times; 7

40
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:29,318
And the prime factorization of 30 is equal to, let's see, it's 3 &times; 10, and 10 is 2 &times; 5

41
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:36,634
So, what are the <i>most</i> factors that we could take from both 21 and 30 to make the largest possible numbers?

42
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:45,103
When you look at the prime factorization, the only thing that's common right over here is a 3

43
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:54,111
And so we would say that the greatest common factor, or the greatest common divisor, of 21 and 30 is 3

44
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:58,999
If you saw <i>nothing</i> in common right over here, then you would say the greatest common divisor is 1

45
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:03,730
Let me give you another interesting example, just so that we can get a sense of things

46
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:22,276
Let's say that these two numbers were not 21 and 30, but let's say we care about the greatest common divisor, not of 21, but let's say of 105 and 30

47
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:25,302
So if we did the prime factorization method, it might become a little clearer now

48
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:29,571
Actually figuring out, "Hey, what are all the factors of 105" might be a little bit of a pain

49
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:42,402
But if you do a prime factorization, you'd say, well, let's see, 105 is divisible by 5, definitely, so it's 5 &times; 21, and 21 is 3 &times; 7

50
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:51,469
So the prime factorization of 105 is equal to, if I write them in increasing order, 3 &times; 5 &times; 7

51
00:05:51,469 --> 00:06:00,534
The prime factorization of 30, we already figured out, is equal to 2 &times; 3 &times; 5

52
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:04,951
So what's the most number of prime factors that they have in common?

53
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:11,201
Well, these two both have a 3 and they both have a 5

54
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:15,283
So the greatest common factor, or greatest common divisor, is going to be a product of these two

55
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:23,534
In this situation, the GCD of 105 and 30 is 3 &times; 5 = 15

56
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:31,024
So you can do it either way. You can just list out the traditional divisors or factors until you figure out which of those is common and is the greatest

57
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:39,867
Or you can break it down into its core constituencies, its prime factors, and then figure out what is the largest set of common prime factors

58
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:43,867
And the product of those is going to be your greatest common factor. It's the largest number that is divisible into both numbers
