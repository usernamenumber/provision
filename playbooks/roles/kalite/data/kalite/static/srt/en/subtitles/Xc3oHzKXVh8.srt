1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,800
Let's say given this diagram right over here

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,770
We know that the length of segment AB is equal to the length of AC

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,830
so AB which is this whole side right over here

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,880
The length of this entire side as a given

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,950
is equal to the length of this entire side right over here

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,160
So that's the entire side right over there

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,560
And then we also know the angle ABF, ABF is equal to angle ACE

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,680
or you could see their measures are equal or this just implies

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,030
that they are congruent so they have the same measures

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,250
It's equal to angle ACE so this angle right over here is congruent

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,550
to that angle right over there

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,430
Or you could say that they have the same measure

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,070
Now the first thing that I want to attempt to prove in this video

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:53,570
is whether BF, is whether BF has the same length as CE

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,450
Does BF have the same length as CE

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,450
So let's try to do that

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,080
So we already know a few things I could do

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,970
it two column professionally

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,240
let me just do it just so that

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,690
in case you have to do two column proofs

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,900
in your class you can see how to do it more formally

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,500
So let's try out our statements

23
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,330
Over here I'm going to write I'm going to write my reason for the statement

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,570
So let me just rewrite this kind of formal two column proof

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:25,200
so we know AB is equal to AC so this is statement 1 and this is given

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,620
We know statement 2 that angle ABF is equal to angle ACE

27
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,450
Once again that was given

28
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,770
Now the other interesting thing on each of these ,we have an angle

29
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,000
and we have a side, each of these triangles

30
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,410
And then what you can see is both of the triangles

31
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,700
and when I say both of the triangles

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,850
I'm talking about triangle ABF and triangle ACE

33
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,950
and they both share this vertex at A and point A is a vertex for both of these

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:08,680
So, we could say angle A we say BA, let's call it BAF, angle BAF

35
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,820
We could say is equal to angle BAF

36
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,110
or we could say is equal to angle CAE

37
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,700
That makes it little bit clear that we're dealing

38
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,190
with two different triangles right here

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,250
But it really is the exact same angle

40
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,280
It's equal to itself right there that's our third statement

41
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,620
and we could say that it's obvious

42
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,840
Some people would call this the reflexive property

43
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,540
It's obvious that an angle is equal to itself

44
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,320
And so we could say it's obvious

45
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,040
or we could call it maybe the reflexive property

46
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,440
that an angle is clearly reflexive obviously equal to itself

47
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,710
even if we labeled it different way

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,270
this angle is going to be the same measure

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,410
And now we have something interesting going on,

50
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,980
we have an angle, a side, and an angle

51
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:01,960
So, we end up having is that triangle so by angle-side-angle

52
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,710
we have the triangle BAF so our statement number 4

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,510
I'm running out of space right here I'll go down right here

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:17,020
Statement right here is triangle BAF triangle BAF

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,790
Let me kind of highlight it a little more blue right here

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,350
BAF so that's this entire triangle right over here

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,180
And half of the trick of some

58
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,250
of this problems is seeing the right triangle

59
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,910
So we started with this white angle we went through the side

60
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,150
that we knew then we went to this orange angle right over here

61
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,670
BBA I'm sorry we started at this angle

62
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,760
then we work to this orange angle across the side E that we know

63
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,280
is congruent to that side over there

64
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,140
And then we went to the side the aim of the vertex is not labeled

65
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,630
So at triangle BAF

66
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,900
we now know is going to be congruent Congruent to triangle

67
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,340
we start at the white angle

68
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,580
go to the orange angle then go to the unlabeled angle

69
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:03,470
It's going be congruent to angle to triangle CAF

70
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,240
So, this is kind of a messily drawn version

71
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,450
but you can get the idea

72
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,700
These two triangles are going to be congruent

73
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,460
C A sorry CAE I should say

74
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,320
is congruent to triangle CAE

75
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,730
White angle, orange angle, and then the unlabeled angle

76
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,920
on that triangle right over there

77
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,400
And this comes straight out of angle-side-angle

78
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,860
This comes straight out of ASA

79
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,090
and these are the two angles and so this is the side in between

80
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,550
so it comes out of the statements 1, 2, and 3

81
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,050
And so they're congruent, we know that corresponding sides are going

82
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,760
to be congruent so we know our statement 5

83
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,540
We should do this a little bit neater

84
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,900
Our statement 5, we now know that BF is equal to CE

85
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:58,080
BF is equal to CE

86
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,480
And this comes straight out of statement 4,

87
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,670
or we could say, corresponding sides,

88
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,590
sides congruent, corresponding sides are congruent

89
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,430
Now let's take it up another notch

90
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,980
Let's see if we can prove whether ED is equal to EF

91
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,260
So let's just keep going down this and see if we can prove

92
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,850
whether ED is equal to EF

93
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,030
I put a question mark there

94
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,430
'cause we haven't necessarily proven it yet

95
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,130
So I'm gonna prove that this little short line segment EF is equal to DF

96
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:44,830
Sorry not EF is equal to DF, ED is equal to DF

97
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,670
So let's see if we can prove this right over here

98
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,460
So the interesting thing that

99
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,690
we might at first it might not be so obvious

100
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,920
You know, how do we figure out some type of congruency over that

101
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,930
but we do already have some information here

102
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,520
We know that BAF is congruent to CAE

103
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,950
So we also know that this side right over here

104
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,280
Let me do it with the color I haven't used yet

105
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,110
Let me see I have been using a lot of the colors in my pallet

106
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,400
so it's getting a little too

107
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,360
So we know from these two congruent triangles that side AE

108
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,630
Side AE which is part of CAE

109
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,870
We know that AE is going to be equal to AF

110
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,680
That these two sides are congruent and the reason why is

111
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,780
'cause they're corresponding sides of congruent triangles

112
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,320
AF is the side opposite the white angle on BAF triangle BAF

113
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,180
And AE is the side opposite the white angle on triangle CAE

114
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,340
which we know are congruent

115
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,990
So we know that AE is equal to AF

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,750
And once again this comes from statement 4

117
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,570
and we could even say corresponding sides congruent

118
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,250
Same reason as we gave right up here

119
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,770
Now, what's interesting here is you know

120
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,730
this isn't even a triangle that we're seeing up here

121
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,730
but this information that these two characters

122
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,090
are congruent help us with this part over here

123
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:18,850
Because we know that BA or as to say we know that AB is equal to AC

124
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,560
that was given and so we know that EB

125
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,910
Let me write it over here

126
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,400
and make it a little bit messy right over here

127
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,020
Statement 7 will give us will give us some space

128
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:36,280
we know that BE is going to be equal to CF

129
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,600
Let me write that down, we know that BE is equal to CF

130
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,200
And why do we know that let me put the reason right over here

131
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,970
Let me try to clean up my work a little bit

132
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,890
This column has been slowly drifting to the left

133
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,260
But how do we know that BE is equal to CF?

134
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:09,600
Well we know that the length of BE is equal to the length of BA minus AE

135
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,480
or I could just say AB I could that's how

136
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,560
I call it up here so it's equal to

137
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:22,670
AB minus AE is the same thing

138
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,460
based on these last few things that we saw

139
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,950
As saying AC minus AF cause AB is equal to AC so that's equal to AC

140
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,760
and AE we already showed as the same thing as AF

141
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:43,480
AC minus AF and AC minus AF is the same thing as CF right over here

142
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,610
is equal to CF right over there

143
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,230
And we know that because and we know this from statement 1,

144
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,420
we know it from statement 5 and we know it from statement 6

145
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,740
Actually we didn't need we didn't need statement 5 there

146
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,770
Let me see we just need 1 and 6

147
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,180
So, let's say we need this is from 1 and 6 is what we had to do there

148
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,300
So, we just know that look this side is equal to that side

149
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,810
This little part is equal to that part

150
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,070
So if you subtract the big part minus the little part

151
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,920
This right over here is going to be equal to this right over here

152
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,820
So, that's all we're showing

153
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:23,000
So, this yellow side is equal to this yellow side right over here

154
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,530
Now the other thing that we know

155
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,930
And this is straight out of vertical angles is that this angle EDB

156
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,880
is going to be congruent to angle FDC

157
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,220
So let me write that down again

158
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:48,610
So 8, we know that angle EDB is going to be equal to angle FDC

159
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:55,230
That comes straight out of vertical angles are congruent

160
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,780
or their measures are equal

161
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,590
And now all of a sudden we have something interesting again

162
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,690
We have the Orange angle-white angle-side

163
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,340
So we know that these two smaller triangles are congruent

164
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,080
So, now we know I don't want to lose my diagram

165
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,490
We know that triangle BED, we know so statement number 9

166
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,660
we know that triangle BED is congruent

167
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:27,260
So, BED is this one we know that BED is congruent to triangle

168
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,570
Now we want to use the same sides white angle yellow side

169
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,550
then orange angle

170
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,580
White angle white angle let me be careful here, white angle

171
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,880
So B is white angle, E is the unlabeled angle,

172
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,770
and then D is the labeled angle the orange labeled angle

173
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,010
So, you want to start C unlabeled angle orange angle

174
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:53,400
so triangle CFD

175
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,580
And this comes straight from once again,

176
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,690
orange angle white angle side

177
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,040
So angle-angle-side orange sorry,

178
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,210
orange angle white angle side

179
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,680
So this come straight angle-angle-side congruency

180
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,750
And since we've now shown that this triangle is equal

181
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,100
to that triangle we know that their corresponding sides are equal

182
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,640
And then this is our homestretch

183
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,260
We now know since these two triangles are congruent

184
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:23,000
We now know that ED is equal to DF

185
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,390
because they're corresponding sides

186
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,560
And I could write that right over here ED is equal to DF

187
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,070
And once again the reason here is

188
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,650
the same thing up here corresponding

189
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,130
so we know our statement 9 which means they're congruent

190
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:44,650
And corresponding sides congruent and we are done

191
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,240
So that was a pretty involved problem

192
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,860
But you see once again you go step by step

193
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,290
just try to figure out each triangle and you eventually get it

194
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,710
But really the hard part isn't so much the realizing which postulate

195
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,410
to use or how to apply them necessarily

196
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,060
But seeing the triangle seeing that

197
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,390
there's some information there

198
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,900
Seeing that you could figure out BE by subtracting it from AE minus BE

199
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,350
Seeing that there are two triangles kind of overlapping in the star

200
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,250
or arms or whatever you might want to call it
