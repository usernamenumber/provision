We are asked to find the values of sin of theta and cos of theta for theta is equal to pi over 3, 2 pi over 3, 4 pi over 3 and 5 pi over 3 and I assume that they are talking about these angle measures being in radians. So let's figure out what this is going to be. And to do that let's set up ourselves with a little bit of a unit circle, we'll use unit circle definitions of our trig functions especially because I suspect many of these are going to not be able to be done purely with SOH CAH TOA. They are going to be beyond 90 degrees or beyond, so let's figure out, so let's see there's our unit circle and also just to kind of visualize these a little better, maybe use out knowledge of some triangles where we know the angle measures and degrees. Let's convert these radian measures to degree measures. So if we have pi over 3 radians , so pi over 3 radians, is going to be equal to well we know we know how many degrees are there how many degrees are there per radian. Well for every 180 degrees you have pi r
