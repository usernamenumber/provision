1
00:00:00,683 --> 00:00:12,203
Let's say that f(x) is equal to x^2 + x - 6/x - 2.

2
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:15,934
And we're curious about what the limit of f(x)

3
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:21,202
as x approaches 2 is equal to.

4
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:23,937
Now, the first attempt that you might want to do,

5
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:25,770
right when you see something like this,

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,138
is just see what happens, what is f(2)?

7
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:29,468
Now, this won't always be the limit,

8
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:30,869
even if it is defined.

9
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,285
But it is a good place to start,

10
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:35,205
just to see if something reasonable could pop out.

11
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:38,600
So looking at it this way, if we just evaluate f(2),

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,681
in our numerator, we're going to get 2^2 + 2 - 6.

13
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:44,940
So, that's going to be 4 + 2, which is 6, - 6.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,763
So you're going to get 0 in the numerator,

15
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:49,334
and you're going to get 0 in the denominator.

16
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:54,017
So, we don't have – the function is not defined at x = 2.

17
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:58,302
WRITING: f not defined.

18
00:00:58,302 --> 00:00:59,930
So there's no simple thing there.

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,801
Even if this did evaluate, if it was a continuous function,

20
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,798
then actually the limit would be whatever the function is.

21
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:07,333
But that isn't necessarily the case.

22
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,337
But we see very clearly that the function is not defined here.

23
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,004
So, let's see if we can simplify this.

24
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:14,229
And we'll also try to graph it in some way.

25
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:16,474
So one thing that might have jumped out at your head is

26
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:19,006
you might want to factor this expression on top.

27
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:20,343
So, if we want to rewrite this,

28
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:22,272
we could rewrite the top expression –

29
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:24,873
(And this just goes back to your Algebra I.)

30
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:28,640
Two numbers whose product is -6 and whose sum is +3 –

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,334
Well, that could be + 3 and -2.

32
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:40,977
So this could be x + 3 × x - 2, all of that over x - 2.

33
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:43,670
So, as long as x does not equal 2,

34
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,560
these two things will cancel out.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,735
So we could say this is equal to x + 3

36
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:58,409
for all x's except for x = 2, as long as x does not equal 2.

37
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,143
So that's another way of looking at it.

38
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:02,229
Now, another way we could rewrite our f(x) –

39
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,605
(I'll do it in blue, just to change the colors.)

40
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:07,419
– we could rewrite f(x) – this is the exact same function –

41
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:14,424
f(x) is equal to x + 3 when x does not equal 2.

42
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:20,499
And we could even say it's undefined when x = 2.

43
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:24,337
So given this definition, it becomes much clearer to us

44
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:26,937
how we can actually graph f(x).

45
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:29,424
So let's try to do it.

46
00:02:29,424 --> 00:02:33,336
DRAWING: (So that is not anywhere near being a straight line.

47
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,919
That is much better.)

48
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,237
Let's call this the y axis.

49
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:38,462
We'll call it y = f(x).

50
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:41,320
And then let's, over here, let me make

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,659
a horizontal line that is my x axis.

52
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:48,334
So defined this way, f(x) = x + 3.

53
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:53,984
So if this is 1, 2, 3, we have a y-intercept at 3,

54
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:55,885
and then the slope is 1.

55
00:02:55,885 --> 00:03:00,591
But it's defined for all x's except for x = 2.

56
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:04,081
So this is x = 1, this is x = 2.

57
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:07,480
So when x = 2, it is undefined.

58
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,791
So let me make sure I can –

59
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,460
So it's undefined right over there.

60
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,825
DRAWING: So it's undefined right over there.

61
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:22,598
So this is what f(x) looks like.

62
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:25,204
Now, given this, let's try to answer our question.

63
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,236
What is the limit of f(x) as x approaches 2?

64
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:30,483
Well, we could look at this graphically.

65
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:33,819
As x approaches 2 from lower values than 2 –

66
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,332
(So this, right over here, is x = 2.)

67
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:40,735
If we get to maybe, let's say this is 1.7,

68
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:43,572
we see that our f(x) is right over there.

69
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:46,822
If we get to 1. 9, our f(x) is right over there.

70
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:52,014
So it seems to be approaching this value right over there.

71
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:56,475
Similarly, as we approach 2 from values greater than it,

72
00:03:56,475 --> 00:04:00,178
if we're at like – I don't know – this could be, like, 2.5 –

73
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:02,264
our f(x) is right over there.

74
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:06,934
If we get even closer to 2, our f(x) is right over there.

75
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:10,422
And once again, we look like we are approaching this value.

76
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:11,534
Or, another way of thinking about it,

77
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:13,868
if we ride this line from the positive direction,

78
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:16,842
we seem to be approaching this value for f(x).

79
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:19,257
If we ride this line from the negative direction –

80
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:20,674
from values less than 2 –

81
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:24,936
we seem to be approaching this value right over here.

82
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:31,074
And this is essentially the value of x + 3 if we set x = 2.

83
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:33,201
So, this is essentially going to be –

84
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:36,204
this value right over here is equal to 5

85
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:37,744
if we just look at it visually.

86
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:43,532
If we just graphed a line with slope 1, with a y-intercept of 3,

87
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:45,799
this value right over here is 5.

88
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:50,732
Now, we can also try to do this numerically.

89
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:52,531
So let's try to do that.

90
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:55,314
So, if this is our function definition –

91
00:04:55,314 --> 00:05:00,417
completely identical to our original definition,

92
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:04,106
then we just try values as x gets closer and closer to 2.

93
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:05,837
So let's try values less than 2.

94
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:08,263
So, 1.99999 –

95
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:09,124
(This is almost obvious.)

96
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:16,194
1.999 + 3, well that gets you pretty darned close to 5.

97
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:18,344
If I put even more 9's here, and get even closer to 2,

98
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:20,400
we'd get even closer to 5 here.

99
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,859
If we approach 2 from the positive direction –

100
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,582
And then, once again, we're getting

101
00:05:26,582 --> 00:05:29,159
closer and closer to 5 from the positive direction.

102
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:32,326
If we were even closer to 2, we'd be even closer to 5.

103
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:34,118
So, whether we look at it numerically,

104
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:36,828
or we look at it graphically, it looks pretty clear

105
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:43,185
that the limit here is going to be equal to 5.
