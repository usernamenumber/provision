1
00:00:00,673 --> 00:00:04,017
Let's do another ratio problem that's a bit of a classic.

2
00:00:04,017 --> 00:00:08,800
So, let's say that I start off with a certain number of fruit.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,267
So, I have some number of fruit.

4
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:13,200
But I'll get back to that in a second.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,533
But we know that the ratio.

6
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:20,333
We know that the ratio -- we know that the ratio of apples

7
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,133
-- I'll do apples in this reddish color.

8
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:28,700
The ratio of apples to oranges.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,267
To oranges, those colors are very similar.

10
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:37,732
Let's say, it is equal to -- let's say it is equal to five:eight.

11
00:00:37,732 --> 00:00:41,441
So it's equal to five:eight.

12
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,400
five:eight.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,743
Or I could also write it as five:eight, just like that.

14
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:48,600
That's the ratio of apples to oranges.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,709
Now, the next thing that I know about this problem is that when

16
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:56,657
I take away fifteen -- when I take away fifteen apples.

17
00:00:56,657 --> 00:01:14,304
So, take away fifteen apples, and the ratio becomes 1 to 4

18
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:18,669
The ratio of apples to oranges becomes 1 to 4

19
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:29,164
How many apples -- let me write it this way. how many total, how many total not how many apples

20
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:55,267
how many, How much, let me say how much total fruit do I have, I have after taking away the fifteen apples? he fifteen apples

21
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:57,415
How much total fruit do I have?

22
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:00,210
So let's do a little bit of algebra.

23
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:08,049
Let's say that x is the number, x is equal to the number of

24
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:14,864
fruit that we start with.

25
00:02:14,864 --> 00:02:17,555
How much fruit are we going to end up with at the end?

26
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,733
We're taking away fifteen apples. We're not doing anything to the oranges.

27
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:23,615
So we know that x minus thirty, I'll do that in a different

28
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:31,278
color, x minus oh x fifteen, we take away fifteen apples, xminus 15 is equal

29
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:41,898
to the number of fruit we end up with.

30
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:43,979
We know these two things are true.

31
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,812
And now, we know that we start off with a ratio of five:eight.

32
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:52,989
So we know that the ratio of apples to oranges is equal to

33
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,125
five:eight that we start off with.

34
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,533
Or, that's just another way of saying that for every group --

35
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:04,921
assuming that we can divide our group of fruit into even -- or

36
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:07,524
I can divide it into a set of groups, and every group

37
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:09,475
has the same number of apples and oranges.

38
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:23,825
That means that for every group of, what, thirteen fruits, thirteen fruits,

39
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:38,331
there are five apples and eight oranges.

40
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:41,400
That's what this tells me. For every group of thirteen fruits, there are five

41
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,469
apples and eighteen oranges.

42
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:45,785
And how many groups of thirteen fruit are there?

43
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:48,225
Well, I have x total fruit.

44
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:53,523
So if I divide x divided by thirteen, if I take x divided by thirteen,

45
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:58,724
that is equal to -- this is thirteen thirteen right here, this is the thirteen

46
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:01,933
at thirteen fruits per group, I have x total fruit.

47
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:09,777
So this is the total number of groups, So this is equal to the number of groups.

48
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:12,467
Now, for every group, I have five apples.

49
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:15,187
So how many apples am I starting off with?

50
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:16,348
There is a number of groups.

51
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:17,788
For every group, I have five apples.

52
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:21,747
So I'm starting off with five times that apples.

53
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:24,340
fivex over thirteen apples.

54
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,267
5 x over thirteen apples

55
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,200
Now, for every one of these groups, I also have eight oranges.

56
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,697
So, how many oranges do I have?

57
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:33,962
I have eight times that.

58
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:36,410
Because for every one of these, I have eight oranges.

59
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,940
So eight times that is eightx over thirteen oranges.

60
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,054
Fair enough.

61
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:42,333
That's what I start off with.

62
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:47,788
Now, when I'm done we said that the ratio, the rato of apples to oranges

63
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,574
the ratio of apples to oranges becomes 1 to 4.

64
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:55,071
Becomes 1 to 4

65
00:04:55,071 --> 00:05:01,604
Or, another way of saying that is that, for every five -- right,

66
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:06,687
if you add these two numbers together, for every five fruit

67
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:20,064
there are one apple and four oranges.

68
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:21,248
Fair enough.

69
00:05:21,248 --> 00:05:24,452
So, how many groups of five fruit do we have?

70
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:27,053
Well, this is the total number of fruit we're left with

71
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,771
after we took fifteen away.

72
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:31,140
So how many groups of five do we have?

73
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,719
We take the total number of fruit.

74
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:34,809
x minus fifteen.

75
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:38,384
Divide it by how many fruit we have per group.

76
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:41,775
And this is how many groups of -- this is equal to

77
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:46,372
the groups of five fruit.

78
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:47,719
Of five fruit.

79
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:50,134
Now, for each of these groups, I'm going to have

80
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:52,781
one apple and four oranges.

81
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:56,124
So how many apples and oranges do I now have after I took

82
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:57,471
away fifteen of the apples?

83
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,979
I took away fifteen fruit?

84
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,790
Let's think about this a little bit.

85
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,437
How many apples am I going to have?

86
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:06,533
I have one apple for every one of these groups.

87
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,803
So, that's how many -- so the number of groups is the

88
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:09,667
number of apples I have.

89
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:14,524
So, I'm going to have x minus fifteen over five apples.

90
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,800
And then how many oranges am I going to have?

91
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,267
For every one of these groups, I'm going to have four oranges.

92
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:22,532
So, I'm going to have four times this many oranges.

93
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:30,402
So we can write that as 4 over 5 times x minus fifteen oranges, right

94
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:33,733
That's just five times the number of groups of five fruit.

95
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,622
Now, what doesn't change?

96
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:38,733
I'm messing with the number of apples, but I never changed

97
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:39,867
the number of oranges.

98
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:43,200
So, this number which is the number of oranges we

99
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,133
started off with, has to equal this number.

100
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,933
The number of oranges we ended up with.

101
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:52,270
There's many ways to do this problem, but this is the way that's popping out of me that might be straightforward.

102
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,587
So let's see if we can solve for x.

103
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:56,133
This has to be equal to that.

104
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:57,200
That never changed.

105
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:09,237
So you could say 8 x over 13 is equal to 4 fifth times x minus fifteen.

106
00:07:09,237 --> 00:07:12,867
And, maybe, the best way to do this, let's multiply both sides

107
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,653
of this equation times five / four.

108
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:20,533
So, times five / four times five / four.

109
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,246
These cancel out. That just becomes one.

110
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:24,400
What does this become?

111
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,425
This becomes, you see you get a four, divide it by four you get a two there.

112
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:30,723
This becomes tenx over thirteen.

113
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:34,933
tenx over thirteen, that's the left-thand side, is

114
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:39,667
equal to x minus fifteen.

115
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,961
Now, let's subtract x from both sides.

116
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:50,018
And we get tenx over thirteen minus x is equal to minus fifteen.

117
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:52,600
Let me scroll down a little bit.

118
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,133
And so, what is this?

119
00:07:54,133 --> 00:08:01,452
This is the same thing as tenx over thirteen minus thirteenx over thirteen, all right

120
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:02,921
That's just x.

121
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:04,438
Is equal to minus fourteen.

122
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:10,429
And then, ten minus thirteen, this is equal to -- so this is minus threex

123
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:17,766
over thirteen, is equal to minus fifteen.

124
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:20,135
Now, we can just multiply both sides of this equation

125
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:25,197
by minus thirteen over three.

126
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:28,772
Multiply this side by minus thirteen over three.

127
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:31,791
I picked that number so that this and that cancel out.

128
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,533
And that and that cancel out, and the negatives cancel out.

129
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:37,410
So I'm just left with x on that side.

130
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,407
And then, the right-hand side becomes what?

131
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:42,008
The negatives cancel out.

132
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:44,067
I can divide the fifteen and the three by three, so that becomes a five.

133
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:47,733
And then this becomes a one.

134
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:49,903
And I'm just left with five times thirteen.

135
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,225
This was just, times plus thirteen, I wrote that just to make sure

136
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:54,732
that you understood that the negatives canceled out.

137
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:56,869
So, five times thirteen is what?

138
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:01,048
five times twelve is sixty, so x is equal to sixty-five.

139
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:02,720
But that is not our answer.

140
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,533
Remember what x was.

141
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:08,200
x was the number of fruit we started with.

142
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,962
We just figured out that this is equal to sixty-five.

143
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:14,725
But what the question asked, the question wanted to know is,

144
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:18,579
how much total fruit do I have after taking away the fifteen apples.

145
00:09:18,582 --> 00:09:23,246
So the question wants to know, how many after taking the fifteen apples.

146
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:26,099
If I started with sixty-five, I give away fifteen of the fruit, all of

147
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:30,190
them are apples, then I'm left with sixty-five minus fifteen,

148
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,252
which is equal to?

149
00:09:33,252 --> 00:09:37,013
fifty apples, oh not, fifty pieces of fruit.

150
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:40,966
fifty pieces of fruit.

151
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:43,332
That's what they're asking for.

152
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,400
fifty pieces of fruit.

153
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,867
If you want, you can go on and figure out how many apples you

154
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:49,067
started with, you finished with, the number of oranges, or

155
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,552
whatever else, but this is what they're asking.

156
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:54,292
How much total fruit, not the number of apples, total fruit,

157
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:58,555
do I have after taking away the fifteen apples?
