1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,467
Let’s say we we've been hanging out in scenario E for a bunch of days.

2
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:08,533
On average we've been catching one rabbit, but gathering 280 berries.

3
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:12,794
We were, I guess, in a berry mood, so this is scenario E right over here.

4
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:15,400
But now all of a sudden we are in a mood for more proteins.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,503
So let me write down: we are in scenario E

6
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:23,336
and we are in the mood for more protein.

7
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:25,658
And so we want to think about what are the trade-offs.

8
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,562
If we try to catch more rabbits

9
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:30,351
So what I want to do, I want to say,

10
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:37,314
if I want to catch one more rabbit,

11
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:38,324
what am I going to have to give up.

12
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:39,333
So if I catch one more rabbit,

13
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,611
so I go from one rabbit, on average, to two rabbits a day,

14
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,349
so I am going from scenario E to scenario D,

15
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:46,851
what am I going to give up?

16
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:48,599
So this is plus one over here.

17
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:52,488
Well, I am going to give up forty berries

18
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:54,667
and you can see visually right here.

19
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,169
If I try to get one more rabbit,

20
00:00:56,169 --> 00:01:00,581
I can't go into this impossible, this unattainable part right over here.

21
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:03,507
I have to stay on the production possibilities frontier,

22
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:08,243
sometimes abbreviated as PPF

23
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:11,262
or I guess the acronym for it, I should say, is PPF.

24
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:13,166
But if I want one more rabbit,

25
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:17,000
the production possibilities frontier drops off

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and I will have to give up forty fruits.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,661
So one more rabbit means that I have a cost.

28
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:30,581
So I have to give up, on average, forty berries

29
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:33,321
and the technical term for what I have just described is

30
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:39,581
the opportunity cost of going after one more rabbit is giving up forty berries.

31
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,003
So let me write this down.

32
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:51,793
The opportunity cost of one more rabbit

33
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:55,090
and this is particular to scenario E, as we will see,

34
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:58,067
is going to change depending on what scenario we are in,

35
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:59,931
at least for this example.

36
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:06,345
So the opportunity cost of one more rabbit is 40 berries.

37
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:09,591
Assuming we are in scenario E.

38
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:12,656
One more rabbit, I have to give up 40 berries.

39
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:15,674
And another term, when we talk about the opportunity cost,

40
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:19,343
of going after, of producing, I guess we could say

41
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:21,990
the opportunity cost of producing one more rabbit here.

42
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,591
When we talk about the opportunity cost of producing one more unit

43
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:27,056
is sometimes called the marginal cost.

44
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:33,759
So this, right over here, you can also view as the marginal cost.

45
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,340
In this context of this video our costs are in terms of

46
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,334
the thing that I am giving up, the opportunity that I am giving up.

47
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:43,908
In other scenarios, we will see sometimes

48
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:47,000
the marginal cost be given in actual monetary units, like dollars of whatever else.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,340
what was the cost of producing that extra unit, that extra widget right over there

50
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,637
let‘s make sure we understand opportunity cost

51
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:57,400
so that's, when we are sitting in scenario E, the opportunity cost

52
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,235
of one more rabbit

53
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:03,667
but whats the opportunity cost, lets say we are tired of eating meat

54
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,667
we are sitting in scenario E and we want to become vegetarians all together

55
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:10,986
so we want to go to scenario F

56
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:14,839
essentially not eat any rabbits and eat as much fruit as possible

57
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:17,204
so another thing that you could ask in scenario E

58
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:24,538
is the opportunity cost of

59
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,899
and just to make the numbers easier

60
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:33,322
I am going to say, opportunity cost of 20 more berries

61
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:38,012
is, well I am going to give up a rabbit

62
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:40,845
so over here what we are doing is, we are saying

63
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:46,088
OK, I want to increase my berries by 20, but to do that I have to decrease my rabbits by one

64
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:50,319
so the opportunity cost, assuming we are in scenario E

65
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:57,238
the opportunity cost of 20 more berries is one rabbit

66
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,400
now this, right over here, is not a marginal cost

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,085
cause I am talking about the cost of 20 more units

68
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:03,972
not just one

69
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:07,641
if I want to write this as a marginal cost of one more berry

70
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:10,845
then I could just say, well 20 berries is one rabbit

71
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:14,328
you could say, you could essentially divide both sides by 20

72
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:18,972
so one more berry

73
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:23,400
and I will assume for those who want to get more technical, its somewhat linear right over here

74
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,170
one more berry, if we divide both sides by 20

75
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:32,672
is 1/20 of a rabbit

76
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:36,400
so if I go for one extra berry, sitting in scenario E

77
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,333
on average, I am going to get 1/20 less of a rabbit

78
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:51,991
and when I phrase it this way, it is being phrased as a marginal cost

79
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,988
now, for those who want to get a little technical

80
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:57,426
this is a curve, right over here, so it might not be exactly this

81
00:04:57,426 --> 00:04:59,654
we can't just, well, I don't want to get too technical

82
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:04,251
for the sake of this one right over here, this is a safe way to think about it

83
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:06,898
the opportunity cost of 20 more berries is one rabbit

84
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:10,067
but if we assume that it's somewhat linear right over here

85
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,982
its not so curved, it's somewhat of a line between those two points

86
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:17,672
then the opportunity cost of 1 berry is 1/20 of a rabbit

87
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:22,177
or the marginal cost of an extra berry is 1/20 of a rabbit

88
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:23,988
and we could do it at different points on this curve

89
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:26,682
and I actually encourage you to do, based on the data that we have

90
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:29,329
in this table that we constructed in the last video, and maybe this curve

91
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,973
think about what the opportunity cost is in the different scenarios

92
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:37,316
if you're in scenario B, and if you want an extra rabbit

93
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:41,635
how much is that going to cost you in terms of berries

94
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:48,159
or if you want more berries, what is that going to cost you in terms of rabbits?
