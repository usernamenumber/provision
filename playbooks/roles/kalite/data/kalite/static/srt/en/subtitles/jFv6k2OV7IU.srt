1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,290
We know that solid phosphorus
will react with chlorine gas

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:11,000
to spontaneously produce
phosphorus trichloride, liquid

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,330
phosphorus trichloride.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,720
And we're told that we have 1.45
grams of solid molecular

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:18,980
phosphorus.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,830
And we're asked how many grams
of chlorine is required to

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,190
essentially use up all of the
phosphorus that we have?

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,509
And how many grams of phosphorus
trichloride is

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,080
going to be produced?

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,130
Now before you do any of these
stoichiometry problems. And

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,180
that's just a fancy word for
problems where you need to

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,960
figure out how much of a certain
reactant is required.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,070
Or how much of a product is
going to be produced.

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,590
Before you do any of these
problems you have to make sure

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,990
that your reaction, or that your
equation, is balanced.

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,000
So let's make sure.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,570
So on the left-hand side,
here, this molecule of

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,670
phosphorus has four phosphorus
atoms. So on the whole

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,620
left-hand side, all of our
reactants combined have 4

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,770
phosphorus atoms. So our
products also need to have 4

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,100
phosphorus atoms. But the
way it's written right

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,020
now, I only have 1.

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,200
So let me just multiply
this guy by 4.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,990
Now I have 4 phosphorus atoms on
both sides of the equation.

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,870
Let's balance the
chlorine now.

27
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,560
On the left-hand side I only
have 2 chlorine atoms. This 1

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,490
molecule of chlorine
has 2 atoms in it.

29
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,370
Here I have each molecule
of phosphorus

30
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,980
trichloride has 3 chlorines.

31
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,650
And I have 4 molecules of it.

32
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,760
So 4 times 12, I have
12 chlorine's on

33
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,930
the right-hand side.

34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,330
So 12 on the right-hand side.

35
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,650
I need to have 12 on the left.

36
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,930
I only have 2 here.

37
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,760
Let me multiply that by 6.

38
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,190
6 times 2 is 12.

39
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,760
4 times 3 is 12.

40
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,500
Now our equation is
all balanced.

41
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,440
4 phosphoruses each side,
and twelve chlorines.

42
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,620
Now the next thing we have to
do, now that we know that we

43
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,280
have a balanced equation and
we can get into the meat of

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,680
the problem, is figure out how
many moles of phosphorus we're

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,250
dealing with.

46
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,700
Because once we know the
moles, we can use

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,480
stoichiometric ratios.

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,320
Which is just essentially
saying, look, for every mole

49
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,460
of that, I need 6
moles of that.

50
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,260
And for every mole of
that, I'm going to

51
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,910
produce 4 moles of that.

52
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,730
So you want to get it all
in terms of moles.

53
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,500
So let's figure out how many
moles of phosphorus

54
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,390
we have on our hands.

55
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,880
Let's look at our
periodic table.

56
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,530
This periodic table, we
have to give proper

57
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,710
attribution to the maker.

58
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,640
It's made by Le Van
Han Cedric.

59
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,610
I got this off of Wikimedia
Creative Commons.

60
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,220
It had an attribution license.

61
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,300
Other than that, we're
free to use it.

62
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,160
And let's gi to phosphorus.

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,760
Phosphorous right here has its
atomic weight of 30.974.

64
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,950
Let's just round
that up to 31.

65
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,800
Let me write it down
right here.

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:03:04,060
So phosphorus has atomic
weight of 31.

67
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,820
Which tells us that a mole of
phosphorus will weigh 31

68
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,650
grams. Remember a mole is this,
you know, 6.02 times 10

69
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,010
to the 20th.

70
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,460
It's this huge number of atoms.
If you have that many

71
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,530
number of atoms of atomic
prosperous.

72
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,580
It's going to weight at 31
grams. Now if you look at the

73
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,470
atomic weight of P4, or a
molecule that has 4 phosphorus

74
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,910
atoms in it, it's going
to be 4 times this.

75
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,460
So it's going to have an atomic
weight of-- well,

76
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,480
what's 4 times 31?

77
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,910
it's 124-- of 124.

78
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:48,140
Which means that 1 mole of--
let me write it here-- this

79
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:54,930
tells us, right there, that
1 mole of solid molecular

80
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,536
phosphorus is going to have a--
well, since we're doing it

81
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:08,540
in grams, I should say, will
have a mass of 124 grams. Now,

82
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,870
given that, we can use that
with this information to

83
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,260
figure out how many moles of
molecular phosphorus we have.

84
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,279
Solid molecular phosphorus.

85
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,029
So let me start over here.

86
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:28,240
So we have 1.45 grams-- let
me write it this way-- of

87
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,220
molecular phosphorus, each
molecule containing 4 atoms.

88
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,770
And we could just do a little
dimensional analysis, and make

89
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,770
sure everything cancels out.

90
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,890
Times this information
right here.

91
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:50,140
We have 1 mole of molecular
phosphorus for every 124 grams

92
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,870
of molecular phosphorus.

93
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,900
I should write this here, just
so we remember what we're

94
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,930
talking about.

95
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,460
1 mole of molecular phosphorus
for every 124 grams of

96
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,650
molecular phosphorus.

97
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,990
And then this cancels out.

98
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,460
So the units at least
cancel out.

99
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,290
The grams of phosphorus.

100
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:21,500
And then we get 1.45 times
1/124 moles of molecular

101
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,050
phosphorus.

102
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,450
And we can figure that out.

103
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,780
Let's get our calculator out.

104
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,600
It's 1.45-- we could just say
divided by 124, right?

105
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,180
That's the same thing as
multiplying by 1/124.

106
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:45,630
So divided by 124 is equal to
0.001-- I'll just round it, 7.

107
00:05:45,630 --> 00:06:04,480
So this is equal to 0.0117
moles of phosphorus.

108
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,670
That's what we're starting
off with.

109
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,170
That's what this
1.45 grams are.

110
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,660
And that makes sense.

111
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,270
If we had an entire mole of
molecular phosphorus, it would

112
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,820
weigh a 124 grams. We only
have 1.45 of that.

113
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,760
So it's a little bit more than
1/100, which makes sense.

114
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,300
This number right here is a
little more than 1/100.

115
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,620
Now, we need to think about,
for every mole,

116
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,560
let's scroll down here.

117
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,120
Although I don't want
to lose my equation.

118
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,430
We need to think about for every
mole-- so let me write

119
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:45,340
down, so we have 0.0117 moles
of molecular phosphorus.

120
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,260
And for every mole of
phosphorus, how many moles of

121
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,050
chlorine molecules do we need?

122
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,360
So let me write this down.

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,830
So for every 6 moles of chlorine
gas-- I'll do it in

124
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:13,650
blue-- for every 6 moles of
chlorine gas, we need 1 mole

125
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,260
of molecular phosphorus.

126
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,450
And the reason I wrote it this
way, instead of writing 1 mole

127
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,990
of molecular phosphorus for
every 6 moles of chlorine gas,

128
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,965
is because I want to make sure
the units cancel out.

129
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:26,930
And it also should make sense
for you intuitively.

130
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,720
If I have 1 of this, I'm going
to need 6 of this.

131
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,080
If I have 0.0117 of this, I'm
going to need 6 times of the

132
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,060
chlorine gas.

133
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,340
And the units work out.

134
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,960
This cancels out with that.

135
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,520
And I'm just essentially
multiplying by 6.

136
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,470
So we're going to have
6 times 0.0117.

137
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,060
I think I still have that
on my calculator.

138
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,070
Yes, it's right there.

139
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:59,460
So times 6, is equal to 0.07.

140
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,500
I'll just keep it there because
then it is 0 again.

141
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:13,590
So this is equal to 0.07 moles
of chlorine gas required.

142
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,650
And I could write
it right here.

143
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,560
Let me write, required.

144
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,360
Required in the numerator.

145
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,090
Required in the denomenator.

146
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,780
That makes a little bit more
sense or it clarifies things.

147
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,440
For every 6 moles of chlorine
gas that are required, 1 mole

148
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,120
of phosphorus is required, of
solid phosphorus, is required.

149
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,270
Or we could say for every mole
of phosphorus is required, you

150
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,140
need 6 moles of chlorine gas.

151
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,340
We got that just from the
original equation.

152
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,809
So I'll write this, required,
down right there.

153
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,820
So we're almost there.

154
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,440
We figured out that 0.07 moles
of chlorine gas are required.

155
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,830
But we want to find out
how many grams of

156
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,180
chlorine gas are required.

157
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,860
So we just have to figure
out how many grams

158
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,680
there are per mole?

159
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,870
So let's figure that out.

160
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,470
Let's look at the chlorine.

161
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,150
Chlorine is off here
to the right.

162
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,320
This is a super huge
periodic table.

163
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:12,960
Chlorine, right here, has an
atomic weight of 35.453.

164
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:24,090
So chlorine, 35.453
atomic weight.

165
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,430
The weighted average of
all of the isotopes

166
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,605
of chlorine on earth.

167
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:31,760
So molecular chlorine gas, which
has 2 atoms, is going to

168
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,070
have twice that.

169
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,510
So I could do it in my head.

170
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,770
It is going to be, right,
about what?

171
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,750
70.9?

172
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,350
I'll just use a calculator.

173
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,210
I don't want to make a
silly math mistake.

174
00:09:45,210 --> 00:10:04,850
35.453 times 2 is
equal to 70.906.

175
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,720
I didn't even need
the calculator.

176
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,580
So it's equal to 70.906.

177
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,110
My memory is bad.

178
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:18,690
70.906 atomic weight.

179
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,020
Which tells us that-- well, let
me write this information

180
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,600
that we had down before.

181
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,930
We were required to have 0.07
moles of chlorine gas.

182
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,650
That is what is required.

183
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,900
And let's multiply it.

184
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,540
We want moles in the
denominator.

185
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,860
So we want moles in the
denominator here.

186
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:48,610
So 1 mole of chlorine gas.

187
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,130
For every mole, what's
the mass going to be?

188
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,000
Well if the atomic weight of
chlorine gas is 70.906, that

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,060
means one mole of it is going
to have a mass of 70.906

190
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,210
grams. So for every mole,
we have 70.90 grams.

191
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,430
We have 0.07 moles.

192
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,770
So we will multiply 0.07 times
70 to figure out how many

193
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,680
grams we have. And the
units cancel out.

194
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,010
We have moles of chlorine gas
and we're just going to have

195
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,130
grams required.

196
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,230
So this is going to
be equal to 70

197
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,850
times 0.07 grams required.

198
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,610
So let's get that over here.

199
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:41,020
So we already have the 70.906
times 0.07 is equal to 4.96

200
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:52,580
grams. So 4.96 grams of-- and
actually this is grams of

201
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,520
chlorine gas.

202
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,400
I should write that there.

203
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,940
So grams of chlorine
gas are required.

204
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,650
Even the required worked out
with the dimensional analysis.

205
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,490
And we've answered the first
part of the problem.

206
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,270
If we have 1.45 grams of
phosphorus as one of the

207
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,900
reactants, then we're
going to need 4.96.

208
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,350
4.96 grams of chlorine
are required.

209
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,020
Now, the second question
is how much phosphorus

210
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,050
trichloride is produced?

211
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,840
Now there's two ways to do it.

212
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,110
An easy way and a hard way.

213
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,920
The easy way says, well,
mass is conserved.

214
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,790
If you have grams on the side,
the total mass on this side

215
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,170
has to be equal to the total
mass on that side.

216
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,320
That's the easy way.

217
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,010
The slightly harder way is you
could have done the exact same

218
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,100
thing we did with the chlorine
gas, you could do it with the

219
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,640
phosphorus trichloride.

220
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,620
You could say, hey, for
every mole of this, I

221
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,200
need 4 moles of that.

222
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,840
And then figure out the mass of
each mole and multiply and

223
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,460
do all of that.

224
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,220
But let's do it the easy way.

225
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,050
We know that we have 1.45 grams
of this reactant, and we

226
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,190
have 4.96 grams of
this reactant.

227
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,830
So this, which is the only
product right here, this

228
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,090
product right here must have
a mass of our combined

229
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,950
reactants, because it's
going to react fully.

230
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,820
So let's figure that out.

231
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,920
We have 4.96.

232
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:25,560
I'll just round 4.96 plus 1.45
is equal to 6.41 grams of

233
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,440
phosphorus trichloride.

234
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,250
6.41 grams. And we're done.

235
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,533
