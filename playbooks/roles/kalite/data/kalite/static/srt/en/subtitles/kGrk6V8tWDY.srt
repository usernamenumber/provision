1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870
   

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,170
I've got this source of a wave
right here that's moving to

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,150
the right at some velocity.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:14,510
So let's just say that the
velocity of the source-- let's

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,460
call it v sub s to the right--
so we're really going to do

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,180
what we do in the last video,
but we're going to do it in

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,630
more abstract terms so we can
come up with a generalized

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,160
formula for the observed
frequency.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,190
So that's how fast he's moving
to the right, and he's

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,400
emitting a wave. Let's say the
wave that he's emitting-- so

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,930
the velocity of wave--
let's call that v

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,270
sub w radially outward.

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,510
We've got to give a magnitude
and a direction.

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,760
So radially outward.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,070
   

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,660
That's the velocity of the wave,
and that wave is going

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,950
to have a period and a
frequency, but it's going to

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,550
have a period and a frequency
associated from the point of

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,630
view of the source.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,515
And we're going to
do everything.

21
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:02,840
This is all classical
mechanics.

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,959
We're not going to be talking
about relativistic speed, so

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,580
we don't have to worry about all
of the strange things that

24
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,580
happen as things approach
the speed of light.

25
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,670
So let's just say it has
some period of-- let me

26
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,130
write it this way.

27
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,220
The source period, which is the
period of the wave from

28
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,890
the perspective of the source,
so the source period, we'll

29
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,850
call it t sub source, And the
source frequency, which would

30
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,400
just be-- we've learned,
hopefully it's intuitive now--

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,900
would be the inverse of this.

32
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:42,790
So the source frequency would
be-- we'll call it f sub s.

33
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,960
And these two things are the
inverse of each other.

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,300
The inverse of the period
of a wave is its

35
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,060
frequency, vice versa.

36
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,010
So let's think about what's
going to happen.

37
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,930
Let's say at time equal zero,
he emits that first crest,

38
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,430
that first pulse, so he's
just emitted it.

39
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,540
You can't even see it because
it just got emitted.

40
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,020
And now let's fast forward
t seconds.

41
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,695
Let's say that this is in
seconds, so every t seconds,

42
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,410
it emits a new pulse.

43
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,970
First of all, where is
that first pulse

44
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,800
after t sub s seconds?

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,170
Well, you multiply the velocity
of that first pulse

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,650
times the time.

47
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,780
Velocity times time is going
to give you a distance.

48
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,200
If you don't believe me, I'll
show you an example.

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,980
If I tell you the velocity is 5
meters per second, and let's

50
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,850
say that this period is 2
seconds, that's going to give

51
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,340
you 10 meters.

52
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,580
The seconds cancel out.

53
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,230
So to figure out how far that
wave will have gone after t

54
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,090
sub s seconds, you just multiply
t sub s times the

55
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,830
velocity of the wave.

56
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,160
And let's say it's
gotten over here.

57
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,960
It's radially outward.

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,080
So, I'll draw it radially
outward.

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,690
That's my best attempt
at a circle.

60
00:02:53,690 --> 00:03:00,080
And this distance right here,
this radius right there, that

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,140
is equal to velocity
times time.

62
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,780
The velocity of that first
pulse, v sub w, that's

63
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,510
actually the speed.

64
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,630
I'm saying it's v sub
w radially outward.

65
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,800
This isn't a vector quantity.

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,750
This is just a number
you can imagine.

67
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,450
v sub w times the period,
times t of s.

68
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,100
   

69
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,780
I know it's abstract, but just
think, this is just the

70
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,300
distance times the time.

71
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,330
If this was moving at 10 meters
per second and if the

72
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,190
period is 2 seconds,
this is how far.

73
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,520
It will have gone 10 meters
after 2 seconds.

74
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,635
Now, this thing we said
at the beginning of

75
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:38,100
the video is moving.

76
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,410
So although this is radially
outward from the point at

77
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,340
which it was emitted, this thing
isn't standing still.

78
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,720
We saw this in the last video.

79
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,690
This thing has also moved.

80
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,540
How far?

81
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,700
Well, we do the same thing.

82
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,330
We multiply its velocity times
the same number of time.

83
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,770
Remember, we're saying what does
this look like after t

84
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,230
sub s seconds, or some period
of time t sub s.

85
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,130
Well, this thing is moving
to the right.

86
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,660
Let's say it's here.

87
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,570
Let's say it's moved
right over here.

88
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,470
In this video, we're assuming
that the velocity of our

89
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,440
source is strictly less than the
velocity of the wave. Some

90
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,750
pretty interesting things happen
right when they're

91
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,890
equal, and, obviously, when
it goes the other way.

92
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,860
But we're going to assume that
it's strictly less than.

93
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,150
The source is traveling slower
than the actual wave.

94
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,290
But what is this distance?

95
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,980
Remember, we're talking
about-- let me do it

96
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,550
in orange as well.

97
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,650
This orange reality is what's
happened after t sub s

98
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,160
seconds, you can say.

99
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,360
So this distance right here.

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,390
That distance right there--
I'll do it in a different

101
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,540
color-- is going to be the
velocity of the source.

102
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,350
It's going to be v sub
s times the amount of

103
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,190
time that's gone by.

104
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,340
And I said at the beginning,
that amount of time is the

105
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,480
period of the wave. That's
the time in question.

106
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,340
So period of the wave t sub s.

107
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,950
So after one period of the wave,
if that's 5 seconds,

108
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,910
then we'll say, after 5 seconds,
the source has moved

109
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:07,800
this far, v sub s times t sub s,
and that first crest of our

110
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,300
wave has moved that far,
V sub w times t sub s.

111
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Now, the time that we're talking
about, that's the

112
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,270
period of the wave
being emitted.

113
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,810
So exactly after that amount of
time, this guy is ready to

114
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,960
emit the next crest.
He has gone

115
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,500
through exactly one cycle.

116
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,390
So he is going to emit
something right now.

117
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,680
So it's just getting emitted
right at that point.

118
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,760
So what is the distance between
the crest that he

119
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,990
emitted t sub s seconds ago or
hours ago or microseconds ago,

120
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,730
we don't know.

121
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,650
What's the distance between this
crest and the one that

122
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,210
he's just emitting?

123
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,600
Well, they're going to move at
the same velocity, but this

124
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,810
guy is already out here, while
this guy is starting off from

125
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,260
the source's position.

126
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,530
So the difference in their
distance, at least when you

127
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,630
look at it this way, is the
distance between the source

128
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,670
here and this crest.

129
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,740
So what is this distance
right here?

130
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,790
What is that distance
right there?

131
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,270
Well, this whole radial
distance, we already said,

132
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,090
this whole radial distance is
v sub w, the velocity of the

133
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,440
wave, times the period of the
wave from the perspective of

134
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,170
the source, and we're going to
subtract out how far the

135
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,540
source itself has moved.

136
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,350
The source has moved in the
direction, in this case, if

137
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,910
we're looking at it from
this point of view,

138
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,050
of that wave front.

139
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,140
So it's going to be minus v
sub s, the velocity of the

140
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,990
source, times the period of the
wave from the perspective

141
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,340
of the source.

142
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,780
So let me ask you a question.

143
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,900
If you're sitting right here, if
you're the observer, you're

144
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,730
this guy right here, you're
sitting right over there, and

145
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,680
you've just had that first
crest, at that exact moment

146
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,190
that first crest has passed you
by, how long are you going

147
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,720
to have to wait for
the next crest?

148
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,520
How long until this one that
this guy's emitting right now

149
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,010
is going to pass you by?

150
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,920
Well, it's going to have
to cover this distance.

151
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,750
It's going to have to
cover that distance.

152
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,650
Let me write this down.

153
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,580
So the question I'm asking is
what is the period from the

154
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,060
point of view of this observer
that's right in the direction

155
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,320
of the movement of the source?

156
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,660
So the period from the point
of view of the observer is

157
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,180
going to be equal to the
distance that the next pulse

158
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,240
has to travel, which is that
business up there.

159
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,900
So let me copy and paste that.

160
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,260
   

161
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,390
So it's going to be that.

162
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,150
Let me get rid of that.

163
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,690
It shouldn't look like an equal
sign, so I can delete

164
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,540
that right over there.

165
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,070
Or a negative sign.

166
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,335
So it's going to be this
distance that the next pulse

167
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,840
is going to travel, that one
that's going to be emitted

168
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,260
right at that moment, divided by
the speed of that pulse, or

169
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,310
the speed of the wave, or the
velocity the wave, and we know

170
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,400
what that is.

171
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,565
That is v sub w.

172
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:58,680
   

173
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,600
Now this gives us the period
of the observation.

174
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:01,770
Now.

175
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,850
If we wanted the frequency-- and
we can manipulate this a

176
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,190
little bit.

177
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,980
Let's do that a little bit.

178
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,940
So we can also write this.

179
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,390
We could factor out the
period of the source.

180
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,630
So t sub s we could
factor out.

181
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:20,440
So it becomes t sub s times the
velocity of the wave minus

182
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,690
the velocity of the source, all
of that over the velocity

183
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,230
of the wave. And so just like
that, we've gotten our formula

184
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,309
for the observed period for this
observer who's sitting

185
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:38,270
right in the path of this moving
object as a function of

186
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,270
the actual period of this wave
source, the wave's velocity

187
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,930
and the velocity
of the source.

188
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,670
Now, if we wanted the frequency,
we just take the

189
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,140
inverse of this.

190
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,340
So let's do that.

191
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,640
So the frequency of the
observer-- so this is how many

192
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,630
seconds it takes for him
to see the next cycle.

193
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,110
If you want cycles per second,
you take the inverse.

194
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,880
So the frequency of the observer
is just going to be

195
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,600
the inverse of this.

196
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,060
So if we take the inverse of
this whole expression, we're

197
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,800
going to get 1 over t sub
s times v sub w over the

198
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,840
velocity of the wave minus
the velocity the source.

199
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,740
And of course, 1 over the period
from the point of view

200
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,580
of the source, this
is the same thing.

201
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,840
This right here is the
same thing as the

202
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,260
frequency of the source.

203
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,070
So there you have it.

204
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,160
We have our two relations.

205
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,010
At least if you are in the path,
if the velocity of the

206
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,690
source is going in
your direction,

207
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,310
then we have our formulas.

208
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,190
And I'll rewrite them, just
because the observed period of

209
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,600
the observer is going to be the
period from the point of

210
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,060
view of the source times the
velocity of the wave minus the

211
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,080
velocity of the source-- that's
the velocity of the

212
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,650
source-- divided by the velocity
of the wave itself.

213
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,640
The frequency, from the point
of view of this observer, is

214
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,560
just the inverse of that,
which is the frequency.

215
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,590
The inverse of the period is the
frequency from the point

216
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,840
of view of the source times
the velocity of the wave

217
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,730
divided by the velocity
of the wave minus the

218
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,450
velocity of the source.

219
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,640
In the next video, I'll do the
exact same exercise, but I'll

220
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,400
just think about what happens to
the observer that's sitting

221
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,960
right there.

222
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,533
