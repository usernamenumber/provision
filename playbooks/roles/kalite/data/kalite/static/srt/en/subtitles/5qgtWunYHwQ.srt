1
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:10,480
Mosaic glass vessels are made from long canes of glass

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,255
that are cut into thin sections and then fused together.

3
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:20,944
To make a spiral cane, a mass of coloured glass

4
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:23,860
is thinly-coated in colourless glass

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,808
then rolled on a marver to give it a cylindrical shape.

6
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:36,057
The glass is flattened by pressing it against the marver with another tool.

7
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:43,971
Gradually the flattened glass is pulled to form a thick ribbon.

8
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:47,810
The ribbon is rolled up onto itself.

9
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:54,516
The glass is then cut free of the metal rod.

10
00:00:56,254 --> 00:01:02,155
The rod is reattached, but this time to the side of the rolled-up glass.

11
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:09,140
After reheating, a second rod is attached to the other side.

12
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:21,344
The rolled-up ribbon is gently stretched from its edges, to form a long cane.

13
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:31,644
The cane is cut into manageable lengths.

14
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:40,807
Once cooled, the cane is cut again, this time into thin sections.

15
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:44,937
The sections are arranged on a ceramic slab

16
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:48,290
and then placed into a furnace.

17
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,580
After the glass softens,

18
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,612
and begins to flow slightly, any gaps are squeezed closed.

19
00:01:57,058 --> 00:02:03,275
While the mosaic sections are still soft, a decorative edge-cane is added.

20
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:09,137
After further reheating, the sections and edge-cane are squeezed and pressed together

21
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:13,591
to form a perfectly flat disc.

22
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,622
The disc is transferred to a 'slumping form'

23
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:20,851
and placed into the furnace.

24
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:24,579
After a few seconds, gravity forces the glass downward

25
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,964
over the form.

26
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:30,453
As the glass and form cool,

27
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:34,177
they can be separated.

28
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,825
Finally, after 'annealing' - or slow cooling -

29
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,454
the bowl can be ground and polished.
