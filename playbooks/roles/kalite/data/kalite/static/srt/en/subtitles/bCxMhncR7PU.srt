1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,390
In the last video we figured
out how many different ways

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:11,790
could 5 people sit in 3 chairs.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,580
So for example, if this is
chair one, this is chair

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,420
two, this is chair three.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,940
We said, well, in chair one
we could put 5 people.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,750
No one's sitting down.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,660
Then there's only going to be 4
people left, so we could put 4

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,940
different people in chair 2.

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,820
And then there would be 3
people left that we could

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,730
put in chair three.

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,220
So the total permutations, the
different ways that people

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,340
could sit in the different
yours if we cared about the

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,220
order-- if we cared about which
chair they were sitting down

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,840
in-- it would be 5
times 4 times 3.

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,800
And another way of thinking
about that-- 5 times 4 times

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,770
3-- that's the same thing.

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:59,290
That equals 5 times 4 times 3
times 2 times 1 over what?

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,880
Over 2 times 1.

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,210
And that's the same thing as 5
factorial over 2 factorial.

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,070
Now where does
this 2 come from?

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,320
How is 2 related
to the 5 and 3?

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,850
What's the difference
between the two?

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:22,850
So this is the same thing,
this is equal to 5 factorial

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,340
over 5 minus 3 factorial.

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,070
And that in general is how
we figure out, how many

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:37,080
permutations can 5 things
place themselves or be

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,140
placed into 3 positions?

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,960
And the general formula
is-- and we learned

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,510
this in the last video.

31
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,630
And I will switch colors.

32
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:51,810
If we want to put n things into
k positions, and k has to

33
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,500
be less than or equal to n.

34
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,390
Well actually, it
doesn't have to.

35
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,770
But for our purposes right now
we'll assume it is because our

36
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,970
formula might break
down if it weren't.

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:08,320
And that equals n factorial
over n minus k factorial.

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,760
I always find this harder
to memorize than just

39
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,870
thinking about the spot.

40
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,950
Then just saying, oh well,
you know, 5 people, 5 of

41
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,110
the things could be here.

42
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,340
And then once one thing is
here, there's 4 possibilities

43
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,800
left and then there's
3 possibilities left.

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,550
   

45
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,590
The way I think of it I
take the first k terms

46
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,820
of the n factorial.

47
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,230
Or in this case, I take
the first three terms

48
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,720
of the 5 factorial.

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,380
5 times 4 times 3.

50
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,370
That's how I think
of permutations.

51
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,050
This is great if we cared--
let's say these are

52
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,410
people A, B, C, D, E.

53
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,810
So these are the 5 people that
are going to sit in the chairs.

54
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:57,470
This is great if we wanted to
count the permutation ABC as

55
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,900
different from the permutation
ACB, as different from the

56
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,310
permutation-- I don't know--
BAC as different from

57
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,686
the permutation BCA.

58
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:14,110
   

59
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,640
Because remember, when we did
this we actually cared about

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,380
where they're sitting.

61
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,790
And in the previous video we
double counted everything

62
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,620
because it matters if person
A is in seat one and

63
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,830
person B is in seat two.

64
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,250
And then if they switch
we recounted, right?

65
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,260
This is where they switch.

66
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,640
But what if we didn't
care about that?

67
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,400
What if we didn't care
who's in what seat?

68
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,820
We just wanted to know how
many different ways can

69
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,860
the 5 people sit down?

70
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,760
So we want to count all the
situations where person A, B,

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,360
and C are sitting down as
essentially one situation.

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,890
We don't care who's
sitting in which chair.

73
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,430
We just care that those are
the 3 people sitting down.

74
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,200
That's the set, the subset
of the people sitting down.

75
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,260
And so the question then
becomes not how many different

76
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,470
permutations or how many
different ways can the people

77
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,420
sit down, the question becomes,
how many subsets of 3 can

78
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,090
we take out of a set of 5?

79
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,950
   

80
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,840
And I know I'm kind of jumping
up around a little bit, but

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,130
that's essentially what
a combination is.

82
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,020
A combination is a permutation
where you don't care

83
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,560
about the order.

84
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,990
So how do we figure it out?

85
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,420
Well, when we figured out the
permutations using this formula

86
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,090
we counted-- for example, we
counted ABC, ACB, BAC,

87
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,500
BCA, and let's see.

88
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,800
There should be two
more permutations.

89
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,220
CAB and CBA.

90
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,510
We counted all 6 of these
as different permutations.

91
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,990
But in our combinations we're
going to want to-- this is all

92
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,830
essentially the same
combination because we don't

93
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,300
care about the order.

94
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,990
So for any 3 different people
that are in these seats,

95
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,930
there's actually going to be 6
permutations that we're

96
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,770
counting when we do
the permutations.

97
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,320
So if we want the combinations
we'll just divide by the number

98
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,770
of ways we can rearrange
3 people into 3 seats.

99
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,490
That's essentially
what we did here.

100
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,450
So how many different
ways can you arrange 3

101
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,030
people into 3 seats?

102
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,650
Well, this is kind of another
permutation problem.

103
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,260
The first seat you could put 3
different people, the second

104
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,480
seat you put 2 different
people, and the last seat--

105
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,750
well, there's only
1 person left.

106
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,410
So it equals 3 factorial,
which is equal to 6.

107
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,780
This is equal to 3 factorial,
which is equal to 6.

108
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,000
Hope I'm not confusing.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,230
What I'm just trying to say is
when you did a permutation we

110
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,340
counted all of the different
orders of how people could

111
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,450
arrange themselves.

112
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,400
And what I'm saying now is
well, how many different ways

113
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,630
can people arrange themselves?

114
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,190
Well, it's going to be the
number of places factorial

115
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,980
because if we have 3 people
in 3 spots or let's say,

116
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,190
4 people in 4 spots.

117
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,250
The fourth spot can have 4
people, the second spot can

118
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,770
have 3, and so forth, the third
spot could have 2, and the

119
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,010
last spot will only have 1.

120
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,150
So it's the number of spots
factorial is how many

121
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,500
permutations we're counting.

122
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,710
When we have just the same
people, they're just playing

123
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,700
musical chairs in the
exact same seats.

124
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,120
So on order to figure out the
combination, so if we wanted to

125
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,900
say how many people-- let's
say if we had 5 people.

126
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,140
How many different groups
of 3 can be seated?

127
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,820
And we don't want to double.

128
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,270
We don't want to more
than double count.

129
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,240
I don't know what the
word is for counting

130
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,760
something six times.

131
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,500
Well, it's just going to be the
same thing as the permutation

132
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,890
divided by all of the
extra counting we did.

133
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,810
We'll just divide by the number
of ways that 3 people can

134
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,810
arrange themselves in 3 seats.

135
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,830
And that's 3 factorial.

136
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,710
   

137
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,230
And I hope I'm making sense.

138
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,190
Maybe I'll do a couple more
examples in other videos.

139
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,030
And definitely request
it if you think this

140
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,320
is extra confusing.

141
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,220
So in general, if we say, what
are the different ways that

142
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,530
n things can be chosen?

143
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,050
Or the number of combinations
that n things can be chosen

144
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,000
into sets of r, where r is
less than or equal to n.

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,540
It's equal to the number of
permutations you could create

146
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,320
of putting n things into r
spots, divided by r factorial.

147
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,880
   

148
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,140
We're going to divide by the
number of ways the r spots

149
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,340
themselves could be rearranged
because we don't want to

150
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,670
count those as extra.

151
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,580
And so if we go back to this
formula up here, well, this

152
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,240
was a k, but now we're
saying it's an r.

153
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,160
This is the same thing as--
so the permutations was

154
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:51,350
n factorial over n
minus r factorial.

155
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,360
And now we're dividing
everything by r factorial.

156
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,840
So that equals-- let
me just write this.

157
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,050
This is often written
as n choose r.

158
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,320
Another way it's
written is n choose r.

159
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,180
This is called the binomial
coefficient and we'll do a

160
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,460
whole series of modules on that
as well because this actually

161
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,450
shows up in polynomial
expansion when you take

162
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,690
polynomials to powers.

163
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:20,640
But this is equal to n
factorial over r factorial

164
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,020
divided by n minus r factorial.

165
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,210
You could memorize this.

166
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,050
You know, it's useful if
you want to do things

167
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,820
quickly on tests.

168
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,410
But it's very important to
think about where it came from.

169
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,980
The n factorial over the n
minus r factorial-- this

170
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,220
is just the permutation.

171
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,390
And what is that?

172
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,630
Well, that was just the first
r-- I guess you could call

173
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,710
it the first r factors.

174
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,340
The r largest factors
of n factorial.

175
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,510
That's all that is.

176
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,250
And then when we do the
combinations we divided by r

177
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,310
factorial because we want to
divide it by all the different

178
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,830
arrangements that the people
could seat themselves

179
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,970
in r seats.

180
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,420
Or, the balls could
be placed in r cups.

181
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,450
So in this situation if we want
to know how many different

182
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,090
groups of 3 can be selected
from 5 people or from 5

183
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:16,370
letters, it's going to be 5
factorial over 3 factorial

184
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,040
times 5 minus 3 factorial.

185
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,860
And that's 5 times 3 times
2 times 1, over-- 3

186
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,840
factorial is just 6.

187
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,750
We'll put that aside
for a second.

188
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,400
Divided by-- this
is 3 factorial.

189
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,820
2 times 1.

190
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,870
So notice, this is a
permutation part right here.

191
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,590
This term just gets rid of
the two lowest factors.

192
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,170
You get 5 times 3.

193
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,810
Oh, sorry there's a 4.

194
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,430
5 times 4 times 3, which is
the number of permutations.

195
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,330
And then we divide by 6 because
we get 6 permutations for

196
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,150
really every combination.

197
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,760
Maybe that confused you.

198
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,520
But anyway, so we get 5 times
4 times 3 divided by 6.

199
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,140
And that's what?

200
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:07,930
5 times 12 divided by 6,
which is equal to 5 times 2.

201
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,330
There's 10 possible ways
that we can take sets of 3

202
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,750
from a group of 5 things.

203
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,810
See you in the next video.
