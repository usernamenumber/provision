1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i;m convinced, i will follow them. i will come too

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
only four of us involved. looking at trousers

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and peale staicase, we've got a portrait of two of his

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sons raphael and tishin peale. we wonder if these names are phinoria

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he named his children after famous european painters

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and scientists. that is amazing. he is amazing real

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is the amazing portrait we are going to think about

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
full size portraits as being images of kings and

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are a stalk receiver here. and here peale

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
represented his twosons making up a staircase

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this painting was meant as a show piece for his first

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
american museum. this was a museum of art and there is amuseum of science as well.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that was a most famous exhibit of the bones of a

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
master don it is interesting to think about

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what the museum of science and art meant

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in a republic. here was an attempt to create an institution of education.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here we have true democracy. this is the first time

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sice the new democracy existed it was this grand

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
experiment. peale understood that the public needed education to make wise decisions

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so peale founded the combiano, the first american art school

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and had it ceded to the peennsylvania academy of

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
fine arts that he founded ten years after that

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
after he founded, as we said this first museum

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we've talked about his achievements, but we haven't

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
really talked about his pre foresight, that is in evidence here.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's true.ok this painting is all about

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
fusion and what is remarkable is none about clarity

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with shich his sons are rendered with a staircase
