1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:07,271
The function f(x) is graphed, what is its domain? So the way it's graphed right over here we can assume

2
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:11,726
that this is the entire function definition for f(x) So for example

3
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:15,804
if we say well what does f(x) equal when x is equal to -9? Well we go up here

4
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:19,143
we dont see its graphed here it's not defined for x = -9

5
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:23,560
or x = -8 1/2 or x = -8 it's not defined for any

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,226
of these values it only starts getting defined at x = -6

7
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:32,893
at x = -6 f(x) is equal to 5

8
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:35,737
and it keeps getting defined f(x) is defined for x

9
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:39,477
all the way from x = -6 all the way to

10
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:42,938
x = 7 when x = 7 half of x is equal to 5

11
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:46,644
you can take any x value between -6 including -6

12
00:00:46,644 --> 00:00:50,603
and positive 7 including positive 7 and you just have to see

13
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:54,644
you just have move up above that number wherever you are to find out

14
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:59,476
what the value of the function is at that point.

15
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,937
So the domain of this function definition

16
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:07,005
Well f(x) is defined for any x that is greater than

17
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:10,892
or equal to -6 or we can say -6 is less than or equal to

18
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:14,070
x which is less than or equal to 7. If x satisfies

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,270
this condition right over here the function is defined.

20
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,337
So that's its domain, let's check our answer and do a few more of these.

21
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:27,469
The function f(x) is graphed what is its domain?

22
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:30,737
Well exact similar argument this function is not defined

23
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:34,893
for x is -9 -8 all the way down or all the way up

24
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:38,643
I should say to -1. At -1 it starts getting defined.

25
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:42,476
f of -1 is -5 so it's

26
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:45,404
defined for -1 is less than or equal to x

27
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:50,269
is defined all the way up to x = 7 including x = 7. So this

28
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:54,269
right over here -1 is less than or equal to x is less than or equal to 7 the

29
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:57,225
function is defined for any x that satisfies this

30
00:01:57,225 --> 00:02:02,810
double inequality right over here. Let's do a few more

31
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,005
the function f(x) is graphed, what is its range?

32
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:10,070
So now we're not thinking about the x's for which this function is defined

33
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,070
we're thinking about the set of y values, what is

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,561
where do all the y values fall into?

35
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:21,977
Well let's see the lowest possible y value or the lowest possible

36
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:26,072
value of f(x) that we get here looks like its 0 the

37
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:29,977
function never goes below 0 so f(x)

38
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:34,406
is 0 is less than or equal to f(x) it does equal 0 right over here

39
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:37,894
f of -4 is 0 and then the highest y value

40
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:41,404
or the highest value that f(x) obtains in this function definition

41
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:45,606
is 8, f of 7 is 8 it never gets above 8 but

42
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:48,671
it does equal 8 right over here when x is equal to 7

43
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:53,070
So, 0 is less than f(x) which is less than or equal

44
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,404
to 8 so that's its range.

45
00:02:57,404 --> 00:03:00,976
Let's do a few more this is kinda fun. The function f(x) is graphed

46
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:05,061
what is its domain? So once again this function is defined for -2

47
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:09,070
-2 is less than or equal to x which

48
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,737
is less than or equal to 5. If you give me an x anywhere in between

49
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:17,143
-2 and 5 I can look at this graph to see where the function is defined

50
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:21,070
f of -2 is -4 f of -1 is

51
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,477
-3 so on and so forth and I can even pick the values inbetween

52
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:28,894
these integers. So -2 is less than or equal to x which is

53
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:31,834
less than or equal to 5.
