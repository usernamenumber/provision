1
00:00:00,298 --> 00:00:02,832
We're asked to graph the function f(x)

2
00:00:02,832 --> 00:00:06,159
is equal to the principle square route of .5x-1

3
00:00:06,159 --> 00:00:09,627
And to graph it we're going to just sample some points

4
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:12,360
some x values that are within the domain of this function,

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,033
this function definition, and see what the function is equal to

6
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:18,597
for those x values, and then we can connect those dots

7
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:20,253
and see what the curve will look like

8
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:24,279
So, let me do a little table here, and so I'm going

9
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,567
to pick some x-values, and I'm going to figure out what

10
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:30,279
the f(x) values are given those x values

11
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,052
And actually, I'm going to do something in between

12
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:33,832
because I want to have nice, clean numbers

13
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:36,487
I want to pick x-values that are nice clean integers

14
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:39,343
and I want to get f(x) values that are nice clean integers

15
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:41,315
So I'm going to be a little bit more careful

16
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:43,237
in what x values I pick.

17
00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:45,403
I wanna pick x values so that this part of the expression

18
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:48,750
this part of the function definition

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,330
ends up being an integer

20
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,788
and if this needs to be an integer, then what's underneath

21
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:58,095
the radical, that .5x

22
00:00:58,095 --> 00:00:59,169
that needs to be a perfect square

23
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:01,102
So, let me make another column over here

24
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:06,481
just to make our math a little bit cleaner

25
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,830
You could pick just arbitrary x-points

26
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,882
you could pick x to be 1, 2, 3, just go like that

27
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:13,550
but on some of those you might get strange radicals

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,782
over here, which might be hard to graph without a calculator

29
00:01:16,782 --> 00:01:23,134
So let's try so let me write over here what 0.5x is

30
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:27,270
And I'm doing this just so that I can pick this

31
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,162
we want this thing over here

32
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:30,019
to be perfect squares

33
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:32,801
because if 0.5x is a perfect square, than the square root

34
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,768
of that is going to be an integer

35
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:38,585
So let's say that 0.5, let's think about all

36
00:01:38,585 --> 00:01:40,039
of the perfect squares, you can start at 0, then you

37
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:47,121
could go to 1, then we could go to: 2 isn't a perfect

38
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:48,553
square, 3 isn't a perfect square,

39
00:01:48,553 --> 00:01:50,505
I'm just thinking of all the values where if I took the

40
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:52,178
square root, I'd get an integer

41
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:57,789
And then I go to 4, then I go to 9, then I go to 16

42
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,437
and then I go to 25.

43
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:02,603
These are the first five perfect squares, obviously

44
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:04,864
with 0, if you take the principle square root of that you get

45
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:06,986
zero. So these would be good values for

46
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:10,690
.5x. But if those are what .5x is equal to, what is

47
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,686
x going to be? So, if 0.5x is 0, then x

48
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:17,105
is also going to be 0. You could solve that

49
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:18,606
separately over in an equation right over here

50
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,636
you could say 0.5x is equal to 0,

51
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:26,904
x is equal to 0 divided by .5, just divide both sides

52
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:29,455
by .5, and you get that equal to 0.

53
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:32,286
So in general, to get what the x-value is, we

54
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,967
jsut have to take this number and divide it by .5

55
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:40,132
or another way of thinking of that is just taking

56
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:46,916
this number and multiplying it by two.
