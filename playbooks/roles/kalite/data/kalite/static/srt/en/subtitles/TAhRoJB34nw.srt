1
00:00:00,518 --> 00:00:01,712
I sensed some confusion

2
00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:04,728
coming out of the last video on inferior goods.

3
00:00:04,728 --> 00:00:05,467
So, I thought I would do another one.

4
00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:07,468
So let's make --

5
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:09,468
Let's assume that there [are] three cars in the market.

6
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:10,520
And what I want to do is --

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,527
I sensed that some people thought I was suggesting

8
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:14,982
that a car, in general, is an inferior good.

9
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,786
And that's not what I was saying. I was saying

10
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:18,975
if we lived in a reality where everyone owned a car --

11
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:21,354
your car was a necessity for life --

12
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,953
and that is true in much of the developed world --

13
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:26,500
I was saying that the cheapest car on the market

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,276
might be considered an inferior good.

15
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:30,415
And to think about that,

16
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:32,266
let's just think about the entire population.

17
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,742
So let's say that this line -- this line represents

18
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:36,771
the entire population in our place --

19
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,451
in our developed country

20
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:40,208
where everyone owns a car.

21
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:44,365
And let's say -- let's represent this car with blue.

22
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:49,452
So, let's say a third of the people right now have that car.

23
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:52,415
And now, let's say a good chunk of the people

24
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:54,453
have this mid-sized sedan.

25
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:55,714
This is probably the car

26
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:58,501
that most people would like to have.

27
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:00,379
It's a little bit safer. It's a little bit larger.

28
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,970
It [has] a more powerful engine.

29
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,826
And so, this is where most people are sitting.

30
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:08,009
And then you have this ultra --

31
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:13,353
this kind of luxury car -- a Rolls Royce, maybe.

32
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:16,236
And so, that [is] a very small segment.

33
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:18,885
So, this end of the line is the poor --

34
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:22,700
So, this is the poor in our population.

35
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,519
And this is the rich, right over here.

36
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,569
So this is at some given income level.

37
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,304
And maybe we could say

38
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:32,224
this is true at a particular price point.

39
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:33,959
But we'll see -- what we're going to talk about

40
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,511
is the general impact on demand --

41
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:38,314
on the entire curve at any given price point --

42
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:41,182
always assuming that this is the most expensive,

43
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:43,886
this is in between, and this is the least expensive.

44
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:47,053
Now, what happens if income goes up from here?

45
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:50,570
WRITING: Income goes up.

46
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,086
Well, the very poorest,

47
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:53,982
they're not going to be able to necessarily

48
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:56,267
just trade up to this mid-size sedan yet.

49
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,400
Although, maybe they'll have more income for other things --

50
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,072
or they can get a nicer version of this.

51
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:01,588
But for the most part,

52
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,103
they're still going to be driving this car.

53
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:06,375
But at kind of the boundary right over here,

54
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,879
if incomes do go up,

55
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,210
there will be people who can now afford the mid-sized car,

56
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,541
And that's what they want.

57
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:17,285
And so, these people might start buying the mid-size car.

58
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:19,564
And then what will happen, over here?

59
00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:22,044
Well, maybe there [are] a few people

60
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:23,359
at the boundary over here --

61
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:24,674
they now have the money to afford this very expensive car.

62
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:26,283
And it suits their taste.

63
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:30,653
And so they also -- a very small proportion also grows there.

64
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:32,302
So what happened here?

65
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:41,803
When income went up, the quantity demanded

66
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:46,795
at a particular price point for this smallest car, went down.

67
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:48,869
But the demand for this mid-size car went up.

68
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,877
It took a much bigger chunk out of this blue

69
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:54,390
than a chunk was taken out of it by the orange.

70
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,670
And also, the demand for this very expensive car went up

71
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,155
And that was at a particular price point.

72
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:05,256
But assuming this is the most expensive, this is the middle,

73
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:07,053
and this is the [least] expensive,

74
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,477
this would be true of probably any price point.

75
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:12,476
And so we have this phenomenon that when income went up --

76
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:16,123
the quantity demanded at multiple price points for this car --

77
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:18,388
So let me draw its actual demand curve.

78
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:22,867
So [for] this car right over here, this is price;

79
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:26,700
this over here is demand.

80
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,821
If its old demand curve looks something like this,

81
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:34,825
we're saying that maybe when we thought about this,

82
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:36,191
at first, we're thinking of --

83
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,879
we were thinking the price point right over here,

84
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,782
we notice when income went up,

85
00:03:40,782 --> 00:03:42,551
at that particular price point,

86
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,258
the quantity demanded went down --

87
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,325
and that would be true at pretty much any price point --

88
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:49,392
assuming that this is always the cheapest car.

89
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:50,856
So at any price point,

90
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,123
you would have a decrease in demand.

91
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:53,623
Now, remember.

92
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:55,020
When we talk about a decrease in demand,

93
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,107
we are talking about a shift of the entire curve.

94
00:03:57,107 --> 00:04:00,424
We're not talking about just one particular quantity.

95
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:02,057
Now, there was another interesting question

96
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:02,893
that was asked.

97
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:07,591
And it's a very nice and subtle thing to think about.

98
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:10,207
I keep drawing these shifting demand curves,

99
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:14,407
And if, at least, I understand the question properly,

100
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:16,940
the question is does the curve, when it shifts,

101
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,481
does it necessary shift perfectly?

102
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:20,577
Or does, sometimes, it change?

103
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:22,165
Does it shift more at one price point or another?

104
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:25,236
And the simple answer is it can.

105
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:27,459
In fact, in very few circumstances

106
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:29,213
would it probably be a perfect shift.

107
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:30,701
Depending on the price point you're at,

108
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:33,080
it would probably shift a little bit different[ly].

109
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,606
So, the actual shape of the curve might change

110
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:37,818
while it's shifting.

111
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,339
But anyway, going back to this.

112
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:41,771
So, we see that this cheap car, right here,

113
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:44,664
had the unusual property that when the incomes went up,

114
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:47,059
the demand curve shifted to the left.

115
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:51,609
And that's why we call this an inferior good.

116
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:56,187
These other two cars, when --

117
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:59,381
WRITING: So, that's price. And this is demand.

118
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,988
These other two cars, when income went up --

119
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:06,576
So, this is the demand curve at first.

120
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:09,376
When income went up, demand went up.

121
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,514
The whole curve got shifted to the right.

122
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:14,814
So, they are normal --

123
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,635
So, this -- these are normal goods.
