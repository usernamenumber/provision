2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,503
Dr. Steven Zucker: We're in the Uffizi in Florence

3
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:08,311
and we're looking at Ambrogio Lorenzetti's

4
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:09,703
"Presentation in the Temple"

5
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:12,637
--now Ambrogio Lorenzetti was one of two brothers

6
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,623
the other was Pietro Lorenzetti

7
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:16,575
--and they were both students of

8
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:18,442
the great early Sienese master -- Duccio

9
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:20,674
--and this is one of Ambrogio Lorenzetti's

10
00:00:20,674 --> 00:00:21,953
most important paintings

11
00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:25,357
--and it tells the story early in the new testament

12
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:28,645
narrative of Christ being brought to the temple

13
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:29,624
to be circumsized

14
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:32,546
--this is the moment when Simeon is presenting Christ

15
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:35,458
to the temple--and Anna, the seer, is recognizing

16
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:39,027
Christ as the redeemer--and points him out

17
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:41,675
--what I find so interesting is that whereas Christ

18
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,972
is so often represented as all knowing even as an infant

19
00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:46,844
--here he really looks like an infant

20
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:49,185
Dr. Beth Harris: He is and he is putting his fingers in his mouth

21
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:52,740
Dr. Zucker: It's hard to miss the beautiful emphasis on architecture

22
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,978
--and this is something that Ambrogio often emphasizes

23
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:58,354
--look at the gothic characteristics of this church

24
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:00,494
--this panel was originally intended

25
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,990
for the duomo in Siena

26
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,808
and so it would itself have been

27
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:06,673
in this great Gothic environment

28
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:08,858
--but look at the way in which we look back

29
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:11,224
towards the apse through this nave

30
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:13,711
--all this fabulous emphasis on these

31
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:16,226
vaguely Corinthian columns

32
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:19,262
--and lots of paint on the ceiling

33
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:20,722
for instance we can see a Christ

34
00:01:20,722 --> 00:01:22,239
in a mandorla with angels

35
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,197
--we can see ribbed vaults which actually have

36
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:27,175
painted gold stars against a blue ground

37
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:29,106
very much like what we would expect to see

38
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:31,094
in a fourteenth century church

39
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:32,762
Dr. Harris: And we have illusion of space

40
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:34,478
if we look down at the floor

41
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,861
we see diagonal lines that appear to recede

42
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:39,678
into this space--although this is not

43
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:41,329
correct use of linear perspective

44
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:42,976
Dr. Zucker: It's not--but it is an attempt

45
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:44,607
to create a sense of recession

46
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:46,293
--look at the capitals and the way they allow

47
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:49,005
our eye to move back slowly

48
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:51,626
but it deliberately into space as one space

49
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:53,726
opens up into another--and there is mystery

50
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:55,225
--and drama--and what's so interesting

51
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:58,308
is that we see this wonderful transhistorical

52
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:00,955
representation of Christ--this ancient figure

53
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,414
in a modern Gothic environment

54
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,228
--wonderfully lighting the past and the present

55
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:08,106
Dr. Harris: So in some way that would made

56
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:10,130
a Sienese person in the thirteen hundreds

57
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,893
really be able to relate to what was going on here

58
00:02:12,893 --> 00:02:14,083
Dr. Zucker: I think that that's right

59
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,532
making this ancient scene immediate

60
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:30,878
