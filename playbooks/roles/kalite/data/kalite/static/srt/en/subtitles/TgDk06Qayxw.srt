1
00:00:00,504 --> 00:00:03,890
In the last video we learned that if we have two different triangles

2
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:09,066
And if all of the corresponding sides of the two triangles have the same length,

3
00:00:09,106 --> 00:00:12,039
then by side side side we know that

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,260
the two triangles are congruent. And I also touched a little bit on

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,260
the idea of an axiom or a postulate.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,580
But I wanna be clear: sometimes you'll hear this referred to as

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,588
a side side side theorem - theorem - and sometimes you'll hear it as

8
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:31,230
a side side side postulate or axiom - postulate or axiom.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,830
And I think it's worth differentiating what these mean.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:39,069
A postulate or an axiom is something that you just assume, you assume from the get-go,

11
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:42,701
while a theorem is something you prove using more basic,

12
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:45,380
or using some postulates or axioms.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,402
So, and really in all of mathematics you make some core assumptions.

14
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:52,060
You make some core assumptions. You call these -

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,050
You call these the axioms or the postulates.

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,623
Axioms - axioms or the postulates

17
00:00:59,623 --> 00:01:03,069
And then using those, you try to prove theorems.

18
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:07,250
So maybe using that one I can prove some theorem over here

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,840
And they'd be using that theorem

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,900
and then this axiom, I can prove another theorem over here

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,260
and them using both of those theorems

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,850
I can prove another theorem over here - I think you get the picture.

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,530
This axiom might lead us to this theorem

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,370
And these two might lead us to this theorem right over here

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,390
And we essentially try to build our knowledge

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,160
Or we build a mathematics around these core assumptions.

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,500
In an introductory geometry class, we kind of

28
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,862
We don't rigorously prove side side side

29
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:39,450
We don't rigorously the prove side side side theorem

30
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,420
And that's why a lot of geometry calls you kind of just take it as a given

31
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,600
As a postulate or an axiom

32
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,060
And the whole reason why I'm doing this is

33
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,170
One I just want you to know the differences between the words

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,760
theorem and postulate or axiom

35
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,341
And also so that you don't get confused. It is just a given

36
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:55,550
but in a lot of books and I've looked at several books

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,847
they do refer to it as a side side side theorem

38
00:01:57,847 --> 00:01:59,690
even though they never prove it rigorously.

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,870
They do just assume it.

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,553
So it really is more of a postulate or an axiom.

41
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:05,890
Now with that out of they way, we just take -

42
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,770
we're just going to assume going forward that we just know

43
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,030
that this is true, we're gonna take it as a given

44
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,030
I wanna show you that we can already do something pretty useful with it.

45
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,890
So let's say that we have a circle.

46
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,110
Let's say we have a circle. There's many useful things

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,860
that we can already do with it.

48
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,710
And this circle has a center right here at A

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,980
and let's say that that we have a chord

50
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,600
a chord in this circle that that is not a diameter.

51
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,840
So let me draw a chord here.

52
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,800
So let me draw a chord in the circle, so that's a kind of a segment

53
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,412
of a secant line, and let's say that I have

54
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:47,753
Let's say that I have a line that bisects - that bisects this chord from - from the center.

55
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:49,682
And I guess I can call it a radius 'cause I'm gonna go from

56
00:02:49,682 --> 00:02:54,576
the center to - to the edge of the circle right over there.

57
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:57,726
So I went to the center to circle itself.

58
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:59,950
And when I say bisects it, these are all

59
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,040
I'm just setting up the problem right now.

60
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,831
When I say bisecting it, it means it splits that line segment in half.

61
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:09,740
So what it tells us is, is that the length of this segment right over here

62
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,133
is going to be equivalent to the length of this segment right over there.

63
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:17,050
And what I wanna do is, so this is, I set it up I have a circle.

64
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,420
This radius bisects this chord right over here.

65
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,479
And what I wanna do is prove - the goal here is to prove, is to prove

66
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,257
that it bisects this chord at a right angle.

67
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:32,348
Or another way to say it, let me add some points here

68
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:37,526
Let's just call this B, let's call this C, and let's call this D.

69
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:43,547
I wanna prove that segment AB, segment AB is perpendicular

70
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:50,812
It intersects it at a right angle, it is perpendicular to segment CD, to segment CD.

71
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:53,370
And as you can imagine I'm gonna prove it pretty much

72
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,623
using the side side side whatever you wanna call it

73
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:59,200
side side side theorem, postulate or axiom.

74
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,313
So let's do it, let's think about it this way.

75
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:03,854
So you can imagine if I'm gonna use this I need to have some triangles,

76
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:07,063
there's no triangles here right now, but I can construct triangles,

77
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:09,930
and I can construct triangles based on things I know.

78
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,970
For example, I can construct - this has some radius

79
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,257
So let's call this, that's a radius right over here, the length of that is just going to be the radius of the circle,

80
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:23,916
but I can also do it right over here, the length of AC

81
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,483
is also going to be the radius of the circle.

82
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,510
So we know that these two lines have the same length

83
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,710
which is the radius of the circle, which is the radius of the circle

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,053
or we can say that AD is congruent to AC

85
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:36,710
or the have the exact same lengths.

86
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,900
We know from the set up in the problem

87
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,510
we know from the set up in the problem

88
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,671
that this segment is equal in length to this segment over here.

89
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,610
We could even, let me add a point here so I can refer to it

90
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,940
so if I call that point E we know from the set up in the problem

91
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,830
that CE is congruent to ED or they have the same length

92
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,300
CE has the same length as ED.

93
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,130
And we also know that both of these triangles - the one here on

94
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,470
the left and the one here on the right, the one here on the right

95
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,612
the both share the side EA so EA is clearly equal to EA.

96
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,839
So this is clearly equal to itself, it's the same side.

97
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,874
The same side has been used for both triangles.

98
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:19,088
The triangles are adjacent to each other.

99
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:23,562
And so we see a situation where we have a tri - where we have two different triangles

100
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:26,390
that have corresponding sides being equal.

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
This side is equivalent to this side right over here.

102
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,391
This side is is equal in length to that side over there.

103
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:37,800
And then we have obviously AE is equivalent to itself

104
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,920
It's a side on both of them.

105
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,810
It's a corresponding side on both of these triangles.

106
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,340
And so by side side side, so by side side side

107
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:54,280
we know, we know that triangle, triangle ABC

108
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:01,803
triangle ABC is congruent to triangle AE -

109
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:04,967
Oh sorry, it's not ABC it's AEC, sorry.

110
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:07,300
We know, it should let me write it over here

111
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:17,852
by side side side we know, we know that triangle AEC, AEC

112
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:24,990
is congruent to triangle AED.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,910
But how does that help us? How does that help us knowing

114
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,270
that you know we use our little theorem

115
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,690
but how does that actually help us here?

116
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,468
Well what's cool is once we know that two triangles are congruent

117
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:40,040
So because, so because they congruent that tells us

118
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,570
So from that we can deduce that all the angles are the same.

119
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,277
And in particular we can deduce that this angle right over here

120
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:54,102
that the measure of angle CEA, CEA is equivalent

121
00:06:54,102 --> 00:07:00,874
to measure of angle DEA, DEA, the measure of angle DEA.

122
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:03,356
And the reason why that's also, why that's useful

123
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,550
is that we also see just by looking at this

124
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,130
that they are supplementary to each other.

125
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,630
They're adjacent angles, their outer sides form a straight angle.

126
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,951
So CEA is supplementary and equivalent to DEA.

127
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:20,643
So they're also supplementary. So we also have the measure

128
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:24,590
of angle CEA, the measure of angle CEA

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,404
plus the measure of angle DEA is equal to 180 degrees.

130
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:32,603
But they're equivalent to each other so I can replace

131
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:37,376
the measure of DEA with the measure of CEA, measure of angle CEA.

132
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:40,430
Or I could rewrite this as two times

133
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,107
the measure of angle CEA is equal to 180 degrees.

134
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:47,983
Or I could divide both sides by two and I'd say the measure

135
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:51,875
of angle CEA is equal to 90 degrees

136
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:56,181
which is going to be the same as the measure of angle DEA, because they're equivalent.

137
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,780
So we know that this angle right over here is 90 degrees

138
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,780
so I can glue it with that little box

139
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,530
and this angle right over here is 90 degrees

140
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,858
and because AB intersects where, intersects CD we have a

141
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,560
90 degree angle here and there

142
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,850
and we could also prove this over there as well

143
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,540
they are perpendicular to each other.
