1
00:00:01,856 --> 00:00:04,999
we are at the british museum, standing in front of

2
00:00:05,499 --> 00:00:10,960
the holy thorn reliquary, which was commissioned

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,844
by John, Duke of Berry in 1390s in Paris

4
00:00:13,844 --> 00:00:17,777
and this is quite a piece of work.

5
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:19,210
it´s exquisite and there is an awful lot of detail here.

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,043
We´ve just started right from the bottom of it up.

7
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:23,446
We got the city in gold

8
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:25,127
and it´s a four cornered city

9
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:28,194
it represents the four corners of the world

10
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,093
and there is an angel at each corner

11
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:31,928
blowing a trumpet, and around that

12
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:34,544
we have this green hill, with four tombs,

13
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:35,910
with people are rising out of that and looking out.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,795
above that we´ve got the central panel

15
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:39,711
which is surrounded by rubies and pearls

16
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:47,243
and lots of gold, and there are twelve figurines

17
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:50,960
who are the twelve apostles picked out in an armor in gold

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,727
surrounding the central panel.and right

19
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:55,561
in the centre, we have Christ sitting in majesty,

20
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,993
with his feet on the globe. And above that

21
00:00:56,993 --> 00:00:58,910
at the very top, we've got the Father,

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,581
and then there are these two saphires. They are the only two saphires in the whole piece.

23
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:07,411
One is at the very very top above God the Father

24
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:09,612
and the other one is i the middle of

25
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:10,928
this window , where the Christ figure is sitting

26
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:13,928
and this is 2 inch long piece of wood jotting up

27
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:17,411
into Christ and Cchrist is sitting on a rainbow

28
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:23,328
and right above Christ there are these two little angels holding a tiny tiny cramapones above his head

29
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:27,044
what and that is connected to this spike coming out of where the saphire is.

30
00:01:27,044 --> 00:01:32,011
It is supposedly one of the thorns that came from

31
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:35,444
the crown of thorns.

32
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:36,143
We will see it at the reliquary here.

33
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:38,861
The idea of reliquary in the middle ages

34
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:40,228
is really important because it was these physical objects

35
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:43,044
which were sometimes body parts of saints.

36
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:46,993
in this case it is a thorn from the crown of thorns

37
00:01:46,993 --> 00:01:50,826
these objects were used as focussors of spiritual contemplation

38
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:54,244
well we're really looking here where relics began

39
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:57,977
because Christ died on a cross and he rouse into heaven. So,

40
00:01:57,977 --> 00:02:03,295
he left nothing behind. So all the relics that are connected to Christ

41
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:03,362
are things like the crown of thorns or pieces of the true cross

42
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:03,416
that are material memory, and of course we have no way of proving

43
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,511
whether this was in fact a thorn, from the crown of thorn

44
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:07,709
worn by christ when he was crucified.

45
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,593
No. But that wasn't the point. The idea was you believed in these objects

46
00:02:10,593 --> 00:02:11,944
and so we insisted to pray in the presence of these objects

47
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:13,278
was to give extra power and special access

48
00:02:13,278 --> 00:02:19,210
to heaven. Christ and the Passion of all this happened within the Roman Empire.

49
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:25,945
The crown of thorn was discovered by Constantine´s mother,

50
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,698
the Empress Helena. He went on pilgrimage,

51
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:47,843
and she found the crown of thorns and the true cross as well.

52
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:50,544
these were taken by Constantinople and it´s said the Bizantine empire had all

53
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:52,579
of the power which of course this is what made the rest of the world

54
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:53,811
extremely jealous of the power that Constantinople had and thats why they came

55
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:55,061
and sacked Constantinople and thats when these things got taken away

56
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,143
Tis reliquary started with one of the french kings

57
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,561
Louise the ninth, who as he saw it rescued the crown and brought it to paris

58
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,761
and then the gratest gift that he could give to anyone,

59
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:08,678
would be to take one of the thorns and make a gift of it.

60
00:03:08,678 --> 00:03:10,343
and thats what he did here. it is spiritual but

61
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:12,310
its so circulous to control because if

62
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,979
someone gives you a gift of something thats

63
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,977
so close to christ that is ever placeable, so here we thought

64
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:19,961
John, Duke de Pari, who s is one of the french Dukes

65
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:25,678
and its such an important gift for both religious and political reasons

66
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:30,277
and he has made this incredible case to House

67
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:33,696
this one relic. and you see the story of the last Judgement

68
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:37,180
its not whats going on here.these angels at the bottom are trumpeting

69
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,128
to wake people up to see the dead rising out of their coffins

70
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:45,662
from the four corners of the earth.and in the centre there is the scene of christ enthroned.

71
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:49,893
and its important for the relicary because with the out of all this gold and saphires and pearls

72
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:54,812
and all this paraphernilia around it , how do you know about it.

73
00:03:54,812 --> 00:04:00,777
you know what it is by casing a hole set and keep out.the time will have itswell for this is not an audience

74
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:03,778
who is litereate. what you mostly got is the story being told by the object itself

75
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:09,078
and people would have been to church and heard these stories

76
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:09,243
the stories of the last judgement and christ enthroned. it is like a picture book

77
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:13,343
for an audience looking at this at the time

78
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:19,012
regardlessof all that gold back and any of those roles

79
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:22,795
the most valuable object is this entire piece is not one

80
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,628
bit of thorn that has to swab the blood of christ upon it

81
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:31,328
there is so much tiny tiny detail in the way

82
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:33,179
that everything is made in the hair, in the beards,

83
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:39,877
the carving of the leaves. if you look at the two nailing fingers of christ feet

84
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:42,728
the way that their carving has been picked out

85
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:45,161
and the individual fingers that you can see and the praying hands

86
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,927
it is a really nice combination of both.an object of faith and a beautiful object of craftsmanship.
