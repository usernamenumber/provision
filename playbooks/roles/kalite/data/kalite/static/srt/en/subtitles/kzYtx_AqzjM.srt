1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:03,108
PROBLEM: "The function f(x) is graphed.

2
00:00:03,108 --> 00:00:05,395
Find f(-1)."

3
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:07,502
So this graph right over here is essentially

4
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:09,082
a definition of our function.

5
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:12,281
It tells us, “Given the allowed inputs into our function,

6
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:14,375
what would the function output?”

7
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,502
So here, they're saying,

8
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:21,500
“Look, what gets output when we input x = -1?”

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,126
So x = -1 is right over here.

10
00:00:24,126 --> 00:00:25,970
x = -1.

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,928
And our function graph is right at 6

12
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:32,671
when f is equal to -1.

13
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:36,815
So we can say that f(-1) = 6.

14
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:38,078
Let me write that right over here.

15
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:41,711
f(-1) = 6.
