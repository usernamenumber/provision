1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,141
In the last video we tried to
figure out the slope of a

2
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:07,570
curve at a certain point.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,310
And the way we did, we said OK,
well let's find the slope

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,970
between that point and then
another point that's not too

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,220
far away from that point.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,953
And we got the slope
of the secant line.

7
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:19,530
And it looks all fancy, but
this is just the y value of the

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,570
point that's not too far away,
and this is just the y value

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,700
point of the point in
question, so this is

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,100
just your change in y.

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,020
And then you divide that
by your change in x.

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,580
So in the example we did,
h was the difference

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,610
between our 2 x values.

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,420
This distance was h.

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,210
And that gave us the
slope of that line.

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,940
We said hey, what if we take
the limit as this point

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,510
right here gets closer
and closer to this point.

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,420
If this point essentially
almost becomes this point, then

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,230
our slope is going to be the
slope of our tangent line.

20
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,620
And we define that as the
derivative of our function.

21
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,280
We said that's equal
to f prime of x.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,520
So let's if we can apply this
in this video to maybe make

23
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,750
things a little bit more
concrete in your head.

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,910
So let me do one.

25
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,140
First I'll do a particular
case where I want to find the

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,980
slope at exactly some point.

27
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,670
So let me draw my axes again.

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,520
Let's draw some
axes right there.

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,400
Let's say I have the curve--
this is the curve-- y

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,110
is equal to x squared.

31
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,790
So this is my y-axis, this is
my x-axis, and I want to know

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,270
the slope at the point
x is equal to 3.

33
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,660
When I say the slope you can
imagine a tangent line here.

34
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,760
You can imagine a tangent line
that goes just like that, and

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,710
it would just barely graze
the curve at that point.

36
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,260
But what is the slope
of that tangent line?

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,570
What is the slope of that
tangent line which is the same

38
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,360
as the slope of the curve
right at that point.

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,770
So to do it, I'm actually going
to do this exact technique that

40
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,270
we did before, then we'll
generalize it so you don't have

41
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,910
to do it every time for
a particular number.

42
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,805
So let's take some
other point here.

43
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,110
Let's call this 3 plus delta x.

44
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,380
I'm changing the notation
because in some books you'll

45
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,530
see an h, some books you'll see
a delta x, doesn't hurt to

46
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,660
be exposed to both of them.

47
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,500
So this is 3 plus delta x.

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,770
So first of all what is
this point right here?

49
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,890
This is a curve y is equal to
x squared, so f of x is 3

50
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,720
squared-- this is the point 9.

51
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,805
This is the point
3,9 right here.

52
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,870
And what is this
point right here?

53
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,180
So if we were go all the way
up here, what is that point?

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,120
Well here our x is
3 plus delta x.

55
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,310
It's the same thing as
this one right here,

56
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:50,990
as x not

57
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,300
plus h.

58
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,235
I could have called this
3 plus h just as easily.

59
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:58,110
So it's 3 plus
delta x up there.

60
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,930
So what's the y
value going to be?

61
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,080
Well whatever x value is, it's
on the curve, it's going

62
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,550
to be that squared.

63
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:12,310
So it's going to be the point
3 plus delta x squared.

64
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,790
So let's figure out the
slope of this secant

65
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,240
line.

66
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,270
And let me zoom in a little
bit, because that might help.

67
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,950
So if I zoom in on just
this part of the curve,

68
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,250
it might look like that.

69
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,330
And then I have one point
here, and then I have the

70
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,776
other point is up here.

71
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,070
That's the secant

72
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,510
line.

73
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,210
Just like that.

74
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,510
This was the point over
here, the point 3,9.

75
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,230
And then this point up here is
the point 3 plus delta x, so

76
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,340
just some larger number than
3, and then it's going to

77
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,790
be that number squared.

78
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,110
So it's going to be 3
plus delta x squared.

79
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,070
What is that?

80
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,310
That's going to be 9.

81
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,720
I'm just foiling this out,
or you do the distribute

82
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,940
property twice.

83
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,280
a plus b squared is a squared
plus 2 a b plus b squared, so

84
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,430
it's going to be 9 plus two
times the product

85
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,020
of these things.

86
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,345
So plus 6 delta x, and then
plus delta x squared.

87
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,530
That's the coordinate
of the second line.

88
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,470
This looks complicated, but I
just took this x value and I

89
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,230
squared it, because it's on the
line y is equal to x squared.

90
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,430
So the slope of the secant

91
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,500
line is going to be the
change in y divided

92
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,050
by the change in x.

93
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,500
So the change in y is just
going to be this guy's y value,

94
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:49,430
which is 9 plus 6 delta
x plus delta x squared.

95
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,610
That's this guy's y value,
minus this guy's y value.

96
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,000
So minus 9.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,510
That's your change in y.

98
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,630
And you want to divide
that by your change in x.

99
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,020
Well what is your change in x?

100
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,210
This is actually going to
be pretty convenient.

101
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,490
This larger x value-- we
started with this point on the

102
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,460
top, so we have to start with
this point on the bottom.

103
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,680
So it's going to be
3 plus delta x.

104
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,340
And then what's this x value?

105
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,700
What is minus 3?

106
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,070
That's his x value.

107
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,760
So what does this simplify to?

108
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,020
The numerator-- this 9
and that 9 cancel out,

109
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,320
we get a 9 minus 9.

110
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,780
And in the denominator
what happens?

111
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,560
This 3 and minus 3 cancel out.

112
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,550
So the change in x actually end
up becoming this delta x, which

113
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,490
makes sense, because this delta
x is essentially how much more

114
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,990
this guy is then that guy.

115
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,360
So that should be the
change in x, delta x.

116
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,810
So the slope of my secant

117
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:53,860
line has simplified to 6 times
my change in x, plus my change

118
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:00,130
in x squared, all of that
over my change in x.

119
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,640
And now we can simplify
this even more.

120
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,140
Let's divide the numerator
and the denominator

121
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,790
by our change in x.

122
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,900
And I'll switch colors just
to ease the monotony.

123
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,110
So my slope of my
tangent of my secant

124
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,580
line-- the one that goes
through both of these-- is

125
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,483
going to be equal if you
divide the numerator and

126
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,650
denominator this becomes 6.

127
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,420
I'm just dividing numerator
and denominator by delta

128
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,130
x plus six plus delta x.

129
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,080
So that is the slope
of this secant

130
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,630
line So slope is equal
to 6 plus delta x.

131
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,280
That's this one right here.

132
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,990
That's this reddish line that
I've drawn right there.

133
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,340
So this number right here, if
the delta x was [? once ?], if

134
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,390
these were the points 3 and 4,
then my slope would be 6 plus

135
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,640
1, because I'm picking a point
4 where the delta x here

136
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,480
would have to be 1.

137
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,780
So the slope would be 7.

138
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,730
So we have a general formula
for no matter what my delta

139
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,790
x is, I can find the slow
between 3 and 3 plus delta x.

140
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,640
Between those two points.

141
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,010
Now we wanted to find the
slope at exactly that

142
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,120
point right there.

143
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,100
So let's see what happens
when delta x get

144
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,810
smaller and smaller.

145
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,470
This is what delta
x is right now.

146
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,580
It's this distance.

147
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,510
But if delta x got a little
bit smaller, then the secant

148
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,160
line would look like that.

149
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,360
Got even smaller, the secant

150
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
line would look like that,
it gets even smaller.

151
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,240
Then we're getting pretty
close to the slope

152
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,860
of the tangent line.

153
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,970
The tangent line is this
thing right here that I

154
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,910
want to find the slope of.

155
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,970
Let's find a limit as our
delta x approaches 0.

156
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,400
So the limit as delta
x approaches 0 of our

157
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,240
slope of the secant

158
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,700
line of 6 plus delta
x is equal to what?

159
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,830
This is pretty straightforward.

160
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,350
You can just set this equal
to 0 and it's equal to 6.

161
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:54,280
So the slope of our tangent
line at the point x is equal to

162
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,615
3 right there is equal to 6.

163
00:07:57,615 --> 00:08:01,280
And another way we could write
this if we wrote that f of

164
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,450
x is equal to x squared.

165
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,770
We now know that the derivative
or the slope of the tangent

166
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,350
line of this function at the
point 3-- I just only evaluated

167
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:18,410
it at the point 3 right there--
that that is equal to 6.

168
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,670
I haven't yet come up with a
general formula for the slope

169
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,790
of this line at any point, and
I'm going to do that

170
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,330
in the next video.
