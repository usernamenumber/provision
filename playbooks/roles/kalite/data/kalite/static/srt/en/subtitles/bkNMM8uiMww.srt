1
00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:05,816
According to Filipo Brunelleschi's biographer

2
00:00:05,816 --> 00:00:09,974
he stood just inside the main doors of the Cathedral of Florence

3
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:13,574
when he conducted his first perspectival experiment

4
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:15,690
and that's where we are standing right now.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,848
We're very close to it. Brunelleschi's experiment demonstrated that linear perspective could produce

6
00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:28,364
an incredibly realistic illusion of three dimensional space on a two dimensional surface.

7
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:32,887
So this notion that we can actually develop a system that would be relatively easy to follow

8
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:37,194
but highly accurate that could translate the volumetric world that we move through,

9
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:42,054
through time, onto a frozen two-dimensional surface is really an extraordinary achievement.

10
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:44,158
There's some discussion amongst scholars

11
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:47,581
whether or not there was linear perspective in the ancient world

12
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,735
but if there was, it was lost.

13
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:54,237
Linear perspective was created at least for us in the modern world

14
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:58,783
by Brunelleschi in the 15th century, around 1420.

15
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:03,177
Right, and so some people say that Brunelleschi rediscovered linear perspective

16
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:06,924
in case the ancient Greeks an Romans had had it, before him.

17
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:11,623
Brunelleschi had gone to Rome, and had studied antiquity and some have hypothesised

18
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:17,356
that he developed the basis for linear perspective in an attempt to accurately portrait the buildings

19
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:20,439
that he was looking at, that he was sketching, that he was drawing.

20
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,285
It's certainly something that artists, begining really in the thirteen-hundreds,

21
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:29,744
were creating forms, they were creating human figures that were three-dimensional

22
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:33,770
by using modeling and making the figures poky and monumental.

23
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:38,353
Then you had the challenge of putting those figures within a believable space.

24
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:42,942
Giotto and Duccio had kind of approximated that space

25
00:01:42,942 --> 00:01:47,219
and began to create a kind of earthly setting for their figures,

26
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,329
but had not achieved perfect illusion of space for their figures to inhabit.

27
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:57,665
As the culture becomes increangly analytical, mathematical it's a trade-based culture

28
00:01:57,665 --> 00:02:02,292
this is a culture that is some ways may have demanded of its artist a kind of precision,

29
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:06,437
a kind of mathemetical accuracy in its representation.

30
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:08,292
And Brunalleschi delivers that.

31
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,458
So what does he do?

32
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:17,514
Brunelleschi creates a perpectively accurate image of the Baptistery and its surround.

33
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:21,784
Right. So Brunelleschi develops a system with just a few essential elements

34
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:26,269
and trough these elements is able to constract accurate scientific one-point perspective.

35
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:30,282
They include a vanishing point, which is at the viewer's horison line,

36
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:34,283
as well as a series of orthagonals or illusionisticly receding diagonals.

37
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:40,505
What Brunelleschi then does, is he paints or draws an image of the Baptistery with linear perspective

38
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:43,573
and puts a small hole in the center of it.

39
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:46,333
He takes that small drawing or painting, puts a handle on it,

40
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,876
and holds it in front of his face, but facig away from him.

41
00:02:50,877 --> 00:02:54,615
He then takes a mirror, and holds it in back of that.

42
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:58,615
Now remember, that his painting has a small hole in it so he can see through it

43
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:00,468
straight to the vanishing point.

44
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:03,110
So he is holding a mirror, at arms length,

45
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,277
and the actual painting with the hole in it right in front of him for his eye to look through.

46
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:12,427
Right, so he can see the painting's reflection in the mirror and if he pulls the mirror away

47
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:17,329
he can see the actual Baptistery and he can bring the mirror back to see the painting,

48
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,750
move the mirror away to see the actual Baptistery

49
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,755
and see if in fact those lines are well coordinated and it was a very convincing experiment.

50
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:29,072
What Brunelleschi saw in the reflection of the painting

51
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:32,482
looked exactly like the reality that was in fron of him.

52
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:36,147
This would have the most profound effect on the history of western art

53
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:41,592
Virtually, every painting in the western tradition after the 15th century is responding to linear perspective,

54
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:45,253
either adopting it, or very consciously rejecting it for some reason.

55
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:48,730
And within a couple of decades after Brunelleschi's discovery,

56
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:55,189
Alberti, the brilliant architect and theoretician, writes the book called 'On Painting',

57
00:03:55,189 --> 00:04:00,910
in which he codifies Brunalleschi's discovery and creates a manual for artists

58
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:05,238
of how to use linear perspective and how to make great paintings.
