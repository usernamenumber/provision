1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,910
Let's say we have triangle A, B, C, say it looks something like

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,810
I wanna think about the minimum amount of information

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,530
I wanna come up with a couple of postulates

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,160
that we can use to determine whether another triangle

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,150
is similar to triangle A-B-C

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,280
So we already know that if, if all three angle,

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,870
all three of the corresponding angles are congruent

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,460
to the corresponding angles on ABC, that we know

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,890
that we're dealing with congruent triangles

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,320
So, for example, if this is 30 degrees, this angle is 90 degrees

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,740
and this angle right over here is 60 degrees

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,810
And we have another triangle that looks like this,

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,280
that looks like this, it's clearly a smaller triangle,

14
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,240
but its corresponding angles, so this is 30 degrees,

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,740
this is 90 degrees and this is 60 degrees

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,660
We know that X-Y-Z in this case is going to be similar

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,100
to A-B-C

18
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,090
So we would know, we would know from

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,000
this because corresponding angles are congruent

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:09,710
We would know that triangle ABC is similar to triangle XYZ

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,180
And you gotta get the order right to make sure

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,100
that you have the right corresponding angles

23
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,190
Y corresponds to the 90 degree angle, X correspond

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,590
to the 30 degree angle, A correspond to the 30 degree angle

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,450
so A and X are the first two things

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,130
B and Y, which are the 90 degrees, second two

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,790
and then Z is the last one

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,310
So that's what we know already, if you have three angles

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,100
But do you need three angles?

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,860
If we only knew two end of the angles, would

31
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,100
that be enough?

32
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:32,640
Well, sure

33
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,580
Cause if you know two angles for a triangle, you know the third

34
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,790
So for example, if I have another triangle, if I have a triangle

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,060
that looks like this, I mean to look or draw it like this

36
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,080
And if I told you that only two of the corresponding angles

37
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,090
are congruent

38
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,480
So maybe, maybe this angle right here is congruent

39
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,310
to this angle and that angle right there is congruent to

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,300
that angle

41
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,490
Is that enough to say that these two triangles are similar?

42
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,870
Well, sure because in a triangle, if you know two of the angles

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,770
then you know what the last angle has to be

44
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,220
I you know that this is 30 and you know that is 90

45
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,830
then you know that this angle has to be 60 degrees

46
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,960
Whatever you, whatever these two angles are, subtract them

47
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,070
from 180 and that's going to be this angle

48
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,870
So in, in general, in order to show similarity, you don't have

49
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,360
to show three angles are, three corresponding angles

50
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,500
are congruent

51
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,840
You really just have to two, show two

52
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,830
So this it'll be our, the first of our similar, similarity postulates,

53
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,680
We call it Angle-Angle

54
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,460
If you can show two that corresponding angles are congruent

55
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,880
then we're dealing with similar triangles

56
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,170
So for example, just to put some numbers here, if you showed,

57
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,930
if this was 30 degrees and we know that on this triangle

58
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,900
this is 90 degrees right over here

59
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,720
We know that this triangle right over here is similar to

60
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,760
that one there

61
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,810
And you can really just go to the third angle pretty straight,

62
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,320
in a pretty straight forward way

63
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,790
You say this third angle is 60 degrees so all three angles

64
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,850
are the same

65
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,730
That's one of our constraints for similarity

66
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,290
Now other thing we, we know about similarity is

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,000
that the ratio between all of the sides are going to be the same

68
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,610
So for example, if we have another triangle right over here

69
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,340
Let me draw another triangle

70
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:26,630
I'll call this triangle, I'll call this triangle X, Y and Z

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,260
And let's say that we know that the ratio between A B

72
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,000
and X Y, we know that AB over XY,

73
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,100
so the ratio between this side and this side

74
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,660
Notice, we're not saying that they're congruent, we're just saying

75
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,870
that they're ratio, we're looking at the ratio now

76
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,610
We're saying that AB over XY, let's say that

77
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,280
that is equal to BC, BC over YZ

78
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:57,050
That is equal to BC over YZ and that is equal to AC,

79
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,560
that is equal to AC over XZ

80
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,070
So once again, this is one of, this is one the ways we say,

81
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,900
Hey! this means similarity

82
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,460
So if you have all three corresponding sides,

83
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,610
the ratio between all three corresponding sides are the same

84
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,480
then we know that we are dealing with similar triangles

85
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,140
So this is what we call Side-Side-Side Similarity

86
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,190
and you don't want to get this confused

87
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,050
with Side-Side-Side Congruent

88
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,180
So this are all of our similarity postulates

89
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,750
Similarity postulates or axioms

90
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,710
or things that we're gonna assume

91
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,180
and then we're gonna build off of them to solve problems

92
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,430
and prove other things

93
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,150
Side-Side-Side, when we're talking about congruence, means

94
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,240
that the corresponding sides are congruent

95
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,310
Side-Side-Side for similarity, we're saying

96
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,950
that the ratio between corresponding sides are going to be the same

97
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,180
So for example, if this right over here, if this right over here is,

98
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,380
let's say this right over her is 10 - let me, no, think

99
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,660
of a bigger number - let's say this is 60, this right over here is 30

100
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,530
and this right over here is 30 square roots of 3

101
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,080
And I just made those numbers right cause, you, you,

102
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,370
what we will soon learn what typical ratios are of

103
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,680
the sides of 30, 60, 90 triangles

104
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:18,630
And let's say, this one over here is 6, 3 and 3 square root of 3

105
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,220
Notice, AB over XY, AB over XY, 30 square root's of 3

106
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,460
over 3 square root's of 3 this will be 10, this will be 10

107
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,170
What is BC over XY?

108
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,980
30 divided by 3 is 10

109
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,290
And what is 60 divided by 6?

110
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,640
What, or, AC over XZ, AC over XZ,

111
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,020
Well that's going to be 10

112
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,620
So in general to go from the corresponding side here

113
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,920
to the corresponding side there, we always multiply

114
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,930
by 10 on every side

115
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,430
So, we're not saying that they're congruent or,

116
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,820
or we're not saying are the side

117
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,170
for this Side- Side-Side for similarity

118
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,220
We're saying that we're really just scaling them up by

119
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,220
the same amount

120
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,680
Or another way to think about it,

121
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,970
the ratio between corresponding sides are the same

122
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,590
Now what about, what about if we had,

123
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,160
if we had, let's start another triangle right over here

124
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,740
Let me draw it like this

125
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,340
I shall not leave this here so we can have our list

126
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,990
So let me draw another triangle ABC

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,570
Let's draw another triangle ABC, So this is A,B and C

128
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,520
And let's say that we know, let's say that we know

129
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,610
that this side to go, when we go to another triangle,

130
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,850
when we go to another triangle that,

131
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,950
we know that XY, that we know

132
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,280
that XY is AB multiplied by some constant

133
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,200
So, A, so I can write it over here, XY is equal

134
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,960
to some constant times AB

135
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,890
Actually let me make XY bigger so it actually, it doesn't have to be,

136
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,970
that constant can be less than 1, in which case

137
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,880
it would be a smaller value, but let me just do it that way

138
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,150
So let me just make XY look a little bit bigger

139
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,990
So let's say that this is X and that is Y

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,150
So let's say that we know, that XY, XY over AB, over AB is equal

141
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,080
to some constant

142
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,400
Or if you multiply both sides by AB,

143
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,620
you would get XY subscaled up version of AB

144
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,830
So, you know, maybe this is, maybe AB is 5, XY is 10

145
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,680
then our constant would be 2

146
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,080
We scaled it up by a factor of two

147
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,800
And let's say we also know, we also know

148
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:32,110
that angle ABC is congruent to XYZ

149
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,050
and I'll had another point over here

150
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,870
So let me draw another side, right over here, so this is Z

151
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,050
So let's say we also know that angle ABC is congruent to XYZ

152
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,610
Now let's say we know that the ratio

153
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,710
between BC and YZ is also this constant

154
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,580
The ratio between BC and YZ is also equal to the same constant

155
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,040
So an example where this is 5 and 10, maybe this is 3 and 6

156
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,930
The constant we're kind of doubling the length of the side

157
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,590
So is this triangle, is triangle XYZ going to be similar

158
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,610
Well if you think about it there's only one, if you say

159
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,800
that this is some multiple, if X, if XY is, is

160
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,620
the same multiple of AB as YZ is the multiple of BC

161
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,260
and this, the angle in between is congruent,

162
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,230
there's only one triangle we can set-up over here

163
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,340
We're, we're only constraint to one triangle right over here,

164
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,300
and that, and so we're completely constraining

165
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,570
the length of this side

166
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,030
And the length of this side is going to have to be

167
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,280
that same scale as that over there

168
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:41,270
And so we call that Side-Angle-Side Similarity, Side-Angle-Side

169
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,830
So, once again, we saw SSS and SAS in our congruent's postulates

170
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,340
but we're saying something different here

171
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,240
We're saying that in, in SAS,

172
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,130
if the ratio between one corresponding side and

173
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,670
the other corresponding, one corres

174
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,590
if the ratio between corresponding sides of

175
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,290
the two triangle are the same

176
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,600
So AB and XY of one corresponding side,

177
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,790
And then another corresponding side, so

178
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,840
that's that second side, so that's between BC and YZ

179
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,690
and the angle between them are congruent

180
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,710
then we're saying it's similar

181
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,620
For SAS, for congruency we said that the sides actually had

182
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,650
to be congruent

183
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,150
Here, we're saying that the ratio between

184
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,700
the corresponding sides just has to be the same

185
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,800
So for example, SAS just to apply it,

186
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,140
if I have, let me just draw, show some examples here

187
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,900
So let's say I have an exam a triangle here that is 3,2,4

188
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,520
And let's say we have another triangle here,

189
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:41,730
we have another triangle here that has length, that has length 9,6

190
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,410
We also know that the angle in between i are congruent

191
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,510
So that, that angle is equal to that angle

192
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,970
What SAS ins ins in the similarity world tells you is

193
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,190
that these triangles are definitely going to be similar triangles

194
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,150
That we're actually constraining because

195
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,960
there's actually only one triangle we can draw right over here

196
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,060
It's the triangle where all of the sides are going to have

197
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,950
to be scaled up by the same amount

198
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,640
So there's only one long side right here that we can actually draw

199
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,960
And that's going to have to be scaled up by three as well

200
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,750
There's only have,thi thi this is the only one possible triangle,

201
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,350
if you constrain this side, if you're saying look, this is 3 times

202
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,930
that side, this is 3 times that side and the angle between them

203
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,900
is congruent, there's only one triangle we can dra we can make

204
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,880
And we know there, there is a similar triangle

205
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,520
there where everything is scaled up by factor of 3

206
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,550
So that one triangle we can draw, has to be that one similar triangle

207
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,410
So this is what we're talking about, SAS

208
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,400
We're not saying that this side is congruent to that side or

209
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,230
that side is congruent to that side

210
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,810
We're saying that they're scaled up by the same factor

211
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,950
If we had another triangle, if we had another triangle

212
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,790
that looked like this, So maybe this is 9, this is 4

213
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,750
and the angle between them were congruent

214
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,710
You couldn't say that they're similar because this side is,

215
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,990
is scaled up by a factor of 3

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,400
This side is only scaled up by a factor of two

217
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,020
So this, when we write over there, you could not say

218
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,230
that it is neccess necessarily similar

219
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,500
And like wise, if you had a triangle that had length 9 here

220
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,250
and length 6 there but you did not know, you did not know

221
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,740
that these two angles are the same

222
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,290
Once again, you're not constraining this enough

223
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,200
and you would not know that those two triangles

224
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,830
are necessarily similar

225
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,550
Cause you don't know those, that middle angle is the same

226
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,860
Now you might be saying there's a few other postulates

227
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:31,810
that we had, we had, we had A AS when we dealt with congruency

228
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,860
but if you think about it,

229
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,930
we've already shown that two angles by themselves

230
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,610
are enough to show similarity

231
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,130
So why worry about an angle, angle and a side or

232
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,400
the ratio between the sides

233
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,760
Why even worry about that

234
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,600
And we also had Angle-Side-Angle in congruence

235
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,160
but once again, we already know that two angles are enough

236
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,100
so we don't need to throw in this extra side

237
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,060
So we don't even need this right over here

238
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,840
So these are going to be our similarity postulates

239
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,840
And I want to remind you, Side-Side-Side, this is different

240
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,320
than the Side-Side-Side for congruence

241
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,340
We're talking about the ratio between corresponding sides

242
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,180
We're not saying that they're actually congruent

243
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,510
And here, Side-Angle-Side, it's, it's different

244
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,320
than the Side-Angle-Side for congruence

245
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,900
It's kind of related but we're here, we're talking about

246
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,190
the ratio between the sides, not the actual measures
