1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,470
In the last set of videos, we've
hopefully familiarized

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,250
ourselves with the different
ways that a

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,630
company can raise capital.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,140
It can do it through
debt or equity.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,030
And we learned that debt
securities are

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,200
often called bonds.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,470
And equity securities you're
probably familiar with.

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,610
Those are stocks.

9
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,620
And then I left you with
a cliffhanger.

10
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,470
Let draw it so I don't
get ahead of myself.

11
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,570
So these are the assets of a
company and it was able to

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,430
generate these assets.

13
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,020
So there's a couple of ways
you can generate assets.

14
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,270
You can get investors through
equity, and we've done several

15
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,040
videos on that.

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,810
You start with the angel
investors, or maybe your rich

17
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,750
uncle, and then eventually get
venture capitalists, and you

18
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,320
do an initial public offering.

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,760
And then you can do follow-on
offerings.

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,380
And so on and so forth.

21
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,380
Now we see governments will buy
equity in you if you are a

22
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,880
bank that's too big to fail.

23
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,420
But we'll do a whole
playlist on that.

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,350
So equity.

25
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,270
That's one way that you can
get cash or get capital so

26
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,560
that you can buy assets
to run your business.

27
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,030
The other way is you can borrow
money from people.

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,820
So the equity holders
are actually the

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,790
owners of the company.

30
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,230
So you might have been part of
the equity holder, and you

31
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,260
have to sell some of the equity,
or sell some shares in

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,090
your company for someone
else to give money.

33
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,820
Then they become kind of
like your partner.

34
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,910
And the other way is you
could borrow money.

35
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,290
Let me draw that.

36
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,070
That we'll just put generally
as liability.

37
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,990
Debt isn't the only kind of
liability, but that's a pretty

38
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,430
reasonable simplification
for now.

39
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,220
There's other things.

40
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,930
In general, liability means you
owe something to somebody

41
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,180
in the future.

42
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,760
So these are liabilities.

43
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,970
And we'll assume right
now that your debt

44
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,070
is your main liability.

45
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,550
You might have other
liabilities.

46
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,760
You might have some type of
legal liability, where someone

47
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,190
is suing you or you had sprayed
asbestos on a bunch of

48
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,920
playgrounds, thinking that it
was actually good for the

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,770
playground equipment and now
there's all of this liability

50
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,670
because, well, you
get the idea.

51
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,610
But from now on we'll have the
simplification that debt is

52
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,270
your liability.

53
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,150
And we said there's different
kinds of debt.

54
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,410
If you securitize it,
it's often a bond.

55
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:02,690
Right?

56
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,860
That would be a certificate
that's an IOU from a company.

57
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,940
It'll pay you coupons or
interest and so forth.

58
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,789
Or you can also just get regular
bank debt, where you

59
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,320
owe the bank money.

60
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,510
And I left you with a question
the last time around.

61
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,460
I said, let's say this company
goes into bankruptcy.

62
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,440
And let's say that these assets
aren't worth what we

63
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,170
think they are, right?

64
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,250
In this world, if we just
have to sell off

65
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,730
these assets, fine.

66
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,440
The debt guys would
get paid off.

67
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,400
And the equity guys would get
left over with whatever else.

68
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,410
So let's say if this
was on our books.

69
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,140
Whenever you hear things like
book value, and I've done a

70
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,670
couple of videos on book value
versus market value, but the

71
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,930
book value is essentially
what you have on

72
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,680
your accounting books.

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,570
You say that this is
worth $10 million.

74
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:44,800
Right?

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,010
Let's say we've bought land
and factories and whatever

76
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,160
else worth $10 million.

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Let's say your debt
is $6 million.

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,360
Then your equity would
be worth $4 million.

79
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,780
And let's say, for whatever
reason, the economy turns

80
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,580
south or maybe this was some
type of business that's now

81
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,410
not viable.

82
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,040
So it's going to go
into bankruptcy.

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,770
And I'll get a little bit more
specific on the different

84
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,650
types of bankruptcy.

85
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,220
But we're assuming
liquidation.

86
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,760
Actually I'll just get
specific right now.

87
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,080
So when we say bankruptcy,
bankruptcy is

88
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,130
a very common word.

89
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,050
I think most people have a
general sense what it means.

90
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,970
They know it's bad and it means
to some degree that a

91
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,510
company can't operate
as it was before.

92
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,420
But there's a lot of confusion
over what it means.

93
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,940
There's actually two types
of bankruptcy.

94
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,190
There's liquidation.

95
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,780
And that's essentially saying
that, you know what, this

96
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,580
business doesn't
make any sense.

97
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,290
It doesn't make sense
to have the

98
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,350
employees and run the factories.

99
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,840
You're never going to make any
money, so you might as well

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,550
just sell everything you have.
You liquidate it all.

101
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,310
That's one type.

102
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,810
And that falls under the
category of Chapter 7.

103
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,620
And we're just talking
about corporate

104
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,730
bankruptcy right now.

105
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,250
There's also personal
bankruptcy.

106
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,825
And maybe we'll do a couple
of videos on that.

107
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:04,200
It might be especially relevant
in this economy.

108
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,090
Well, the other type is
reorganization or

109
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,340
restructuring.

110
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,990
And restructuring says,
you know what?

111
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,459
This factory here,
it's actually

112
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,610
making something useful.

113
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,430
It's actually generating
money.

114
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,430
And actually we can get more
value for what we have here if

115
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,600
we keep it running.

116
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,890
And we will just keep it
running, and we'll restructure

117
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,610
the company.

118
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,190
And usually that means changing
this side of it.

119
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,130
So maybe we'll cancel some
debt and all of that.

120
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,080
And I'll show you how that's
done in a reasonably fair way.

121
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,400
But just to understand kind of
a simplified scenario, let's

122
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,120
take liquidation into
consideration.

123
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,480
So let's say that this was my
website selling shoes online,

124
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,710
and that all of a sudden
people have

125
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,880
stopped wearing shoes.

126
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,060
It's just gone out of fashion,
so it makes no sense anymore

127
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,110
to sell shoes online.

128
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,320
So I'm just going to liquidate
my assets, my real estate that

129
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,270
I might have, my warehouses,
et cetera, et cetera.

130
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,160
My question that I left you with
in the last video was,

131
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,570
who gets it?

132
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,470
So let's say when we liquidate
it-- so we go into bankruptcy

133
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,690
and essentially all of the
assets are taken into

134
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,260
possession by the bankruptcy
court-- they're going to sell

135
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,820
these assets.

136
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,460
And let's say when they sell
them, they don't get $10

137
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,790
million for these assets.

138
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,590
They only get $5 million
for them.

139
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,250
Right?

140
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,390
I paid for them thinking that
they were useful in some way,

141
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:33,540
but they end up not to
be, so my assets--

142
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,430
You know what, I just realized
when I talked earlier about

143
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,170
there's two ways to raise
capital, there's a third way

144
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:37,700
to raise capial.

145
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:37,930
Right?

146
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,580
You can sell shares.

147
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,350
You can issue debt.

148
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,380
You can borrow money.

149
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,480
Obviously the third way is
actually just make money.

150
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,900
Right?

151
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,810
Once you start a company,
hopefully you generate

152
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,590
earnings, and that'll also
generate cash or capital that

153
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,790
you can reinvest in
the business.

154
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,640
And we'll talk about that.

155
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,640
But I just wanted to make it
clear that that's obviously

156
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,250
the best way to generate capital
for your business is

157
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,520
when the business itself
generates capital.

158
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,180
So let's say that these assets,
when you actually sell

159
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,760
them off, aren't worth
$10 million anymore.

160
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,340
Let me make the pointer
smaller.

161
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,730
They're worth $5 million.

162
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,320
-

163
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
So my question in the
last video is, who

164
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,750
gets this $5 million?

165
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,670
Do you somehow split it evenly
between all of these people?

166
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,000
Or does one of them get more
of it, or one of them gets

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
less of it?

168
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,890
And I think you'll get a sense
based on where I took the $5

169
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,680
million out of, who
gets the money.

170
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,630
It's the debt holders.

171
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,100
And the way I drew it right
here, you can kind of view it

172
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,760
as you go up in this
direction, you're

173
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,010
getting more senior.

174
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,580
-

175
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,850
Or if you're going down
in this way, you're

176
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,110
getting more junior.

177
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,750
And seniority, when you talk
about a company's capital

178
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,760
structure, is just, you know
what, if there's anything

179
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,860
left, who gets their
money first?

180
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,160
And even within the
debt, you'll have

181
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,280
different layers of debt.

182
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,520
There might be different debt
holders who have different

183
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,030
levels of seniority.

184
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,950
So this one might be called
senior secured debt.

185
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,490
-

186
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,370
Senior means they're high
up on the stack.

187
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,080
They are one of the first people
to get their money.

188
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,590
And secured means there's
actually some collateral on

189
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,170
the asset side that they get
if the company can't pay.

190
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,060
So maybe this is like
a piece of land.

191
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,490
Right?

192
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,240
So just in kind of our everyday
personal finance

193
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,150
world, your mortgage is
actually secured debt.

194
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,990
It's secured by the collateral
of your home.

195
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,830
If you can't pay the debt,
the bank comes

196
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,470
and takes your home.

197
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,040
It forecloses on the property.

198
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,320
So that's what secured means.

199
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,540
It means that there's some
collateral, and in the event

200
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,750
of a bankruptcy this guy can
immediately go and get the

201
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,620
collateral that his debt
is secured by.

202
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,310
So this is considered a very,
very senior form of debt.

203
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,620
Senior secured.

204
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,960
Then you might have here, you
might have senior unsecured.

205
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,620
-

206
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,070
And there's a lot of words
around, senior, junior,

207
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,110
subordinate, and all of that.

208
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,470
But just to get a sense that
there's just a hierarchy here.

209
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,620
Some people are the first people
to get the money, and

210
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,440
then whatever money is left goes
to this person, then if

211
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,460
there's any money left, it goes
to this person, and then

212
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,630
if there's anything left
it goes to this person.

213
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,460
And once you're in bankruptcy
court it does tend to be a

214
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,163
negotiation between the
different, you can almost view

215
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:16,120
it as buckets, of debt.

216
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,010
And we'll do a more complicated
example in the

217
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,590
future on that.

218
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,760
We'll actually delve into the
details of bankruptcy.

219
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,170
But this is the general
notion.

220
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,760
That the senior guys get made
whole first, then the more

221
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,420
junior guys get whatever's left,
and so on and so forth.

222
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,990
And if there's no money for the
equity, there's no money

223
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,679
for the equity.

224
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,610
And that makes sense, right?

225
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,400
Because the debt holders, all
they were getting-- their

226
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,070
upside was just interest,
right?

227
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,640
So they also should get limited
downside in the event

228
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,980
things should turn bad.

229
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,500
Equity holders, they kind
of took a gamble.

230
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,000
If things were great, they would
get all of the upside.

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,770
And now that things turn
bad, they take

232
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,500
a lot of the downside.

233
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,350
And they're actually lucky that
they don't owe money.

234
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,730
That's actually the-- I guess
you could call it-- the beauty

235
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,060
of a corporate structure, that
you have limited liability.

236
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,640
In some times in history, these
people would actually

237
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,770
owe the difference.

238
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,730
They would actually owe
this extra $1 million.

239
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,150
They would all go to debtor's
prison and all that.

240
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,670
But we'll talk more about
it in the future.

241
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,190
So anyway, just going back on
the different tranches of

242
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,730
debt, or buckets of debt.

243
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,840
So we could call this
senior unsecured.

244
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,380
And that means that they're
still senior.

245
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,780
They're still fairly high
up the seniority ladder.

246
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,440
But they're unsecured.

247
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,680
There's no particular assets
that they can go run.

248
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,190
But as long as there's enough
for them, they'll get it.

249
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,190
So let me put some
numbers here.

250
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,390
So let's say there was, I don't
know, $1 million of

251
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,750
senior secured.

252
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,570
Let's say there's $2 million
of senior unsecured.

253
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:40,930
And let's say that this is $2
million of subordinated--

254
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,870
subordinated just means they're

255
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,330
not senior-- unsecured.

256
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,780
So in this reality, what would
happen is the bankruptcy court

257
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,780
would liquidate all this stuff
and then they'll hand it out

258
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,620
in order of seniority.

259
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,620
These guys get their
$1 million back.

260
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,980
So they're made whole.

261
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,000
And they probably charged a
lower interest rate, because

262
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,680
they didn't perceive their risk
that high to begin with.

263
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,290
These guys, right here, the
senior unsecured, they'll get

264
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,300
the next $2 million.

265
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,980
And then there's $1
million left.

266
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,490
Right?

267
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,700
And that $1 million will go
to the subordinated debt.

268
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,870
So they'll get 50% of
their money back.

269
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,120
So they took a little bit of a
hit, but that's OK because

270
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,300
when things were good, they
probably got higher interest

271
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,650
to compensate them
for their risk.

272
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,810
Usually as you get more and more
junior and you take on

273
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,630
more risk, you get more upside,
or more interest. And

274
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,930
in this case the equity
holders get nothing.

275
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,790
They get wiped out.

276
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,860
So it just goes to 0.

277
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,190
So that's the answer
to the question.

278
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,360
I said, who gets the money?

279
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,430
Well, it's the debt holders
get first dibs.

280
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:45,720
And if there was actually $7
million here instead of $5

281
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,820
million, then you would have
paid the six off completely,

282
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,810
and then the equity holders
would've gotten $1 million.

283
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,580
And so they would have gotten
something if there was enough

284
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,840
money to hand it to them.

285
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,950
Anyway, in the next video I'll
cover-- this was liquidation,

286
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,420
where we just say this
isn't worth running.

287
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,440
Let's just give it all away, or
let's sell it, and give it

288
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,675
back to our creditors.

289
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:12,430
In the next video I'll talk
about reorganization, where we

290
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,190
say, hey, you know what?

291
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,480
This business is a
good business.

292
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,110
It just has too many
liabilities.

293
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,870
See you in the next video.
