1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
   

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,820
So far, we've been assuming that
the discount rate is the

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,880
same thing, no matter
how long of a period

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,590
we're talking about.

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,670
But we know if you go to the
bank and you say, hey, bank, I

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,580
want to essentially invest in
a one-year CD, they'll say,

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,720
oh, OK, one-year CD
will give you 2%.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,850
And you're like, well, what
if we give you the

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,420
money for two years?

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,610
So you can keep our money,
locked in for even longer.

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,910
They'll say, oh, then we'll
give you a little bit more

12
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,520
interest, because we have
more flexibility.

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,230
For two years, we don't have
to worry about paying you.

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,510
So instead of giving you 2%,
we'll give you 7%, because we

15
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,800
get to keep your money
for two years.

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,170
And maybe if you say, well,
you know, I actually don't

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,820
even need my money for 10 years,
so let me give you the

18
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,510
money for 10 years.

19
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,170
They'll say oh, 10 years, if
we get to keep your money,

20
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,830
we'll give you 12%.

21
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,420
So in general-- and this tends
to be the case, although it's

22
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,660
not always the case-- the longer
that you defer your

23
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,700
money, or the longer you lock
up the money, the higher an

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,990
interest rate you get.

25
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,220
So the same thing is true when
you're doing a discount rate.

26
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,500
Oftentimes you want to discount
a payment two years

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,410
out by a higher value than
something that's

28
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,860
only one year out.

29
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,920
So how do you do that?

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,230
So let's say the risk-free rate,
if you were to go out

31
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:18,450
and get a government bond-- the
one-year rate, let's say

32
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,010
that they're only
giving you 1%.

33
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,910
But let's say that the
two-year rate,

34
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,550
they'll give you 5%.

35
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,680
So what does that mean?

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,720
Well, let's take the example.

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,770
So that means you could take
that $100 and essentially lend

38
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,130
it to the federal government,
and in a year they'll

39
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,850
give you 1% on it.

40
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,350
So that these are
annual rates.

41
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,750
So 1%, 1.01 times 100, that's
just $101, right?

42
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,880
Fair enough.

43
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,920
Now your other option is,
you could lock it in.

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,750
You could lend it to the federal
government for two

45
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,380
years and not see your money.

46
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,490
And they say, oh, then we're
going to give you 5% a year.

47
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,280
So then you're going
to go 5% a year.

48
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,990
So how much do you end
up with in two years?

49
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,410
Well, remember, this
is an annual rate.

50
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,560
These are always quoted
in annual rates.

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,350
So if you're getting 5% a year,
that's going to be equal

52
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,040
to-- let's do it on
the calculator.

53
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,140
That's going to be 100-- after
one year you're going to get

54
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,460
1.05, and after two years you're
going to get 1.05.

55
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,050
Or you can view that as 100
times 1.05 squared.

56
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:34,010
So you'd have $110.25.

57
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,220
So you already see, not even
doing any present value, this

58
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,260
is actually-- you can almost
view this as a future value

59
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,300
calculation.

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,380
If you take a future value,
you already know that this

61
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,310
option is better than this
option, when you have these

62
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,630
varying interest rates.

63
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,280
But anyway, the whole topic of
this is to talk about present

64
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,680
value, so let's do that.

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,530
So in this circumstance,
what is the present

66
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,970
value of the $110?

67
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,550
Well, actually, what is the
present value of the $100?

68
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,330
Well, we always know that.

69
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,260
That's easy.

70
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,750
That is $100.

71
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,240
Present value of $100
today is $100.

72
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,500
What is the present
value of the $110?

73
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,870
So we take $110, and we're
going to use the two-year

74
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,110
rate, and discount twice.

75
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,210
And that makes sense, because
essentially you're deferring

76
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,560
your money for two years.

77
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,430
You're not going to
get anything,

78
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,210
even a year from now.

79
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,150
So you're deferring your
money for two years.

80
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:25,530
So you divide it by 1-- so it's
a 5% rate, 1.05 squared.

81
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,630
And then that is equal to--
I think that was our first

82
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,320
problem, right?

83
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,040
So I'll just do it again.

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,770
110 divided by 1.05 squared.

85
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,940
That's equal to $99.77, right?

86
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,370
That was our first problem.

87
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,410
And now this one
is interesting.

88
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,840
The $20 you get today-- and
this is a side note.

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,820
It's very important when you're
doing this, when they

90
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,120
talk about year one, or year
zero, just make sure-- is that

91
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
today, is that a
year from now?

92
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,720
Because if it's a year from now,
you'd have to discount it

93
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,360
by the one-year interest rate.

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,120
If it's today, you don't
discount it.

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,740
So anyway, I clarified that.

96
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,510
I was a little ambiguous about
that in the last two videos,

97
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,230
but I clarified it.

98
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,890
The $20 is now.

99
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,450
So the present value of
something given you today, is

100
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,240
the value of it.

101
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,080
So it's $20 plus $50.

102
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,205
Now $50, what do we use?

103
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:15,640
Do we use the one-year rate
or the two-year rate?

104
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,160
Well of course, we use the
one-year rate, because you're

105
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,800
not deferring the pleasure of
that $50 for two years.

106
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,760
You're actually getting
it in one year.

107
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:30,580
So plus $50 divided by
the one-year rate.

108
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,830
Divided by 1.01.

109
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:38,450
Plus $35 divided by the two-year
rate-- but this is an

110
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,310
annual rate, so you have to
discount it twice-- divided by

111
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,510
1.05 squared.

112
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,720
Let's get the TI-85 out.

113
00:04:49,720 --> 00:05:01,960
So you get 20 plus 50 divided
by 1.01, plus 35 divided by

114
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:15,430
1.05 squared, is equal
to $101.25.

115
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,090
So notice, the actual payment
streams I did not change in

116
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,330
any of the three scenarios.

117
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,500
And let me just draw a line
between them, because I got a

118
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,740
little bit messy.

119
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,480
So that was scenario one.

120
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,730
This is scenario two.

121
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,190
And this is scenario three.

122
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,040
But in scenario one, because we
used a 5% discount rate for

123
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,050
all-- you could say, I don't
want to use fancy words-- but

124
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,410
for all durations out we used
a 5% discount rate.

125
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,700
We saw that choice number
one was the best.

126
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,840
But then if the discount rate
were to change-- if we were to

127
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,760
change our assumption.

128
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,910
If we had a 2% rate, for
whatever reason, we could lend

129
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,160
money to the federal government
in the form of

130
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,305
buying bonds from them-- we
could lend the federal

131
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:03,480
government two years over
any time period at 2%.

132
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,830
Then all of a sudden, choice
two became the best option.

133
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,060
And then finally, if we had this
kind of-- and this is the

134
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,640
most realistic scenario, and
even though the math is fairly

135
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,270
simple, we're actually doing
something fairly

136
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,040
sophisticated here.

137
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,960
When I had a different discount
rate for my one year

138
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,150
out cash flows and my two year
out cash flows, and it was

139
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,140
these exact numbers.

140
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,930
I had to play with the numbers
to get the right result.

141
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:36,520
Then all of a sudden choice
three was the best option.

142
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,460
I'll leave it to you-- I want
you to think about why this

143
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,030
was better for choice three than
it was for choice two.

144
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,030
And if you really understand
that, then I think you are

145
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,980
starting to have a
lot of intuition

146
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,790
about present values.

147
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,400
And frankly, what we're
learning here is a

148
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,440
discounted cash flow.

149
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,420
What is a discounted
cash flow?

150
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,370
I'm giving you a stream
of cash flows.

151
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,660
$20 now, $50 a year from
now, $35 in two years.

152
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,500
And you are essentially
discounting them back to get

153
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,220
today's present value.

154
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,770
So when someone says, you know,
I can use Excel to do a

155
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,530
discounted cash flow, that's
all they're doing.

156
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,160
They're making some assumption
about the discount rates.

157
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,780
And they're just using this
fairly straightforward

158
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,720
mathematics to get the
present value of

159
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,980
those future cash flows.

160
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,940
But it's a very powerful
technique.

161
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,950
Because if you were to take--
if you're good at Excel, and

162
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,690
you were to say, oh,
I have a business.

163
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,790
And based on my assumptions, in
year one, right now, this

164
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,060
business gives me $20.

165
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,490
The next year it's going
to give $50.

166
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,290
The year after that it's $35.

167
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,990
And this risk-free is
the big assumption.

168
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,800
But if it was risk-free, you
could discount it like that.

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,800
You'd say, if these are the
interest rates, this business

170
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,690
is worth $101.25.

171
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,936
That's what I'm willing
to pay for it.

172
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:48,600
Or, I'm neutral.

173
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,820
If I could get it for $90,
that's a good deal for me.

174
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,610
That's all a discounted
cash flow is.

175
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,980
But the big learning from this
is how dependent the present

176
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:04,090
value of future payments are
on your discount rate

177
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,820
assumption.

178
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,800
The discount rate assumption
is everything in finance.

179
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,210
And this is where finance really
diverges from a lot of

180
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,330
other fields, especially
the sciences.

181
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,740
There really is no
correct answer.

182
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,430
It's all assumption driven.

183
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,930
All of these discounted cash
flows, and all these models,

184
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,340
they're really just to
help you understand

185
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,600
the dynamics of things.

186
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,090
And frankly-- and this happens
a lot in the real world of

187
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,130
finance-- if you ever become
an analyst at an investment

188
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,580
bank, you'll probably
do this yourself.

189
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,500
But you can almost justify any
present value, by picking the

190
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,630
right discount rate.

191
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,620
And actually the whole topic of,
how do you decide on the

192
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,370
right discount rate?

193
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,080
Because we assumed risk-free.

194
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,890
Everything is risk-free.

195
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,450
You're guaranteed
these payments.

196
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,810
But we know in the real world,
if you're investing in

197
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,020
pets.com and they tell you
that they're going to pay

198
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,650
these cash flows to you,
that's not risk-free.

199
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,560
There's some risk implicit
in that.

200
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,700
So actually, most of finance,
and most of portfolio theory,

201
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,700
and modern finance, is
based on figuring out

202
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,970
that discount rate.

203
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,760
And that is the crux of
everything, because as we see,

204
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,070
that completely changes which of
these options is the best.

205
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,970
But anyway, I don't want to
confuse you too much.

206
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,510
What you have already is
a very powerful tool.

207
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,100
If you can think of a discount
rate, you can make a very

208
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,150
rational comparison between
three, or ten, or whatever

209
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,940
different types of payments.

210
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,920
And this is actually
really useful.

211
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,720
You don't realize how
many things in the

212
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,040
world are like this.

213
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,260
These college payment schemes
where you pay some company $25

214
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,130
a year for 20 years, and then in
year 21 they're willing to

215
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,510
pay for your college tuition, or
your kids' college tuition.

216
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,650
You could figure out with that
really is worth, how much

217
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,300
money are they making off
of you, by taking a

218
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,460
discounted cash flow.

219
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,780
And of course if you're
paying out, these

220
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,750
become negative numbers.

221
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,950
And when they pay you, it
becomes a positive number.

222
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,250
Anyway.

223
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,950
Maybe I'll do that in a couple
of videos, because I think

224
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,090
that's a fairly useful thing
to be able to analyze.

225
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,080
See you in the next video.
