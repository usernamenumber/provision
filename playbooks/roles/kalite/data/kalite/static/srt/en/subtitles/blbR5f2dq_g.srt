1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,834
In the last video we began to explore the IS curve

2
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:07,440
which, as I think I mentioned, stands for investment savings

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,636
And we really analyzed it from the point of view of investment

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:16,835
we thought of it as real interest rates driving the level of investment

5
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:20,442
which drives the equilibrium level of real output

6
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:23,419
High real interest rates - low level of investment

7
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:26,570
low level of investment leads to low level of equilibrium output

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,591
So this scenario is closer to that right over there

9
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:34,770
If real interest rates are lower then that leads to higher levels of planned investment

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,005
which leads to a higher level of equilibrium output

11
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,504
so that right over there

12
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:41,590
What I want to do in this video

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,670
so that was more from the investment point of view

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,969
What I want to do in this video is explore the exact same relationship

15
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:50,838
the exact same curve, but think of it more from savings point of view

16
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:53,503
and in this situation we're going to have the exact same thing

17
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:57,101
but instead of viewing real interest rates as driving GDP

18
00:00:57,101 --> 00:01:01,423
we're actually going to view GDP as driving real interest rates

19
00:01:01,423 --> 00:01:03,838
So let me leave this up here

20
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:07,637
Let's just break down the expenditure model of GDP

21
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:12,102
So we know that aggregate income, or aggregate GDP, or aggregate output

22
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:13,253
however you want to think of it

23
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:17,170
Is equal to, and you can break it up into it's component expenditures

24
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,770
its equal to aggregate consumer spending, which is a function

25
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:27,236
of disposable income. Y - T is disposable income - aggregate income minus taxes

26
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:31,298
plus investment

27
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:35,309
plus government expenditures

28
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:38,505
and I could do net exports, but for simplicity for this discussion

29
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:40,700
we'll just assume we're in a closed economy

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,442
it makes conceptualizing saving and investment a little bit easier

31
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:47,369
Now, what I want to do is solve for investment

32
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,175
So if I solve for investment, I'm just going to subtract

33
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:53,970
this piece and this piece from this equation

34
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:03,874
and I get aggregate income minus total aggregate consumer spending

35
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:07,089
minus total government spending

36
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:13,437
is equal to, on the right hand side I'm just going to be left with investments right over here

37
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:17,103
and this thing right over here is interesting

38
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:21,521
because this is total income minus...

39
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:23,923
Let me make sure that we- I don't want to confuse you

40
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:25,249
because that looks like a lower case 'c'

41
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:27,500
and if we're talking about aggregate consumption, it's usually and upper case 'c'

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,338
So on the left hand side, we have total aggregate income minus consumer spending

43
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:35,255
minus government spending

44
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,168
so you could really view this as this right over here

45
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:40,590
really is aggregate savings

46
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,708
this over here really is savings

47
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:48,257
And as we see when one side of the economy, when people are saving that goes into banks

48
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:52,101
and it gets lent out, and then it gets reinvested

49
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:54,919
or you could save directly by reinvesting

50
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:57,836
And so what we have here, savings is equal to investment

51
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,340
and that's why it's called an IS curve

52
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,701
because when you look at the expenditure model, savings and investment are really the same thing

53
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,504
They could have- they are really just saying,

54
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:06,504
look, there's two ways to view this curve

55
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:10,501
it's investment driven, or it's savings driven

56
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:14,968
and when you think of it this way, you have slightly different view of this curve

57
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:17,436
because when you view it from a savings point of view,

58
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:20,169
you say "well what's going to happen if GDP goes up?"

59
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:23,837
"what happens if he have a high GDP over here?"

60
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,582
So if we have a high GDP-

61
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:31,042
or let's say in particular, if GDP goes up,

62
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,834
the consumer spending, which is a function of GDP, it will go up

63
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,703
but it won't go up as much

64
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:39,036
it's going to go up by this expression right here

65
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:43,250
times <u><u></u>_</u> linear model, times the marginal propensity to consume

66
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,071
which is less than one, it's between 0 and 1

67
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:48,102
So this is going to go up less than that

68
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:54,043
and then we can- for the sake of this model we'll assume right now that happens without any changes in government expenditure

69
00:03:54,043 --> 00:04:00,703
So this, if total aggregate income goes up, then savings are going to go up

70
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:02,998
if we assume government expenditure holds constant

71
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:08,770
so then we have savings goes up

72
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,250
and if savings goes up, that means we have more loanable funds

73
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,924
there is more money to lend

74
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:17,921
and if there's more money to lend, what's going to happen to interest rates?

75
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:21,103
Well, interest rates are just the price of borrowing money

76
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:22,436
the price of money

77
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:25,436
So if you have more of something, the price of that thing goes down

78
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:31,176
So if savings goes up, then real interest rates go down

79
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:35,036
So if you have a high GDP, you're going to end up with low interest rates

80
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:38,923
So, once again, looking at it from the point of view of GDP driving interest rates

81
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:41,969
we have high savings here, so we're going to have low interest rates

82
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:47,169
and you view it the other way around, if you have a lower income

83
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,303
this thing is going to also decrease

84
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,036
but it's not going to decrease as much as this did

85
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:56,702
because of the marginal propensity to consume is less than one

86
00:04:56,702 --> 00:05:00,970
we saw that up here, we saw that all the way over here, right over there

87
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,433
and so, in aggregate, the savings are going to go down

88
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,002
once again, we hold government spending constant

89
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:10,770
So in this situation savings are going to go down

90
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,834
and if you have fewer loanable funds, there's less savings to lend out

91
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:19,500
Then, if you have less of a supply of something, what's going to happen to it's price?

92
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,903
The price is going to go up, the price of borrowing money is the interest rate

93
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:27,037
So in this situation, interest rates would go up

94
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:30,255
So that's going in this direction, right over here

95
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:36,436
if aggregate income goes down, loanable funds go down, interest rates are going to be higher

96
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,971
So, once again, same exact curve

97
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,503
IS curve, but there's two takeaways here

98
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,101
One is to realize why it's called IS - then investment and savings (when you view it from this point of view)

99
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:47,708
really are the same thing

100
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,309
One person's savings can be another person's investment

101
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:56,254
And when we viewed it from the investment point of view, we were viewing r as driving Y

102
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:58,107
now we're looking at it the other way around

103
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,910
Y is driving savings, which is driving r

104
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,910
but it gives us the exact same relationship for this model
