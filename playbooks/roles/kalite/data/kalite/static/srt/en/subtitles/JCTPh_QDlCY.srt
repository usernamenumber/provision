1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,182
[intro piano music]

2
00:00:06,182 --> 00:00:07,673
Ok! Bryn and Monica.

3
00:00:07,673 --> 00:00:09,648
We are standing before the New York Kouros.

4
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:11,602
And that means what, Monica?

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,587
"Kouros" means young man in Greek.

6
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:18,215
Ok. So this is a general term that refers to a sculpture of a young man.

7
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:19,759
OK. So, a sculpture of a young man.

8
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:20,900
So we walk up to this

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,247
not recognizing it is a portrait of an individual.

10
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:27,225
No, this is really a type, an idealized male form.

11
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:28,647
But a man not a god?

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,790
Absolutely! These are believed to be grave markers.

13
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:36,862
And of course, one thing you can't escape

14
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:38,335
when you walk up to this, it is nude.

15
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:39,209
Absolutely!

16
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:41,095
So they are taking off of the clothing

17
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:43,747
to focus on the ideal, young male form.

18
00:00:43,747 --> 00:00:45,815
So if this was a portrait it might be a little strange

19
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:48,238
to have the man being naked, right?

20
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:49,696
And a Kenneth Clark interpretation,

21
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:51,538
the difference between the naked and the nude,

22
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:53,034
rather than someone without clothing,

23
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:55,036
the nude is an ideal form.

24
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:58,505
Right, focusing on the perfection of the human body.

25
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:01,829
And a young man, so an expression in a very narrow range

26
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,792
Of a man around twenty years old. Yes.

27
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:07,082
OK, now the first thing we notice about it,

28
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:08,136
it's extremely frontal.

29
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,790
It only makes sense from the front.

30
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,229
So it's not meant to be experienced in around. Right.

31
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:13,861
Only from the front or the back.

32
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,279
Oh yes that's correct!

33
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:17,894
And an Egyptian posture that is undeniable, right?

34
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:19,725
The hands kind of locked to the sides,

35
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:21,798
the stepping forward with the knees locked,

36
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:23,410
and even the hairdress that looks Egyptian.

37
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,915
Right. And even though he is stepping forward,

38
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:27,856
that the weight is balanced perfectly over both feet,

39
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:30,936
just looks as if though he is about to walk somewhere.

40
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:34,316
So we wouldn't mistake this for an Egyptian statue because of its nudity

41
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:37,246
and as you've mentioned because of the naturalism of the posture. Correct!

42
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:40,760
But, nobody is denying that it comes from an Egyptian influence.

43
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,371
Yes, because we see many Egyptians sculptures with this very kind of pose.

44
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,321
OK, so a transitional moment for the Greek statuary

45
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:49,580
between what's known as the the Geometrical Period,

46
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,075
or the Orientalizing Period, in some vocabularies,

47
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:55,160
to the Archaic.

48
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,875
So it's the starting of a new period

49
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,942
And it is interesting that terminology, the Archaic Period,

50
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:03,416
In the historical way anticipating the era of the Classical.

51
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,408
That's right. This sort of idealizes the Classical Period.

52
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:08,185
They're getting a point for that.

53
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:10,632
So, maybe more responsibly if we would call this the sixth century,

54
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:13,828
the period before the Classical...BCE.

55
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:16,055
And we certainly see the beginning of something here

56
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:20,100
with life size, a litte less than life size, male nude sculpture.

57
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:23,473
What distinguishes this from the figures

58
00:02:23,473 --> 00:02:25,634
in the next gallery, the Classical Period?

59
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:28,369
And while we're getting a personal view of this,

60
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:30,252
all the crowds are in the Classical section

61
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:31,562
Because, in the Classical section,

62
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:37,833
the human forms really correspond much more naturalistically to true life.

63
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,336
The proportions are correct, they are less stiff,

64
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:42,677
they exist more in the rounds,

65
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:44,721
they make sense from all sides.

66
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:48,308
So ideal types but more lifelike. Exactly!

67
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:50,256
This one is still little patterned and stiff.

68
00:02:50,256 --> 00:02:53,683
Correct! The musculature, well, there's a clear interest by the sculptor

69
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:55,914
in the underlying forms of the human body.

70
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:57,691
The bones, the musculature,

71
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:01,940
they are standardized, they are formalized into geometric shapes.

72
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,421
While in the Classical period,

73
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:05,773
they're really correspond much more naturalistically

74
00:03:05,773 --> 00:03:07,950
to the way the human body actually looks.

75
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,573
And that design even carries over to the face.

76
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:12,642
So the face looking a bit like a mask,

77
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:14,978
even with a bit of that forced smile...

78
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:16,388
they called it "the archaic smile."

79
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:18,434
Exactly. And the stylized eyes,

80
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:21,227
the eyebrows that continue right from the side of the nose.

81
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:22,652
And, as you've mentioned before,

82
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:26,958
the hair is well stylized so it's perfectly regular

83
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:27,640
sort of beaded rods.

84
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,725
So we would expect in the classical period

85
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:32,704
to see still idealized young male figures,

86
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,883
but we would expect to see them less patterned and abstract.

87
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:39,191
Right, much more naturalistic!
