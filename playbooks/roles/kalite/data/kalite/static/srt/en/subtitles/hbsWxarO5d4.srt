1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,250
   

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,460
OK, we are in problem
number 9.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,070
   

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,490
If 2 times x minus 3 is equal to
7, what is the value of x?

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,550
Well, this is straightforward.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,660
Just solve for x problem,
divide both sides by 2.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,100
Or actually, yeah, we could
do it either way.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,550
We could say this is 2x
minus 6 is equal to 7.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,420
Add 6 to both sides, you
get 2x is equal to 13.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,740
Divide both sides by 2. x is
equal to 13/2, which is the

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,710
same thing as 6 and 1/2,
which is the same

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,510
thing as 6.5, right?

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,210
That's 12, yep.

14
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:48,820
Problem 10.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:55,470
Point P lies on the line with
the equation y minus 4 is

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,060
equal to 3 times x minus 2.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:08,910
If the x-coordinate of P is 4--
OK, so P is the 0.4, what

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,510
is the y-coordinate?

19
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,820
So we don't know what the
y-coordinate is, so we

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,525
literally just have to solve--
we have to just input 4 for x

21
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:19,290
and then solve for y.

22
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,690
So you get y minus 4 is equal
to 3 times 4 minus 2.

23
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,980
y minus 4 is equal to 3
times 4 minus 2 is 2.

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,740
y minus 4 is equal to 6.

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,805
y is equal to 10.

26
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:36,930
And that's our answer.

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,840
The point is 4, 10, but they
just wanted to know the

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,490
y-coordinate, and that's 10.

29
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,970
Problem 11.

30
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,620
Car A traveled 60 miles and
averaged 20 miles per gallon

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,380
of gasoline.

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:03,910
So car A traveled 60 miles and
got 20 miles per gallon, mpg,

33
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,660
miles per gallon.

34
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:13,450
Car B traveled 15 miles
for each gallon.

35
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,810
OK, so it got 15 miles
per gallon, right?

36
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,310
It traveled 15 miles for each
gallon of gasoline it used.

37
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,040
How many miles had car B
traveled when it had used the

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,490
same amount of gasoline that car
A used to travel 60 miles?

39
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,340
So they're saying we need to
figure out how many gallons A

40
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,890
used, and then how far
can B get with that

41
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,990
same number of gallons?

42
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,790
That's essentially what
they're asking.

43
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,240
So how many gallons did
A use to go 60 miles?

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,860
Well, we've got 20 miles per
gallon and went 60 miles.

45
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:53,750
So car A could do this
on 3 gallons, right?

46
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:03,120
The way you can view this,
gallons times miles per gallon

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,490
is equal to miles, right?

48
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,920
And so gallons, we'll say g
times 20 miles per gallon is

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,170
equal to 60 miles.

50
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,540
So gallons, divide both sides
by 20, is equal to 30.

51
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,330
That's times right there.

52
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,790
I'm sorry, it's equal to 3.

53
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,460
60 divided by 20 is 3.

54
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,000
So car A used 3 gallons
to go 60 miles.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:39,800
And so car B can go 15 miles
per gallon times 3 gallons

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,090
equals 15 times 3
is 45 gallons.

57
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,340
Next problem.

58
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:54,020
   

59
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,500
OK, see if I can draw that.

60
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,680
It's a straight line here.

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,025
Straight line, point A comes
up to this point to B.

62
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,850
It comes down a little bit.

63
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,660
And then point C comes
down here.

64
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,390
   

65
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,190
OK, and they're telling us
that this is 65 degrees.

66
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,180
This is 100 degrees.

67
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,940
This is 120.

68
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,430
And this, right here,
is x degrees.

69
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,700
In the figure above, points A,
D, and E lie on the same line.

70
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,190
This is A.

71
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,050
This is D.

72
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,220
This is E.

73
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,330
They lie on the same line.

74
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,690
What is the value of x?

75
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,700
So we really just need to figure
out the value of this,

76
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,160
and then we can say x is
supplementary to that.

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,410
So let's think about how we can
think about what the value

78
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,240
of this angle is.

79
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,150
So the way I think about it is
draw a line here, and you

80
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,500
could automatically know what
all the angles in a

81
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,770
quadrilateral are.

82
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,710
But I'll prove it to you that
all the angles in a

83
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,110
quadrilateral are going
to add up to 360.

84
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,590
How do I know that?

85
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:11,010
Because think of it this way:
this angle plus this angle

86
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,630
plus this angle is
going to be 180.

87
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,280
And then this angle plus this
angle plus this angle

88
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,200
is going to be 180.

89
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,730
And if you add all of those
together, you're essentially

90
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,570
adding all of the angles of
the quadrilateral-- it's

91
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,190
late-- because this and this is
equal to the angle of the

92
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:30,900
whole quadrilateral.

93
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,390
So the angles in the entire
quadrilateral are 360 degrees.

94
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,570
And you can memorize
that if you want.

95
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,190
So if we know that all of these
angles add up to 360

96
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,060
degrees, what is this big
angle right here?

97
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:50,150
Well, we know that 65 plus 100
plus 120 plus-- let's call

98
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,010
this angle y, and y is this
whole thing-- plus y is equal

99
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,980
to 360 degrees.

100
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,660
And this is what?

101
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:05,220
This is 220 plus 65, 285
plus y is equal to 360.

102
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:13,300
So y is equal to 360 minus
285, and that is what?

103
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,620
That is 75 degrees, right?

104
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,890
Because 70 would
be 350, right?

105
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,100
So y is 75 degrees.

106
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,220
So this whole angle
right there is 75.

107
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,860
And we know that x plus this
big angle here, 75-- and

108
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,840
ignore this green line.

109
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,660
I'm looking about
this big angle.

110
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,470
x plus 75 is equal to 180.

111
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,280
So x has to be equal
to 105 degrees.

112
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,820
Subtract 75 from both sides.

113
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:50,700
Next question, problem 13.

114
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,770
The first term of a sequence
is 20 and the

115
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,830
second term is 8.

116
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,450
So it goes from 20,
then it goes to 8.

117
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,090
The third term and each term
thereafter is the average of

118
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,380
the two terms immediately
preceding it.

119
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,990
What is the value of the first
term in the sequence that is

120
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,490
not an integer?

121
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:06,790
OK.

122
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,700
So we just have to average
these two.

123
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,540
So this is going to be what?

124
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,500
It's going to be 28
divided by 2.

125
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,940
28/2, which equals 14, right?

126
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,950
I just took 20 plus 8
divided by 2 is 14.

127
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,910
And now, what's the average
of 8 and 14?

128
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,202
Well, 8 plus 14 is 22.

129
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:31,840
So 22 divided by 2, which
is equal to 11.

130
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,260
Delete my work.

131
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,750
Now, what's the average
of 14 and 11?

132
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,900
You add them, you get
25 divided by

133
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,480
2, that equals 12.5.

134
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,180
So here we go.

135
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,150
This is the first number in
the series that is not an

136
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,500
integer, 12.5.

137
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,310
And you could fill that in.

138
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,970
Problem 14.

139
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,050
If x is 1/5 of y-- so
x is equal to 1/5y.

140
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,600
   

141
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,970
y is 3/10 of z.

142
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:07,870
y is equal to 3/10z and z is
greater than 0, then x is what

143
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,200
fraction of z?

144
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,160
So you could literally just
substitute here, right?

145
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,720
You can just substitute
this y.

146
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,330
You could substitute
3/10z for y, right?

147
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,510
Because we say y is equal to
3 times z, so x is equal

148
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,600
to 1/5 times y.

149
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,220
We're going to substitute
for y, 3/10z.

150
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,670
So x is equal to--
what is this?

151
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,475
3/50z.

152
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:35,830
So x is 3/50 of z.

153
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,370
So you would fill in 3/50
in your answer box.

154
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,580
OK, Next problem.

155
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,895
Well, I don't know if I have
time to do it in this video.

156
