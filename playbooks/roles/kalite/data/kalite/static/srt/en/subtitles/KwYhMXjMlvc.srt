00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:10,472
We're looking at a small romanesque wooden carving of Madonna and child enthroned.

2
00:00:10,507 --> 00:00:13,845
It's actually very well preserved. It's really only missing, as far as I can see,

3
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:18,171
the crowns that they would've originally worn. Christ's right hand is up, his two forefingers

4
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:25,679
are up in a blessing and he's holding a bible for our regard. With romanesque scultpure of this sort there's the notion

5
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,962
that it's not Mary that's enthroned so much as Christ is enthroned by Mary.

6
00:00:31,962 --> 00:00:37,384
They're both very frontal but Mary does become a throne for Christ

7
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:41,503
who doesn't look at all like a little baby but rather like a small man.

8
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:44,051
Yeah, there's a very specific reason for that. Of course the artist had seen

9
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:47,922
many babies and knew that Christ would not have looked like this at this age

10
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:53,632
but this is a simbolic form and the idea was how does one marry the relathionship

11
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:57,810
between an all knowing God and a young child.

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,610
How do you represent a baby with the wisdom of God himself.

13
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,916
This is remarkably beautiful sculpture. I'm struck not only by the color,

14
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:14,328
by the painting, and the decorative forms on, for example, her mantle and the clothing that Christ wears

15
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:19,493
but just the delacacy of the carving, that shawl that goes over his left shoulder

16
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:26,403
and the ripples that come down at the edges of it and ride up back over his left knee.

17
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:33,681
This period of romanesque in Spain in the late eleventh and early twelfth century of building, of painting

18
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:41,894
the walls of these new churches of this period, of decorating them with forms for veneration worship like we see here--

19
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:46,181
So this would've been one object within a much more elaborate, decorative pro--

20
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:47,358
Perhaps.

21
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:51,858
I think one of the characteristics that's important for me is when I look at the Romanesque

22
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:54,232
is a kind of elegance but also this kind of massiveness.

23
00:01:54,232 --> 00:02:01,075
She has this really elongated face, obviously, that's much too large for her body but that really focuses our

24
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:08,375
attention on Mary and her importance. And I'm also struck by her coloring, of the painting, of the wood,

25
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:14,049
helps make the figure much more real and how important that must've been if you're in church and you're

26
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:20,049
praying. You're surrounded by these murals, these wall paintings, and you come up perhaps to an alter

27
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:26,761
and this is, you know, one figure perhaps among many on the alter and how real she would've seemed.

28
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:31,329
You mentioning not only the fine carving but also the painting, there's a lot of the decorative painting

29
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,492
that's still in place. And you can see that the painting is still in place and you can see that

30
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:36,576
the painting has been built up with a little bit of stucco in certain places

31
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:38,121
Like around her collar here.

32
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:43,302
That's absolutely right. So there's this beautiful decorative detail that you were speaking of but there's also, I think,

33
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:49,396
this kind of a sense of the maternalist. She's very human. There's a great sense of empathy that

34
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:54,134
I feel when I look at her and of course there's always this sense of the tragic when we look at the virgin

35
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:57,341
and child because of her knowlege of Christ's eventual fate.

36
00:02:57,341 --> 00:03:02,525
I think that the artist manages to convey some of the human relationship between these figures,

37
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:07,541
even within this formula of representating the Madonna enthroned with Christ.
