1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380
   

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,460
In this video I want to talk
about what is easily one of the

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,990
most fundamental and profound
concepts in statistics and

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,560
maybe in all of mathematics.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,240
And that's the central
limit theorem.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,940
   

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,760
And what it tells us is we
could start off with any

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,100
distribution that has a
well-defined mean and variance.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,080
And if it has a well-defined
variance, it has a well-defined

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,850
standard deviation.

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,720
And it can be a continuous
distribution or a discrete one.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,100
I'll draw a discrete one
just because it's easier to

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,920
imagine at least for the
purposes of this video.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,170
So let's say I have a
discreet probability

15
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,210
distribution function.

16
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,630
And I want to be very careful
not to make it look anything

17
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,640
close to a normal distribution
because I want to show you the

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,220
power of the central
limit theorem.

19
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,440
So let's say I have
a distribution.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,290
Let's say it could take
on values 1 through

21
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,920
6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,520
It's some kind of crazy dice.

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,220
It's very likely to get a 1,
let's say it's impossible-- let

24
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,560
me make that a straight line--
you've a very high likelihood

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,620
of getting a 1, let's say it's
impossible to get a 2, let's

26
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,350
say it's an OK likelihood
of getting a 3 or a 4.

27
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,560
Let's say it's
impossible get a 5.

28
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,850
And let's say it's very
likely to get a 6 like that.

29
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,330
So that's my probability
distribution function.

30
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,830
If I were to draw a mean, this
is symmetric, so maybe the mean

31
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,580
would be something like that.

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,280
The mean would be halfway.

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,690
So that would be my
mean right there.

34
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,020
The standard deviation maybe
it would look-- it'd be

35
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,720
that far and that far
above and below the mean.

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,080
But that's my
discreet probability

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,300
distribution function.

38
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,130
Now what I'm going to do here,
instead of just taking samples

39
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,640
of this random variable that's
described by this probability

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,690
distribution function, I'm
going to take samples of it.

41
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,670
But I'm going to average the
samples and then look at those

42
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,620
samples and see the frequency
of the averages that I get.

43
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,170
And when I say average
I mean the mean.

44
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,650
So let's say-- and let me
define something-- let's say my

45
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,620
sample size, and I could put
any number here, but let's say

46
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:57,570
first off we try a sample
size of n is equal to 4.

47
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,440
And what that means is
I'm going to take 4

48
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,230
samples from this.

49
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,990
So let's say the first
time I take 4 samples.

50
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,100
So my sample sizes is 4.

51
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,880
Let's say I get a 1, let's say
I get another 1, let's say

52
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,830
I get a 3, and I get a 6.

53
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,780
So that right there is my first
sample of sample size 4.

54
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,980
I know the terminology can get
confusing because this is a

55
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,870
sample that's made
up of 4 samples.

56
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,490
But when we talk about the
sample mean and the sampling

57
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,770
distribution of the sample mean
which we're going to talk more

58
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,630
and more about over the next
few videos, normally the sample

59
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,850
refers to the set of samples
from your distribution.

60
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,210
And the sample size tells you
how many you actually took

61
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,100
from your distribution.

62
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,030
But the terminology can be very
confusing because you can

63
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,330
easily view one of
these as a sample.

64
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,990
But we're taking 4
samples from here.

65
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,690
We have a sample size of 4.

66
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,920
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to average them.

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,880
So let's say the mean-- I'm
going to be very careful when I

68
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,100
say average-- the mean of this
first sample of size 4 is what?

69
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,090
1 plus 1 is 2.

70
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,060
2 plus 3 is 5.

71
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,590
5 plus 6 is 11.

72
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:06,040
11 divided by 4 is 2.75.

73
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,270
That is my first sample mean
for my first sample of size 4.

74
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,260
Let me do another one.

75
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,450
My second sample of size 4.

76
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,650
Let's say that I get a 3, a 4,
let's say I get another 3,

77
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,790
and let's say I get a 1.

78
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,370
I just didn't happen
to get a 6 that time.

79
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,400
And notice I can't
get a 2 or a 5.

80
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,120
That's impossible for
this distribution.

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,770
The chance of getting
a 2 or a 5 is zero.

82
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,950
So I can't have any
2's or 5's over here.

83
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:37,610
So for this second sample of
sample size 4, my sample mean--

84
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,580
so my second sample mean is
going to be 3 plus 4 is 7.

85
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,050
7 plus 3 is 10 plus 1 is 11.

86
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,030
11 divided by 4 once
again is 2.75.

87
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,930
Let me do one more because I
really want to make it clear

88
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,220
what we're doing here.

89
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,030
So I do one more-- actually
we're going to do a gazillion

90
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,030
more, but let me just
do one more in detail.

91
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,493
So let's say my third sample of
sample size 4 I get-- some I'm

92
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:03,480
going to literally
takes 4 samples.

93
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,450
So my sample is made up of 4
samples from this original

94
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,120
crazy distribution.

95
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,070
Let's say I get a 1,
a 1, a 6 and a 6.

96
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,620
And so my third sample mean is
going to be 1 plus 1 is 2.

97
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,440
2 plus 6 is 8.

98
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,110
8 plus 6 is 14.

99
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,990
14 divided by 4 is 3.5.

100
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,780
   

101
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,210
And as I find each of these
sample means-- so for each of

102
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,400
my samples of sample size 4 I
figure out a mean-- and as I do

103
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,300
each of them I'm going to plot
it on a frequency distribution.

104
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,990
And this is all going to
amaze you in a few seconds.

105
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,390
So I plot this all on a
frequency distribution.

106
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,350
So I say, OK, on my
first sample my first

107
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,190
sample mean was 2.75.

108
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,880
So I'm plotting the actual
frequency of the sample means

109
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,800
I get for each sample.

110
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,510
So 2.75, I got it one time.

111
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,720
So I'll put a
little plot there.

112
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,940
So that's from that
one right there.

113
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,790
And the next time I
also got a 2.75.

114
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,060
That's a 2.75 there.

115
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,050
So I got it twice.

116
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,090
So I'll plot the
frequency right there.

117
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,130
Then I got a 3.5.

118
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,080
So all the possible values, I
could have a 3, I could have

119
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,910
a 3.25, I could have a 3.5.

120
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,720
So then I had the 3.5 so
I'll plot it right there.

121
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,420
And what I'm going to do
is I'm going to keep

122
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,510
taking these samples.

123
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,000
Maybe I'll take 10,000 of them.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,880
So I'm going to keep
taking these samples.

125
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,770
So I go all the
way to s 10,000.

126
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,170
I just do a bunch of these.

127
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,840
And what it's going to look
like over time is each of these

128
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,200
I'm going to make a dot because
I'm going to have to zoom out.

129
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,430
So if I look at it like this,
over time, it still has all

130
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,180
the values that it might
be able to take on.

131
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,950
You know, 2.75 might be here.

132
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,605
So this first dot is going to
be this one right here is going

133
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:51,690
to be right there and that
second one is going to be right

134
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,530
there and then that one at 3.5
is going to look right there.

135
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,830
But I'm going to do it
10,000 times so I'm

136
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,990
going to have 10,000.

137
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,170
And let's say as I do
it, I'm going to just

138
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,500
keep plotting them.

139
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,470
I'm just going to keep
plotting the frequencies.

140
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,510
I'm just going to keep
plotting them over and

141
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,820
over and over again.

142
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,480
And what you're going to see
is as I take many, many

143
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,760
samples of size 4.

144
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,630
I'm going to have something
that's going to start

145
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,060
kind of approximating
a normal distribution.

146
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,500
So each of these dots represent
an incidence of a sample mean.

147
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,830
So as I keep adding on this
column right here that means

148
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,560
I kept getting the
sample mean 2.75.

149
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,420
So over time I'm going to have
something that's starting to

150
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,740
approximate a normal
distribution.

151
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,120
And that is a neat thing about
the central limit theorem.

152
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,380
So the central limit-- and this
was the case for-- so in

153
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,190
orange, that's the case
for n is equal to 4.

154
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,350
This was for sample size of 4.

155
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,590
Now if I did the same thing
with a sample size of maybe 20.

156
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,210
So in this case instead of just
taking 4 samples from my

157
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,840
original crazy distribution
every sample I take 20

158
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,440
instances of my random variable
and I average those 20 and then

159
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,950
I plot the sample mean on here.

160
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,770
So in that case, I'm going
to have a distribution

161
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,600
that looks like this.

162
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,580
And we'll discuss
this in more videos.

163
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,600
But it turns out if I were to
plot 10,000 of the sample means

164
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,380
here, I'm going to have
something that-- two things:

165
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,960
it's going to even more closely
approximate a normal

166
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,750
distribution.

167
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,350
And we're going to see in
future videos it's actually

168
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,210
going to have a smaller-- well,
let me be clear-- it's going

169
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,780
to have the same mean.

170
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,570
So that's the mean.

171
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,660
This is going to
have the same mean.

172
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,730
It's going to have a smaller
standard deviation.

173
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,790
So I should plot these
from the bottom because

174
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,500
you kind of stack it.

175
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,780
One you get 1 and then another
instance then another instance.

176
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,990
But this is going to more
and more approach a

177
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,320
normal distribution.

178
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,250
So the reality is-- and this is
what's super cool about the

179
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:53,040
central limit theorem-- as your
sample size becomes larger,

180
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,250
or you can even say as it
approaches infinity, but you

181
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,560
really don't have to get that
close to infinity to really get

182
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,740
close to a normal distribution.

183
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,820
Even if you have a sample size
of 10 or 20, you're already

184
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,320
getting very close to a
normal distribution.

185
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,500
In fact, about as good an
approximation as we see

186
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,375
in our everyday life.

187
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,970
But what's cool is we can
start with some crazy

188
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,290
distribution, right?

189
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,860
This has nothing to do with
a normal distribution.

190
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,160
But if we have a sample size--
this was n equals 4-- but if we

191
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,980
have a sample size of n equals
10 or n equals 100, and we were

192
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,360
to take 100 of these instead of
4 here and average them and

193
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,050
then plot that average,
the frequency of it.

194
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,270
Then we take 100 again,
average them, take the

195
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,500
mean, plot that again.

196
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,700
And if we were to do that a
bunch of times, in fact, if we

197
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,940
were to do that an infinite
time, we would find--

198
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,300
especially if we had an
infinite sample size-- we

199
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,730
would find a perfect
normal distribution.

200
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,300
That's the crazy thing.

201
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,370
And it doesn't apply just
to taking the sample mean.

202
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,755
Here we took the sample mean
every time but you could have

203
00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:46,530
also taken the sample sum.

204
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,740
The central limit theorem
would have still applied.

205
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,070
But that's what's so
super useful about it.

206
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,250
Because in life there's all
sorts of processes out there,

207
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,370
proteins bumping into each
other, people doing crazy

208
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,860
things, humans interacting
in weird ways.

209
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,720
And you don't know the
probability distribution

210
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,360
functions for any
of those things.

211
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,010
But what the central limit
theorem them tells us is if we

212
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,880
add a bunch of those actions
together, assuming that they

213
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,550
all have the same distribution,
or if we were to take the mean

214
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,010
of all of those actions
together and if we were to plot

215
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,160
the frequency of those means,
we do get a normal

216
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,740
distribution.

217
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,350
And that's frankly why the
normal distribution shows up so

218
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,720
much in statistics and why
frankly it's a very good

219
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,980
approximation for the sum or
the means of a lot

220
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,370
of processes.

221
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,430
Normal distribution.

222
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,253
What I'm going to show you in
the next video is I'm actually

223
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:37,640
going to show you that
this is a reality.

224
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,520
That as you increase your
sample size, as you increase

225
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,410
your n, and as you take a lot
of sample means, you're going

226
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,470
to have a frequency plot that
looks very, very close to

227
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,190
a normal distribution.

228
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:48,322
