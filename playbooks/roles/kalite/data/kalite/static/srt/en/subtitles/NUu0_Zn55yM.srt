2
00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:09,333
&gt;&gt;: We're looking at a work by
Robert Smithson, and it dates to

3
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:12,600
1970, and it's called
"The Spiral Jetty."

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,167
This is a photograph showing it.

5
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:16,733
It must have been taken from a
helicopter, and it's what you

6
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:21,500
call a work of environmental
art or land art.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,600
It's essentially a bunch of dirt
and rubble that has been pushed

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,733
out into the spiral form into a
lake, into this salt lake in

9
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,000
Utah.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,533
&gt;&gt;: It exists in this one place
and this one time.

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,067
Could we say it is site
specific?

12
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:36,967
&gt;&gt;: Right, exactly.

13
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:38,200
We call it site specific.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,467
One of the things that Smithson
wanted to emphasize was a kind

15
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:45,733
of a distinction between, you
know, the site of the work of

16
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:49,833
art, and the traditional site of
the work, which would be a

17
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:53,033
gallery or a museum or private
home and kind of breaking down

18
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:58,433
barriers, saying, is a work of
art only to be contained by

19
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,600
museum or can we also
find it elsewhere?

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,000
And so he is part of a larger
movement of artists who are

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,167
specifically locating or
situating their work in the

22
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:12,633
land, and oftentimes the works
have these very, very large

23
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:13,833
proportions.

24
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:17,833
Like this juts out 1500
feet into the water.

25
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,100
&gt;&gt;: And can you walk through it?

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,833
&gt;&gt;: You can usually walk on it.

27
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:21,967
Well, not necessarily.

28
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:25,300
It depends on the height
of the water itself.

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,600
So sometimes it is submerged.

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,200
So this photograph shows that
there are some people out on the

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,900
jetty.

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,767
&gt;&gt;: Yeah, I see.

33
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,867
&gt;&gt;: But it has been slightly
covered by water.

34
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,500
Sometimes it's lower or higher.

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,133
It depends on the depth of the
water in Utah at the time, and

36
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,167
it's very a salty lake.

37
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:43,200
So it's a work that really is
certainly part of the

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,067
environment, but also interacts
and changes the environment in

39
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,800
important ways.

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,300
So you could also maybe
categorize it under the category

41
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,967
of process art because it is
something that is forever

42
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:55,567
changing.

43
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:58,700
You know, he had one idea of it,
but then there are things that

44
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,667
act upon it and will change it
for, you know, for as long as it

45
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:02,367
is there.

46
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,867
&gt;&gt;: It is made of things that
are so durable, though.

47
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:08,333
One gets a sense of
existing beyond human life.

48
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,233
&gt;&gt;: Right.

49
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:11,233
And it has such a
basic shape as well.

50
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:16,233
He is interested in some ancient
examples of prehistoric land

51
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:21,067
art, mounds that have been found
in America and elsewhere, and it

52
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:24,000
is sort of inspired by that
somewhat abstract quality of a

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,167
lot of those.

54
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,667
The idea that your vision of it
right now as you see it as a

55
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:28,333
totality.

56
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,600
When you are in it of course,
you are only experiencing it,

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,433
and it is a very, very
different way

58
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,667
of seeing partial
aspects of it.

59
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:37,500
&gt;&gt;: What interests me is
that you can go into it

60
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,300
and walk through it.

61
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,467
&gt;&gt;: Right, usually you are not
supposed to touch the art.

62
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:42,967
&gt;&gt;: No, right.

63
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:45,800
I like that idea of touching it
and being inside it.

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,267
&gt;&gt;: He liked it, too.

65
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,400
Yeah, and --

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
&gt;&gt;: -- it is fun.

67
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,967
It makes it fun.

68
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:53,367
&gt;&gt;: Yeah, and he had to use a
lot of construction tools,

69
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:59,567
massive trucks to drive the
rubble down and also to employ a

70
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:00,500
lot of people.

71
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,367
So it really destabilizes our
idea that the artist is an

72
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:10,300
individual, a single person who
is the mastermind.

73
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,267
Of course he did come up with
the scheme, but he never could

74
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:15,200
have realized this alone.

75
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,833
&gt;&gt;: Right.

76
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,133
&gt;&gt;: And that is such an
important idea now.

77
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:20,700
Things can be made by groups of
people, by factories, people

78
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,400
that the artist can employ.

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,267
&gt;&gt;: Right.

80
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:27,600
And maybe he is going back also
to what he thinks ancient art

81
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,633
was like, that it was not done
by a single genius artist but

82
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:34,367
rather was a communal thing and
then was sort of left open

83
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,033
for everyone to interact with.
