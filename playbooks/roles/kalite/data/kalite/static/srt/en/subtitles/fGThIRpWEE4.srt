1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400
   

2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,590
In this video I'm just going
to multiply a ton of

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,500
polynomials, and hopefully
that'll give you enough

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,630
exposure to feel confident when
you have to multiply any

5
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,450
for yourselves.

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,810
Let's start with a fairly
simple problem.

7
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:18,810
Let's say we just want to
multiply 2x times 4x minus 5.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,440
Well, we just straight
up use the

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,680
distributive property here.

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,390
And really, when we do all
of these polynomial

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,140
multiplications, all we're
doing is the distributive

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,990
property repeatedly.

13
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,710
But let's just do the
distributive property here.

14
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:39,240
This is 2x times 4x, plus
2x times negative 5.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,700
Or we could say negative
5 times 2x.

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,520
So you'd say, minus
5 times 2x.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,480
All I did is distribute
the 2x.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,740
This first term is going to be
equal to-- we can multiply the

19
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,440
coefficients.

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,560
Remember, 2x times 4x is the
same thing as-- you can

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,530
rearrange the order
of multiplication.

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,170
This is the same thing as 2
times 4, times x times x.

23
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,020
Which is the same thing
as 8 times x squared.

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,880
Remember, x to the 1, times x
to the 1, add the exponents.

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,380
I mean, you know x times
x is x squared.

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,070
So this first term is going
to be 8x squared.

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,520
And the second term, negative
5 times 2 is negative 10x.

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,720
Not too bad.

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,620
Let's do a slightly
more involved one.

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:34,140
Let's say we had 9x to the third
power, times 3x squared,

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,570
minus 2x, plus 7.

32
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,720
So once again, we're just going
to do the distributive

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,810
property here.

34
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,260
So we're going to multiply the
9x to the third times each of

35
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,650
these terms.

36
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,100
So 9x to the third
times 3x squared.

37
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,750
I'll write it out this time.

38
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,530
In the next few, we'll
start doing it a

39
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,420
little bit in our heads.

40
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,230
So this is going to be 9x to
the third times 3x squared.

41
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,710
And then we're going to have
plus-- let me write it this

42
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:13,960
way-- minus 2x times 9x to the
third, and then plus 7 times

43
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,400
9x to the third.

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,606
So sometimes I wrote the 9x to
the third first, sometimes we

45
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:18,610
wrote it later because
I wanted this

46
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,400
negative sign here.

47
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,770
But it doesn't make a difference
on the order that

48
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,980
you're multiplying.

49
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,730
So this first term here
is going to be what?

50
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,720
9 times 3 is 27 times x to
the-- we can add the

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,190
exponents, we learned that in
our exponent properties.

52
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:40,670
This is x to the fifth power,
minus 2 times 9 is 18x to

53
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,770
the-- we have x to the
1, x to the third-- x

54
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,970
to the fourth power.

55
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,160
Plus 7 times 9 is 63x
to the third.

56
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,160
So we end up with this nice
little fifth degree

57
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,920
polynomial.

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,640
Now let's do one where we are
multiplying two binomials.

59
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,400
And I'll show you what
I mean in a second.

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,680
This you're going to see
very, very, very

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,510
frequently in algebra.

62
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,215
So let's say you have x minus
3, times x plus 2.

63
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:16,920
And I actually want to show you
that all we're doing here

64
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,990
is the distributive property.

65
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,510
So let me write it like
this: times x plus 2.

66
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,940
So let's just pretend that this
is one big number here.

67
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,510
And it is.

68
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,100
You know, if you had x's, this
would be some number here.

69
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,770
So let's just distribute this
onto each of these variables.

70
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:44,790
So this is going to be x minus
3, times that green x, plus x

71
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,760
minus 3, times that green 2.

72
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,530
All we did is distribute
the x minus 3.

73
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,980
This is just the distributive
property.

74
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,920
Remember, if I had a times
x plus 2, what would

75
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,750
this be equal to?

76
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:19,810
This would be equal to a
times x plus a times 2.

77
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,620
So over here, you can see when x
minus 3 is the same thing as

78
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,220
a, we're just distributing it.

79
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,910
And now we would do the
distributive property again.

80
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,960
In this case, we're distributing
the x now onto

81
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,050
the x minus 3.

82
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,850
We're going to distribute the
2 onto the x minus 3.

83
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,760
You might be used to seeing the
x on the other side, but

84
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,730
either way, we're just
multiplying it.

85
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,840
So this is going to be--
I'll stay color coded.

86
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:56,390
This is going to be x times x,
minus 3 times x, plus x times

87
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,870
2-- I'm going through great
pains to keep it

88
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,030
color coded for you.

89
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,640
I think it's helping--
minus 3 times 2.

90
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,640
All I did is distribute the
x and distribute the 2.

91
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,450
And soon you're going
to get used to this.

92
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,480
We can do it in one step.

93
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,740
You're actually multiplying
every term in this one by

94
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,200
every term in that one, and
we'll figure out faster ways

95
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,940
to do it in the future.

96
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,960
But I really want to show
you the idea here.

97
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,590
So what's this going to equal?

98
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,050
This is going to equal
x squared.

99
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,040
This right here is going
to be minus 3x.

100
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,800
This is going to be plus 2x.

101
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,720
And then this right here
is going to be minus 6.

102
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,950
And so this is going to be x
squared minus 3 of something,

103
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,940
plus 2 of something, that's
minus 1 of that something.

104
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,860
Minus x, minus 6.

105
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,510
We've multiplied those two.

106
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,630
Now before we move on and do
another problem, I want to

107
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,450
show you that you can kind of do
this in your head as well.

108
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,000
You don't have to go through
all of these steps.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,670
I just want to show you really
that this is just the

110
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,270
distributive property.

111
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,980
The fast way of doing it, if
you had x minus 3, times x

112
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,880
plus 2, you literally just want
to multiply every term

113
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,240
here times each of
these terms.

114
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,510
So you'd say, this x
times that x, so

115
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,130
you'd have x squared.

116
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,000
Then you'd have this x times
that 2, so plus 2x.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,250
Then you'd have this minus
3 times that x, minus 3x.

118
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,070
And then you have the minus 3,
or the negative 3, times 2,

119
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,750
which is negative 6.

120
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,930
And so when you simplify, once
again you get x squared

121
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,140
minus x minus 6.

122
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,680
And it takes a little
bit of practice to

123
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
really get used to it.

124
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,910
Now the next thing I want to
do-- and the principal is

125
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,160
really the exact same way-- but
I'm going to multiply a

126
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,290
binomial times a trinomial,
which

127
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,720
many people find daunting.

128
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,840
But we're going to see,
if you just stay calm,

129
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,010
it's not too bad.

130
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:56,000
3x plus 2, times 9x squared,
minus 6x plus 4.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,910
Now you could do it the exact
same way that we did the

132
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,160
previous video.

133
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,720
We could literally take this 3x
plus 2, distribute it onto

134
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,860
each of these three terms,
multiply 3x plus 2 times each

135
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,860
of these terms, and then you're
going to distribute

136
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,920
each of those terms
into 3x plus 2.

137
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,460
It would take a long time and in
reality, you'll never do it

138
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,090
quite that way.

139
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,930
But you will get the same answer
we're going to get.

140
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,130
When you have larger
polynomials, the easiest way I

141
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,450
can think of to multiply,
is kind of how you

142
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,730
multiply long numbers.

143
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,300
So we'll write it like this.

144
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,110
9x squared, minus 6, plus 4.

145
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:37,010
And we're going to multiply
that times 3x plus 2.

146
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,670
And what I imagine is, when you
multiply regular numbers,

147
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,930
you have your ones' place,
your tens' place, your

148
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,760
hundreds' place.

149
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,590
Here, you're going to have your
constants' place, your

150
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,090
first degree place, your second
degree place, your

151
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,650
third degree place,
if there is one.

152
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,300
And actually there will
be in this video.

153
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,910
So you just have to put things
in their proper place.

154
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,270
So let's do that.

155
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,250
So you start here, you multiply
almost exactly like

156
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,480
you would do traditional
multiplication.

157
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,370
2 times 4 is 8.

158
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,440
It goes into the ones', or
the constants' place.

159
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,520
   

160
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:20,640
2 times negative 6x
is negative 12x.

161
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,580
And we'll put a plus there.

162
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,390
That was a plus 8.

163
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:28,060
2 times 9x squared is 18x
squared, so we'll put that in

164
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,360
the x squared place.

165
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,000
Now let's do the 3x part.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,710
I'll do that in magenta, so you
see how it's different.

167
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:43,480
3x times 4 is 12x,
positive 12x.

168
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,940
3x times negative 6x,
what is that?

169
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,190
The x times the x is
x squared, so it's

170
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,780
going to go over here.

171
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,330
And 3 times negative
6 is negative 18.

172
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,330
And then finally 3x times 9x
squared, the x times the x

173
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,150
squared is x to the
third power.

174
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,500
3 times 9 is 27.

175
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,670
I wrote it in the
x third place.

176
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,620
And once again, you just
want to add the like

177
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,230
terms. So you get 8.

178
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,460
There's no other constant
terms, so it's just 8.

179
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,670
Negative 12x plus 12x,
these cancel out.

180
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,650
18x squared minus 18x squared
cancel out, so we're just left

181
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,620
over here with 27x
to the third.

182
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,940
So this is equal to 27x
to the third plus 8.

183
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,110
And we are done.

184
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,840
And you can use this technique
to multiply a trinomial times

185
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,910
a binomial, a trinomial times
a trinomial, or really, you

186
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,290
know, you could have
five terms up here.

187
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,930
A fifth degree times
a fifth degree.

188
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,480
This will always work as long
as you keep things in their

189
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,000
proper degree place.
