1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
   

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,890
Let's see if we can prove to
ourselves some more reasonably

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,415
interesting transpose
properties.

4
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:10,660
So let's define some matrix C,
that's equal to the sum of two

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,280
other matrices, A and B.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,040
And so any entry in C, I can
denote with a lowercase cij.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,830
So if I want the ith row in jth
column it would be cij,

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,880
and so each of its entries are
going to be the sum of the

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,300
corresponding columns that
are matrices A and B.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,140
So our ij entry in C is going to
be equal to the ij entry in

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,450
A, plus the ij entry in B.

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,470
That's our definition
of matrix addition.

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,710
You just get the corresponding
entry in the same row and

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,130
column, add them up, and you get
your entry in the same row

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,400
and column, and your new
matrix is the sum

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,140
of the other two.

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,610
Now, let's think a little bit
about the transposes of these

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,790
guys right here.

19
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,130
So, if A looks like this.

20
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,310
I won't draw all
of the entries.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,540
It takes forever.

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,100
But each of its entries are
ij, just like that.

23
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,210
Let's say that A transpose
looks like this.

24
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,230
Each of its entries, we would
call it, that's if you've got

25
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,790
that same entry, we're going
to call it a-prime ij.

26
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,220
And these things aren't probably
going to be the same.

27
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,350
There's some chance they are,
but they're probably not going

28
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,650
to be the same.

29
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,810
But that its ijth entry.

30
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,930
In the ith row, jth column.

31
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,490
In A transpose.

32
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,900
Now, the fact that this is the
transpose of that means that

33
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,800
everything that's in some row
and column here is going to be

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,160
in that column and row over
here, that the rows and

35
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,580
columns get switched.

36
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:43,330
So we know that we could write
that a-prime ij, we're going

37
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:49,560
to have the same entry
that was in aji.

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,220
Maybe aji is over here.
aji is over here.

39
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,230
So, this thing over here, which
is in the same position

40
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,940
as this one, is going to be
equal to this guy over here if

41
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,820
you switched the rows
and columns.

42
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,060
I think you can accept that.

43
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,630
And you can make the same
argument for B.

44
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,820
Let me actually draw it out.

45
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,070
So if I make B transpose.

46
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,949
   

47
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,960
The entry in the ith row and
jth column, I'll call it

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,380
b-prime ij.

49
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,090
Just like that.

50
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,450
Just like I did for A.

51
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,750
So we could say that b-prime ij
is equal to, you take the

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,300
matrix B, what's going to be
the entry that's in the jth

53
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,920
row and ith column.

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,290
These are, you could
almost say, the

55
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,060
definition of the transpose.

56
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,910
If I'm in the third row and
second column now, it's going

57
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,970
to be what was in the second
row and third column.

58
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,790
Fair enough.

59
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,980
So we already have what
cij is equal to.

60
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,610
What's the transpose of cij
going to be equal to?

61
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,850
Let me write that down.

62
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,370
So C transpose, let me
write it over here.

63
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,620
Write C transpose is equal to.

64
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,780
I'll use the same notation.

65
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,100
The prime means that
we're taking

66
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,380
entries in the transpose.

67
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,970
So C transpose is just going to
be a bunch of entries, ij.

68
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,105
And I'll put a little prime
there showing that that's

69
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:13,440
entries in the matrix
of the transpose,

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,620
and not in C itself.

71
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:23,440
And we know that c-prime
ij is equal to cji.

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,430
Nothing new at all.

73
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,480
We've just expressed kind
of the definition of the

74
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,970
transpose for these
three matrices.

75
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,230
Now what is cji equal to?

76
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,220
So let's focus on this
a little bit.

77
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,100
What is cji equal to?

78
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,480
We know that cij is equal to a
sub ij plus b sub ij, so if

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,320
you swap them around, this is
going to be equal to, you just

80
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,050
swap the j's and the i's.

81
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,990
a sub ji plus b sub ji.

82
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,280
I just used this information
here-- you could almost view

83
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,420
it as this assumption or
this definition-- to go

84
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,370
from this to this.

85
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,480
If I had an x and a y here, I'd
have an x and a y here,

86
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,860
and a x and a y here.

87
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,640
I have a j and an i here, so I
have a j and an i there, and a

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,880
j and an i right there.

89
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,740
Now what are these?

90
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,620
What are these equal to?

91
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,870
This is equal to.

92
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,310
   

93
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,829
This guy right here is equal
to-- we do it in the green--

94
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:26,560
the same entry for the
transpose of a at ij.

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,800
And this is equal to the
same entry for the

96
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,330
transpose of b at ij.

97
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,090
   

98
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,020
Now, what is this telling us?

99
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,030
It's telling us that the
transpose of C, which is the

100
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,660
same thing is A plus B, so it's
saying that A plus B, A

101
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,050
plus B transpose is the same
thing as C transpose.

102
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,320
Let me write that.

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,350
C transpose is the same thing
as A plus B transpose.

104
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,030
So these are the entries in A
plus B transpose right here.

105
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,410
And what is this over here?

106
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,670
What are these?

107
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,740
These are the entries
right there.

108
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,260
We do the equal sign
over here.

109
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,320
What are these?

110
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,370
These are the entries in A
transpose plus B transpose.

111
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,490
Right?

112
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,600
These are the entries
in A transpose.

113
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,620
These are the entries
in B transpose.

114
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,150
If you take the sum of the two,
you're just adding up the

115
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,000
corresponding entries.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,870
So that's straightforward to
show that if you take the sum

117
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,610
of two matrices and then
transpose it, it's equivalent

118
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,540
to transposing them first, and
then taking their sum.

119
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,920
Which is a reasonably
neat outcome.

120
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,510
Let's do one more and I think
we'll finish up all of our

121
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,190
major transpose properties.

122
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,360
Let's say that A inverse-- this
is going to be a slightly

123
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,380
different take on things.

124
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,130
We're still going to
take the transpose.

125
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:51,760
So if we know that A inverse
is the inverse of A, that

126
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,410
means that A times A inverse
is equal to the identity

127
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,360
matrix, assuming that these
are n-by-n matrices.

128
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,430
So it's the n-dimensional
identity matrix.

129
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,730
And that A inverse times A is
also going to be equal to the

130
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,250
identity matrix.

131
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,790
Now, let's take the
transpose of both

132
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,990
sides of this equation.

133
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,910
I'll do them both
simultaneously.

134
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,540
So if you take the transpose of
both sides of the equation,

135
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,880
you get A times A inverse
transpose is equal to the

136
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,950
identity matrix transpose.

137
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,560
And what's the transpose
of the identity matrix?

138
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,180
Let's draw it out.

139
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,490
The identity matrix
looks like this.

140
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,800
You have just ones all the
way down the diagonal and

141
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,050
everything else is 0.

142
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,870
   

143
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,480
Right, and you could view this
as i 1, 1 i 2, 2 all the way

144
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,710
down to i n, n.

145
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,285
Everything else is 0.

146
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:50,040
So when you take the transpose,
you're just

147
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,430
swapping out the
zeroes, right?

148
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,800
These guys don't change.

149
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,090
The diagonal does not change
when you take the transpose.

150
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,570
So the transpose of the identity
matrix is equal to

151
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,820
the identity matrix.

152
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,890
   

153
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,490
And so we can apply that
same thing here.

154
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,750
Let's take the transpose
for this statement.

155
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,870
So we know that A inverse times
A transpose is equal to

156
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,090
the identity matrix transpose,
which is equal to

157
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,960
the identity matrix.

158
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,610
And then we know what happens
when you take the

159
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,960
transpose of a product.

160
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,190
It's equal to the
product of the

161
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,720
transposes in reverse order.

162
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,050
So this thing right here we
can rewrite as A inverse

163
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,450
transpose times A transpose,
which is going to be equal to

164
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,540
the identity matrix.

165
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,550
You could do the same
thing over here.

166
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,930
This thing is going to be equal
to A transpose times A

167
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,310
inverse transpose, which is also
going to be equal to the

168
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,880
identity matrix.

169
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,830
Now, this is an interesting
statement.

170
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:55,340
The fact that, if I have this
guy right here, times the

171
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,510
transpose of A is equal to the
identity matrix, and the

172
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,885
transpose of A times that same
guy is equal to identity

173
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:11,650
matrix, implies that A inverse
transpose is the

174
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,150
inverse of A transpose.

175
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,800
Or another way of writing that
is if I take A transpose, and

176
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,510
if I take its inverse, that is
going to be equal to this guy.

177
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,925
It's going to be equal to
A inverse transpose.

178
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,840
So, another neat outcome dealing
with transposes.

179
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,760
If you take the inverse of the
transpose, it's the same thing

180
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,159
as the transpose
of the inverse.

181
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,133
