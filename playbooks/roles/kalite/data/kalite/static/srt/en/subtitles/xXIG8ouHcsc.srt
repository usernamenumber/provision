1
00:00:00,513 --> 00:00:04,507
Let's divide 7182 by 42.

2
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:08,175
Now what's different here is we're now dividing by two-digit number, not a one-digit number.

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,940
But the same idea holds.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,494
So we say: "Hey, how many times does 42 go into 7?"

5
00:00:12,494 --> 00:00:16,070
Well, it doesn't really go into 7 at all so let's add one more place value.

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,414
How many times does 42 go into 71?

7
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:22,804
Well it goes into 71 one time and we're really... Just the reminder of what happens during the process:

8
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:31,349
You're saying: "Hey 42 goes into 71 one time.", but we're really saying: "42 goes into 7100 one hundred times",

9
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,067
because we're putting this one in the hundreds place.

10
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:36,411
But let's put that on the side for a little bit and focus on the process.

11
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:41,751
So 1 times 42 is 42 and now we subtract:

12
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:49,275
Now, you might be able to do 71 minus 42 in your head knowing: "Hey, 72 minus 42 would be 30 so 71 minus 42 would be 29."

13
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:51,504
But we could also do it by regrouping.

14
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:56,473
To regroup you want to subtract the 2 from a 1, well that's not so you can really do that

15
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:01,999
(in the traditional way) so let's take a 10 from the 70 (so that becomes a 60)

16
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:05,761
and give that 10 to the ones place and then that becomes an 11.

17
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:10,767
And so 11 minus 2 is 9 and 6 minus 4 is 2.

18
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:12,170
So you get 29.

19
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,674
And we can bring down the next place value. Bring down an 8.

20
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:21,272
And now this is really art happens when we're dividing by multi-digit number right over here.

21
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:24,433
We have to estimate how many times does 42 go into 298.

22
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:27,500
And sometimes it might envolve a little bit of trial-and-errors.

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,745
You really just kind of have to eyeball it, if you made a mistake, try again.

24
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:34,767
The way you know you make a mistake is as if you say... it goes into 9 times,

25
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:38,687
you do 9 times 42 and you're in the number larger than 298, then you overestimated.

26
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:42,767
If you say it goes into it 3 times, you do 3 times 42, you get some number here,

27
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:46,674
when you subtract you get something larger than 42, then you also made a mistake

28
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,433
and you have to adjust upwards.

29
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:49,600
But let's see if I can eyeball it.

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,767
So this is roughly 40, this is roughly 300.

31
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:58,767
40 goes into 300 the same times as 4 goes into 30 soit's going to be roughly 7.

32
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:01,767
Let's see if that's right.

33
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:09,433
7 times 2 is 14, 7 times 4 is 28, plus 1 is 29.

34
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:11,900
So we've got pretty close.

35
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:21,272
My remainder here: Notice 294 is less than 298 so I'm cool there and my remainder is less than 42 so I'm cool as well.

36
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:24,337
So now let's add another place value.

37
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:28,006
Let's bring this 2 down.

38
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:31,350
And here we're just asking ourselves: "How many times does 42 go into 42?"

39
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, 42 goes into 42 exactly one time.

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,430
1 times 42 is 42 and we have no remainder.

41
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,077
So this one luckily divided exactly.

42
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:46,077
42 goes into 7182 exactly 171 times.
