00:00:01,023 --> 00:00:04,028
Welcome to the presentation on level four linear equations.

2
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:06,053
So, let's start doing some problems.

3
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:06,070
So.

4
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:09,058
Let's say I had the situation-- let me give me a couple of

5
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:20,010
problems-- if I said three over x is equal to, let's just say five.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,017
So, what we want to do -- this problem's a little unusual from

7
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:24,025
everything we've ever seen.

8
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,094
Because here, instead of having x in the numerator, we actually

9
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:28,012
have x in the denominator.

10
00:00:28,014 --> 00:00:31,026
So, I personally don't like having x's in my denominators,

11
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:34,017
so we want to get it outside of the denominator into a

12
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:36,013
numerator or at least not in the denominator as

13
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:36,092
soon as possible.

14
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:40,077
So, one way to get a number out of the denominator is, if we

15
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:45,056
were to multiply both sides of this equation by x, you see

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,045
that on the left-hand side of the equation these two

17
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,089
x's will cancel out.

18
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:52,014
And in the right side, you'll just get five times x.

19
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:56,090
So this equals -- the two x's cancel out.

20
00:00:56,092 --> 00:01:00,088
And you get three is equal to fivex.

21
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:05,042
Now, we could also write that as fivex is equal to three.

22
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:07,081
And then we can think about this two ways.

23
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:12,020
We either just multiply both sides by one / five, or you could just

24
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,021
do that as dividing by five.

25
00:01:14,023 --> 00:01:16,048
If you multiply both sides by one / five.

26
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:18,067
The left-hand side becomes x.

27
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:23,073
And the right-hand side, three times one / five, is equal to three / five.

28
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:24,062
So what did we do here?

29
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:26,084
This is just like, this actually turned into a level

30
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:28,065
two problem, or actually a level one problem,

31
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:29,048
very quickly.

32
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,098
All we had to do is multiply both sides of this

33
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:33,025
equation by x.

34
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,045
And we got the x's out of the denominator.

35
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:36,034
Let's do another problem.

36
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:53,051
Let's have -- let me say, x plus two over x plus one is

37
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:58,079
equal to, let's say, seven.

38
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,078
So, here, instead of having just an x in the denominator,

39
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,090
we have a whole x plus one in the denominator.

40
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:04,098
But we're going to do it the same way.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,015
To get that x plus one out of the denominator, we multiply both

42
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:15,043
sides of this equation times x plus one over one times this side.

43
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:17,000
Since we did it on the left-hand side we also have

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,062
to do it on the right-hand side, and this is just seven / one,

45
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:24,040
times x plus one over one.

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,071
On the left-hand side, the x plus one's cancel out.

47
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:31,009
And you're just left with x plus two.

48
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:33,028
It's over one, but we can just ignore the one.

49
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,025
And that equals seven times x plus one.

50
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,091
And that's the same thing as x plus two.

51
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:45,071
And, remember, it's seven times the whole thing, x plus one.

52
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:47,077
So we actually have to use the distributive property.

53
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:54,038
And that equals sevenx plus seven.

54
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,018
So now it's turned into a, I think this is a level

55
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:58,078
three linear equation.

56
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:02,003
And now all we do is, we say well let's get all the x's on

57
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:02,096
one side of the equation.

58
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:05,056
And let's get all the constant terms, like the two and the seven, on

59
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:07,009
the other side of the equation.

60
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:08,087
So I'm going to choose to get the x's on the left.

61
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,097
So let's bring that sevenx onto the left.

62
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:14,043
And we can do that by subtracting sevenx from both sides.

63
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:19,043
Minus sevenx, plus, it's a minus sevenx.

64
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:22,078
The right-hand side, these two sevenx's will cancel out.

65
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,040
And on the left-hand side we have minus sevenx plus x.

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,083
Well, that's minus six plus two is equal to, and on the

67
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:35,008
right all we have left is seven.

68
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:36,046
Now we just have to get rid of this two.

69
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:41,034
And we can just do that by subtracting two from both sides.

70
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:47,099
And we're left with minus six x is equal to six.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,021
Now it's a level one problem.

72
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,038
We just have to multiply both sides times the reciprocal

73
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,018
of the coefficient on the left-hand side.

74
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,013
And the coefficient's negative six.

75
00:03:56,015 --> 00:03:59,061
So we multiply both sides of the equation by negative one / six.

76
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:05,059
Negative one / six.

77
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:08,087
The left-hand side, negative one over six times negative six.

78
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:10,018
Well that just equals one.

79
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:16,011
So we just get x is equal to five times negative one / six.

80
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:19,024
Well, that's negative five / six.

81
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:23,018
And we're done.

82
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,069
And if you wanted to check it, you could just take that x

83
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,093
equals negative five / six and put it back in the original question

84
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:30,056
to confirm that it worked.

85
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:31,031
Let's do another one.

86
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:37,093
I'm making these up on the fly, so I apologize.

87
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:40,000
Let me think.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:51,000
three times x plus five is equal to eight times x plus two.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,073
Well, we do the same thing here.

90
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:55,093
Although now we have two expressions we want to get

91
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:56,067
out of the denominators.

92
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:58,086
We want to get x plus five out and we want to get

93
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:00,000
this x plus two out.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,066
So let's do the x plus five first.

95
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,062
Well, just like we did before, we multiply both sides of

96
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:05,056
this equation by x plus five.

97
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:07,062
You can say x plus five over one.

98
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:12,067
Times x plus five over one.

99
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:15,006
On the left-hand side, they get canceled out.

100
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:24,022
So we're left with three is equal to eight times x plus five.

101
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:28,075
All of that over x plus two.

102
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:31,081
Now, on the top, just to simplify, we once again

103
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,041
just multiply the eight times the whole expression.

104
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:41,085
So it's eightx plus forty over x plus two.

105
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:43,049
Now, we want to get rid of this x plus two.

106
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,050
So we can do it the same way.

107
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,049
We can multiply both sides of this equation by

108
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,088
x plus two over one.

109
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,056
x plus two.

110
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:53,068
We could just say we're multiplying both

111
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:54,041
sides by x plus two.

112
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:56,062
The one is little unnecessary.

113
00:05:56,062 --> 00:06:02,089
So the left-hand side becomes threex plus six.

114
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,006
Remember, always distribute three times, because you're

115
00:06:05,006 --> 00:06:07,000
multiplying it times the whole expression.

116
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:08,052
x plus two.

117
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:09,085
And on the right-hand side.

118
00:06:09,086 --> 00:06:13,061
Well, this x plus two and this x plus two will cancel out.

119
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:16,037
And we're left with eightx plus forty.

120
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:19,031
And this is now a level three problem.

121
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:25,037
Well, if we subtract eightx from both sides, minus eightx, plus-- I

122
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:26,095
think I'm running out of space.

123
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:28,047
Minus eightx.

124
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:31,027
Well, on the right-hand side the eightx's cancel out.

125
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:38,061
On the left-hand side we have minus fivex plus six is equal

126
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:42,031
to, on the right-hand side all we have left is forty.

127
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:45,037
Now we can subtract six from both sides of this equation.

128
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,037
Let me just write out here.

129
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:49,049
Minus six plus minus six.

130
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,045
Now I'm going to, hope I don't lose you guys by

131
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:53,014
trying to go up here.

132
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:58,039
But if we subtract minus six from both sides, on the left-hand

133
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:05,026
side we're just left with minus fivex equals, and on the

134
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:08,076
right-hand side we have thirty-four.

135
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:09,087
Now it's a level one problem.

136
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:12,075
We just multiply both sides times negative one / five.

137
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,035
Negative one / five.

138
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:21,012
On the left-hand side we have x.

139
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:27,012
And on the right-hand side we have negative thirty-four / five.

140
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:29,062
Unless I made some careless mistakes, I think that's right.

141
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:33,018
And I think if you understood what we just did here, you're

142
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:36,075
ready to tackle some level four linear equations.

143
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:38,027
Have fun.
