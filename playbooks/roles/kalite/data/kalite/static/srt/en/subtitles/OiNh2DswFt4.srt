1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,980
I'll now introduce you
to the concept

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,460
of the Laplace Transform.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,930
And this is truly one of the
most useful concepts that

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,840
you'll learn, not just in
differential equations, but

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,100
really in mathematics.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,050
And especially if you're going
to go into engineering, you'll

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,610
find that the Laplace Transform,
besides helping you

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,480
solve differential equations,
also helps you transform

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,210
functions or waveforms from
the time domain to the

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,170
frequency domain, and study
and understand a

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,740
whole set of phenomena.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,480
But I won't get into
all of that yet.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,920
Now I'll just teach
you what it is.

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,170
Laplace Transform.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,100
I'll teach you what it is, make
you comfortable with the

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,330
mathematics of it and then in
a couple of videos from now,

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,220
I'll actually show you how it
is useful to use it to solve

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,180
differential equations.

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,200
We'll actually solve some of the
differential equations we

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,800
did before, using the
previous methods.

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,470
But we'll keep doing it, and
we'll solve more and more

22
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,000
difficult problems.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,890
So what is the Laplace
Transform?

24
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,575
Well, the Laplace Transform,
the notation is the L like

25
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:12,056
Laverne from Laverne
and Shirley.

26
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:15,040
That might be before many
of your times, but

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,860
I grew up on that.

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,690
Actually, I think it was even
reruns when I was a kid.

29
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,770
So Laplace Transform
of some function.

30
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,170
And here, the convention,
instead of saying f of x,

31
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,590
people say f of t.

32
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,120
And the reason is because in
a lot of the differential

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,190
equations or a lot of
engineering you actually are

34
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,360
converting from a function
of time to

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,630
a function of frequency.

36
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,300
And don't worry about
that right now.

37
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,180
If it confuses you.

38
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,020
But the Laplace Transform
of a function of t.

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,820
It transforms that function into
some other function of s.

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,410
and And does it do that?

41
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,150
Well actually, let me just do
some mathematical notation

42
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,460
that probably won't
mean much to you.

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,800
So what does it transform?

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,630
Well, the way I think of
it is it's kind of

45
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,870
a function of functions.

46
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,220
A function will take you from
one set of-- well, in what

47
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,009
we've been dealing with-- one
set of numbers to another set

48
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,060
of numbers.

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,990
A transform will take you from
one set of functions to

50
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,100
another set of functions.

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,140
So let me just define this.

52
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:23,310
The Laplace Transform for our
purposes is defined as the

53
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,510
improper integral.

54
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,790
I know I haven't actually done
improper integrals just yet,

55
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,890
but I'll explain them
in a few seconds.

56
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:36,430
The improper integral from 0 to
infinity of e to the minus

57
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:43,605
st times f of t-- so whatever's
between the Laplace

58
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:49,170
Transform brackets-- dt.

59
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,190
Now that might seem very
daunting to you and very

60
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,120
confusing, but I'll now do
a couple of examples.

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,660
So what is the Laplace
Transform?

62
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,950
Well let's say that f
of t is equal to 1.

63
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,300
So what is the Laplace
Transform of 1?

64
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,660
So if f of t is equal to 1--
it's just a constant function

65
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:14,280
of time-- well actually, let me
just substitute exactly the

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,130
way I wrote it here.

67
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,910
So that's the improper integral
from 0 to infinity of

68
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:24,640
e to the minus st
times 1 here.

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't have to rewrite it here,
but there's a times 1dt.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,270
And I know that infinity is
probably bugging you right

71
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,480
now, but we'll deal
with that shortly.

72
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,620
Actually, let's deal with
that right now.

73
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,660
This is the same thing
as the limit.

74
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:48,870
And let's say as A approaches
infinity of the integral from

75
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:57,400
0 to Ae to the minus st. dt.

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,410
Just so you feel a little bit
more comfortable with it, you

77
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,640
might have guessed that this
is the same thing.

78
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,560
Because obviously you can't
evaluate infinity, but you

79
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,410
could take the limit as
something approaches infinity.

80
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,880
So anyway, let's take the
anti-derivative and evaluate

81
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,730
this improper definite
integral, or

82
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,810
this improper integral.

83
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,300
So what's anti-derivative
of e to the minus st

84
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,339
with respect to dt?

85
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:28,625
Well it's equal to minus 1/s
e to the minus st, right?

86
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,640
If you don't believe me, take
the derivative of this.

87
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,070
You'd take minus s times that.

88
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,500
That would all cancel out, and
you'd just be left with e to

89
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,455
the minus st. Fair enough.

90
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,410
Let me delete this here,
this equal sign.

91
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,890
Because I could actually use
some of that real estate.

92
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,430
We are going to take the limit
as A approaches infinity.

93
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,330
You don't always have to do
this, but this is the first

94
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,650
time we're dealing with
improper intergrals.

95
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,270
So I figured I might as
well remind you that

96
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,340
we're taking a limit.

97
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,030
Now we took the anti-derivative.

98
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,960
Now we have to evaluate it at A
minus the anti-derivative

99
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,050
evaluate it at 0,

100
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,740
and then take the limit of
whatever that ends up being as

101
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,710
A approaches infinity.

102
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:17,490
So this is equal to the limit
as A approaches infinity.

103
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:17,750
OK.

104
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:24,550
If we substitute A in here
first, we get minus 1/s.

105
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,960
Remember we're, dealing
with t.

106
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,220
We took the integral
with respect to t.

107
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,630
e to the minus sA, right?

108
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,650
That's what happens when
I put A in here.

109
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,350
Minus -

110
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,970
Now what happens when I put
t equals 0 in here?

111
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,830
So when t equals 0, it becomes
e to the minus s times 0.

112
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,320
This whole thing becomes 1.

113
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,190
And I'm just left
with minus 1/s.

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,450
Fair enough.

115
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,000
And then let me scroll
down a little bit.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,490
I wrote a little bit bigger
than I wanted

117
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,770
to, but that's OK.

118
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:10,160
So this is going to be the limit
as A approaches infinity

119
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:20,640
of minus 1/s e to the
minus sA minus minus 1/s.

120
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,780
So plus 1/s.

121
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,170
So what's the limit as A
approaches infinity?

122
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,150
Well what's this term
going to do?

123
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:34,350
As A approaches infinity, if
we assume that s is greater

124
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,810
than 0-- and we'll make that
assumption for now.

125
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,000
Actually, let me write
that down explicitly.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,950
Let's assume that s
is greater than 0.

127
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,320
So if we assume that s is
greater than 0, then as A

128
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,870
approaches infinity, what's
going to happen?

129
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,210
Well this term is going to go to
0, right? e to the minus--

130
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,640
a googol is a very,
very small number.

131
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,520
And an e to the minus googolplex
is an even smaller number.

132
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,530
So then this e to the minus
infinity approaches 0, so this

133
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,920
term approaches 0.

134
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,850
This term isn't affected because
it has no A in it, so

135
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,420
we're just left with 1/s.

136
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,400
So there you go.

137
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,120
This is a significant
moment in your life.

138
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,190
You have just been exposed to
your first Laplace Transform.

139
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,350
I'll show you in a few videos,
there are whole tables of

140
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,300
Laplace Transforms, and
eventually we'll

141
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,570
prove all of them.

142
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,440
But for now, we'll just
work through some of

143
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,230
the more basic ones.

144
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,180
But this can be our
first entry in our

145
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,680
Laplace Transform table.

146
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,870
The Laplace Transform of
f of t is equal to

147
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,030
1 is equal to 1/s.

148
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,430
Notice we went from a function
of t-- although obviously this

149
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,460
one wasn't really dependent
on t-- to a function of s.

150
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,520
I have about 3 minutes left,
but I don't think that's

151
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,010
enough time to do another
Laplace Transform.

152
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,040
So I will save that for
the next video.

153
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,660
See you soon.
