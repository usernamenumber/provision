1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I've drawn a crazy looking function here in yellow

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and what I want to think about is

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when this function takes on maximum values

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and minimum values.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And for the sake of this video,

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can assume that the graph of this function

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just keeps getting lower and lower and lower

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as x becomes more and more negative,

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and lower and lower and lower as x goes beyond

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the interval that I've depicted right over here.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what is the maximum value that this function takes on?

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, we can eyeball that. It looks like it's at this point,

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it looks like it's at that point right over there.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we would call this a global maximum.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The function never takes on a value larger than this

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we can say that we have a global maximum at the

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
point x-nought. Because f(x)-nought is greater than

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to f(x) for any other x

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the domain.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's pretty obvious when you look at it like this.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now do we have a global minimum point

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the way that I've drawn it? Well no,

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this function can take on arbitrarily negative values

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it approaches negative infinity as x approaches

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative infinity. It approaches negative infinity as

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x approaches positive infinity.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have, let me write this down, we have

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
no global minimum. Now let me ask you a question.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Do we have local minima, or local maxima?

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When I say minima, it's just the plural of minimum.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And maxima is just the plural of maximum.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So do we have a local minima here, or a local minimum here?

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, a local minimum you can imagine means that

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the value of that funtion is lower than the points around it

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
SO right over here it looks like we have a local minimum.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have a local minimum.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'm not giving you a very rigorous definition here,

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but one way to think about it is, we can say that

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have a local minimum point at x-one, is if we have

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a region around x-one where f(x)-one is less than f(x)

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for any x in this region right over here. And it's pretty

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
easy to eyeball too. This is a low point for any

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
values of f around it.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right over there.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now do we have any other local minima?

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well it doesn't like we do.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now what about local maxima?

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, this one right over here, let me do it in purple.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I don't want to get people confused, actually,

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me do it in this color.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This point right over here looks like a local

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maximum. Not lox, that would have to deal with salmon.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Local maximum, right over there.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we can say at the point x-one, sorry, at the

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
point x-two, we have a local maximum point at x-two,

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because f(x)-two is larger than f(x) for any x around

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a neighborhood around x-two.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I"m not being very rigorous,

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but you can see it just by looking at it.

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's fair enough. We've identified all of the

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maxima and minima, often called the extrema,

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for this function.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now how can we identify those if we knew something

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
about the derivative of the function?

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, let's look at the derivative at each of these points.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So at this first point right over here, if I were to try

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to visualize the tangent line,

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me do that in a better color than brown.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I were to try to visualize the tangent line, it

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
would look something like that. So the slope here is a zero.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we would say that f-prime of x-nought is equal

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to zero.

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The slope of the tangent line at this point is zero.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What about over here? Well, once again, the tangent line

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
would look something like that.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So once again we would say f-prime at x-one is equal

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to zero.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What about over here? Well, here, the tangent line

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is actually not well-defined. We have a positive slope

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going into it and it immediately jumps into being

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a negative slope.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So over here, f-prime of x-two is not defined.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me just write "undefined."

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have an interesting, and once again, I'm not

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
rigorously proving it to you. I just want you to get the

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
intutiion here. We see that if we have some type of extrema,

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're not talking about when x is at an endpoint of

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
an interval, just to be claerwhat I"m talking about.

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when I'm talking about x as an endpoint of an interval.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're saying that, let's say that the function is,

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's say we have an interval from there,

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's say that a function starts right over there and then keeps going.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This would be a maximum point, but it would be an endpoint.

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're not talking about endpoints right now.

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're talking about when we have points in between,

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or when our interval is infinite.

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we're not talking about points like that, or points like

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this.

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're talking about points in between.

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you have a point inside of an interval.

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's going to be a mimum or maximum, and we see the

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
intuition here.

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, non-endpoint min or max at x is equal to a,

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you know if you have a minimum or maximum point,

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at some point x is equal to a, and x is at the endpoint
