00:00:01,867 --> 00:00:06,533
Find the sum 3 1/8 + 3/4 + ( -2 1/6)

2
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:12,067
We have two positive numbers, let me draw a

3
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:19,533
number line , we are going to start with 3 1/8,

4
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:28,600
this is 0, then we have 1, 2, 3 and then we have 4.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,933
3 1/8 is going to be right over there

6
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:42,267
3 1/8, is going to be 3 1/8ths to the right of 0

7
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:49,400
So it is exactly that distance from 0.

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,800
The length of this arrow is 3 1/8th.

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,533
When ever we have fractions with different denominators

10
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,067
i like to deal them with improper fractions, which

11
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:02,867
makes addition , subtraction, multiplication easier

12
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:09,133
So 3 1/8 ths = 25/8

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,133
To that we are going to add 3/4ths,

14
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:30,200
we are going to move another 3/4ths.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:42,400
to the right , this length is 3/4ths

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,867
Where doees this put us, we need to add it.

17
00:01:46,867 --> 00:02:01,467
we have 25/8 + 3/4. The LCM of 4 & 8 is 8

18
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:15,800
So 3/4 = 6/8.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:25,200
So it is 25/8 + 6/8 = 31/8

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:34,600
This number right over here is 31/8

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,800
32/8 =4 so 31/8 is a bit less than 4

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:52,533
The length of this arrow is 31/8

23
00:02:52,533 --> 00:03:06,067
To write it as a mixed number, 31/8 = 3 7/8ths

24
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:13,533
Now to that we need to add - 2 1/6

25
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:20,600
So let us think about what - 2 1/6ths is like

26
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:29,800
So we are going to add -2 & - 1/6ths

27
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:42,733
we can draw -2 1/6ths like this

28
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:56,133
We can think in a couple of ways, when we add

29
00:03:56,133 --> 00:04:04,267
it is same thing as subtracting 2 1/6ths

30
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:30,267
This value is going to be difference between 31/8 and - 2 1/6ths

31
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:34,867
From 31/8, we subtract 2 1/6ths

32
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:43,800
31/8 - 2 1/6ths

33
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:56,733
2 1/6 = 13/6

34
00:04:56,733 --> 00:05:06,200
LCM of 8 & 6 is 24

35
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:46,400
31/8 = 93/24 , and 13/6 = 52/24

36
00:05:56,733 --> 00:06:01,000
So 93/24 - 52/24 = 41/24

37
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:13,133
It is positive 41 /24

38
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:17,133
This is little bit less than 2
