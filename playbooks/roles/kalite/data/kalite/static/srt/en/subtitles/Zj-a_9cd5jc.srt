1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,350
The question we're given asks
us, how many students attended

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,370
Einstein School in 2006?

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,000
And in this little table, they
tell us how many attended in

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,480
2001, 150 students, and in 2002,
225, 2003, we had 300

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,170
students, but they don't
tell us 2006.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,600
So what I think they want us
to do is to see the pattern

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,520
and how many students the
population of students grew by

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,650
every year, and just assume that
that pattern continues

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,530
through 2006.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,570
So we need to figure out what
the pattern is from one year

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,360
to the next, and then we're
going to figure out 2004,

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,980
2005, and then 2006.

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,340
So the assumption that we're
making in this problem, and I

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,880
think that the problem wants us
to make, is that whatever

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,000
the pattern of growth was in
these three years, that they

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,090
continue all the way to 2006.

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,940
So let's see what's
happening here.

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,290
When we go the first year, what
happens to our student

20
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:58,920
population?

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,370
We go from 150 to
225 students.

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,390
And the easiest pattern to think
about is, well just how

23
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,500
much are we increasing
by every year?

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,270
So how much do we have to
go to from 150 to 225?

25
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,100
We increased.

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,290
Well, if you increase by 50,
you get to 200, so we

27
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,600
increased another 25.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,270
So we increased by
75 students.

29
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,970
And then they go from
225 to 300, how many

30
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,270
did we increase by?

31
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,450
Looks like 75 again.

32
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,700
75 plus 225 is 300.

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,330
So it looks like we increased
by another 75.

34
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,570
So the pattern here is that each
year, 75 more students

35
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,720
attend the Einstein School.

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,560
So let's just continue
that pattern.

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,290
So let's add another 75.

38
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,060
Let's add another 75
to the 300 in 2003,

39
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,420
and we'll get 375.

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,440
In 2004, if we assume the
pattern continues, let's add

41
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,070
another 75.

42
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,120
And then what will
that give us?

43
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,450
That'll give us 450 students
in 2005, if we assume the

44
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,760
pattern continues.

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,550
And we're almost there.

46
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,870
Let's add a final
75, 75 plus 450.

47
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,440
If you add 50, you get
to 500, so it's

48
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,140
another 25, so it's 525.

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,300
So that would be the answer to
our question, if we assume the

50
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,820
pattern continued, that 525
students attended Einstein

51
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,500
School in 2006.

52
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,800
