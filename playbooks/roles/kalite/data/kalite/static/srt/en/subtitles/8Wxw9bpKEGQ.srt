99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Divide x squared minus three x plus two. Divided by x minus two. So we're going to divide this into that.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can do this really the same way that you first learned long division. So we have x minus two being divided into

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x squared minus three x plus two. Another way we could have written the same exact expression is...

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x squared minus three x plus two. All of that over x minus two. That, that, and that are all equivalent expressions.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now to do this type of long division, we can call it algebraic long division, you want to look at the highest degree term on the

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x minus two and the highest degree term on the x squared minus three x plus two. And here's the x and here's the x squared.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
X goes into x squared how many times? Or x squared divided by x is what? Well thats just equal to x.
