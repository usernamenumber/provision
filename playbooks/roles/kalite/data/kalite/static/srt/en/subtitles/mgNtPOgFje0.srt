00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:08,010
In the last video we took the MacLauren expansion of e^x, and we saw that it looked like some type of

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:16,537
a combination of the polynomial approximations of cos(x) and of sin(x), but it's not quite, because there was

3
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:22,641
a couple of negatives in there, if we were to really add these two together, that we did not have, when we

4
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:29,994
took the representation of e^x. But to reconcile these, I'll do a little bit of a, I don't know if you can even call

5
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:38,643
it a trick. Let's see, if we take this polynomial expansion of e^x, this approximation, what happens,

6
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:46,603
and if we say e^x is equal to this, specially as this becomes an infinite number of terms, it becomes less of an approximation

7
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:54,010
and more of an equality. What happens if I take e^(ix). And before that might have been kind of a weird thing to

8
00:00:54,010 --> 00:01:00,737
do. Let me write it down: e^(ix). Because before it's like, how do you define e to the ith power, that's a

9
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:05,994
very bizzare thing to do, to take something to the xi power, how do even comprehend some type of a

10
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:12,224
function like that. But now that we can have a polynomial expansion of e^x, we can maybe make

11
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:18,245
some sense of it, because we can take i to different powers, and we know what that gives, you know,

12
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:26,022
i^2=-1, i^3=-i, so on and so forth. So what happens when you take e^(ix). So once again, it's just like

13
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:31,925
taking the x up here, and replacing it with an ix. So everywhere we see the x in it's polynomial

14
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:40,160
approximation we would write an ix. So let's do that. So e^(ix) should be approximately equal to, and it'll become

15
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,799
more and more equal. And this is more of an intuition, I'm not doing a rigorous proof here. But it's still

16
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,389
profound... Not to oversell it, but I don't think I can oversell what is about to be discovered or seen in this

17
00:01:51,389 --> 00:02:01,642
video. It would be equal to 1+, instead of an x, we'll have an ix, +ix+, so what's

18
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:13,622
(ix)^2? So itÂ´s gonna be, so let me write this down, what is (ix)^2/2!? Well i^2 is gonna be -1 and

19
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:24,215
you'd have (x^2)/2!. So it's going to be -(x^2)/2!, and I think you might see where this is gonna go. And then,

20
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:31,507
what is, ix, remember, everywhere we saw an x we're gonna replace with an ix. So what is (ix)^3. Actually,

21
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:41,638
let me write this out, let me not skip some steps over here. So this is going to be ((ix)^2)/2!. Actually let

22
00:02:41,638 --> 00:03:10,854
me... I wanna do it just the way... So +((ix^2))/2!+((ix)^3)/3!+((ix)^4)/4!+((ix)^5)/5! and we can just keep

23
00:03:10,854 --> 00:03:23,638
going so on and so forth. But let's evaluate these 'ix's raised to different powers. So this will be equal to 1+ix...

24
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:36,140
(ix)^2, that's the same thing as (i^2)(x^2), i^2 is -1. So this is -(x^2)/2!. And then this is gonna be the same

25
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:52,547
thing as (i^3)(x^3), i^3 is the same thing as (i^2)i, so it's gonna be -i, so it's gonna be -i(x^3)/3!. And then,

26
00:03:52,547 --> 00:04:04,584
so then +, you're gonna have, what's i^4? So that's (i^2)^2, so that's (-1)^2, that's just going to be 1, so i^4

27
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:14,041
is 1 and then you have x^4 so +(x^4)/4!. And then you're going to have +, I'm not even gonna write the +

28
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:28,974
yet, i^5, so i^5 is going to be 1i, so it's gonna be i(x^5)/5! so +i(x^5)/5!, and I think you might see a

29
00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:52,692
pattern here. Coefficient is 1, i, -1, -i, 1, i, then -1(x^6)/6!, and then -i(x^7)/7!. So we have some terms, some of them

30
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:59,294
are imaginary, they have an i, they're being multiplied by i, some of them are real, why don't we separate

31
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:05,572
them out? Why don't we separate them out? So once again, e^(ix) is gonna be equal to this thing, specially

32
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:13,323
as we add an infinite number of terms. So let's separate out, the real and the non-real terms, or the real and the

33
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:24,777
imaginary terms, i should say. So this is real. This is real, this is real, and this right over here is real. And we

34
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:39,314
can keep going on with that. So the real terms here are 1-(x^2)/2!+(x^4)/4!, and you might be getting excited

35
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:48,698
now, -(x^6)/6!, and that's all I have done here, but they would keep going, so +, and so on and so forth. So that's all of the

36
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:56,575
real terms. And what are the imaginary terms here? And let me just, I'll just factor out the i over here. So it's

37
00:05:56,575 --> 00:06:05,254
gonna be +i times, well, this is ix, so this will be x, and then the next... so that's an imaginary term, this is an

38
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:16,204
imaginary term, we are factoring out the i, so -(x^3)/3!, then the next imaginary term is right over there, we

39
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:25,122
factored out the i, +(x^5)/5!, and then the next imaginary term is right there, we factored out the i so it's

40
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:35,617
-(x^7)/7!, and then we obviously would keep going, so +, -, keep going, so on and so forth. Preferably to infinity, so

41
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:45,039
that we can get as good of an approximation as possible. So we have a situation where e^(ix) is equal to

42
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:52,190
all of this business here. But, you probably remember from the last few videos, the real part, this was the

43
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:59,794
polynomial, this was the MacLauren approximation of cos(x) around 0, or i should say the Taylor

44
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:05,946
approximation around 0, or we could also call it the MacLauren approximation. So this and this are the

45
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:16,382
same thing. So this is cos(x), specially when you add an infinite number of terms, cos(x). This over here, is

46
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:23,138
sin(x), the exact same thing. So looks like we are able to reconcile how you can add up cos(x) and sin(x) to get

47
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:32,782
something that's like e^x. This right here is sin(x) and so, if we take it for granted, I'm not rigorously proving it

48
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:38,172
to you, that if you'd take an infinite number of terms here, that this will essentially become cos(x), and if you

49
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:45,894
take an infinite number of terms here, this will become sin(x), it leads to a fascinating formula. We could say

50
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:57,945
that e^(ix) is the same thing as cos(x), and you should be getting goose pimples right around now, is equal to

51
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:14,012
cos(x)+i(sin(x)), and this is Euler's Formula. This right over here is Euler's Formula, and if that by itself isn't

52
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:18,495
exciting and crazy enough for you, because it really should be, because we've already done some pretty

53
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:24,431
cool things. We're involving e, which we get from continuous compounding interest, we have cos(x) and

54
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:31,375
sin(x), which are ratios of right triangles, it comes out of the unit circle, and somehow we've thrown in (-1)^(1/2),

55
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:37,263
there seems to be this cool relationship here. But it becomes extra cool, and we are gonna assume we are

56
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:45,644
operating in radians here, if we assume Euler's Formula, what happens when x is equal to pi? Just to

57
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:50,790
throw in another wacky number in there, the ratio between the circumference and the diameter of a circle,

58
00:08:50,790 --> 00:09:06,529
what happens when we throw in pi? We get e^((i)(pi)) is equal to cos(pi), cos(pi) is what? cos(pi) is, pi is

59
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:18,843
halfway around the unit circle, so cos(pi) is -1, and then sin(pi) is 0. So this term goes away. So if you

60
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:26,544
evaluate it at pi, you get something amazing, this is called Euler's Identity!! Euler's Identity! I always have

61
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:34,485
trouble pronouncing Euler. Euler's Identity!! Which we can write like this, or we add 1 to both sides, and we

62
00:09:34,485 --> 00:10:02,546
can write it this. And I'll write it in different color for emphasis. e^((i)(pi))+1=0. And THIS, this is thought

63
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:06,947
provoking. I mean, here we have, just so you see, I mean, this tells you that there is some connectedness

64
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:12,974
to the Universe that we don't fully understand, or at least I don't fully understand. i is defined by engineers

65
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:20,883
for simplicity so they can find the roots of all sorts of polynomials, as, you could say, the square root of -1.

66
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:29,846
pi is the ratio between the circumference of a circle and it's diameter, once again, another interesting

67
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:35,441
number, but it seems like it comes from a different place as i. e comes from a bunch of different places.

68
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:41,670
e you can either think of it, it comes out of continuous compounding interest, super valuable for Finance, it

69
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:47,078
also comes from the notion that the derivative of e^x is also e^x, so another fascinating number, but once

70
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:53,118
again, seemingly unrelated to how we came up with i, and seemingly unrelated to how we came up with pi.

71
00:10:53,118 --> 00:11:00,011
And then of course, you have some of the most profound basic numbers over here, you have 1, I don't

72
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:06,026
have to explain why 1 is a cool number, and I shouldn't have to explain why 0 is a cool number. So this right

73
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:13,197
here, connects all of these fundamental numbers, in some mystical way, that shows us that there's some

74
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:23,983
connectedness to the Universe, so frankly, frankly, if this does not blow your mind, you really...

75
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,000
you have no emotion.
