1
00:00:01,371 --> 00:00:04,768
So we've thought a little bit about the lungs and the tissue,

2
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:07,936
and how there is a kind of (...sing?) relationship between the two,

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:12,726
where they're trying to send little molecules back and forth,

4
00:00:12,726 --> 00:00:17,106
so long it try to send, of course oxygen, out to the tissues, right.

5
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:22,878
And the tissue is trying to figure out a way to efficiently send back carbondioxide.

6
00:00:22,878 --> 00:00:26,773
So these are the --the kind of core things are going on, between the two.

7
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:30,458
And remember in turns of getting oxygen accross, there're two major ways we said.

8
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:34,745
The first one, kind of the easy one, is as dissolved oxygen

9
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:37,492
--dissolved oxygen in the blood itself.

10
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:39,506
But that's not the major way.

11
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:43,282
The major way is when oxygen actually binds hemoglobin --in fact,

12
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:48,779
we called it HbO2, and the name of that molecule is oxyhemoglobin.

13
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:53,867
So this is kind of how the majority of the oxygen is gonna get delivered to the tissues.

14
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:58,005
And on the other side, coming back from the tissue to the lungs,

15
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:00,113
you've got dissolved carbondioxide,

16
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:04,379
little bit of carbondioxide actually literally comes just right in the plasma.

17
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,233
But that's not the majority of how carbondioxide gets back.

18
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:11,415
The more effective ways of getting carbondioxide back,

19
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:15,122
remember we have this protonated hemoglobin.

20
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:18,652
And actually --remember when I-- when I said there's a protonated hemoglobin,

21
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:22,083
there's gotta be some bicarb floating around in the plasma.

22
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,270
And the reason that that works is because,

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,524
when they get back to the lungs, the proton --the bicarb,

24
00:01:27,524 --> 00:01:32,086
actually kind of meet up again, and they form CO2 and water,

25
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:36,279
and this happens because there's an enzyme called carbonic-anhydrase,

26
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,809
inside of the red blood cells.

27
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:40,879
So this is where the carbondioxide is actually gets back.

28
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,110
And of course there's the third way, remember there's also some hemoglobin

29
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,386
that actually binds directly to carbondioxide in the process,

30
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:52,583
you know, it forms a little proton as well,

31
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,947
and that proton can go to this bussiness, right?

32
00:01:55,947 --> 00:01:58,056
It can bind to a hemoglobin as well.

33
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:02,257
So, there's a little interplay there, but the important ones

34
00:02:02,257 --> 00:02:07,486
I want to really kind of focus in on, are the fact that hemoglobin can bind to oxygen

35
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:12,587
and also in this side, that hemoglobin actually can bind to protons.

36
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:16,980
Now the fun part about all this is that there's a little competition, right?

37
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,013
A little game going on here.

38
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:23,443
Because you've got --on the one side you've got hemoglobin binding oxigen,

39
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,817
and let me draw it twice,

40
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:29,399
and let's say this topple an interaction with proton,

41
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:34,215
well that proton is gonna wanna snatch away the hemoglobin.

42
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:36,489
And so there's a little competition for hemoglobin,

43
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,284
and here the oxygen kind of gets left out in the cold,

44
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,679
and the carbondioxide does kind of the same thing we said. We--

45
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:48,429
Now we've little hemoglobin bound a carbondioxide and makes a proton in the process,

46
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:51,885
but again, that leaves oxygen out in the cold.

47
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:54,614
So depending on whether you have a lot of oxygen around,

48
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:57,326
if that's the kind of key thing going on,

49
00:02:57,326 --> 00:03:03,448
or whether you have a lot of these kind of products, the proton or the carbondioxide.

50
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:08,194
Depending on which one you have more of, floating around in the --in the tissue, in the cell,

51
00:03:08,194 --> 00:03:11,185
will determine which way the reaction goes.

52
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:14,459
So keeping this concept to mind, then I could actually step back and say, well--

53
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,835
you know, I think that oxygen is affected by carbondioxide and proton,

54
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:24,733
so I could say, well, these two --carbondioxide and protons, are actually --affecting,

55
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:29,150
let's say are affecting,

56
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:33,518
the --let's say, the affinity,

57
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:41,133
the affinity or the willingness of hemoglobin to bind --of hemoglobin-- four oxygen.

58
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:45,780
Right, that's one kind of statement you could make by looking at that kind of competition,

59
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,280
and (the repressing?) come along in that they say, well, I think

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,182
oxygen actually is affecting, you know, depending on which one

61
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:55,857
--which perspective you take, you get the oxygen is affecting,

62
00:03:55,857 --> 00:04:03,615
maybe the affinity of hemoglobin for the carbondioxide and proton.

63
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:08,884
--of hemoglobin for CO2 and protons.

64
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:12,281
So you could say it from either perspective,

65
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:16,512
if I wanna point out is that actually in a sense both of these are true,

66
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,628
In a lot of times we think, well, maybe it's just saying the same thing twice.

67
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:24,982
But actually, these're two separate facts, and they have two separate names.

68
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:28,644
So, the first one, talking about carbondioxide and protons,

69
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:32,744
their effect is called the {Bohr Effect}.

70
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:35,448
See, you might see that word, or this description,

71
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:37,584
This is the Bohr Effect.

72
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:40,731
And the other one, kind of looking at from the other perspective,

73
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:44,783
looking at from oxygen perspective, this should be the {Haldane Effect}.

74
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:47,568
That's just the name of it, Haldane Effect.

75
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:50,605
So, what is the Bohr Effect and the Haldane effect,

76
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:54,568
other than simply saying that the things compete for hemoglobin?

77
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:56,930
Well, let me actually bring up a little bit of the (can?) list,

78
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,159
and let's see if I can diagram this out.

79
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:02,979
because sometimes I think a little diagram would really go along when explaining these things.

80
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:05,341
So, let's see if I can do that.

81
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:09,853
Let's use a little graph and see if you can illustrate the Bohr Effect on this graph.

82
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:14,534
This is the partial pressure of oxygen, how much it dissolved in the plasma.

83
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:20,632
And this is oxygen content which is to say how much total oxygen is there in the blood,

84
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:26,181
and this of course takes an account mostly the amount of oxygen that's bound to hemoglobin.

85
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:29,746
So what if I slowly increase the partial pressure of oxygen,

86
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:35,948
see how initially not too much is gonna be binding to the hemoglobin,

87
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:40,062
but eventually as a few of the molecules bind, you get cooperativity,

88
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:44,846
and so then slowly the slopes start to rise, becomes more steep.

89
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:47,541
And this is all because of cooperativity,

90
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,899
oxygen likes to bind where other oxygen have already bound.

91
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:53,711
And then it's gonna kind of level off.

92
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:57,322
And the leveling off is because hemoglobin is starting to get saturated.

93
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,755
So there aren't to many extra spots available,

94
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:02,780
so you need a lot --a lot of oxygen dissolved in the plasma,

95
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,877
to be able to seek out and find those extra remaining spots on hemoglobin.

96
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:10,171
So let's say we choose two spots.

97
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:14,777
One spot, let's say, is high amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood,

98
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:19,000
And this, let's say, is a low amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,986
I'm just kind of choosing them arbitrarily, and don't--

100
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:22,515
don't worry about the units.

101
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:26,020
And if you are to think of where in the body would be high location,

102
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,121
that could be something like the lungs, where you have a lot of oxygen dissolved in bloods.

103
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:36,026
And low would be, let's say, the thigh muscle where there is a lot of CO2,

104
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:38,443
but not so much oxygen dissolved in the blood.

105
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:41,142
So these could be two parts of our body, and you--

106
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:43,970
you can see that, now if I wanna figure out--

107
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,643
looking at this curve, how much oxygen is being delivered to the thigh.

108
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,948
Then that's actually pretty easy, I could just say, well,

109
00:06:50,948 --> 00:06:56,544
how much oxygen was there in the lungs --or in the blood vessel leaving the lungs--

110
00:06:56,544 --> 00:07:00,316
And there's this much oxygen in the blood vessels leaving the lungs.

111
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:05,418
And there's this much oxygen in the blood vessel leaving the thigh.

112
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:11,937
So the difference wherever oxygen is between this two points,

113
00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:14,324
that's the amount of oxygen that I got delivered.

114
00:07:14,324 --> 00:07:18,047
So if you want to figure out how much oxygen got delivered to any --any tissue,

115
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:21,346
you can simply substract these two values.

116
00:07:21,346 --> 00:07:23,049
So that's the oxygen delivery.

117
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:25,793
But looking at this you can see a kind of interesting point,

118
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:29,081
which is that if you want it to increase the oxygen delivery,

119
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:33,087
let's say you want it, for some reason, to increase it, become more efficient,

120
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:37,667
then really the only way to do that is to have the thigh

121
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:42,846
kind of become more hypoxic, as he moves to the left on here,

122
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:46,786
that's really becoming hypoxic, or having less oxygen.

123
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:53,059
So if he becomes more hypoxic, then yes --you'll, you'll have, you know,

124
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:56,073
maybe, a lower point here, maybe a point like this,

125
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:58,894
and that would mean a larger oxygen delivery.

126
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:02,914
But that's not ideal, you know, when your thighs to become hypoxic,

127
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:05,391
you know that --that could start aching and hurting.

128
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:09,649
so is there an another way to have a large oxygen delivery

129
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:14,935
without having any hypoxic tissue, or tissue that has a low amount of oxygen in it?

130
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:17,421
And this is where the Bohr Effect comes into play.

131
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:24,679
So, remember that Bohr Effect is that CO2 and proton affect the hemoglobin affinity for oxygen.

132
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:29,547
So let's think of a situation --I'll do it in green,

133
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:32,893
and in this situation we have a lot of carbondioxide and proton,

134
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:37,421
the Bohr Effect thought is, that it's kind of a bit harder for oxygen to bind hemoglobin.

135
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:39,371
So if I was to sketch another curve,

136
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:45,656
initially, it's gonna be even less impressive, with less oxygen bound to hemoglobin.

137
00:08:45,656 --> 00:08:50,208
And eventually, once the --once the concentration of oxygen rises enough,

138
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:54,687
it will start going up up up, and it does bind hemoglobin eventually,

139
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:59,111
so it's not like it'll never bind hemoglobin in the presence of carbondioxide and protons,

140
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:00,911
but it takes longer.

141
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:04,111
and so the entire curve looks shifted over.

142
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:08,957
This-- these conditions of kind of high CO2 and high proton,

143
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:11,452
that's not really relevant to the lungs.

144
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:15,305
The lungs will think you --for us, you know-- "who cares, we don't really have these conditions".

145
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,725
But for the thigh, it is relevant.

146
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:22,282
Because the thigh has a lot of CO2 and the thigh has a lot of proton.

147
00:09:22,282 --> 00:09:25,812
Again, remember, high protons means low pH.

148
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:28,114
So, you can think it either way.

149
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:32,845
So in the thigh, you're gonna get, then, a different point.

150
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:35,643
Right, it's gonna be on the green curve, not the blue curve.

151
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:41,111
So, we can draw it at the same O2 level, actually being down here.

152
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:45,113
So what is the O2 content in the blood that's leaving the thigh?

153
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:49,321
Well then, to do it properly out, they'll-- you'll be, actually you'll be over here.

154
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:55,947
This is the actual amount. And so O2 delivery is actually much more impressive.

155
00:09:55,947 --> 00:10:00,943
Look at that. So O2 delivery is inceased because of the Bohr Effect.

156
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:02,996
And if you want to know exactly how much it increase,

157
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:08,132
I could even show you, I could say, well this amount from here down to here,

158
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:12,278
literally the vertical distance between the green and the blue lines,

159
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,612
so this is the extra oxygen delivered because of the Bohr Effect.

160
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:21,791
So this is how the Bohr Effect is so important

161
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,206
and actually helping us deliver oxygen to our tissues.

162
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,990
So let's do the same thing now,

163
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,924
but for the Haldane Effect, and to do this,

164
00:10:28,924 --> 00:10:33,661
we actually have to switch things around, so our units and our axis are gonna be different.

165
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:36,655
So we're gonna have the amount of carbondioxide there,

166
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:40,016
and here we'll do carbondioxide content in the blood.

167
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:43,044
So let's think through this kind of carefully.

168
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:48,585
Let's first start out with increasing the amount of carbondioxide slowly but surely,

169
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:49,680
and see that the content goes up.

170
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,379
and here, as you increase the amount of carbondioxide,

171
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:56,154
the content just kind of goes up as the straight line.

172
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:59,313
And the reason it doesn't take that S-shape that we had with the oxygen,

173
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:02,647
is that there is no cooperativity in binding the hemoglobin.

174
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:04,543
It just kind of goes up straight.

175
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:06,496
So that's easy enough.

176
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:09,710
Now let's take two points like we did before.

177
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:15,119
Let's take a point --let's say, up here this'll be high amount of CO2 in the blood,

178
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,040
and this'll be a low amount of CO2 in the blood.

179
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,800
So you'd have a low amount, let's say right here, in what part of tissue?

180
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,704
Well, low CO2, that sounds like the lungs,

181
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:27,748
there is not too much CO2 there.

182
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:34,537
But high CO2 probably is the thighs, 'cause the thigh is like a little CO2 factories, right?

183
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:38,867
So the thigh has a high amount, and the lungs have a low amount.

184
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:44,046
So, if I wanna look at the amount of CO2 delivered, we do it the same way with --

185
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:50,693
okay, well the thighs had a high amount, this is the amount of CO2 in the blood, remember.

186
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:53,700
And this is the amount of CO2 in the blood when it goes to the lungs.

187
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,579
So, the amount of CO2 that was delivered from the thigh to the lungs,

188
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:05,022
is the difference --and so this is how much CO2 delivery were actually getting.

189
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:09,345
So just like we had O2 delivery, we have this much CO2 delivery.

190
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:14,512
Now, read over the Haldane Effect, and let's see if we can actually sketch out

191
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:19,714
another line in the presence of high oxygen, what's gonna happen?

192
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:22,380
Well, if there is a lot of oxygen around,

193
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,858
then it's gonna change the affinity of hemoblobin for carbondioxide and protons.

194
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:36,323
So it's gonna low less binding of protons and carbondioxide directly to the hemoglobin.

195
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:39,279
And that means that you're gonna have less CO2 content,

196
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,251
for any given amount of dissolved CO2 in the blood.

197
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:49,277
So that line is still a straight line, but it's actually --you notice it's kind of sloped downwards.

198
00:12:49,277 --> 00:12:52,555
So where is this relevant?

199
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:54,110
Where do you have a lot of oxygen?

200
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,443
Well, it's not really relevant for the thigh,

201
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,516
because the thighs don't have a lot of oxygen.

202
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:01,068
But it is relevant for the lungs.

203
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:03,201
It is very relevant there.

204
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:06,536
So now you can actually say, "well, let's see what happens"

205
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:11,516
Now that you have high O2, how much CO2 delivery are you getting?

206
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:14,732
And then-- then you can already kind of see it, it's gonna be more, right?

207
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:20,468
because now you got this much, you've got going all the way over here.

208
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:23,232
So this is the new amount of CO2 delivery.

209
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:27,866
And it's gone up. And in fact, you can even show exactly how much it's gone up by--

210
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:31,335
by simply taking this difference. So, this difference right here,

211
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:35,598
between the two, this is the Haldane Effect.

212
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:39,859
This is the kind of visual way that you can actually see the Haldane Effect.

213
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:45,907
So the Bohr Effect and the Haldane Effect, these are two important strategies our body has,

214
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:49,802
for increasing the amount of O2 delivery and CO2 delivery

215
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:52,008
going back and forth between the lungs and the tissues.

216
00:13:52,008 --> 99:59:59,999
~o0o~
