2
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:10,213
We've talked about Dürer as a great painter from Northern Germany,

3
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:13,575
but Dürer was also a great printmaker.

4
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:16,577
This is an excellent example to talk about Dürer's printmaking,

5
00:00:16,577 --> 00:00:17,896
in part because it's a woodcut.

6
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:19,847
There are several different types of printmaking

7
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:23,240
that are popular in the late 1400s and early 1500s,

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,993
and the woodcuts was [sic] the first and most popular type of printing at the time.

9
00:00:28,993 --> 00:00:30,146
There's a couple of reasons for that,

10
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:32,683
but maybe one of the most important ones is

11
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:34,499
the way that a woodcut is made.

12
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:35,867
When we're looking at a woodcut like this,

13
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:37,793
what we have to keep in mind is that

14
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:40,757
all of the lines that have been printed on the page

15
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:44,148
were raised up off the surface of the printing block.

16
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:47,254
And so we need to imagine that on the piece of wood

17
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:48,319
that this was printed from,

18
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:49,300
when we look at this cloud,

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,374
there was a thin piece of wood standing up from the surface,

20
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:54,610
and the carver, sometimes Dürer himself,

21
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,699
had carved away everything that's white and blank.

22
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:00,723
It's like a stamp. It's very labor-intensive.

23
00:01:00,723 --> 00:01:03,228
But it's worth it in the end, because you can make a lot of them.

24
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:05,678
And you can make money that way, as Dürer did.

25
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:07,498
You can spread your point of view that way,

26
00:01:07,498 --> 00:01:09,870
because they can be distributed; they're very portable.

27
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,644
And so, a lot of effort goes into it at first,

28
00:01:12,644 --> 00:01:14,133
but then once you're making the prints,

29
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:16,030
there's a lot of them, they're inexpensive,

30
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,643
they can be carried around easily,

31
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:20,547
and so they help spread your name or your ideas very quickly.

32
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:26,783
I was going to say that they were popular because they could be combined with the printed word,

33
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:29,039
which is printed more and more often at this time,

34
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,820
because like letters in a typewriter,

35
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,116
the images are raised up off the surface,

36
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:33,861
like the letters.

37
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:37,126
And so they could all be combined in the same printing press and used together.

38
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:39,540
He was interested in other kinds of media, too.

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,553
because although he could achieve, as we can see,

40
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:43,368
a great deal of light and shadow,

41
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:45,977
and some detail, in these woodcuts,

42
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:50,016
there are ultimately limitations to the woodcut process,

43
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:52,901
even though Dürer was a great master, as we can see.

44
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:55,147
And the primary problem is, as we've said,

45
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:57,614
that you're cutting away what you don't want to print.

46
00:01:57,614 --> 00:02:00,159
It's not a very direct way of making a representation.

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,260
You're not drawing with a pen

48
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,596
or painting with a paintbrush.

49
00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:05,363
You're making the marks that you don't want to appear on the paper,

50
00:02:05,363 --> 00:02:06,327
if that makes any sense.

51
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,088
And that creates difficulties.

52
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:10,034
Also, it's very hard, in a woodcut,

53
00:02:10,034 --> 00:02:12,701
to get very fine lines, or very sharp details,

54
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:15,430
because if you want a very thin line,

55
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,736
like the lines in the clouds are, to a certain extent,

56
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:22,130
you have to imagine, these are very thin fins,

57
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,753
basically, of wood, that are sticking up;

58
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:25,432
and in the printing press, they may crush.

59
00:02:25,432 --> 00:02:27,911
So Dürer is interested in other methods of printing

60
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:30,489
that can give him the kinds of details and tonal gradation.

61
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:34,191
And so, what he's able to do is then, instead,

62
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:35,289
later in his life,

63
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:38,921
take advantage of the engraving printing technique,

64
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:42,031
which is very different from the way a woodcut is made.

65
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,699
The primary difference is that with an engraving,

66
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,109
the gestures that you make are the lines that will appear on the paper.

67
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:48,735
Like drawing.

68
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,115
Like drawing. With an engraving,

69
00:02:50,115 --> 00:02:51,642
you work with a metal plate,

70
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:54,460
and you use a very sharp instrument

71
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,998
with a v-shaped tip -

72
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:57,144
it's called a burin -

73
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,701
and you push that through the metal.

74
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:01,206
The lines that you're making with this tool

75
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:02,789
can be extremely thin.

76
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:05,287
You can make the very faintest of lines.

77
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:08,264
Here we can see how Dürer has been able to achieve

78
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:11,372
the kind of detail and textural nuances

79
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:14,074
and subtleties of shade and light

80
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:16,928
that he would never ever be able to achieve with a woodcut.

81
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:20,287
You're carving the lines, then the ink goes all over the plate,

82
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,974
including in the lines;

83
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:23,500
you wipe off the surface of the plate

84
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,224
so that the ink is only in the lines,

85
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:26,624
and then you put it through a printing press

86
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,619
that presses much harder than a woodcut printing press.

87
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:32,134
This is one of the disadvantages of engravings.

88
00:03:32,134 --> 00:03:34,147
There are a couple, compared to woodcuts.

89
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,254
One of them is that, because of the high pressure

90
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:38,455
of the printing press,

91
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:40,822
and the faint, very delicate dots and lines

92
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:43,961
of an engraving, you can't make as many good prints.

93
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:48,766
So you can print fewer engravings than you can a wood cut, surprisingly.

94
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:49,802
And that would make them more expensive.

95
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:50,962
That makes them more expensive.

96
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:54,039
Along with the fact that the raw materials that you're using

97
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,218
are also more expensive: metal, instead of wood.

98
00:03:56,218 --> 00:04:00,118
And by the way, this is "St. Jerome in his Study," by Dürer.

99
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:03,067
This is St. Jerome in the study, a later print by Dürer

100
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:04,349
from the early 1500s.

101
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,689
It's amazing how he's able to achieve with an engraving

102
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,783
the characteristic features of Northern European painting,

103
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,948
like the effects of light and shadow,

104
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:14,016
the sense of texture, the sense of detail,

105
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:18,216
and also this idea of a solitary man working at,

106
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,949
probably, the translation of the Bible that Jerome is famous for -

107
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:25,565
that sense of devotion and solitary, pensive thought is also rather Northern.

108
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,179
We should also add that there are influences of Italian art here.

109
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,965
It's quite evident that Dürer has used one-point perspective.

110
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:34,536
In the early 1500s, there were not many Northern European artists

111
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:36,852
who had the mastery of perspective,

112
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:40,953
as Dürer did since he had traveled to Italy twice in the 1490s.

113
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:42,181
He's showing off here, isn't he?

114
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,017
Absolutely.

115
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:50,705
