1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,800
Let's say I have this
bizarre-looking function.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,600
It's just some
arbitrary function.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,970
And we'll call that f of x.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,880
So this function right
there is f of x.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,780
And what we're going to do in
this video is, it's not an

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,700
experiment, but we're going to
play around a little bit, and

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,920
we're going to try to
approximate this function

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,720
using a polynomial with
some coefficients.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,840
And this polynomial we're going
to do, we're going to keep

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,670
adding terms to the polynomial,
so that we can better and

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,380
better approximate
this function.

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,890
And that's actually
called a power series.

13
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,060
And we'll do more about that
later, but we're going to

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,360
specifically try, in this case,
to approximate the function

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,320
around x is equal to 0.

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,490
So around this point.

17
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,020
So the easiest way to
approximate it is to say, well,

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,000
the simplest polynomial is
just a constant, right?

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,590
Let's say this is my
polynomial, let me call

20
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,100
my polynomial p of x.

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,320
The simplest polynomial is just
a constant, and it would just

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,280
be a horizontal line someplace.

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,310
So if I just wanted this one
term polynomial, what would be

24
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,300
my best approximation for this
function, at least

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,290
at this point?

26
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,850
Well, I could just set p
of x is equal to f of 0.

27
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,130
And in that case, p of x would
just look like a horizontal

28
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,600
line going through f of 0.

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,050
It would just look like that.

30
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,460
I'm going to erase that now,
just so I don't dirty up

31
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,590
this picture too much.

32
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,540
But that's, you could say,
a very rough approximation

33
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,050
of f of x, right?

34
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,860
So that's a start.

35
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,450
Well, what would be one way
to approximate it even more?

36
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,140
Well, what if not only does p
of x equal f of 0 at x is equal

37
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:44,900
to 0, so that horizontal line
we did, we got p of 0 is equal

38
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,450
to f of 0, so we knew that at x
equals 0, at least that

39
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,430
horizontal line is the same
value of f of x, that's a

40
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,920
very rough approximation.

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,010
But what if we set it up so
that the derivative of p of 0

42
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:06,020
is equal to the derivative
of the function at 0?

43
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,350
All of a sudden, this could be
a little bit more interesting.

44
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,790
So how could we set
it up like that?

45
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:14,350
Well, what if we set p of x,
and I'm doing it very general,

46
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,180
and we're going to do specific
examples, and actually, the

47
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,160
first example we're going to do
is probably the coolest one.

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,460
So what if p of x is equal to,
well, the constant term is f of

49
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:31,650
0, and then it's plus the
derivative of this function, so

50
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,110
the slope of this function at
that point, f prime

51
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,780
of 0 times x.

52
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,020
Let's say I'm defining,
so this is a polynomial.

53
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,040
I just added a first
degree term here.

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,270
I had a constant, and now I'm
adding a first degree term.

55
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,630
And let me confirm that this
will have the same derivative.

56
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,990
So let's see.

57
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,800
First of all, let's confirm
that p of 0 is equal to f of 0.

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:03,130
Well, p of 0 is equal to f of
0 plus f prime of 0 times 0.

59
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,980
Well, this last term just
goes to, is nothing, right?

60
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,560
Times 0.

61
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,180
So that checks out.

62
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,500
At x is equal to 0,
the two functions are

63
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,840
equal to each other.

64
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,190
Now let me confirm that their
derivative, their first

65
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,990
derivatives are the same.

66
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,450
So what's the first
derivative of p?

67
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,470
p prime of x is equal to,
well, the derivative of a

68
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,660
constant term is 0, right?

69
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,850
Plus, and what's the derivative
of a next term, of a

70
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,170
first degree term?

71
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,800
Well, it's just f prime of 0.

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,780
So this checks out.

73
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:45,290
My new polynomial that I've
defined right here is equal to

74
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,360
the function f at x is equal to
0, and its derivative is equal

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,380
to the function f at
x is equal to 0.

76
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,740
So what would it look like?

77
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,830
Well, it would intersect, at
x is equal to 0, the two

78
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,170
functions would overlap.

79
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,460
And also, they would have the
same slope at that point.

80
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,180
So whatever f of x is
doing, that function's

81
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,640
going to be doing.

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,780
So it's going to look something
like, I'm going to try my best

83
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,650
to, it's going to look
something like that.

84
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,930
And so that is a better
approximation, if we had to use

85
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,770
a line, that's as good as any,
especially around 0,

86
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,470
of what f of x is.

87
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,180
f of x might have been some
really crazy weirdo function,

88
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,350
but we were able to approximate
it reasonably well with this

89
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,760
very simple linear equation.

90
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,750
Well, that's all good, but
let's approximate it with a

91
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,490
quadratic equation, with adding
another x squared term.

92
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,910
And we're going to do that way,
but we're going to say, well,

93
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,050
we said, when at x is equal
to 0, the functions

94
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,900
equal each other.

95
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,590
That's what we did here.

96
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,570
Then we said, the derivatives
equal each other, and

97
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,270
so we added this term.

98
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,130
And now I'm going to say, what
happens when their second

99
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,480
derivatives equal each other?

100
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,050
So what has to happen for
their second derivatives

101
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,430
to equal each other?

102
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,610
Well, let's try out this,
and I think you'll start

103
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,960
to see the intuition here.

104
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,860
Let me define my new p of x,
so let me add another term.

105
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,070
p of x, the first terms
are going to be the same.

106
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,820
They're going to be f of 0.

107
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,100
Remember, this is just
a constant term.

108
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,530
Plus f prime of 0, the
first derivative at 0,

109
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,050
the slope at 0 times x.

110
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:32,790
Plus f prime prime, the second
derivative of the function at

111
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,610
0, times x squared over 2.

112
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,500
Now you're probably saying,
why are you multiplying

113
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,390
it by 1/2 here?

114
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,300
And you'll see, and maybe
you'll even realize it, when

115
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,500
you take a second derivative,
what happens, right?

116
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,460
You multiply the expression by
the exponents so you can have a

117
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,800
2 come down, it's going to
cancel out with the 1/2.

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,150
And that's why I
put the 1/2 there.

119
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,390
So that when I take the
derivative, that 2 and the 1/2

120
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,460
cancel out, and I'm just left
with the second derivative

121
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,470
of the original function.

122
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,570
So let me confirm that.

123
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:09,670
So p of 0 is equal to f of 0
plus, well when x is equal to

124
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,290
0, that's 0, this term is 0,
and when x is equal to 0,

125
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,010
that term is 0, right?

126
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,380
So that checks out.

127
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,790
What's the first
derivative of p?

128
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,630
The first derivative of p is
going to be, up here, this

129
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,570
was the first derivative
of p at 0, right?

130
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,700
So what's the first
derivative of p?

131
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,720
Well, the constant term becomes
0, plus-- oh, actually, no,

132
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,770
this was actually of x, sorry.

133
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,130
I shouldn't go back on my work,
I know it best when I'm doing

134
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,080
it the first time around.

135
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,970
Anyway.

136
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,530
The first derivative of p of x,
this is my current p of x, this

137
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,200
constant term, derivative of 0.

138
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,780
This x term, the derivative
is f prime of 0.

139
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,380
And then, what's the
derivative of this term?

140
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,990
Well, we take the exponent,
multiply it by the expression.

141
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,650
We have 2 times 1/2,
that cancels out.

142
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,340
So we're just left with
f prime prime of 0 x.

143
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,020
Right?

144
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,550
You take the exponent, multiply
by the whole thing, and then

145
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,900
decrement the exponent by 1.

146
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,020
So what is p prime of 0?

147
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,730
What is the derivative at 0?

148
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,960
Well, it equals,
this is nothing.

149
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,030
It equals f prime of 0
plus, and, well, this

150
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,990
term's going to be 0.

151
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,930
So that checks out.

152
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,990
And so what's the
third derivative?

153
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,380
Let me clean up some of
the stuff on the top.

154
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,780
Since this is our current f
of x anyway, I can clean

155
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,360
up all of this stuff.

156
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,050
Let me clean up all of this.

157
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:55,700
So what is the third derivative
of this p that I defined here?

158
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,540
This is our current p.

159
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,900
Well, the third derivative is
going to be, so p prime prime

160
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,540
prime of x, we could have also
written p3 of x, is equal

161
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,900
to the derivative of this.

162
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,360
Oh, sorry, we're not on
the third, we're only on

163
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,650
the second derivative.

164
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,060
p, and I'll write prime prime,
I was going to write a 2 there.

165
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,750
p prime prime of x.

166
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,000
That equals what?

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,990
That's the derivative of this.

168
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,440
So there was a 0 here,
that goes to nothing.

169
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,090
This is now a constant term,
that becomes nothing.

170
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,250
And then we take the
derivative of this term.

171
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,050
Well, we just, it's
a constant times x.

172
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,040
Remember, this might look like
a function or some variable.

173
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,680
It's just a constant.

174
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,140
Because we evaluated this
curvy function, it's

175
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,570
second derivative 0, so we
just got a number here.

176
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,900
So this derivative is
just this number.

177
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,650
So it equals f
prime prime of 0.

178
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,000
And so our current p of x has
the same value when x is equal

179
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,080
to 0 as f of x, it has the same
first derivative at xis equal

180
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,050
to zero as f of x, it has
the same second derivative.

181
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,270
And I don't, this is getting
beyond my visualization

182
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,360
ability, especially for an
arbitrary function like this,

183
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,140
but I could guess that maybe
it looks something like this.

184
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,620
I don't know.

185
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,940
Maybe it looks, maybe our new
function will curve, and it'll

186
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,180
approximate it a little
bit better, and then maybe

187
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,180
it'll come down like that.

188
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,480
I don't know.

189
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,710
I'm just guessing.

190
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,460
But around x is equal to 0,
it's going to be a better

191
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,560
approximation of f of x.

192
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,170
Well, we could just keep doing
this, and actually, we will

193
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,540
keep doing this, and you know,
just saying, well, the zeroth

194
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,430
derivative, or at the value, is
the same the first derivative

195
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,600
is the same at 0, the second
derivative is the same at 0,

196
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,380
we'll say the third derivative,
the fourth derivative, and

197
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,520
we'll keep doing that.

198
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,730
And I only have 20 seconds left
in this video, so we will

199
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,250
continue that in
the next video.
