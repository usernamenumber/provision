1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is sal here again and i'm still here with my good friend Dr maja Devon from Stanford University.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the last video we had looked at adequacy of x-rays for the neck, is the x-ray good enough?

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But now, lets assume that we have good x-rays, now what do we look at?

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Dr Devon: The next step is to look at the alignment, so we talk about the A, B, C's

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The A, B, C's of reading a cerebral-spinal film. A starts with Adequacy, that we went over, and the

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
second part of A is Alignment.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sal: Ok, so we're still in A, I was expecting something with a B...

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Alright, Alignment. Alright, so this looks like this is about alignment.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is about Alignment, and there's four lines that we look at. the first is the anterior vertebral

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
body line. Ok, AVBL right over there.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly, and basically what you're doing is trying to draw a smooth line that connects the anterior aspect,

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the front of, all the vertebral bodies, it should be nice and smooth, it's usually curved, and all the

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
points should sort of fit on that line; nothing should be off of that line. That would suggest that

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there was a problem there.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I see, and anterior as you just said means front.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly. The next line is going to the back of the vertebral body is the Posterior Vertebral body.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, so not the back of the entire vertabrae, the vertebral body, which is this boxy part right in front.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly. So, same thing, connecting a line up and down, should be nice and smooth as you've drawn it,

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and nothing should fall off that line, no piece of the vertebral body should fall off of that line as

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you've drawn it.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Alright, sounds good. And then?

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The next is we connect all the spinal laminar junctions. So this is the spinal laminar line, and it's

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where, sort of the lamina connects to the spinous process.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Spinous process, sounds like we could make a whole video about that...

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Spinous process, if you look at the back of somebody's neck are those little bumps that you can see...

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Oh, ok, so these triangular things right here...

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Oh, ok, so you are just connecting that line, kind of the front of these triangles, the base of these

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
triangles, so to speak.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, then the last one?

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The last line is the spinous process tips. And again, we're just connecting the top, the tip,

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of all the spinous processes, the little bony projections you can see if you look at the back of

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
somebody's neck.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right, right.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And these, too, should generally fall in a nice smooth curve.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right, and so the general rule is that if any of these aren't aligned the way that we've drawn here,

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's a problem.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly, we call it subluxation, or malalignment, or misalignment...

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And these all suggest that there is a problem there.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which is a big deal, because your spinal cord is going through there

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Absolutely! If you look between the green and the blue line, that's where your actual spinal cord runs.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right, right, right down there.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I see, so you don't want that to get messed up.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Alright, so let's look at a few of these x-rays and see if we can, or if anything's wrong, if we can

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
spot it.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Actually, Sal, now that you know how to read cerebrospinal x-rays, I'm going to have you look at the

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
first x-ray.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(Laughing) OK, let's see, so now I'm going to get sued for malpractice! Ok, let's see, alright...

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This one over here, so let me just do the first one. Let me just go over what you told me to do.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I'm going to do the anterior side of this vertebral body...

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly.

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm learning the words, too, talking like a doctor...OK, so I'm going to draw a line here.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, that looks pretty good.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yup

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That looks decent, this still looks decent, and I don't know, that doesn't look great, would this count?

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean, this looks like it got shifted over a little bit

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Absolutely.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean, it's not like like a huge shifting, but it's enough to, that it's not easy to draw a line, so,

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so I was right?

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You're absolutely right, and in fact sometimes it's very subtle. You picked up a very subtle abnormality,

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but again, even though it's subtle on the x-ray it can be serious for the patient, so you potentially

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
saved their spinal cord and their lives by picking up an injury like this.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, very good. So it's literally something as subtle as that is what you're looking for.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly. Again, it should be a nice smooth line or nice smooth curve, and as you can see,

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at that junction, it's no longer smooth.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You don't even have to look at the other lines, you just, any one of these, that don't go on a line,

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's enough, you say, hey, do something else.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly, and that's a great important teaching point, which is if you see any abnormality

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on a plain film, or on an x-ray like this, you stop, and you protect their cervical spine,

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then you get a more important study or better quality study like a CT scan.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Fascinating. Although if I do look here, it does look like we could have done the PVBL

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it looks like that also is a little off, too.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Absolutely.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, let's look at a few more.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Great

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I don't want to focus too much on my first victory...

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Alright, so it's clear that this person is facing this way, I can see their teeth.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see what we can do here. Can I give it a shot again?

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Please, please-

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, AVBL looks pretty good. This is, well, that looks close, it looks close...

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I agree, and potentially again, you've got a very keen eye and you might have picked it up,

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but most people might have overlooked that.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Ok, so let's try the other lines here. So this one is more obvious, this one is more obvious, there

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is kind of a disconnection right over there.

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly, and this is the PVBL, or the posterior verterbral body line, and you can see clearly that line is not smooth, it doesn't connect,

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so there is a problem right there at that junction.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Ok, ok, Alright, so we have this last one right over here. Let's see what I can do, I don't want to

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lose my streak...

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Alright, so anterior side, this actually looks pretty perfect, actually.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And in fact, it is perfect.

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, let me try the next lines here.

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the Posterior Vertebral body line

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me do that in a color that's easier to see, magenta, alright. It looks ok, ok, it looks ok, I mean

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
nothing obvious on that line.

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I would say again that you've got the keen eye, but in this particular case, I'd say it's fine.

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Its within the normal range, as we say.

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Ok, and so let me do the base of those triangles. Let me do, so this is a triangle right over here...

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Again, you want to be a nice smooth curve, everything should fall on that curve...

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this, I would have to be a little bit generous with my curve to make it go to these guys down here.

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly, exactly. And this is the spinal laminar line, this is the third line of alignment, as you can
