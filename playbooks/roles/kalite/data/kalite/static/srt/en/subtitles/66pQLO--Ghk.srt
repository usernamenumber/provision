1
00:00:00,376 --> 00:00:05,186
Where we had left off we had used the information from these two lines to figure out two lines to figure

2
00:00:05,186 --> 00:00:10,369
out two vectors which were really just, almost you can say, were two position vectors lying in this white

3
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:20,036
plane and we took their cross-product to find a vector that's perpendicular, that's normal to this entire white plane

4
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:28,570
and that was the vector d there and vector d will have to sit, especially to visualize it, you can always

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:35,164
position a vector anywhere you want. If you start it at 0, it will clearly sit in that plane. But since

6
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:40,190
you can always position it anywhere, you can say, "Okay, let's start it at 0." So it will sit in this

7
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,104
yellow plane that we defined the equation for. Now we know vector d sits in it, we already know that

8
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:55,301
vector A sits in it. We got that early on in the first video on this problem. So we can take the cross product of d and a to find a normal vector to it

9
00:00:55,301 --> 00:01:01,441
and then using that normal vector and then thinking about what an arbitrary point or an arbitrary vector

10
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:07,637
in this plane might look like, we can then figure out the equation for this yellow plane. We already

11
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:13,037
touched on it a little bit in the Linear Algebra playlist. If any of this stuff makes you confused, then

12
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:17,303
just a reminder- We take the cross product of two vectors in three dimentional space. It will give you

13
00:01:17,303 --> 00:01:22,702
third vector that is perpendicular to both. That's the whole kinda tool that we're using over here. So

14
00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:33,234
lets take the cross product of d and a. So this is going to be equal to. So for the i we have 1 x 4,

15
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:45,376
which is 4 minus 3 x 10, so 4 minus 30 is -26. So we have -26i and then we have negative or minus for

16
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:58,308
j, we have to swap signs for he j, so we have -8 x 4 is -32. -32 minus 2 x 10, so -20 is -52. So we put

17
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:07,110
a -52 here, we can just say positive 52, because it's minus -52, that's the same things as +52j. And

18
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:21,356
finally for the k, cross out that row that column -8 x 3 is -24 minus 2 x 1. So -2 is -26. So -26 k.

19
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:28,369
So this normal vector right here or a vector that is normal to the yellow plane, the plane that we have

20
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:34,500
to find the equation of is this over here. And just because it kinda pops out at me that all of these

21
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,501
are divisible by 26, I'm gonna define another normal vector-- I don't know-- let's call it -- let's call

22
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:54,236
it anything-- let's call it p or let's call it normal 1. Just to show it's a different vector. I'm just

23
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:58,369
going to divide, although it's essentially pointing in the same direction, it has the same direction

24
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:04,708
just different magnitude. I'm just going to divide all of these by -26. So if I divide all of these by

25
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:09,969
-26, I'm just scaling the vector, but it still gonna go in the same direction. That's what I care about. I

26
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:21,100
care about just finding any vector that is normal to this yellow plane right here. I wanna find any vector--I

27
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,301
already found one and now I'm just gonna scale it down so that it's a simpler vector. So if I divide

28
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:39,515
everything by -26, I get i plus or i should say -2j plus k. So that might look something like this right

29
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:46,828
over there. So this is our N1 vector that's normal to this. Now just using this we can now figure out t

30
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:52,724
the equation of this plane right here. So let's just think about it a little bit. Let's just say I ha

31
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:58,159
have a point or I could even say a position vector, (x,y,z) and i know (x,y,z) it sits on this plane

32
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:17,392
and we know that the point (0,0,0) is on the plane, so we also know that the position vector xi+yj+zk

33
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:23,893
have to sit on this yellow plane. And question: I am assuming that (x,y,z) is a point on this plane.

34
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:29,394
I could have put little knots here, just to make sure that this could be a particular point on the plane

35
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:36,292
or this is just any point that I am defining to be on this plane. Now this position vector will then

36
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:44,093
be on this plane and since this vector is normal to this position vector right here or in another way y

37
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:50,090
you can say it's perperdicular or orthogonal. If I were to take the dot product of this, if I were to t

38
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:57,827
take that and dot it with this vector right over here and dot it with that vector right over there. so

39
00:04:57,827 --> 00:05:08,061
So I'll have to take the dot product of that and this. yj+zk. If I take the dot product of these two t

40
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:16,893
things, it has to be equal to zero. If I take the dot product of two vectors that are orthogonal to each

41
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:23,691
other, and by definition these two vectors are. I'm saying this guy is in the plane. This vector we a

42
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:28,893
already figured it out is perperdicular to the plane, which means it's perpendicular, it's orthogonal

43
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:34,561
to everything in the plane. So if we take their dot product it will be equal to zero. So what does that

44
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:43,058
give us? So if we take their dot product, we get x times 1. Let me just to term by term, so we take x t
