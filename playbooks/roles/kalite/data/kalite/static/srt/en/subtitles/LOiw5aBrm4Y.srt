1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,933
What I want to do in this video is dig a little bit deeper into the deficit

2
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:07,000
And just so you can get the data yourself

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,400
they are all available in this document

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,267
which is hosted by the Department of Treasury

5
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:13,600
so you know that I am not making up these numbers

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,333
but just of you, the deficit is really a measure of how much

7
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,400
you are overspending in any given year

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,400
if you look at the deficit

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,000
i am gonna focus on 2010 in this video

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,487
In 2010, the government spent

11
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:30,144
so the spending for the government in 2010

12
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:34,754
was about 3.5 to 3.6 trillion dollars

13
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:39,115
and it brought in, in mainly tax revenues

14
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:41,046
but it has a few other sources

15
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:42,438
mainly tax revenues, it brought in about

16
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:44,554
2.2 trillion dollars

17
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:47,021
so based on this, the overspending

18
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:51,290
or the amount of money which beyond the revenues

19
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:57,467
or the deficit, the deficit in 2010 was 1.3 trillion dollars

20
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:58,995
What I want to be clear on it

21
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:01,518
this is only one way to account for spending

22
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:06,010
verses revenues, and this is not the way most companies

23
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,048
would primarily report their own income over the course of the year

24
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:11,087
or their own cost, or their own lost

25
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:12,479
over the course of the year

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,267
most companies would not just have to account for their

27
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:17,533
cash outlets, that's all we are considering in this

28
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:20,267
3.5 to 3.6 trillion dollars

29
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:23,133
a traditional company would also has to include

30
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:26,000
any other liabilities, any other obligations

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
that they are taking on

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,800
for example, if I hire you and I promise to pay you

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,333
$50,000 over the course of next year

34
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,800
and I am gonna pay them to you in cash

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,733
But I also promised that when you retire,

36
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:39,133
I am gonna pay you $10,000

37
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,800
I am gonna give you a $10,000 per year pension

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,467
In a traditional income statement

39
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:46,867
I would not just expense the $50,000

40
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:49,800
I would definitely put that in my expenses

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,733
and government would put that in their expenses

42
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,733
but I would also have to account for this liability

43
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,267
that I am taking on

44
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:57,200
I would also love to say, look, in order for me to be able to

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,333
afford the $10,000 pension in some future day

46
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:03,200
I have to make some estimates about when you would retire

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,733
and how long you would live, and what interest

48
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:07,200
I can get on money, and all of the rest

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,133
But I have to set aside some of the amounts of money

50
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:12,400
so that in the future I can meet that obligation

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
so maybe I have to set aside $2,000 this year

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
and hope it grows properly

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,933
over the course of the next 20 30 years

54
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:23,467
until you retire, so that I can afford to pay you that much

55
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:26,133
who knows, but I would also have to account for, right here

56
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:29,733
the extra liability, the government, in the calculation of the deficit

57
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,467
is not account for that extra liability

58
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:34,533
And it is taking on other liabilities

59
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:37,667
It is making these pension promises to government employees

60
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:41,067
It has obligations to the veterans, and veterans' affairs

61
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,333
and all of that

62
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,133
and that is not taking account, or that is not accounted for the deficit

63
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:49,067
It is accounted for in the gross cost

64
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:53,400
And you see here, we said, when we look at just the budget

65
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,467
we were talking 3.5 to 3.6 trillion dollars

66
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,533
that's direct cash outlets, mostly direct cash outlets

67
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,933
if you include all of this other stuff

68
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:07,133
then it ballons to 4.5 trillion dollars

69
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:11,467
4.5 trillion dollars, so in previous video that I mentioned,

70
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:14,533
that the government right now, for every dollar it has spending

71
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,400
it has to borrow 40 cents of that dollar

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,800
but if you really think about the total obligations that it has

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,067
the total obligations has to be 4.5 trillion took on

74
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:27,133
view that way, it only has it about half of that

75
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:29,667
it only has it about half of that coming in revenue

76
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,400
so every dollar the government is taking on

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,667
the equal obligations that year

78
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:38,133
some of that is going to express itself in terms of increased debt

79
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,933
and some of that is going to show up as increased obligations

80
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:43,800
and you can see both of those things are increasing

81
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,400
year after year after year

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
And depending on who you talk to

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,800
inside the political spectrum, some people would blame it

84
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,133
on Bush, they will say, look at this, you know

85
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:55,067
the spending increase under Obama

86
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,133
or some of the right would say

87
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,400
some of the left would say, yes, but

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,133
the spending increase, because we have to do all these bailouts

89
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,733
the economy went into the, start to tank

90
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,133
at the end of the 2008

91
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:06,200
we have to do all of these emergency things

92
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,800
as soon as the economy tanks, you automatically

93
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,667
the deficit position gets worse

94
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,733
because you bring in less revenue

95
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,533
And you not only bring in less revenue

96
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,267
because corporate profits are down

97
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:18,067
fewer people are employed, few people start earning less

98
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,333
but you also have higher expenses

99
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,200
because all of these automatic obligations came to effect

100
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,133
unemployment benefits, social security benefits

101
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,733
medicare benefits, those increase

102
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:29,800
so deficit is not actually get worse

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,667
but the whole point here is say regardless of

104
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,333
what party you are on

105
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,867
things are getting worse and

106
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:36,200
they don't seem to be getting better

107
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,133
And generally, you always see this net operating cost

108
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:40,800
sometimes the net operating cost would look lower than

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,467
the actual deficit like in 2008

110
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,400
And that's because there will be some type of

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,667
actual area of accounting

112
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:48,667
re-estimate of the future obligations

113
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,867
maybe the pension obligations, whatever

114
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,533
But in most years, we are taking on more obligations

115
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,667
than just our cash outlets

116
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,000
That's why you see the operating cost

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,467
so much higher than just the pure deficit right over here

118
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,067
And this chart, right over here, actually goes into

119
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,333
what some of those, what the difference is

120
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,067
the actual difference and you see

121
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,667
that is mainly things like liabilities for veterans'

122
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:13,000
compensation, military and civilian employee benefits

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,733
government sponsored enterprises

124
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,933
there's some down division of the tarp, i don't think you can see that

125
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:20,800
So all of a sudden, you realize that tarps gonna cost us

126
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,467
more in the future than you thought it's going to be

127
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:25,667
even though you don't spend that 86 billion this year

128
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,867
you realize that you have an 86 billion higher obligation

129
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:31,933
and so if you add all of these, or i can say,

130
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,067
if you track all of these from the budget deficit

131
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,800
then you are going to get the net operating cost

132
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,533
and that you might already find that depressing

133
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,667
But the point of this video is actually

134
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:43,733
"that's just the beginning"

135
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:46,667
because if you look at where we were going

136
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,800
that you actually get even more depressing

137
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,067
because not only do we have this huge budget deficit

138
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:57,667
or this huge operating cost, this loss, I guess you can say

139
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,267
on an annual basis, but it's gonna get worse

140
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:01,200
it's gonna get worse not just the overspending

141
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,733
not just the overspending on the government's programs

142
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,200
of the defense, and all of that

143
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,533
but because our debt is increasing so much

144
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,133
that the interest, the amount we spend on interest

145
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,667
is only going to incease

146
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:13,733
and that just make matters worse

147
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:15,867
the more you spend on interests, the larger deficits

148
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:18,267
the larger deficits, the more you have to borrow

149
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,133
the more you have to spend on interest

150
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,133
and this is a long time line right here

151
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:25,267
goes out to 2080, but it's pretty clear that something

152
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:27,133
something is going to give

153
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:28,933
so the percentage of the GDP

154
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:32,333
the government, the size of the government has historically

155
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,000
be around this, you know,depending on different periods of

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,667
the history, but in the recent past,

157
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,533
it's been the 20 percent range

158
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,733
but if you just let things go the way they are gonna go

159
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,733
and a lot of these kind of mandatory spending

160
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,400
things we've already obligating ourselves

161
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,867
to what we think we obligate ourselves to

162
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:48,133
it looks like the size of the government is going to take over

163
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:51,400
the economy and it's gonna grow over the next 20 30 years

164
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,467
30% 35% 40% of the entire economy

165
00:06:55,467 --> 00:07:00,667
now if that by itself is not scary or depressing enough for you

166
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,467
then we just have to look at this chart right over here

167
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:06,467
And we've already gone over some of this chart

168
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,800
this is the gross cost, this is the total amount of spending

169
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,800
outlets, cash outlets and other obligations

170
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,200
that we are taking on and accounting for someway

171
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,533
the present, and then you have the taxes

172
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,133
you are bringing in, and you see this is your

173
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,067
net operating cost that we calculated already

174
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:23,733
and then chose your assets, your assets of the government

175
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:26,133
mainly buildings and lands that the government has

176
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,133
a lot of nice land and buildings

177
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:31,467
and you also see a properly plan to the equipment to all

178
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:32,800
that air-craft carriers whatever you want to throw

179
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,667
into the mix right over here

180
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,067
but then you see the debt

181
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,333
and we've done a lot of talk about the debt

182
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,200
you might be saying, wait, even in 2010, they don't

183
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,333
you know, right now, we hit debt ceiling

184
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,800
we have like 14.3 trillion, but didn't we have like

185
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,067
13 point something trillion debt in 2010

186
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,800
why this only say 9 trillion

187
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,333
that's because we have another 4 trillion in debt

188
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,267
that is not held by the public

189
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,933
this is just debt held by the public

190
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:59,467
we have a public clews, things like foreign government

191
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:02,667
but there's another 4 trillion that is held by the government itself

192
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,467
so that is not accounted for

193
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:07,533
and that 4 trillion is mainly excess funds for

194
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:10,133
the social security trust that all invested in treasuries

195
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,667
but the government at the end of the day is responsible for

196
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,800
the social security trust, and so is not accounted for right over here

197
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,400
so you have 9 trillion there

198
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,467
you have another 6 trillion that is seldom talked about

199
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,800
which is benefits for federal employees and veterans

200
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,133
that's right over here, so huge obligation

201
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:29,400
so a total of 16 trillion in liabilities

202
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,133
now that by itself doesn't scare you enough or

203
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,600
doesn't depress you enough

204
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,133
we just have to go down a few lines on the statement

205
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:38,333
and you will see something that does

206
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:42,867
and this right here is the expected or present value of

207
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:48,000
the obligations for social insurance

208
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,267
and the way they talk about social insurance is supposed

209
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,133
social security and things like medicare

210
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:54,333
so these things we've promised we would pay the people

211
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,533
in the future that we told people that we will pay them

212
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:00,400
in the future. And the present value, the easiest way

213
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,733
to think about present value, I've done videos,

214
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,000
I am going to do more depth on that

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
how much money given some assumptions

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,733
if I assume that if I put money aside, that money grows

217
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:10,333
at some rate, how much money would I have to put aside

218
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,800
and in order to fund those obligations

219
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,667
and this values over the next 75 years

220
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,533
And I want to make it clear

221
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,467
75 years is of course gonna be huge number

222
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:23,333
but remember, we are assuming that we can grow money

223
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,400
we are assuming that obligations that are 75 years from now

224
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,067
that if I have to pay someone 10 dollars 75 years from now

225
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,800
I don't have to put 10 dollars aside

226
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,133
I might only have to put 50 cents or dollar aside

227
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:36,733
and assume that 50 cents or dollar will grow

228
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:39,667
by some percentage, so that by the time 75 years go by

229
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,933
I will actually have the 10 dollars

230
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:45,467
this is actually a discounted value

231
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:48,067
this is assuming that money you can set aside today

232
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:51,133
the obligation today that it would grow to actual fulfill

233
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,200
the actual amount you have to pay

234
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,133
and this should scare you

235
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:57,400
these are huge numbers

236
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,333
this close group are what they call the current participants

237
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,067
and we could read the footnotes

238
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:04,667
includes current participants receiving an all

239
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,933
edible benefits for the social security and medicare program

240
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:11,800
ages 50 and over at the start of a 75 year of projection period

241
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,000
so that's 43 trillion than open group

242
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,933
they have current and future participants

243
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,667
this is slightly lower because including people

244
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,800
who are going to be paying into the program

245
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,067
and not necessarily taking out of the program

246
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:26,000
but is still a huge huge liability

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,933
it's twice as big as the official liabilities

248
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:32,215
that the government takes on
