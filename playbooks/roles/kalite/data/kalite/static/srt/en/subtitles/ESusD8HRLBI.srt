1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,390
Welcome to the presentation
on moments.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,680
So just if you were
wondering, I have

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,310
already covered moments.

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,760
You just may not have recognized
it, because I

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,410
covered it in mechanical
advantage and torque.

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,500
But I do realize that when I
covered it in mechanical

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,200
advantage and torque, I think
I maybe over-complicated it.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,100
And if anything, I didn't cover
some of the most basic

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,400
moment to force problems that
you see in your standards

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,900
physics class, especially
physics classes that aren't

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,250
focused on calculus or going
to make you a mechanical

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,850
engineer the very next year.

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,660
So we did that with-- why did
I write down the word

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,980
"mechanical?" Oh yeah,
mechanical advantage.

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,970
If you do a search for
mechanical advantage, I cover

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,730
some things on moments
and also on torque.

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,620
So what is moment of force?

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,850
Well, it essentially is the
same thing as torque.

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,490
It's just another word for it.

21
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,730
And it's essentially force times
the distance to your

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,650
axis of rotation.

23
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,489
What do I mean by that?

24
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,690
Let me take a simple example.

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,870
Let's say that I have
a pivot point here.

26
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:14,210
   

27
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,470
Let's say I have some type
of seesaw or whatever.

28
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,770
   

29
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,260
There's a seesaw.

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,290
And let's say that I were to
apply some force here and the

31
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,750
forces that we care about-- this
was the exact same case

32
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,850
with torque, because there's
essentially the same thing.

33
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,370
The forces we care about
are the forces that are

34
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,910
perpendicular to the distance
from our axis of rotation.

35
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,000
So, in this case, if we're here,
the distance from our

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,830
axis of rotation is this.

37
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,990
That's our distance from
our axis of rotation.

38
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,870
So we care about a perpendicular
force, either a

39
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,220
force going up like that or a
force going down like that.

40
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,490
Let's say I have a force
going up like that.

41
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,830
Let's call that F, F1, d1.

42
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,110
So essentially, the moment of
force created by this force is

43
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,500
equal to F1 times d1, or the
perpendicular force times the

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,990
moment arm distance.

45
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,240
This is the moment
arm distance.

46
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,670
   

47
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,450
That's also often called the
lever arm, if you're talking

48
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,820
about a simple machine, and I
think that's the term I used

49
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,480
when I did a video on
torque: moment arm.

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,590
And why is this interesting?

51
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,810
Well, first of all, this force
times distance, or this moment

52
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,330
of force, or this torque, if it
has nothing balancing it or

53
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,310
no offsetting moment or torque,
it's going to cause

54
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,830
this seesaw in this example to
rotate clockwise, right?

55
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,100
This whole thing, since it's
pivoting here, is going to

56
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,380
rotate clockwise.

57
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,150
The only way that it's not going
to rotate clockwise is

58
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,360
if I have something keep-- so
right now, this end is going

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,500
to want go down like that, and
the only way that I can keep

60
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,320
it from happening is if I exert
some upward force here.

61
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,820
So let's say that I exert some
upward force here that

62
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,880
perfectly counterbalances, that
keeps this whole seesaw

63
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,060
from rotating.

64
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,530
F2, and it is a distance d2
away from our axis of

65
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,930
rotation, but it's going in a
counterclockwise direction, so

66
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,830
it wants to go like that.

67
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,890
So the Law of Moments
essentially tells us, and we

68
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,790
learned this when we talked
about the net torque, that

69
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,910
this force times this distance
is equal to this force times

70
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,500
this distance.

71
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:47,780
So F1 d1 is equal to F2 d2, or
if you subtract this from both

72
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:55,470
sides, you could get F2 d2 minus
F1 d1 is equal to 0.

73
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,820
And actually, this is how we
dealt with it when we talked

74
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,640
about torque.

75
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,060
Because just the convention with
torque is if we have a

76
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,890
counterclockwise rotation, it's
positive, and this is a

77
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,940
counterclockwise rotation
in the example

78
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,260
that I've drawn here.

79
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,750
And if we have a clockwise
rotation, it has a negative

80
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,540
torque, and that's just the
convention we did, and that's

81
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,089
because torque is a
pseudovector, but I don't want

82
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,310
to confuse right now.

83
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,390
What you'll see is that these
moment problems are actually

84
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,709
quite, quite straightforward.

85
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,240
So let's do a couple.

86
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,640
It always becomes a lot easier
when you do a problem, except

87
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,780
when you try to erase
things with green.

88
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,410
So let's say that --
let me plug in real

89
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,070
numbers for these values.

90
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,250
Let me erase all of this.

91
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,210
Let me just erase everything.

92
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,450
There you go.

93
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,170
All right, let me draw
a lever arm again.

94
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,980
   

95
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,290
So what we learned when we
learned about torque is that

96
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,130
an object won't rotate if the
net torque, the sum of all the

97
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,670
torques around it, are zero,
and we're going to apply

98
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,280
essentially that same
principle here.

99
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,250
   

100
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,700
So let's do it with masses,
because I think that helps

101
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,980
explain a lot of things and
makes this seesaw example a

102
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,230
little bit more tangible.

103
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,600
   

104
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,940
Let's say I have a 5-kilogram
mass here, and let's say that

105
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,640
gravity is 10 meters
per second squared.

106
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,480
So what is the downward
force here?

107
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,450
What is the downward force?

108
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,060
It's going to be the mass times
acceleration, so it's

109
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,140
going to be 50 Newtons.

110
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,350
And let's say that the distance,
the moment arm

111
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,570
distance or the lever arm
distance here, let's say that

112
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:47,880
this distance right
here is 10 meters.

113
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,800
Let's say that I have
another mass.

114
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,830
Let's say it's a 25 kilogram--
no, that's too much.

115
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,090
Let's say it's 10 kilograms.
Let's say I have

116
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,490
a 10-kilogram mass.

117
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,590
And I want to place it some
distance d from the fulcrum or

118
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,600
from the axis of rotation so
that it completely balances

119
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,140
this 5-kilogram mass.

120
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,550
So how far from the axis of
rotation do I put this

121
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,390
10-kilogram mass?

122
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,310
This is the distance, right?

123
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,270
Because we actually carry
the distance to the

124
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,720
center of the mass.

125
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,750
Well, how much force
is this 10-kilogram

126
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,400
mass exerting downwards?

127
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,120
Well, it's 10 kilograms times 10
meters per second squared,

128
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,620
it's 100 Newtons.

129
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,540
This is acting what?

130
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,390
This is acting clockwise,
right?

131
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,830
This one's acting clockwise
and this one's acting

132
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,130
counterclockwise, right?

133
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,750
So they are offsetting
each other.

134
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,840
So we could do it a
couple of ways.

135
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,190
We could say that 50 Newtons,
the moment in the

136
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,950
counterclockwise direction, 50
Newtons times 10 meters, in

137
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,890
order for this thing to not
rotate has to be equal to the

138
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,560
moment in the clockwise
direction.

139
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,520
And so the moment in the
clockwise direction is equal

140
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:12,140
to 100 Newtons times some
distance, let's call that d,

141
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,230
100 Newtons times d, and
then we could just

142
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,210
solve for d, right?

143
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,650
We get 50 times 10 is 500.

144
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,730
500 Newton-meters is equal
to 100 Newtons times d.

145
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,740
That's 100.

146
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,970
Divide both sides by 100, you
get 5 meters is equal to d.

147
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,410
So d is equal to 5.

148
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,420
That's interesting.

149
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,950
And I think this kind of
confirms your intuition from

150
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,390
playing at the playground that
you can put a heavier weight

151
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,090
closer to the axis of rotation
to offset a light weight

152
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,790
that's further away.

153
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,530
Or the other way to put it is
you could put a light weight

154
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,040
further away and you kind of get
a mechanical advantage in

155
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,030
terms of offsetting the
heavier weight.

156
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,240
So let's do a more difficult
problem.

157
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,090
I think the more problems we
do here, the more sense

158
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,680
everything will make.

159
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,430
So let's say that we have
a bunch of masses.

160
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:15,450
   

161
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,470
Actually, let's not
do it with masses.

162
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,820
Let's just do it with forces
because I want to

163
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,070
complicate the issue.

164
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,410
So this is the pivot.

165
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,940
And let's say I have a force
here that's 10 Newtons going

166
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,360
in the clockwise direction, and
let's say it is at-- let's

167
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,440
say if this is 0, let's say that
this is at minus 8, so

168
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,190
this distance is 8, right?

169
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:47,820
Let's say that I have another
force going down at 5 Newtons.

170
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,060
And let's say that its
x-coordinate is minus 6.

171
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,980
Let's say I have another force
that's going up here, and

172
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,790
let's say that it
is 50 Newtons.

173
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,790
This might get complicated.

174
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,510
50 Newtons, and it's at minus
2, so this distance

175
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,970
right here is 2.

176
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,750
Let's say that I need to figure
out-- and I'm making

177
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,000
this up on the fly.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,750
Let's say that I have another
force here that is 5 Newtons.

179
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,360
No, let's make it a weird
number, 6 Newtons, and this

180
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,840
distance right here
is 3 meters.

181
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,000
And let's say that I need to
figure out what force I need

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,780
to apply here upwards or
downwards-- I actually don't

183
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,380
know, because I'm doing this on
the fly-- to make sure that

184
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,660
this whole thing
doesn't rotate.

185
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,950
So to make sure this whole
thing doesn't rotate,

186
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,090
essentially what we have to
say is that all of the

187
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,770
counterclockwise moments or all
of the counter clockwise

188
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:49,170
torques have to offset all
of the clockwise torques.

189
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,880
And notice, they're not
all on the same side.

190
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,350
So what are all of the things
that are acting in the

191
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,570
counterclockwise direction?

192
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,790
So counter clockwise
is that way, right?

193
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,850
So this is acting
counterclockwise, this is

194
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,080
acting counterclockwise,
and that's it, right?

195
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,530
So the other ones
are clockwise.

196
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,000
And we don't know this one.

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,210
Let's assume for a second.

198
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,190
We could assume either way.

199
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,680
And if we get a negative, that
means it's the opposite.

200
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,830
So let's assume that this is a--
all of the clockwise ones

201
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,770
I'll do in this dark brown.

202
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,950
Let's assume this is clockwise,
let's assume that

203
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,940
this is clockwise, and let's
assume that our mystery force

204
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,190
is also clockwise.

205
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,380
   

206
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,060
All of the counterclockwise
moments have to offset all the

207
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,340
clockwise moments.

208
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,700
So what are the counterclockwise
moments?

209
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,170
Well, this one's
counterclockwise, so it's 10

210
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,440
Newtons, 10 times its distance
from its moment arm.

211
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
We said it's 8, because it's
at the x-coordinate minus 8

212
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,310
from 0, so it's 10
times 8, plus 50.

213
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:58,360
This is also counterclockwise
times 6, 50 times 6, and those

214
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,840
are all of our counterclockwise
moments and

215
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,340
that has to equal the
clockwise moments.

216
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,880
So clockwise moments,
let's see.

217
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,450
We have 5 Newtons that's going
clockwise times 6.

218
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,560
   

219
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,880
5 Newtons.

220
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,400
Actually, was this 6?

221
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,820
No, if this is 6, I must have
written some other number here

222
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,860
that I can't read now.

223
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,070
How far did I say this was?

224
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,770
Let's say that this is 2.

225
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,840
So that 50, let's say this is
2, it's negative 2, because

226
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,010
that's what it looks like.

227
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,430
I apologize for confusing you.

228
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,650
So what were all the
counterclockwise moments?

229
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,130
This 10 Newtons times its
distance 8, the 50 Newtons

230
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,790
times this distance, 2.

231
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,750
Don't get confused
by the negative.

232
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,890
I just kind of said we're in
the x-coordinate axis or at

233
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,620
minus 8 if this is 0, but it's
8 units away, right?

234
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,810
And this 50, its moment arm
distance is 2 units.

235
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,640
So that has to equal all of
the clockwise moments.

236
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,430
So the clockwise moments
is 5 Newtons times 6.

237
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,760
Its distance is 6 and it's
5 Newtons going in

238
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,720
the clockwise direction.

239
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,170
And then we have plus
6 Newtons times 3,

240
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,690
plus 6 times 3.

241
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,550
And then we're just assuming,
we don't know for sure.

242
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,730
   

243
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,840
Let's say we're applying
the force.

244
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,010
I should have told you
ahead of time so you

245
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,620
could do this problem.

246
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,430
Let's say that we're applying
the force at 10 meters away

247
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,480
from our fulcrum arm.

248
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,140
So force times 10.

249
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,240
So now let's just solve
for the force.

250
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:35,310
We get 80 plus 100 is equal
to 30 plus 18 plus 10F.

251
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:40,950
We get 180 is equal
to 48 plus 10F.

252
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,500
What's 180 minus 48?

253
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:50,350
It's 132 is equal to
10F, or we get F is

254
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,780
equal to 13.2 Newtons.

255
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,530
So we guessed correctly that
this is going to be a-- sorry,

256
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,490
this is going to be a-- I keep
mixing up all of the clockwise

257
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,740
and counterclockwise.

258
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,670
   

259
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,360
This is going to be
a clockwise force.

260
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,540
These were all of the-- sorry,
this is going to be a

261
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,010
counterclockwise force, right?

262
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,040
A clock, this is
counterclockwise.

263
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,140
Let me label that because I
think I said it wrong several

264
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,240
times in the video.

265
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,180
So these go clockwise.

266
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,510
   

267
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,440
And it's this one
and this one.

268
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,650
And what were the
counterclockwise?

269
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,480
These go counterclockwise.

270
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,830
So we have to apply a 13.10
Newton force 10 meters away,

271
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:45,380
which will generate 132
Newton-meters moment in the

272
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,410
counterclockwise direction,
which will perfectly offset

273
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,100
all of the other moments, and
our lever will not move.

274
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,280
Anyway, I might have confused
you with all the

275
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,170
counterclockwise/clockwise.

276
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,940
But just keep in mind that all
the moments in one rotational

277
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,270
direction have to offset all
the moments in the other

278
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,510
rotational direction.

279
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,440
All a moment is is the force
times the distance from the

280
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,260
fulcrum arm, so force times
distance from fulcrum arm.

281
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,570
I'll see you in the
next video.
