1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,638
We now have a trap door for solving Phi. If you know the factorization for N, then finding Phi(N) is easy.

2
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:17,490
For example, the prime factorization of 77 is 7x11. So Phi of 77 is 6x10, 60.

3
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:22,618
Step 3: How to connect the Phi function to modular exponentiation?

4
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:30,994
For this he turned to Euler's theorem, which is a relationship between Phi function and modular exponentiation as follows:

5
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:38,029
m to the power of Phi(n) is congruent to 1 mod n.

6
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:45,123
This means you could pick any 2 numbers, that do not share a common factor, let's call them m and n,

7
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:57,923
say m equals 5 and n equals 8. Now, when you raise m to the power of Phi(n), or 4, and divide by n, you'll always be left with 1.

8
00:00:57,954 --> 00:01:01,829
Now, we just need to modify this equation using 2 simple rules.

9
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,741
1. If you raise the number 1 to any exponent k, you always get 1.

10
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:15,038
In the same way, we can multiply the exponent Phi(a) by any number k and the solution is still 1.

11
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:20,652
2. If you multiply 1 by any number, say m, it always equals m.

12
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:26,694
In the same way we can multiply the left side by m to get m on the right hand side,

13
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:33,281
and this can be simplified as m to the power of k*Phi(n) plus 1.

14
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:41,129
This is the breakthrough. We now have an equation for finding e*d, which depends on Phi(n).

15
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:48,238
Therefore it's easy to calculate d, only if the factorization of n is known.

16
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:57,601
Meaning d should be Alice's private key. It's the trap door, which will allow her to undo the effect of e.

17
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:01,197
Let's do a simple example to see all of this in action.

18
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:07,532
Say Bob has a message he converted into a number using a padding scheme, let's call this m.

19
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:12,446
Then Alice generates her public and private keys as follows:

20
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:20,822
First she generates 2 random prime numbers of similar size and multiplies them to get n, 3127.

21
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:29,412
Then she calculates Phi of n easily, since she knows the factorization of n, which turns out to 3016.

22
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:34,157
Next she picks some small public exponent e,

23
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:38,849
with a condition that it must be an odd number, that does not share a factor with Phi(n).

24
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,830
In this case she picks e equals 3.

25
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,937
Finally she finds the value of her private exponent d,

26
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:55,281
which in this case is 2*Phi(n)+1 divided by 3, or 2011.

27
00:02:55,281 --> 00:03:03,571
Now, she hides everything except the value of n and e, because n and e make up her public key,

28
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:09,197
think of it as an opened lock. She sends this to Bob to lock his message with.

29
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:15,662
Bob locks his message by calculating m to the power of e mod n,

30
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:21,105
call this c, his encrypted message, which he sends back to Alice.

31
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:27,403
Finally, Alice decrypts his message using her private key d accessed through her trap door,

32
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:33,989
c to the power of d mod n equals Bob's original message m.

33
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:41,031
Notice that Eve, or anyone else with c,n and e can only find exponent d,

34
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:46,989
if they can calculate Phi(n), which requires they know the prime factorization of n.

35
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:55,287
If n is large enough, Alice can be sure that this will take hundreds of years even with the most powerful network of computers.

36
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:59,239
This trick was immediately classified after it's publication.

37
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,863
However, it was independently re-discovered at 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman.

38
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:10,030
Which is why it's now known as RSA encryption.

39
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,281
RSA is the most widely used public key algorithm in the world.

40
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:16,943
And the most copied software in the history.

41
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:22,409
Every Internet user on Earth is using RSA or some very in to it whether they realize it or not.

42
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:26,781
It's strength is relies on a hardness of prime factorization.

43
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:31,798
Which is a result of deep questions about the distribution of prime numbers.

44
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:36,631
A question which is remained unsolved for thousands of years.
