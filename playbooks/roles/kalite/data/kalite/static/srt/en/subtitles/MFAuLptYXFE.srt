1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Good morning.

3
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,280
We'll now start.

4
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,860
We're still in the first test,
and we'll now start on Section

5
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,410
9 on page 423.

6
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,090
So let's start with
the first problem.

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,600
Problem number 1.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:31,470
If 5t equals 45, and tk is
equal to 1, what is k?

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,890
Well, 5t equals 45.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,990
This is an easy equation.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,080
You divide both sides by
5, you get t equals 9.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,820
And then you have tk equals 1.

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,320
We know what t is equal to.
t is equal to 9, right?

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,400
So we get 9k is equal to 1.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,532
Divide both sides by 9, you
get k is equal to 1/9.

16
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:53,630
And that is choice B.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,370
That's pretty straightforward.

18
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,520
All right.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,130
Number 2.

20
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,380
I'll switch colors.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,280
   

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,610
It takes 4 complete rotations
of-- it's

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,190
early in the morning.

24
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,420
I can't even read properly.

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,330
It takes 4 complete turns
of a crank to

26
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,510
raise a window 2 inches.

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:24,440
So 4 turns raise the
window 2 inches.

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,770
   

29
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,030
At this rate, how many turns
does it take to raise the same

30
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,990
window 3 and 1/2 inches?

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,360
OK.

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,970
So 4 turns, 2 inches.

33
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,750
Just to simplify things, we
could say, well, that's the

34
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:51,740
same thing as 2 turns
per inch.

35
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,990
Right?

36
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,330
   

37
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,520
2 turns per inch, or you could
even say 1 turn per 1/2 inch.

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,870
But let's just say
2 turns per inch.

39
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,400
I just divided the top by 2.

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,600
If 4 turns to do 2 inches,
it's going to take 2

41
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,740
turns to do 1 inch.

42
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,830
And it wants to know, the same
window, 3 and 1/2 inches.

43
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,170
Actually, when I first
read it, I read it

44
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,070
as 3 and 1/2 feet.

45
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,020
So actually, this isn't that.

46
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,904
So we want to go 3
and 1/2 inches.

47
00:02:21,904 --> 00:02:22,950
It's early in the morning.

48
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,200
My brain is still foggy.

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,440
   

50
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,190
We could actually even
ignore this.

51
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,850
So we can just set this
up as a ratio.

52
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,510
4 turns goes 2 inches,
is equal to x

53
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,440
turns for 3 and 1/2.

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,950
And 3 and 1/2, we could write
that as 3.5, or we could write

55
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,200
that as 7/2.

56
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,770
   

57
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,670
And then we cross multiply.

58
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,750
So 4 times 7/2 is equal to 2x.

59
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,470
And then this cancels
with this.

60
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,343
We have 14 is equal to 2x.

61
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:07,440
x is equal to 7 turns.

62
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,140
And that's choice B.

63
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,580
Sorry for leading you in
the wrong direction.

64
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,320
I thought they said 3 and
1/2 feet at first. OK.

65
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,300
Turn the page.

66
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,360
Number 3.

67
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,730
Image here.

68
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,860
   

69
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,190
I'll switch colors again.

70
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,970
   

71
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,510
Keeps it interesting for
me, at least. OK.

72
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:45,415
If x/y is equal to 2/3, what
is the value of 3x/2y?

73
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:51,470
   

74
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,245
So we know this, and how do
we get the value of this?

75
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:56,680
Well, we could just manipulate
this relationship

76
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,750
algebraically.

77
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,420
So we have 3x/2y on the
left-hand side, and then

78
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,200
whatever we end up on the
right-hand side is our answer.

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,350
So let's see how you do that.

80
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:10,890
So we start off with x/y
is equal to 2/3.

81
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,720
Well, to get here, let's
multiply both sides by 3.

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,110
So if you do a 3 over here,
we have to also multiply

83
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,709
this side by 3.

84
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,910
And then if we multiply both
sides by 1/2-- because this 2

85
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,090
in the denominator is
essentially 1/2-- then you end

86
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,760
up with a 2 here,
and a 2 here.

87
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,040
So now we have 3x and 2y.

88
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,130
And now we have 2
times 3 is 6.

89
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,330
3 times 2 is 6.

90
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,190
That equals 1.

91
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,150
Choice C.

92
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,780
All right.

93
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,250
The next one looks like I
have to do some drawing.

94
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,960
So let me clear this
out a little bit.

95
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,790
   

96
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,040
Number 4.

97
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,060
In the figure above-- let me
draw the figure above.

98
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,570
Looks complicated, huh?

99
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:05,010
So I have one line that goes
straight like this.

100
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,620
I have one line that goes
straight up like this.

101
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,770
   

102
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,400
I have another line that crosses
that line like that.

103
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,740
   

104
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,310
And then I got a bunch
of points.

105
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,070
Let me draw the points.

106
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,550
It takes more time to draw these
than to maybe do them,

107
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,560
although I haven't done
this, so I don't know.

108
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,470
Maybe it will take time.

109
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,500
N.

110
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,304
This is P.

111
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:46,650
This is T, and R, S.

112
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,070
Then I have O.

113
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,940
Then I've got the angle.

114
00:05:51,940 --> 00:06:00,230
They're calling this angle y,
calling this y degrees.

115
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,740
They say this angle here
is 20 degrees.

116
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,700
And they say this is
a right angle.

117
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,240
And they say that this angle
right here is x degrees.

118
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,650
All right.

119
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,690
So let's read what they're
saying now.

120
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,350
In the figure above, PS--
so this is PS-- and TR

121
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,470
intersect at O.

122
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:18,910
Right.

123
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,180
We drew that.

124
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,295
ON is perpendicular to PS.

125
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:25,400
This is my little perpendicular
signal,

126
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,020
looks like an r.

127
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,320
OK.

128
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,070
That's perpendicular.

129
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,690
What is the value
of y minus x?

130
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,940
Interesting.

131
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,650
   

132
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,660
So let me ask you a question.

133
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,640
y is the opposite
angle to what?

134
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,980
If you remember from the
geometry, opposite angles are

135
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,590
equivalent, right?

136
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,430
If I have two lines that
intersect like this, then this

137
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,630
angle is going to be equal
to this angle.

138
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,850
So we know this is y, so what
angle is opposite y?

139
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,610
Well, this angle
is opposite y.

140
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,460
This whole thing.

141
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,240
So what is this angle?

142
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,770
This angle is x degrees plus
this 90 degrees, right?

143
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,260
It's x plus 90.

144
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,570
That's this whole angle.

145
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,570
I added this part of
it plus this part.

146
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,240
That equals this whole angle,
and it's the same thing as y.

147
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,160
And they draw the stuff to
really confuse you, wrote 20

148
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,950
degrees here.

149
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,170
None of that really matters.

150
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,280
So y is going to be equal to
this whole angle, and that

151
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,210
whole angle is going to be equal
to this 90 degrees-- is

152
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,180
equal to this part plus
this part-- plus x.

153
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,900
Subtract x from both sides,
you get y minus

154
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,760
x is equal to 90.

155
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,430
That's it.

156
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,930
That was number 4.

157
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,220
That's choice C.

158
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,880
I do all that and the problem
took too little time.

159
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,630
OK.

160
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,020
Image.

161
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,270
Invert.

162
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,920
   

163
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,340
OK, so here they've
got a schedule.

164
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,800
It's the schedule above,
and hopefully you

165
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,460
have your book open.

166
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,260
I'm on page 424.

167
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,470
In the schedule above, each
session is to be 1 and 1/2

168
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,380
hours long.

169
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,790
Each break is to be 1/4 hour
long, and lunch is

170
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,290
to be 1 hour long.

171
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:12,770
All right.

172
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,760
Session-- oh, boy.

173
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,290
I should just draw this thing.

174
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:24,540
Maybe it'll run into the-- no,
I didn't want to do that.

175
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,410
   

176
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,360
This is my chart.

177
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,610
Three columns.

178
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,940
   

179
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:43,035
I've got this one, and
I've got this one.

180
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:46,180
   

181
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,930
And then I'm going to have one,
two, three, four, five,

182
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,180
six, seven.

183
00:08:50,180 --> 00:09:05,950
   

184
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm going to run out of space.

185
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,210
   

186
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,460
Trying to make this too neat.

187
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,785
   

188
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:16,891
I don't know if I ran
out of space or not.

189
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:20,190
I'll probably have to continue
this in the next video, but

190
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,050
I'll just keep drawing until
the time runs out.

191
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,900
In the next video, it'll
be all set up.

192
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:33,760
So this is the event,
begin time, end.

193
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,220
Actually, I'll just continue
this in the next video.

194
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,490
I don't want to waste your
time drawing this.

195
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,260
I'll draw it, and then
we'll start the next

196
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,220
video on this problem.

197
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,650
See you soon.

198
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:40,900
