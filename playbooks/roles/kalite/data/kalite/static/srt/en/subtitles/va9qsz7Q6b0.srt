1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
   

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,022
We're in problem number seven.

3
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:05,580
Let me switch colors.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,330
The average of the weights
of 14 books is p pounds.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,080
In terms of p, what is
the total weight of

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,470
the books in pounds?

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,620
So this comes up all the
time in the SAT.

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,010
The average of weights of
14 books is p pounds.

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,970
So if you had weight 1, plus
weight 2, plus-- if I were to

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,300
add all 14 books, that's just
the weights of all the 14

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,210
books, and I were to divide
by 14, that is equal to p.

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,310
This is just the definition
of average.

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,690
You add up the weights of all
the books, divide by the

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,680
number of books, and you
get the average.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,500
Well, if you multiply both sides
by 14 you get w1-- you

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,390
get the sum of all of the
weights of the books is equal

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,100
to what? p times 14.

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,760
And what are they asking?

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,080
In terms of p, what is
the total weight

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,970
of all of the books?

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,260
Well, this is the total weight
of all of the books, right?

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,350
I just take the weight of the
first one, plus the weight of

23
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,980
the second one, and keep adding
until I get to the

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,380
weight of the 14th, and that
is equal to p times 14.

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,700
And that is choice E.

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,000
14p.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,770
Choice E.

28
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,860
Next problem.

29
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,110
Problem eight.

30
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:23,036
   

31
00:01:23,036 --> 00:01:24,286
Draw the axes.

32
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:34,990
   

33
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,820
This is x and y.

34
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,190
And then they draw-- let me do
it in a different color.

35
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:47,460
They have point A, which
is 2, negative 1.

36
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,010
So it's 2 comma negative 1.

37
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,970
So this is the point
x is equal to 2.

38
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,560
If we were to go down, this
is y equal negative 1.

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,330
And then they have point
B, which is k,t.

40
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,450
And then they have point C
up here-- C is 2 comma 5.

41
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,080
So it's 2 comma and this is 5.

42
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,530
Point B is the midpoint of AC.

43
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,830
So point B is this
midpoint of AC.

44
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,670
So this distance is the
same as that distance.

45
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,250
What is the value of t?

46
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,190
So what's its y value?

47
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,540
We know what k is, k's going
to have to be 2.

48
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,790
So what's the y value?

49
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,780
So the y value's essentially
just going to be the average

50
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,980
of this y value and that y
value, because it's right in

51
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,380
the middle of the two.

52
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,680
So it's going to be 5
plus minus 1 over 2,

53
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,070
which is equal to what?

54
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,060
That's equal to 4 over 2,
which is equal to 2.

55
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,090
So this point, right here,
is going to be 2 comma 2.

56
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,910
And all I did is I took the
average of the y values.

57
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,610
The other way you could have
thought about it is, what is

58
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,000
this total distance?

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,600
What's the distance from
5 to negative 1?

60
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,010
Well, that's 6.

61
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,435
So this distance would be 3.

62
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:00,330
And what's 5 minus 3?

63
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,690
It's 2 as well.

64
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,340
But the easiest way is just to
average this y value and this

65
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,330
y value, and you'll get the
y value for the midpoint.

66
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,920
And that is choice C.

67
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,170
Next problem.

68
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,160
   

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,100
Problem nine.

70
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,130
So far I didn't have to draw
anything, this is pretty good.

71
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:33,130
If k times 2x plus 3, times x
minus 1 is equal to 0, and

72
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,960
they also tell us that x is
greater than 1, what is the

73
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,370
value of k?

74
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,250
So let's see, if for this times
this, times this to

75
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,770
equal 0, at least one of them
has to be equal to 0.

76
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,530
Maybe more than one,
maybe all of them.

77
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,670
In order for this term to be 0,
what does x have to equal?

78
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,225
Well, for x to be 0 here-- for
this term to be 0, sorry-- x

79
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,470
would have to be equal to 1.

80
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:01,980
How did I get that?

81
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,580
I said x minus 1
is equal to 0.

82
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,640
Add 1 to both sides,
x is equal to 1.

83
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,030
Well, they told us that x
is greater than 1, so x

84
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,490
cannot equal 1.

85
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,460
So this cannot happen.

86
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,910
That cannot happen, because
x is greater than 1.

87
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,050
So we know that this is not 0.

88
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,850
This term is not-- this might
not equal-- that's

89
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,480
not equal to 0.

90
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,830
What has to be a value for
x for this term to be 0?

91
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,630
2x plus 3 equals 0.

92
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,350
Subtract 3 from both sides.

93
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,960
2x is equal to minus 3.

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,500
x is equal to minus 3/2.

95
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,650
Once again, they tell us that
x has to be greater than 1.

96
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,950
If x is greater than 1, we know
that x cannot be minus

97
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,760
3/2, because obviously
this is less than 1.

98
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,750
So once again, we know that this
term does not equal 0.

99
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,650
So if this term doesn't equal 0,
this term doesn't equal 0.

100
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,770
But when I multiply all three
of these terms I get 0.

101
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,420
This k has to equal 0.

102
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,360
This is non-zero, this
is non-zero.

103
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,310
If I'm getting 0 when I multiply
them, k has to be 0,

104
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,150
and that's choice B.

105
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,540
Next problem.

106
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,390
Problem number 10.

107
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,505
Let's see if I have enough
space to do it.

108
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:14,755
I should just clear
it every time.

109
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:17,510
   

110
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,650
If all men in the Williams
family are over 6 feet tall--

111
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,880
that's not true of my family, of
the Khan family; maybe one

112
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,840
day if we eat right-- which
of the following

113
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,060
statements must be true?

114
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,570
If all of the men in the
Williams' family are over 6

115
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,920
feet tall, which of
the following

116
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,490
statements must be true?

117
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,000
Choice A, no man under 6 foot
tall is a member of the

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,180
Williams family.

119
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,650
Sure.

120
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,610
That sounds good to me.

121
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,700
Choice A, no man under 6 feet
tall is a member of the

122
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,850
Williams family.

123
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,730
For example, I am 5 foot 9.

124
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,210
If I was a member of the
Williams family, then the

125
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,030
first statement could not be
have been said, that all men

126
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,795
in the Williams family
are over 6 feet tall.

127
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:03,190
So that makes sense, all men
in the Williams family are

128
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,920
over 6 feet tall.

129
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,750
So that means that no man under
6 foot tall is a member

130
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,010
of the Williams family, because
if there were then you

131
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,930
couldn't have said that all men
in the Williams family are

132
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,810
over 6 feet tall.

133
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,880
That probably required the most
talking and the least

134
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,680
writing on my behalf,
but hopefully that's

135
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,000
a convincing answer.

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,720
Problem 11.

137
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,240
Let me know if it wasn't.

138
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,410
What is the radius of a circle
that has circumference of pi.

139
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:33,820
So we know that circumference
is equal 2 pi r.

140
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,440
And they're telling us that
the circumference is pi.

141
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,870
So pi is equal to 2 pi r.

142
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,660
Divide both sides by 2
pi, you get pi over 2

143
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,980
pi is equal to radius.

144
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,510
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by

145
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,550
pi, you get 1, 1.

146
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,380
So you get 1/2 is equal to the
radius, and that is choice B.

147
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,590
Pretty straightforward, eh?

148
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:05,270
Problem 12.

149
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,950
If y is directly proportional
to x squared and y equals--

150
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,440
OK, so when I say directly
proportional, that means y is

151
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,975
equal to some constant, we don't
know what it is, y is

152
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:18,620
equal to some constant
times x squared.

153
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,150
That's what directly
proportional means.

154
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,540
It means it's some constant
times x squared.

155
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,740
y is directly proportional to
x squared, and y is equal to

156
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,690
1/8 when x is equal to 1/2.

157
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:35,110
So y is equal to 1/8 is equal
to k times when x is 1/2.

158
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,910
So when x is 1/2, that's
all we're saying.

159
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,760
So what does this tell us?

160
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,340
That means that 1/8 is
equal to k times 1/4.

161
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:49,590
Multiply both sides by 4, times
4, you get 4/8 is equal

162
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,570
to k, because this
cancels out.

163
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,890
And 4/8 is the same
thing as 1/2.

164
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:59,880
So the relationship is, y is
equal to 1/2 x squared, and

165
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,720
now what are they asking us?

166
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,200
What is the positive value of
x when y is equal to 9/2?

167
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,786
So they're saying when y equals
9/2, let's solve for x

168
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:10,150
in the positive value.

169
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,130
9/2 is equal to 1/2 x squared.

170
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,870
Multiply both sides by 2,
this 2 cancels here,

171
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,006
this 2 cancels here.

172
00:08:18,006 --> 00:08:19,410
I was multiplying.

173
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,090
So you get 9 is equal
to x squared.

174
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,670
So they want the positive
value of x.

175
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,320
So x is equal to plus
or minus 3.

176
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,100
And they want the positive
value, so x is equal to

177
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,880
positive 3.

178
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,260
And that's choice D.

179
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,510
Choice D.

180
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,710
   

181
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,120
Let me do the next problem
in the next video.

182
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,789
I'll see you soon.

183
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:42,933
