1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,540
Let's do some more percentage problems.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,130
Let's say that I start this year in my stock

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,510
portfolio with $95.00.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:26,000
And I say that my portfolio grows by, let's say, fifteen percent.

5
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,470
How much do I have now?

6
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:40,770
OK.

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,890
I think you might be able to figure this out on your own,

8
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,410
but of course we'll do some example problems, just in case

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,700
it's a little confusing.

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,430
So I'm starting with $95.00, and I'll get rid of

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,080
the dollar sign.

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,900
We know we're working with dollars.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,210
ninety-five dollars, right?

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,390
And I'm going to earn, or I'm going to grow just because

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,160
I was an excellent stock investor, that ninety-five dollars

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,730
is going to grow by fifteen percent.

17
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:11,080
So to that ninety-five dollars, I'm going to add another fifteen percent of ninety-five.

18
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:18,870
So we know we write 15% as a decimal, as 0.15, so 95 plus

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,530
0.15 of 95, so this is times 95-- that dot

20
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,770
is just a times sign.

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,880
It's not a decimal, it's a times, it's a little higher

22
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,790
than a decimal-- So 95 plus 0.15 times 95 is what

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,380
we have now, right?

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,400
Because we started with ninety-five dollars, and then we made

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,610
another fifteen percent times what we started with.

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,930
Hopefully that make sense.

27
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,320
Another way to say it, the ninety-five dollars has grown by fifteen percent.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,920
So let's just work this out.

29
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:55,440
This is the same thing as 95 plus-- what's 0.15 times 95?

30
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,470
Let's see.

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,410
So let me do this, hopefully I'll have enough space here.

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,630
95 times 0.15-- I don't want to run out of space.

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,120
Actually, let me do it up here, I think I'm about to run out

34
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,770
of space-- 95 times 0.15.

35
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:21,720
five times five is twenty-five, nine times five is forty-five plus two is forty-seven, one times ninety-five is

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:29,570
ninety-five, bring down the five, twelve, carry the one, fifteen.

37
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,870
And how many decimals do we have?

38
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,290
one, two.

39
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,660
15.25.

40
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,220
Actually, is that right?

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,240
I think I made a mistake here.

42
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,090
See five times five is twenty-five.

43
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,030
five times nine is forty-five, plus two is forty-seven.

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,490
And we bring the zero here, it's ninety-five, one times five, one times nine, then

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,500
we add five plus zero is five, seven plus five is twelve-- oh.

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,780
See?

47
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,450
I made a mistake.

48
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,250
It's 14.25, not 15.25.

49
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,090
So I'll ask you an interesting question?

50
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,570
How did I know that 15.25 was a mistake?

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,300
Well, I did a reality check.

52
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,830
I said, well, I know in my head that fifteen percent of one hundred is fifteen, so if

53
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:25,790
fifteen percent of one hundred is fifteen, how can fifteen percent of ninety-five be more than fifteen?

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,490
I think that might have made sense.

55
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,780
The bottom line is ninety-five is less than one hundred.

56
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,450
So fifteen percent of ninety-five had to be less than fifteen, so I knew my

57
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,550
answer of 15.25 was wrong.

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,930
And so it turns out that I actually made an addition

59
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,740
error, and the answer is 14.25.

60
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,970
So the answer is going to be ninety-five plus fifteen percent of ninety-five, which is the

61
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:57,560
same thing as 95 plus 14.25, well, that equals what?

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:05,340
109.25.

63
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,550
Notice how easy I made this for you to read,

64
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,910
especially this two here.

65
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,480
109.25.

66
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,990
So if I start off with $95.00 and my portfolio grows-- or the

67
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,420
amount of money I have-- grows by fifteen percent, I'll end

68
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,430
up with $109.25.

69
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,650
Let's do another problem.

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,490
Let's say I start off with some amount of money, and after a

71
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:47,250
year, let's says my portfolio grows twenty-five percent, and after growing

72
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:56,310
twenty-five percent, I now have $one hundred.

73
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,800
How much did I originally have?

74
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,740
Notice I'm not saying that the $one hundred is growing by twenty-five percent.

75
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,270
I'm saying that I start with some amount of money, it grows

76
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:13,770
by twenty-five percent, and I end up with $one hundred after it grew by twenty-five percent.

77
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,000
To solve this one, we might have to break out

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,620
a little bit of algebra.

79
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,470
So let x equal what I start with.

80
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,060
So just like the last problem, I start with x and it grows by

81
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:43,430
twenty-five percent, so x plus twenty-five percent of x is equal to one hundred, and we know this

82
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:52,180
25% of x we can just rewrite as x plus 0.25 of x is equal to

83
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,880
one hundred, and now actually we have a level-- actually this might be

84
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,810
level three system, level three linear equation-- but the bottom

85
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,060
line, we can just add the coefficients on the x.

86
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,340
x is the same thing as onex, right?

87
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,780
So 1x plus 0.25x, well that's just the same thing as 1 plus

88
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,300
0.25, plus x-- we're just doing the distributive property

89
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,950
in reverse-- equals one hundred.

90
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,070
And what's 1 plus 0.25?

91
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,350
That's easy, it's 1.25.

92
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:31,950
So we say 1.25x is equal to 100.

93
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,630
Not too hard.

94
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,760
And after you do a lot of these problems, you're going to

95
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,360
intuitively say, oh, if some number grows by twenty-five percent, and it

96
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,610
becomes 100, that means that 1.25 times that number

97
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,470
is equal to one hundred.

98
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,630
And if this doesn't make sense, sit and think about it a little

99
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,100
bit, maybe rewatch the video, and hopefully it'll, over time,

100
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,610
start to make a lot of sense to you.

101
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,730
This type of math is very very useful.

102
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,890
I actually work at a hedge fund, and I'm doing

103
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,950
this type of math in my head day and night.

104
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:06,650
So 1.25 times x is equal to 100, so x would equal

105
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,670
100 divided by 1.25.

106
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,730
I just realized you probably don't know

107
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,910
what a hedge fund is.

108
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,940
I invest in stocks for a living.

109
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,620
Anyway, back to the math.

110
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,880
So x is equal to 100 divided by 1.25.

111
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,560
So let me make some space here, just because I

112
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,420
used up too much space.

113
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,050
Let me get rid of my little let x statement.

114
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,490
Actually I think we know what x is and we know

115
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,620
how we got to there.

116
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,560
If you forgot how we got there, you can I guess

117
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,570
rewatch the video.

118
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,100
Let's see.

119
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,600
Let me make the pen thin again, and go back to

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
the orange color, OK.

121
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,580
X equals 100 divided by 1.25, so we say 1.25 goes into

122
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,400
100.00-- I'm going to add a couple of 0's, I don't know how

123
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,720
many I'm going to need, probably added too many-- if I

124
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,140
move this decimal over two to the right, I need to move this

125
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,440
one over two to the right.

126
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,400
And I say how many times does one hundred go into one hundred-- how many

127
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,660
times does one hundred and twenty-five go into one hundred?

128
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,520
None.

129
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,410
How many times does it go into one thousand?

130
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,000
It goes into it eight times.

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,120
I happen to know that in my head, but you could do trial

132
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,560
and error and think about it.

133
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,480
eight times-- if you want to think about it, eight times one hundred is

134
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,600
eight hundred, and then eight times twenty-five is two hundred, so it becomes one thousand.

135
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,470
You could work out if you like, but I think I'm running out of

136
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,360
time, so I'm going to do this fast.

137
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,910
eight times one hundred and twenty-five is one thousand.

138
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,590
Remember this thing isn't here.

139
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,360
one thousand, so one thousand minus one thousand is zero, so you can bring down the zero.

140
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,890
one hundred and twenty-five goes into zero zero times, and we just keep getting zero's.

141
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,660
This is just a decimal division problem.

142
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,490
So it turns out that if your portfolio grew by twenty-five percent and

143
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,120
you ended up with $100.00 you started with $80.00.

144
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,640
And that makes sense, because twenty-five percent is roughly one / four, right?

145
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,580
So if I started with $80.00 and I grow by 1/4, that means I

146
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,650
grew by $twenty, because twenty-five percent of eighty is twenty.

147
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,010
So if I start with eighty and I grow by twenty,

148
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,730
that gets me to one hundred.

149
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,010
Makes sense.

150
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,060
So remember, all you have to say is, well, some number times

151
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,940
1.25-- because I'm growing it by 25%-- is equal to 100.

152
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,230
Don't worry, if you're still confused, I'm going to add at
