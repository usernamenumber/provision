1
00:00:00,568 --> 00:00:04,100
Let's think about the different use cases for credit default swaps,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,655
so let's say that I have some company over here

3
00:00:06,655 --> 00:00:10,451
and it's been, it's given a BB credit rating

4
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:14,480
and this rating of course comes from a credit rating agency

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,994
credit rating agency, sometimes called a ratings agency

6
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:22,529
or a rating agency, I've seen it every different way

7
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,095
so this would be like Moody's or Standards & Poor's,

8
00:00:25,095 --> 00:00:26,993
or whatever else. And they say, they look at this company

9
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,868
and they look at it's business, look at it's balance sheet

10
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:32,535
and they say, "Okay, it's not super safe, but it's not super risky either,

11
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:33,898
we give it a BB rating."

12
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:36,326
and let's say that there's an investor over here

13
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:40,147
who wants to lend money to this company

14
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:46,471
so he might lend them some money and get some interest in return

15
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:49,479
but this investor doesn't like this level of safety

16
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,075
he wants to make sure that he's made whole

17
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:54,897
even if this company goes out of business,

18
00:00:54,897 --> 00:00:57,898
so he can go to a writer of a credit default swap.

19
00:00:57,898 --> 00:01:04,009
And the most famous of those credit default swap writers is, or was, AIG

20
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:07,281
And he'll say, "Hey AIG, I'm gonna pay you a little bit every year,"

21
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:09,629
-- you can do that as an insurance premium,

22
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,812
and in exchange, you are essentially going to insure

23
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:18,311
you are going to insure me in the case of a default by this company

24
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,664
Insurance. And what we already said, it's a little bit shady

25
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,729
because AIG, it was not regulated like insurance,

26
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,313
so AIG did not have to set anything aside,

27
00:01:25,313 --> 00:01:29,176
and what was powerful here for AIG is that the rating agencies

28
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:32,676
continued to give AIG a very high rating.

29
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:36,025
So let's say it had a AA rating, so despite the fact

30
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:38,010
that it kept taking on all these liabilities

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,641
the credit rating agencies says, "Hey, we'll still give you a AA,"

32
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:44,661
so they're able to use this AA rating to keep writing these contracts

33
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:47,315
to keep writing insurance, not setting anything aside

34
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,805
and essentially just getting, almost you could view it,

35
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:54,018
free money with eventually having to pay the piper, eventually.

36
00:01:54,018 --> 00:01:57,177
Now, this is one scenario, another scenario is

37
00:01:57,177 --> 00:02:00,399
maybe an investment bank creates some type of special purpose entity

38
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,721
or some collateralized debt obligation right over here

39
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:07,712
and, they have their different tranches,

40
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:11,313
and maybe for the senior tranche over here

41
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:14,293
just so that they can sell them to pension funds

42
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:17,698
who can only buy AA rated debt,

43
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:22,729
pension funds, the investment bank goes to AIG and says,

44
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:27,646
"Hey, can this entity right over here buy credit default swaps?

45
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:32,768
"...can we enter into credit default swap agreeements on you? So that incase any

46
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:36,322
"... of this stuff were to default you will also insure that."

47
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,792
And once we do that, then, a rating agency,

48
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:45,137
so this is a security, this is a senior tranche of a collateralized debt obligation now

49
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:47,607
the senior tranche. And now that that senior tranche

50
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:51,284
is essentially insured by AIG, a credit rating agency

51
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:56,346
once again will assign this a AA rating

52
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:59,911
even though this thing might be made up of a bunch of subprime mortgages

53
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:01,783
and all of the rest, although it is the senior tranche

54
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:05,049
so it will be made whole first, but now pension funds

55
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,808
can buy this type of thing.

56
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:10,535
The last use case, is maybe you have a hedge fund out here

57
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:15,135
Hedge fund out here, who doesn't want to lend anybody

58
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:17,887
any money, but is convinced that about

59
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:21,246
a whole bunch of these companies, maybe this company over here

60
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:25,690
or maybe this company over here, that has some other rating

61
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,696
so this is another company. This hedge fund is convinced

62
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:31,592
that these companies are going to default on their debt,

63
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:34,147
that there's going to be a credit crisis of some kind,

64
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:38,188
well then this hedge fund can enter into a credit default swap agreements

65
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:40,080
Could enter into credit default swap agreements

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,831
to essential get insurance, but not having anything to insure

67
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:48,151
it's like getting car insurance on someone else's driving

68
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:51,147
or someone else's car, and you kind of are starting to hope

69
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,313
that they have a car accident.

70
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:56,209
And because now this guy has a credit default swap

71
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:58,301
on company, on this company right over here,

72
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,545
despite the fact that they didn't lend to them,

73
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:04,011
the hedge fund is going to pay a little bit every year and get the insurance,

74
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:07,373
and they're essentially going to hope that this company

75
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,313
goes out of business, because if it does,

76
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:11,242
then they're going to get the insurance payment

77
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:13,858
they're going to get the same payment that this investor would have

78
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:15,658
but they would have never had to lend the money

79
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:21,504
so you could use it as side bet, you could use it as a way of making

80
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:24,140
lower rated securities all of a sudden acceptable to pension funds,

81
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,606
or you could use it as a straight up way of insuring debt

82
00:04:27,606 --> 99:59:59,999
that you're lending to someone else.
