Part D. Let p4(x) be the fourth-degree Taylor polynomial for f about x=0. Using information from the

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:32,600
graph of y= (f^(5) (x)) shown above,and that's the graph right over here. I put it on the side to save space. Show that the absolute value of (p^4(1/4)- f(1/4)) < 1/3000.

3
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,800
So this seems like quite an interesting problem here. So first let's just think about what they asking.

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,067
They are asking for the difference between the polynomial and the function evaluated 1/4. In other words,

5
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:49,867
they are asking us to, they are asking us to bound the error, the error of the function approximation

6
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:57,000
at, at, at x=1/4. So let me draw a little graph here, just so we can visualize it a little better. So

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,067
that's our y- axis, and let me draw it like this. So this is our y- axis, and this is our x-axis. And

8
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:12,200
our function, lets say our function looks something like this. Our polynomial is centered at zero, our

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,133
fourth- degree polynomial is centered at zero and so it will be equal to the function at zero. And then

10
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:23,733
it will become probably a worse approximation as we get furthur and furthur away from zero. And what

11
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:30,867
they're saying is bound how bad of an approximation that is when x is equal to 1/4. So, if we say, that

12
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:37,667
this is, x is equal to 1/4, right over here. They're saying, "Look take the value of the polynomial at

13
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:43,667
1/4, subtract from that the value of the function at 1/4 and then take the absolute value and that will

14
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:49,467
essentially give us the absolute value of the error, or give us absolute value of the remainder, or the

15
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:55,933
distance between the two functions there," and they want us to bound. They want us to bound that distance.

16
00:01:55,933 --> 00:02:02,333
Now to do this problem there is the something that you just kind of have to know, and I prove it another

17
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,733
series of videos two videos, I think.
