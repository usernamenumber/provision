1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,450
We're on problem 185.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,000
Car x and car y traveled the same 80 mile route.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,020
If car x took 2 hours--

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:26,890
so, x went 80 miles in 2 hours,and that's 40 miles per hour--

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,770
and car y travelled at an average speed

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,040
that was 50% percent faster than the average speed of car x.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,960
So, 50% faster. So y went 50% faster than x.

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,050
50% faster times 40 miles per hour.

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,210
Well that's 40 plus 20.

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,210
That's equal to 60 miles per hour.

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,040
How many hours did it take car y to travel the route?

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,020
So, distance is equal to rate times time.

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,230
80 miles is the distance.

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,930
The rate is 60 miles an hour.

15
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:11,020
So the time is equal to 80/60, which is equal to 1 and 20/60.

16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,020
Which is equal to 1 and 1/3 hours.

17
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,610
And that is what they have there.

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,480
They have choice c.

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,010
I thought they might have 1 hour and 20 minutes written.

20
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,010
Next problem.

21
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,090
186.

22
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,750
If the average of the four numbers k,

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:41,150
2k plus 3, 3k minus 5, and 5k plus 1 is 63,

24
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,880
what is the value of k?

25
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,480
So let's just average the numbers.

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:55,500
k, plus 2k plus 3, plus 3k minus 5, plus 5k plus 1.

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,060
And that was four numbers.

28
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,060
So, divide by 4.

29
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,020
That is equal to 63.

30
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,340
Let's add up all the k's.

31
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,910
I have 1k plus 2k is 3k.

32
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:15,050
So,1k plus 2k is 3k. 6k. 8k. So, I get 8k.

33
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:21,050
And then I get 3 minus 5 is minus 2 plus 1 is minus 1.

34
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,250
And if you multiply the 4 times the 63,

35
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,840
if we just multiply both sides of this equation by 4

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:35,070
you get 4 times 63 is 252.

37
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,800
Let me think about that.

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,000
4 times 60 is 240 plus 12. Yeah, 252.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,550
And then 8k would be-- add 1 to both sides-- 253.

40
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:55,410
And so k is equal to 253 divided by 8.

41
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,110
So that is 8 goes into 253.

42
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,620
8 goes into 25 three times.

43
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,030
24.

44
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,330
Bring down--equals one time. 1 times 8 is 8.

45
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,040
You have a remainder of 5. So, it's 31 and 5/8 is k.

46
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,020
And that is not one of the choices.

47
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,900
Let me see where I made a mistake.

48
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,410
So the average of k.

49
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,840
2k plus 3, 3k minus 5, and 5k plus 1.

50
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,570
That's four numbers, right?

51
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,000
What is the value of k?

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,180
All right, so I add up the four numbers,

53
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,280
and I divide by 4 and they should be equal to 63.

54
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,090
So, maybe I just made a mistake in the simplification.

55
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:46,000
So, I have k plus 2k is 3k, 3k plus 3k is 6k.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,570
Oh, 6k plus 5k is 11k.

57
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,880
I don't know what I was-- that's 11k.

58
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,490
And then you have 3 minus 5 which is minus 2 plus 1.

59
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,080
Minus 1.

60
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,970
So, 11k minus 1. So, this is 11k.

61
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,190
So, k is equal to 253 divided by 11,

62
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:12,370
which is--11 goes into 253 two times.

63
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,940
22, 33.

64
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,920
Oh, that's nicer.

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,000
It goes in exactly 23 times and that's choice D.

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,860
Sorry for the error.

67
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,090
Next question. 187.

68
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,080
If p is an integer, p is even.

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,020
They're telling us q is odd.

70
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,960
Which is the following must be an odd integer?

71
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,010
OK, so they give us a bunch of things.

72
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,570
So, an even times an odd.

73
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,700
Well, by definition, that's going to be even.

74
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,460
Why is that?

75
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,580
Well, you can view it as if you multiply p times q,

76
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,270
if p is even that means that p is divisible by 2, right?

77
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,160
So, if 2 is one of the factors of p,

78
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,000
it's definitely going to be one of the factors of p times q.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,090
So, this one will not be odd.

80
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,020
Let me think about it.

81
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,820
If I add an even plus an odd, that gives me an odd.

82
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,030
So, let's see if any of the choices are that.

83
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,520
Let's see, p divided by q.

84
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,690
An even divided by an odd does not necessarily--

85
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,670
well, this is an interesting one.

86
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,000
2p plus q.

87
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,020
That's choice c.

88
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,990
Now if p is even--

89
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,990
well, it doesn't matter whether p is even or not,

90
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,020
but 2p is actually definitely going to be even.

91
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,620
This is going to be even.

92
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,000
And q, we already know, is odd.

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,070
So, this is an even plus an odd.

94
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,510
So, it's going to be odd.

95
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,410
So, the choice is c.

96
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,980
And we could even prove it a little bit.

97
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,200
If you say that p is equal to 2 times some number k. Right?

98
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,290
We don't know what that is.

99
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,780
We say that q is equal to 2 times some number,

100
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,060
I don't know, m plus 1, then what does this simplify to?

101
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,340
This simplifies to 2 times p, which is 2 times some number k

102
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,390
we don't know what k is--

103
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,030
plus q which is 2 times some number m plus 1.

104
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,590
Some integer m.

105
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,090
So, this becomes 4 times some number k,

106
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,030
plus 2 times some number m, plus 1.

107
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,460
Well, 4 times some number k,

108
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,060
that's the same thing as 2 times some other number n.

109
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,730
You know it's 2 times some other integer

110
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,060
where n is twice what k is, right?

111
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,010
Plus 2m plus 1.

112
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,480
And this is the same thing as 2 times n plus m--

113
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,630
and remember, n,m,k, these are all just integers-- plus 1.

114
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,890
And so, if n and m are integers, then we could say,

115
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,710
well, that's just equal to 2 times some other integer--

116
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,640
let's call it l-- plus 1.

117
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,700
And this would be an odd number.

118
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,810
Because this is even.

119
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,660
And then you're adding 1 to an odd number.

120
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,210
But you didn't have to do that.

121
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,330
You just had to recognize that an odd plus an even

122
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,010
is equal to an odd.

123
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,000
Choice c.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,090
Next problem.

125
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,220
188.

126
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,710
Drum x is 1/2 full of oil.

127
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,940
So x is 1/2 full.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,890
And drum y, which has twice the capacity of drum x,

129
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,040
is 2/3 full.

130
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:39,000
So y is 2/3 full and has two times x capacity.

131
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,600
If all of the oil in drum x is poured into drum y,

132
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,050
then drum y will be filled to what fraction of its capacity?

133
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,400
OK. So if x is 1/2 full.

134
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,820
So x is equal to 1/2 of its--

135
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,370
well, let me think of the best way to write this algebraically.

136
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,570
x is 1/2 full and y is twice as big, right?

137
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,760
So, if you poured all of this 1/2 into y,

138
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,600
it would contribute to 1/4 of y's capacity, right?

139
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,550
I guess another way,

140
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:30,000
we could say capacity of x is equal to 1/2 the capacity of y.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,720
So, if we were to say 1/2 the capacity of x,

142
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,020
if we were to multiply both sides of this by 1/2,

143
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,480
that's equal to 1/4 the capacity of y.

144
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,910
So, this 1/2, that's equal to 1/2 the capacity of x

145
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,030
which is equal to 1/4 the capacity of y.

146
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,670
So, if we add 1/4 of the capacity of y

147
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,480
to 2/3 of the capacity of y--that's 2/3 full,

148
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,900
that's another way of saying 2/3 times the capacity of y--

149
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,370
what do we get?

150
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,910
We get 1/4 plus 2/3 which is equal to--

151
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:09,640
get a common denominator 12-- 3/4 plus 8/12.

152
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,410
3/12 plus 8/12, that's 2/3. You get 11/12.

153
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,410
So, y would be 11/12 full of its capacity.

154
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:26,490
So, that is choice C. That is choice C.

155
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,050
Problem 189.

156
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,480
If x is greater than 0,

157
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:44,020
x/50 plus x/25 is what percentage of x?

158
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,160
So, you get a common denominator.

159
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,470
This is equal to over 50.

160
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,500
x/50 is x/50.

161
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,440
x/25 is 2x over 50. RightŁż

162
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,300
So, that is equal to 3x over 50

163
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,050
which is the same thing as 3/50 x.

164
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,020
And that's the same thing as--

165
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,180
since we want it as a fraction of 100,

166
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,780
since we want to do a percentage-- that's the same thing

167
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,960
as if you multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2,

168
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,100
you get 6 over 100 x

169
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,630
which is equal to .06x which is equal to 6% of x.

170
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,040
And that's choice A.

171
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,050
Anyway. See you in the next video.
