1
00:00:00,871 --> 00:00:02,773
I have these 3 star patches –

2
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:03,668
I guess you could call them –

3
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:04,592
right over here.

4
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:05,513
And so I could say,

5
00:00:05,513 --> 00:00:08,045
"If I had 1 group of 3 star patches,

6
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:10,478
how many star patches do I have?"

7
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:15,320
So I literally have 1 group of 3 star patches.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,524
Well that means that I have 3 star patches.

9
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:18,417
1, 2, 3.

10
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:20,639
This is my 1 group of 3.

11
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:22,699
Now let's make it a little bit more interesting.

12
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:24,933
Let's say that I had 2 groups.

13
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:28,137
Let's say that I had 2 groups of 3.

14
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:29,791
So that's 1 group.

15
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,540
And then here's a second group.

16
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,466
Here's 2 groups of 3.

17
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:37,063
So how many total star patches do I have now?

18
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:41,607
Well I have 2 groups of 3.

19
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:43,420
2 groups of 3.

20
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,038
Or another way of thinking about it is this is 3 + 3.

21
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:54,705
This is equal to 3 + 3, which is equal to 6.

22
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:57,883
So we see 1 × 3. 1 group of 3 is 3.

23
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:02,339
2 groups of 3, (which is literally 2 3's), is 6.

24
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:04,524
Let's make it even more interesting.

25
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:09,564
Let's have 3 groups of 3.

26
00:01:09,564 --> 00:01:13,433
Now what is this going to be equal to?

27
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:15,037
Well it's 3 groups of 3.

28
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:20,641
So I could write this as 3 groups. 3 × 3.

29
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:23,548
And how many of these star patches do I now have?

30
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:27,162
Well this is going to be 3 + 3 + 3.

31
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:30,554
It's going to be 3 + 3 + 3.

32
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:32,713
Notice I have 3 3's.

33
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:34,451
I have 2 3's.

34
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,276
I have 1 3.

35
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:42,420
So this 3 + 3 + 3 is equal to 9.

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,191
And you could count them.

37
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:45,710
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

38
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,449
Or you could just count by 3's.

39
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:49,854
3, 6, 9.

40
00:01:49,854 --> 00:01:52,163
And I think you see where this is going.

41
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:53,616
Let's keep incrementing it.

42
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:55,851
Let's get 4 groups of 3.

43
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:57,825
So let's think about what 4 × 3 is.

44
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:03,928
1, 2, 3, and 4.

45
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:06,679
This right over here is 4 groups of 3.

46
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:12,546
We could write this down as 4 × 3,

47
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:24,042
which is the same thing as 3 + 3 + 3 + 3.

48
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:26,050
Notice I have 4 3's.

49
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,326
1 3, 2 3's, 3 3's, 4 3's.

50
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:34,015
1 3, 2 3's, 3 3's. 4 3's.

51
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:39,155
So we get 3, 6, 9, 12.

52
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:40,658
12.

53
00:02:40,658 --> 00:02:42,148
So what I encourage you to do now ,

54
00:02:42,148 --> 00:02:43,718
now that the video is almost over ,

55
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:44,997
is to keep going.

56
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:48,712
I want you to figure out what 5 × 3 is.

57
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:49,989
5 × 3.

58
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:51,897
And 6 × 3.

59
00:02:51,897 --> 00:02:54,129
And 7 × 3.

60
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,245
And 8 × 3.

61
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:58,676
And 9 × 3.

62
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:01,162
And 10 × 3.

63
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:02,820
And I'll give you a little hint.

64
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,265
You don't always have to draw the star patches.

65
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:05,792
But it's nice to visualize it.

66
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:08,594
We saw that 4 × 3 is literally 4 3's.

67
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:11,736
Well 5 × 3 is going to be 5 3's.

68
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:16,402
So 2 3 4 5.

69
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:17,983
5.

70
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:24,333
– which is equal to 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.

71
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:24,844
15.

72
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,577
So I encourage you to think about

73
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:31,400
what all of these are after this video is done.
