1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,577
So far we looked at open end mutual fund

2
00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:07,756
that can kind of grow and shrink depending on how many investors

3
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:11,836
want to invest in that fund and they can grow by creating new shares

4
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:13,095
and selling those shares to general public

5
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:15,967
and they can shrink because someone who wants their money back

6
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:18,170
goes to the fund and said

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,931
“you have to buy this back from me

8
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:23,910
at the NAV (net asset value) per share.”

9
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:26,587
But the problem with this actually there’s a couple problems

10
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:30,541
is that the manager here has to always keep a little cash

11
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,075
set aside in case some of the investors come to him and say

12
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:38,290
“Hey, I want you to buy my share back. I want liquidity.”

13
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,026
And the other thing that they have to worry about

14
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:42,050
or at least from the investor point of view is

15
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:45,266
they can only buy or sell at the end of the day

16
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:48,705
and that will only happen onnet asset value per share

17
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:52,736
and on top of that the fund manager or whoever is running

18
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,300
the fund has to worry about all of these actually transacting between

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,731
all of these different investors. On the other side of

20
00:00:58,731 --> 00:01:02,679
thing we look at the closed end funds, the closed end funds

21
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:05,552
couldn’t kind of dynamically grow and shrink by creating

22
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:08,238
new shares or by buying them back but what

23
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:11,571
was good about them is that they are freely trading on exchanges

24
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,613
may be on the NASDAQ or New York stock exchange.

25
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:17,861
And because there was non of this kind of back and forth

26
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:21,962
between the fund managers or whoever was a kind of doing

27
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:25,152
the operations of the fund and the investors, they didn’t

28
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,029
have to put cash aside or they didn’t have to have

29
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:30,025
kind of all of the overhead in dealing with the investors.

30
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:32,490
Now, you’re probably saying “well, isn’t there a way

31
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,638
or maybe there’s a way to get the best of both worlds of fund

32
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:39,182
that could grow dynamically, that could create new shares

33
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,669
when there was demand from investors.

34
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,429
But in the same time, those new shares could be

35
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:47,387
traded on an open market and that combination

36
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:49,879
or you can kind of view it as the combination

37
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:55,459
of the due actually exist and they’re called Exchange Traded Funds.

38
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:02,895
Exchange Traded Funds. or ETF for short.

39
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:06,864
And you might say “Hey wait, isn’t a Closed End Funds Exchange Traded?”

40
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:10,744
And it is. These actually do exchange trade hand

41
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:14,351
on the stock exchanges, but these aren’t officially ETF.

42
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:18,904
So someone told you an ETF, the way to think about it is a combination of both.

43
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:22,156
But what it does is, it limits the interactions.

44
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:25,875
So when you have this regular open end mutual fund,

45
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:28,721
any individual investors can come to the fund and say

46
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:31,977
“Here is my share, buy it back from me,” eliminate that share.

47
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:33,587
That creates a lot of ever head here.

48
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:40,344
On an Exchange Traded Funds, only approved people only and these are usually large institutions

49
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:45,833
can go to the fund and say “I want to buy or redeem a big block of shares.”

50
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:48,787
So an Exchanged Traded Funds instead of creating one share at a time,

51
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:53,100
it might create 5,000 or 10,000 or 100,000 shares at a time.

52
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:56,275
And on the other side of a thing, if someone wants to redeem their shares,

53
00:02:56,275 --> 00:03:00,813
they would redeem 5,000, 10,000, or 100,000 shares at the same time.

54
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,859
And what’s good there from the funds point of view is that

55
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:05,832
they don’t have to deal with all of these small transactions,

56
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:09,998
they can do big transactions with big entities so that saves

57
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:14,387
them cost on over head. And since these big people

58
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:19,127
are going kind of buy these big blocks of shares, they can go and sell them

59
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:21,931
in an open market, they can trade them in the open market.

60
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:28,141
So if you want to buy into the ETF instead of buy it directly from the ETF,

61
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:31,705
you would buy it from one of these big institutions that buy big blocks of shares.

62
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:35,922
So they’re now buying, you know a big block of, you know

63
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:41,238
may be a 10,000 shares right over here and will trade in the open market.

64
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:44,469
So you kind of get the best of both worlds.

65
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,710
And in general, ETF also have lower fees.

66
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,177
They have lower fee, one because they don’t have to do all this back and forth

67
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:55,336
between each individual investors and most ETFs are not actively

68
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,264
managed and when I say “actively managed,”

69
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,996
I’m talking about the situation where you had Pete, and Pete said

70
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:04,312
“He’s just an awesome stock figure, he can beat the market,

71
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:06,996
He can you know, do all of you know.

72
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:07,496
He really researched his company and he thinks that

73
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,859
there are some values that he creates by doing that.

74
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:12,648
When something is not actively managed, and Exchanged Traded Funds

75
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:14,562
tend to not be there, saying

76
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:17,531
“Look, we’re just gonna buy the market or we’re just gonna buy some commodity.”

77
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:20,946
So when you go into the Exchanged Trade Funds,

78
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:23,302
you’re really just trying to buy some assets classes,

79
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:28,071
maybe it’s the SNP500, maybe some types of Exchanged

80
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:32,895
Traded Funds that buys gold assets or maybe it’s buying some other type of commodity.

81
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,905
And so because it’s not actively managed,

82
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:37,500
the argument would be that they don’t do as much as managing fees.

83
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,818
So they will have lower fees.

84
00:04:39,818 --> 00:04:42,188
They will have lower fees.

85
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:45,105
So the combination, they can go arbitrary large,

86
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:49,575
and some of the largest Exchanged Traded funds are super huge.

87
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:54,037
They have much lower fees and they have this tradability,

88
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:56,556
you can trade them at any kind of second on the market,

89
00:04:56,556 --> 99:59:59,999
you don’t have to wait until the end of the day like an open end fund.
