1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,986
So say you're Arthur Stone and

2
00:00:01,986 --> 00:00:03,798
you're showing your hexaflexagon to your friend Tuckerman

3
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:06,045
and you already blow his mind by showing him it has 3 sides.

4
00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:07,774
Orange, yellow, pink. orange, yellow, pink.

5
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,125
but now you're about to extra-super-blow his mind

6
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,629
by showing him there is even more colors

7
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:12,425
and he's like, 'wow! Where did the blue side come from?'

8
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,590
but you're having trouble of finding all six. Like,

9
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,000
you know that there is a green side somewhere, but where is it?

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,594
you're like, "OK Tuckerman, I found the green side"

11
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:23,134
It's right in....here. Hmm.

12
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:26,857
Anyway Tuckerman immediately decided that he needs to discover the fastest way to get to all the colors

13
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:29,188
which he called "The Tuckerman Traverse"

14
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:30,982
so you and Tuckerman are working on that

15
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:32,745
And there's hexaflexagons all over the lunch table and then

16
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:35,946
another student is curious about what you're doing and wants to join your committee.

17
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:37,979
His name is Richard Feynman.

18
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:40,998
So stop being Arthur Stone and start being Brian Tuckerman.

19
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:44,605
So you're Tuckerman and you teach Feynman how to make a hexahexaflexagon by first

20
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,531
folding a strip of 18 triangles with a 19th for gluing.

21
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:50,698
You and Stone have just figured out how to number the faces

22
00:00:50,698 --> 00:00:52,787
by dissecting a perfect specimen.

23
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:55,733
You number them 1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2-3

24
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,938
Glue! on one side. Flip it, and:

25
00:00:57,938 --> 00:01:01,991
Glue! 4-4-5-5-6-6-4-4-5-5-6-6-4-4-5-5-6-6 on the other.

26
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:05,162
You coil it around so that you get 1s and 2s and 3s on the outside, like:

27
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:07,461
1-2-2-3-3-1-1-2-2-3-3

28
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:11,069
And then fold THAT around into a hexaflexagon so that all the 2s are on the front.

29
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,261
And then flip it and glue the two "GLUE" parts together, so that all 3s are on the back.

30
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:19,162
Feynman has some trouble flexing it but you show him how to pinch two triangles together and then

31
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,165
push in the opposite side.

32
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:24,196
He somehow still does it wrong and ends up backwards, flexing in reverse.

33
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:27,049
Now he's all intrigued about all the flexing possibilities and you're like

34
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,159
"Let me show you the Tuckerman Traverse!"

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,268
But Feynman, being Feyynman, is like "We must create a diagram!"

36
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:36,122
and Tuckerman is like "Really, it's not that hard-"

37
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:38,887
"NO! Diagram!"

38
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:41,664
So you're Feynman and you've already seen you can cycle from 1 to 2 to 3,

39
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:44,996
So you write that down with arrows and stuff.

40
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:48,692
Or you can go backwards. But from 1, 2, 3 you can also flex the other way, in which

41
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:56,139
1 goes to 6, or 2 to 5, or 3 to 4. And if you did 1 to 6, once you're at 6 you can only flex 1 way because the other doesn't work

42
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:58,140
You HAVE to go to 3. Or backwards, back to 1.

43
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,847
But then you notice that if you go to 3 you can only flex one way and the other

44
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:05,488
is un-open-up-able but before when you're on 3 you can go either to 1 or 4

45
00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:07,284
but now you can only go to 1.

46
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:10,087
And you can go backwards to 6 but not backwards to 2.

47
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:16,026
Which means that this 3 isn't the same 3 as the first 3. Somehow, it's just the same color,

48
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:17,540
but in a different "state".

49
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,715
You show that to your friend, John Tukey, and he's like:

50
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:21,177
"Oh, yeah, that makes sense."

51
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:24,915
And he draws a star in the middle of your 3 and sits back as if that explained everything.

52
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:25,991
So you're like "whatever."

53
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:31,631
and flip it back around to get to the other 3 and check it - the star turns into a...not star.

54
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:35,625
And from this alternate 3 there's this 1-6-3 loop that connects to the main loop at 1,

55
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,971
which is the same 1 as 1 has always been.

56
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,594
But there's a different 1 off of the main 2 in the 2-5-1 loop.

57
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,836
And, of course, everything looks different when you flip it over,

58
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:45,893
And these 3s are also different because they have different numbers on their other side.

59
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:50,878
But you complete a diagram of possibilities, which allows you to find the optimal Tuckerman's Traverse.

60
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,266
You also diagram the original trihexaflexagon, which is pretty simple.

61
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:59,258
The Flexagon Committee approves of your diagram and decides to call them "Feynman Diagrams".

62
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:05,427
Everything is going great - until 1941. Because suddenly there's important war stuff to do and flexagons are largely forgotten.

63
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:10,709
Okay, now fast-forward 15 years and be Martin Gardner. You're an amateur magician,

64
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,414
and you're hanging out at your friend's place, talking about magician stuff.

65
00:03:13,414 --> 00:03:18,058
Anyway, your friend shows you something you've never seen before - a big flexagon he's made out of cloth.

66
00:03:18,058 --> 00:03:22,277
And you're thinking "Hey, this is awesome! maybe other people would like to know about this "flexagon" thing."

67
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:26,000
So you write an article for Scientific American and since you've lended yourself a gig

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,625
writing a regular column about recreational mathematics called "Mathematical Games",

69
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,728
And it's a HUGE success, and it gets hundreds of comments - I mean, letters,

70
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:34,435
And there's nothing else like your column.

71
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:37,966
And all the cool people are inspired by you and you're pretty much THE reason why people

72
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:42,471
know about things like Tangrams and Conway's Game of Life and the works of M. C. Escher,

73
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,684
and other things like that.

74
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:48,503
Now fast forward 50 years and say you're me and the generation of people inspired by Martin Gardner

75
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:51,941
are now inspiring you, so he's your math inspiration grandfather.

76
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:55,796
And now you yourself are in the business of mathematically inspiring people and you want them to be aware of their

77
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:57,576
math inspiration heritage.

78
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:59,857
Okay, now say you are....you.

79
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:03,013
If you think Hexaflexagons are cool that is just column No. 1,

80
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:07,579
And I invite you to joining with the hundreds of people who celebrate Martin Gardner's birthday every October 21st.

81
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:12,223
This year there will be hexaflexagon parties in homes and schools all over the world and if you want to attend

82
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:13,919
our host one, check the description.

83
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,960
I'm celebrating by making these videos, and also, I just like the image of flexagons everywhere.

84
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,537
Floating around lunch tables, falling out of your pockets,

85
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:26,247
Stuck in your head cushions. I like to keep some ready to deploy out of my wallet, or tiny yellow purse,

86
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:28,615
in case of a flexagon emergency.

87
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:32,594
And then there's more recent innovations in flexagon technology and all the cool ways to color them, and

88
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:36,096
other stuff, but that will have to wait until next time.
