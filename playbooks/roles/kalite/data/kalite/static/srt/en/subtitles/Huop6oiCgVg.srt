1
00:00:00,418 --> 00:00:06,039
[piano music playing]

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:09,539
We're on a small hill on a sacred way in the forum of Rome

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,252
and we're looking at the Arch of Titus.

4
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:13,834
It's actually an arch to commemorate Titus.

5
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:18,069
It was built by his brother in honor of the deification of Titus

6
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:21,346
and in honor of his victory in the Jewish Wars.

7
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:23,225
Right, sack of Jerusalem?

8
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:25,765
Yeah, which would have been 70、71 AD,

9
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:29,445
and so this was probably about ten years later or sometime thereafter.

10
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:32,533
So we have a typical triumphal arch form,

11
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:37,084
we have a single arch in the form of a barrel vault.

12
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:42,312
The arch is framed by attached or engaged column.

13
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:43,408
They're actually composites.

14
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:44,756
Look at them, they are Corinthian--

15
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:48,173
they have akanthus leaf, but they're also scrolled.

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,315
So it's sort of an amalgam of Ionic and Corinthian.

17
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:52,308
So it's an invention.

18
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:54,010
We were on the side facing the Colosseum.

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,924
It's likely that only those interior engaged columns

20
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,161
--or parts of those--are original.

21
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:00,540
Right. In fact, this was heavily restored.

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,647
And you have to be very careful

23
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:04,881
because most of what you see when you look at this arch is not original.

24
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:06,253
But it does give us some idea of

25
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:09,945
what a triumphal arch looked like and felt like and its scale.

26
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:14,120
On the inside, we have two important relief sculptures

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,847
showing on one side the Roman army

28
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:19,972
taking the spoils from the temple in Jerusalem.

29
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:22,150
Specifically, including the menorah,

30
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,021
which is really prominently displayed,

31
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,826
both as booty and as a symbol of Rome's victory.

32
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:28,477
Let's go look at that more closely.

33
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,674
So they're carrying the menorah

34
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,492
on their shoulders in a parade--in a procession--

35
00:01:34,492 --> 00:01:37,180
and they're entering into actually an arch

36
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,883
very much in the long tradition of triumphal processions

37
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:44,048
where the booty, the spoils, and the slaves

38
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:46,603
that are being brought from a conquered nation

39
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:48,023
are brought to the city of Rome,

40
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:50,314
for public display, for public humiliation,

41
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:52,790
and as a way of expressing Rome's power.

42
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,681
In terms of its style,

43
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,035
it represents a remarkable sense of naturalism.

44
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:02,469
to the figures, the way the drapery clings to their bodies

45
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:04,449
and shows the form of their bodies

46
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:09,107
and there's an interesting movement and also space.

47
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:14,079
Because the figures that are further away from us are represented in low relief,

48
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:17,502
while the figures that are closer to us are represented in high relief.

49
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:19,658
Their bodies really push out of the wall.

50
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,861
They're getting close to being free-standing figures.

51
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:24,464
And as the figures move through that arch

52
00:02:24,464 --> 00:02:27,919
on the far right going back into space.

53
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,708
And so, there is a remarkable realism, here,

54
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,150
in the treatment of the body and in the treatment of space

55
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,756
and it's a good contrast for what's going to happen

56
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,353
when we get later in the Arch of Constantine

57
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:42,227
where we saw the actual figures that date from the Arch of Constantine,

58
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:44,799
not the stuff Constantine put there from other monuments,

59
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:47,139
but the things that date from the 4th century,

60
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,762
where the figures are represented out of proportion

61
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:51,431
with sort of large heads,

62
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:54,014
and where the draperies are represented in a linear way.

63
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:55,982
Here the drapery looks really three-dimensional

64
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:58,860
and forms itself around the body.

65
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,968
It's interesting that the arch itself is facing the Colosseum,

66
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:07,858
which was in large part founded by the mighty

67
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:10,512
that came into Rome as a result of the sack of Jerusalem.

68
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:13,975
That's right. And so, on the other side,

69
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:15,780
we see the Emperor in a chariot,

70
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,438
being pulled by a team of horses.

71
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:21,431
Again, in that very naturalistic style.

72
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:24,085
I mean the figures stand in lovely contrapposto,

73
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:27,662
some of them are nude or partially nude,

74
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:30,588
and horses look very natural and are moving.

75
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:32,468
But, there is a real sense of heroism through all of the men.

76
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:34,177
You are right there is a wonderful sense of rhythm--

77
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:37,617
the rhythm is represented not only by the four horses pulling the chariot,

78
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,762
which would actually often be represented in bronze

79
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,191
on top of these triumphal arches,

80
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:48,351
but also, the rhythm as constructed by the spears that rise above the crowd.

81
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:51,140
It's really creating a wonderful kind of visual rhythm

82
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,969
that moves across that space.

83
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:56,325
And that's echoed actually quite beautifully

84
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:58,363
by the legs of the horses below.

85
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,557
So that you have this sort of middle band

86
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:03,520
that's quite dense with the bodies of the horses and the bodies of the men.

87
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,319
Then, above that, a series of visual rhythms.

88
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,555
So, we're seeing something that looks as though

89
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:12,149
it's happening in front of us at this moment. Right?

90
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:13,979
The emperor's passing through,

91
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:16,603
the emperor's leading the procession.

92
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:19,356
So there's a real sense of the momentary.

93
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:20,888
It's true, but what's interesting is

94
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:24,203
by the time this arch is being built by Titus's brother,

95
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:26,322
Titus had already been deified,

96
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:28,192
and so he was already a god

97
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:30,745
and had that special significance--that special power.

98
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:33,937
And we do have a kind of mixture of the real and the unreal

99
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:36,270
because we have an allegorical figure of victory.

100
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,960
Waving victory right behind the emperor in the chariot.

101
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,701
So we have this mixture of the real and the allegorical,

102
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,748
and there are two of Titus.

103
00:04:45,748 --> 00:04:53,242
