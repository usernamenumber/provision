1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,278
Let's see if we can write 1.501 as a percentage.

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:10,846
Now, we really just want to write this quantity, as something over 100.

3
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:15,942
So, what we can do is, we can say that this is the same thing as 1.501 over 1.

4
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:22,031
We haven't changed it's value, now let's multiply it times 100 over 100.

5
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:25,048
When we do this product, and I haven't changed the value,

6
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:26,930
this just multiplying something times one.

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,729
But, when we do it we're going to change the way that we're representing it.

8
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:34,800
The denominator now, is going to be 1 times 100, so that's pretty straightforward.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,750
That's just going to be 100.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,352
And then the numerator, we're going to want to multiply 1.501 times 100.

11
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:44,095
And so, this is going

12
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:45,630
If we multiply this times 10,

13
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,346
we would move the decimal one over,

14
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:48,867
we want to be multiplied by hundreds,

15
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:50,186
we want to multiply by 10 again.

16
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:53,348
So we going to more the decimal over to the right twice.

17
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:55,885
We're multiplying it by 10, twice.

18
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:57,515
Or you're multiplying it by 100.

19
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,902
This is multiplying by 10,

20
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:00,200
this is multiplying it by 100.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,245
So this is where the decimals are going to sit now.

22
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:06,381
So we're going to get 150.1

23
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:12,337
And so we've rewritten 1.501 as 150.1 over 100,

24
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:14,699
or 150.1 per 100.

25
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:21,089
Let me write that, 150.1 per... per 100

26
00:01:21,089 --> 00:01:25,502
Which is the same thing as 150.1 per cent

27
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:32,935
Which is the same thing as 150.1%

28
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:33,953
And we're done.

29
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:35,536
And essentially what we are doing

30
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:37,464
- if you really want to simplify the process -

31
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:41,453
we're multiplying this by 100 to get 150.1

32
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:43,700
and then we're saying that is the percentage.

33
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,980
So you wanna make sure that you write % there or the % symbol.
