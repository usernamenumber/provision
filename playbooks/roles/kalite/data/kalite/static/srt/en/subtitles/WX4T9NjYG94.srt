1
00:00:00,629 --> 00:00:05,069
as we've already talked about multiple
times world war one broke out in

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,300
nineteen forty in the beginning of it
was all about austria hungary

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,590
declaring war on serbia using the
assassination of archduke francis

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,830
ferdinand as the pretext for declaring
war on serbia this was in july july

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,570
twenty eighth nineteen fourteen to
declare war on serbia and if you are

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,560
military analyst at the time

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,220
you would have assumed that this would
have been kind of a quick actions and

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,670
this is why frankly are stronger was so
eager to declare war on serbia they

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,100
thought it would be very easy for them
to put the serbians out of commission

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,170
austria hungary

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,730
you're talking about this empire here
huge economy huge military industrial

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,539
complex

13
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:41,649
huge army

14
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,400
serbians much smaller country

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,890
much poorer country they'd also fought
several recent wars they were very

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,780
ill-equipped so any military analyst
with bob that this would be a short war

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,660
but nineteen fourteen did not prove that
way for the austro-hungarian to dissect

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,179
really who could be viewed as a huge
victory

19
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:03,429
a few surprise for the service of the
serbians were able to keep the

20
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:05,290
austro-hungarian spac

21
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,730
serbians

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,780
serbians hold

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,930
now this isn't to say that was an
incredibly incredibly incredibly block

24
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,000
bloody you've had several offensives
across the border into serbia

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,049
the austro-hungarian briefly captured
belgrade the serbian scattered back

26
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,759
in the meantime tens and hundreds of
thousands of folks

27
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,009
or dying

28
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:25,890
but at the end of nineteen fourteen

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,360
you to surprise a military analysts and
the serbians were able to hold despite

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,860
being less equipped

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,750
and and despite just being a uh... a
smaller country

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,930
the lock for the serbians did not hold
up dot well

33
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,730
as we go into nineteen fifteen

34
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,350
by nineteen fifteen other parties other
than the austro-hungarian ps

35
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,240
decide to get involved again get
involved against the serbians

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
in particular

37
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,570
you have the bulgarians that prior to
nineteen fifteen they're kind of trying

38
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,100
to figure out who woodside of the war
they want to fall in on

39
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,830
but they have had several battles or
several wars recently with serbia wanted

40
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,649
as recently as nineteen thirteen they
were here too

41
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,700
captor back some territory

42
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,220
so nineteen fifteen the bulgarians
joined at the war on the side of the

43
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,320
central powers

44
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,160
as we exit nineteen fifteen you have a
joint offensive between the bulgarians

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,069
the austro-hungarian sp and of the
germans

46
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,170
against this small country

47
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,000
against the small country of serbia and
the germans interest other than the fact

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,529
that they want to support their their
ally all stronger the austria

49
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:31,810
there are also either

50
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,799
to take control of the railways between
berlin in constantinople in that railway

51
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:38,830
what did went into

52
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,150
went into serbia

53
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,559
and so if they were able to capture this
take serbia out of the war than they

54
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:49,569
were able to they would be able to send
supplies much more easily to the to the

55
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,200
on him into their other allied

56
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,709
the autumn an empire

57
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,099
so on october of nineteen fifteen

58
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,529
october of nineteen fifteen you have a
joint offensive

59
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:03,049
between the german army this is what
this map right here's to depicting right

60
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,319
over here this is a third austrian army
this is the eleventh german army

61
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,229
this is the first a bulgarian army this
is the second bulgarian army and their

62
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:15,689
joint offensive it's usually successful
for the central powers there so she able

63
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:18,220
to roll into serb it's actually

64
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,400
and press it on the side of the serbians
that took this much force

65
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,090
for to be able to roll through serbia
but they were able to roll through

66
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,979
serbia essentially occupy all serbia

67
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,339
they put the serbian army on the run

68
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:32,209
and and the only redeeming thing is that
some

69
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,919
for the serbians is that some element of
the serbian army

70
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,980
was actually able to escape

71
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,659
through montenegro and albania and and
some of the civilians

72
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:44,870
and then they were transported by the
allies by the entire

73
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,930
to be over crew parade and then joined

74
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,489
as will see on the massive dhoni infront

75
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,309
sun nineteen fifteen

76
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:54,469
nineteen fifteen you have the central
powers

77
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:56,139
central powers

78
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,109
rolled through serbia

79
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,439
role

80
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,659
role

81
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,329
through

82
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:09,439
serbia so from from you know if any of
the right now serbia is essentially lost

83
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,689
now right wing that was happening the
the allies had recognized that serbia

84
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,959
was an adept very difficult situation

85
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,979
and as we will got to the end of
nineteen fifteen they did start the

86
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:20,500
french and british troops

87
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,240
did start to land

88
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,889
did start to land in salon aka right
over here

89
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:27,650
uh... in order to

90
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,069
one would think help

91
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,770
the serbian help of the serbian forces

92
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,860
now they were able to arrive enact in
enough time to prevent what happened and

93
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,099
october of

94
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:40,020
approver of nineteen fifteen

95
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,050
you have some french forces that were
able to essentially distracted the

96
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,500
bulgarian second army bed uh... aidid to
some degree the serbian retreat

97
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,439
but essentially they started to build

98
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,469
they start to build their own forces
right over here in salon ago

99
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:57,479
now this is interesting because we're
talking about this region right over

100
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,949
here and of massive dzone img greece

101
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:03,090
and at this point in the war greece had
st

102
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:03,830
neutral

103
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,399
the king was leaning towards king
constantine the first

104
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,519
he was a leaning towards the central
powers while the prime minister and i

105
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,110
wanna i'm sure i'm going to see this
incredibly

106
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,370
the needs of those

107
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,810
pretty he was leaning towards the allied
parties and so you had started have this

108
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,979
kind of disconnect between the two and
the prime minister resigns but he has

109
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:29,879
got active support especially especially
and kind of massive doni and especially

110
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,530
in massive increase in odyssey

111
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,959
he has support he has support amongst
the allies

112
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,300
so if you go into nineteen sixteen

113
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,370
as you go into nineteen sixteen you have
a coup for vin diesel os

114
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,560
in the mat and nasa do any increase
especially in and round salon aka

115
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,090
which is essentially being held by the
allies even though greece is essentially

116
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,240
as is officially neutral

117
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,789
so coup

118
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,729
crew for

119
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,590
the needs of

120
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,889
the needs of those

121
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:01,180
which leads to a very interesting
situation so after the coup for videos

122
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,840
alos

123
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,420
is actually have greece

124
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,759
kind of massive dorian grease is under
the control of supporters of unease alos

125
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,169
and supporters of the allies

126
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,920
while the rest of greece while the rest
of grease is still

127
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,870
is still loyal to the king and the king
is leaning towards the central powers

128
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,380
but it's not really clear what what what
he wants to do about it

129
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,610
then you get into nineteen seventeen

130
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,249
the allies start to get a little bit
forceful about it in nineteen seventeen

131
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:30,370
the have a blockade

132
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,349
they apply a blockade of southern greece
on c_ blockades are always inflict a lot

133
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:37,099
of hardship economic hardship human
hardship

134
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:42,279
uh... on civilians but this is socially
forces in june

135
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,300
june

136
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,930
of nineteen seventeen

137
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,660
constantine the first

138
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,659
constantine

139
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,030
constantine go

140
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,279
does into exile

141
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,729
and essentially at this point

142
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:58,610
all of greece is under is is kind of
uh... supporting the allies

143
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,599
and agrees

144
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,660
goes on the side of the allies so in
this map right over here that shows kind

145
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,100
of the allied powers

146
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,580
the beyond tog powers and the central
powers greece federated is depicted

147
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,030
as an allied power but it was a neutral

148
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,440
was officially neutral as we go to
nineteen seventy normally after the

149
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,319
overthrow

150
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,140
as only after constantine the first goes
into exile do we have greece formally

151
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,979
formally becoming an ally

152
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:26,069
and so that's that gives us the setup

153
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:26,900
into

154
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,680
nineteen eighteen

155
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,370
so you had to regroup serbian forces in
at this point because the massive dhoni

156
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,060
infront

157
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,769
serbia has been lost to the central
powers

158
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:39,319
you have regrouped serbian forces
epsilon after they've been transported

159

have the british and the french army and

162
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,319
so as we get into september

163
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,289
nineteen eighteen

164
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:55,509

you to remember what's happening on in

165
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,509
the rest of europe at this point you
might remember august of nineteen

166
00:07:58,509 --> 00:07:59,530
eighteen

167
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,080

days offensive that mark to be allied

168
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,960
victory on the western fronts unusual is
already getting in there

169

you had a great morale amongst the
allies you have not so great moa uh...

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,769
morale amongst the the central powers

171
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:18,389
