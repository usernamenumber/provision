1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,310
Let's think about what might
happen to the boiling point or

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,550
the freezing point of any
solution if we start adding

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,860
particles, or we start
adding solute to it.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,470
For our visualization, let's
just think about water again.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,550
It doesn't have to be water.

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,880
It can be any solvent, but let's
just think about water

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,640
in its liquid state.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,100
The particles are reasonably
disorganized because of their

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,150
kinetic energy, but they still
have that hydrogen bonds that

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,340
wants to make them be
near each other.

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,240
So this is in the liquid
state, and they have a

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,740
reasonable amount of
kinetic energy.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,120
You know, each of these
particles is moving in some

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,460
direction, rubbing against each
other, bouncing off of

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,490
each other.

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,910
Now, to move it into the solid
state, or to freeze it, what

18
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,250
has to happen?

19
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,620
The ice has to enter kind of
a crystalline structure.

20
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,710
It has to get pretty organized,
so let's say it has

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,530
to look something like this.

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,610
The water molecules are going
to have a regular structure

23
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,460
where the hydrogen bonds
dominate any kind of kinetic

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,340
movement they want to do, and
all the kinetic movement,

25
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,980
they're just vibrating
in place.

26
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,840
So you have to get a
little bit orderly

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,060
right there, right?

28
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,310
And then, obviously, this
lattice structure goes on and

29
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,150
on with a gazillion
water molecules.

30
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,470
But the interesting
thing is that this

31
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,880
somehow has to get organized.

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,540
And what happens if we start
introducing molecules into

33
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,250
this water?

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,130
Let's say the example of
sodium-- actually, I won't do

35
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:30,750
any example.

36
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,770
Let's just say some arbitrary
molecule, if I were to

37
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,070
introduce it there, if I
were to put something--

38
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,930
let me draw it again.

39
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,350
So now I'll just use that same--
I'll introduce some

40
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,300
molecules, and let's say they're
pretty large, so they

41
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,060
push all of these water
molecules out of the way.

42
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,900
So the water molecules are now
on the outside of that, and

43
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,890
let's have another one that's
over here, some relatively

44
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,860
large molecules of solute
relative to water, and this is

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,890
because a water molecule
really isn't that big.

46
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,310
Now, do you think it's going
to be easier or harder to

47
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,220
freeze this?

48
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,040
Are you going to have to remove
more or less energy to

49
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,199
get to a frozen state?

50
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,979
Well, because these molecules,
they're not going to be part

51
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,690
of this lattice structure
because frankly, they wouldn't

52
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,780
even fit into it.

53
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,990
They're actually going to make
it harder for these water

54
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,495
molecules to get organized
because to get organized, they

55
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:22,500
have to get at the right
distance for the hydrogen

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,330
bonds to form.

57
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,600
But in this case, even as you
start removing heat from the

58
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,000
system, maybe the ones that
aren't near the solute

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,440
particles, they'll start to
organize with each other.

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,020
   

61
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,500
But then when you introduce a
solute particle, let's say a

62
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,740
solute particle is sitting
right here.

63
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,340
It's going to be very hard for
someone to organize with this

64
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,240
guy, to get near enough for
the hydrogen bond to start

65
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,470
taking hold.

66
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,280
This distance would make
it very difficult.

67
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,220
And so the way I think about
it is that these solute

68
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,170
particles make the structure
irregular, or they add more

69
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,710
disorder, and we'll eventually
talk about

70
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,000
entropy and all of that.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,500
But they make it more irregular,
and it's making it

72
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,130
harder to get into
a regular form.

73
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,100
And so the intuition is is that
this should lower the

74
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,960
boiling point or make
it-- oh, sorry,

75
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,780
lower the melting point.

76
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:27,440
So solute particles make you
have a lower boiling point.

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,300
Let's say if we're talking
about water at standard

78
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,870
temperature and pressure or at
one atmosphere then instead of

79
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,390
going to 0 degrees, you might
have to go to negative 1 or

80
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,330
negative 2 degrees, and we're
going to talk a little bit

81
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,800
about what that is.

82
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,400
Now, what's the intuition of
what this will do when you

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,080
want to go into a gaseous
state, when you

84
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,850
want to boil it?

85
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,320
So my initial gut was, hey, I'm
already in a disordered

86
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,390
state, which is closer to what
a gas is, so wouldn't that

87
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,620
make it easier to boil?

88
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,040
But it turns out it also makes
it harder to boil, and this is

89
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,170
how I think about it.

90
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,780
Remember, everything with
boiling deals with what's

91
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,020
happening at the surface, and
we talked about that in our

92
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,160
vapor pressure.

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,980
So at the surface, we said if
I have a bunch of water

94
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:15,390
molecules in the liquid state,
we knew that although the

95
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,000
average temperature might not
be high enough for the water

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,680
molecules to evaporate, that
there's a distribution of

97
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,480
kinetic energies.

98
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,580
And some of these water
molecules on the surface

99
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,070
because the surface ones
might be going

100
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,030
fast enough to escape.

101
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,340
And when they escape into vapor,
then they create a

102
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,510
vapor pressure above here.

103
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,550
And if that vapor pressure is
high enough, you can almost

104
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,910
view them as linemen blocking
the way for more molecules to

105
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,530
kind of run behind them as they
block all of the other

106
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,930
ambient air pressure
above them.

107
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,980
So if there's enough of them and
they have enough energy,

108
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,180
they can start to push back or
to push outward is the way I

109
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,410
think about it, so that more
guys can come in behind them.

110
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,910
So I hope that lineman analogy
doesn't completely lose you.

111
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,210
Now, what happens if you were
to introduce solute into it?

112
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,210
Some of the solute particle
might be down here.

113
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,170
It probably doesn't have much
of an effect down here, but

114
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,290
some of it's going to be
bouncing on the surface, so

115
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,020
they're going to be taking up
some of the surface area.

116
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,310
And because, and this is at
least how I think of it, since

117
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,590
they're going to be taking up
some of the surface area,

118
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,300
you're going to have less
surface area exposed to the

119
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,200
solvent particle or to the
solution or the stuff that'll

120
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,080
actually vaporize.

121
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,820
You're going to have a
lower vapor pressure.

122
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,610
   

123
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,250
And remember, your boiling
point is when the vapor

124
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,020
pressure, when you have enough
particles with enough kinetic

125
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,820
energy out here to start
pushing against the

126
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,340
atmospheric pressure, when the
vapor pressure is equal to the

127
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,800
atmospheric pressure,
you start boiling.

128
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,100
But because of these guys, I
have a lower vapor pressure.

129
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,170
So I'm going to have to add even
more kinetic energy, more

130
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,030
heat to the system in order to
get enough vapor pressure up

131
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,130
here to start pushing back
the atmospheric pressure.

132
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,440
So solute also raises
the boiling point.

133
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,450
   

134
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,230
So the way that you can think
about it is solute, when you

135
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,780
add something to a solution,
it's going to make it want to

136
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,830
be in the liquid state more.

137
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,520
Whether you lower the
temperature, it's going to

138
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,580
want to stay in liquid as
opposed to ice, and if you

139
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,000
raise the temperature, it's
going to want to stay in

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,530
liquid as opposed to gas.

141
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,460
I found this neat-- hopefully,
it shows up

142
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,850
well on this video.

143
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,205
I have to give due credit, this
is from chem.purdue.edu/

144
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:34,820
gchelp/solutions/eboil.html, but
I thought it was a pretty

145
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,690
neat graphic, or at least
a visualization.

146
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,970
This is just the surface of
water molecules, and it gives

147
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,060
you a sense of just how things
vaporize as well.

148
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,090
There's some things on the
surface that just bounce off.

149
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,970
And here's an example where
they visualized sodium

150
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,390
chloride at the surface.

151
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,910
And because the sodium chloride
is kind of bouncing

152
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,120
around on the surface with the
water molecules, fewer of

153
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,880
those water molecules kind of
have the room to escape, so

154
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,050
the boiling point
gets elevated.

155
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,080
Now, the question is by how
much does it get elevated?

156
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,900
And this is one of the neat
things in life is that the

157
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,730
answer is actually
quite simple.

158
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:17,860
The change in boiling or
freezing point, so the change

159
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:24,970
in temperature of vaporization,
is equal to some

160
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:31,120
constant times the number of
moles, or at least the mole

161
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,590
concentration, the molality,
times the molality of the

162
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,200
solute that you're putting
into your solution.

163
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:51,230
So, for example, let's say I
have 1 kilogram of-- so let's

164
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,790
say my solvent is water.

165
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,840
I'll switch colors.

166
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,110
And I have 1 kilogram of water,
and let's say we're

167
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,020
just at atmospheric pressure.

168
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:08,040
And let's say I have some
sodium chloride, NaCl.

169
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,170
And let's say I have
2 moles of NaCl.

170
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,420
I'll have 2 moles.

171
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,670
   

172
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:23,480
The question is how much will
this raise the boiling point

173
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,610
of this water?

174
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:31,070
So first of all, you just have
to figure out the molality,

175
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,299
which is just equal to the
number of moles of solute,

176
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:42,159
this 2 moles, divided
by the number of

177
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,570
kilograms of solvent.

178
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:51,610
So let's say we have 1
kilogram of solvent.

179
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,090
This was, of course, moles.

180
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,820
So our molality is 2
moles per kilogram.

181
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,840
So we just have to figure out
what this constant is, and

182
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,225
then we'll know the temperature
elevation.

183
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:03,430
And actually, that same
Purdue site, they

184
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,510
gave a list of tables.

185
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,146
I haven't run the experiments
myself.

186
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,760
They have some neat
charts here.

187
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,640
But they say, OK water, normal
boiling point is 100 degrees

188
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,200
Celsius at standard atmospheric
pressure.

189
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,740
And then they say that the
constant is 0.512 Celsius

190
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,360
degrees per mole.

191
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,070
So let's just say 0.5.

192
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,320
So it equals 0.5.

193
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,700
   

194
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,950
So k is equal to 0.5.

195
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,430
   

196
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,670
And I want to be very clear here
because this is a very--

197
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,040
I won't say a subtle point, but
it's an interesting point.

198
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,350
So I said that there's 2-- the
molality of-- I just realized

199
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,030
I made a mistake.

200
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,710
I said the molality of
sodium chloride is 2.

201
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,620
2 moles per kilograms. But
that would be if sodium

202
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,940
chloride stayed in this
molecular state, if it stayed

203
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,840
together, right?

204
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,150
But what happens is that the
sodium chloride actually

205
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,790
disassociates, and we learned
all about it in

206
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,430
that previous video.

207
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,750
Each molecule or each sodium
chloride pair disassociates

208
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,810
into two molecules,
into a sodium ion

209
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,430
and a chlorine anion.

210
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,820
And because of that, because
this disassociates into two,

211
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,950
the molality is actually going
to be two times the number of

212
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,670
moles of sodium chloride I have.
So it's going to be two

213
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,730
times this.

214
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,040
So my molality will
actually be 4.

215
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,890
And this is an interesting
point.

216
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,700
If I was dealing with--
and I wrote it here.

217
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,400
So this right here is glucose,
and this is sodium chloride,

218
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,370
or at least sodium chloride
in its crystal form.

219
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,080
One molecule, I guess you can
view it, or one salt of it.

220
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,310
I guess you could just view it
as one of these little pairs

221
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,320
right here.

222
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,780
But the interesting thing is
is you could have the same

223
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,320
number of moles of sodium
chloride when you view it as a

224
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,230
compound and glucose.

225
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,730
But glucose, when it goes into
water, it just stays as one

226
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,460
molecule of glucose.

227
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,990
So a mole of glucose will
disassociate into a mole of

228
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,170
glucose in water.

229
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,950
Well, I guess it won't
disassociate.

230
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,510
It'll just stay as one mole,
while a mole of sodium

231
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,490
chloride will turn into
two moles because it

232
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,480
disassociates.

233
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,890
It turns into two separate
particles.

234
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,780
So in my example, when I start
with a mole of this, I end

235
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:26,910
up-- actually, once I dissolve
it in water, I ended up with 4

236
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,890
moles per kilogram of molality,
because this turns

237
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,280
into two particles.

238
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,600
So given that the molality
is 4 moles.

239
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,240
2 moles of sodium, 2 moles
of chloride per kilogram.

240
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,270
So I just use that constant that
I just got from Purdue.

241
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,100
And I get the change in
temperature is equal to that

242
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:54,910
constant, 0.5, times 4, which
is equal to 2 degrees.

243
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,440
So my boiling point will be
elevated by 2 degrees.

244
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,970
Now, if I had the same number of
moles, if I had 2 moles of

245
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,460
glucose dissolved into my water,
I'd only get half as

246
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,610
much, half as much
of an increase.

247
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,150
Because the molality would
be half as much.

248
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,210
Because it doesn't turn
into two particles.

249
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,720
In some textbooks, you'll
actually see it

250
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,090
written like this.

251
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,990
You'll actually see the same
formula written like change in

252
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,860
boiling temperature, or vapor
temperature, or whatever you

253
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,250
want to think, is equal to k
times m times i, where they'll

254
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,270
say this is the molality
of the compound

255
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,110
you're talking about.

256
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,880
In this case, this number
would be 2, and i is the

257
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,330
number of molecules or the
number of things that it

258
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,640
disassociates into.

259
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,910
So in this case, this
would have been 2.

260
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,520
And that's where we would have
gotten 4 times k, which is

261
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,020
0.5, which is 2.

262
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,180
In the case of water, this would
be-- oh, sorry, in the

263
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,390
case of the glucose, this
would still be 2.

264
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,400
But it only turns into one
particle when it goes in the

265
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,640
water, so that would be 1.

266
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,370
So you would only have a 1
degree increase in the boiling

267
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,370
point of water.

268
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,460
Now, freezing point
is the same thing.

269
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,500
Change in freezing
point is also

270
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,180
proportional to the molality.

271
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,800
And you can either say the
molality of the original

272
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,690
non-in-water compound times
the number of compounds it

273
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,290
disassociates into, although
this k is going to be

274
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,440
different for freezing than
it is for boiling.

275
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,660
Of course, this k changes at
different pressures and for

276
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,370
different elements.

277
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,950
But the really big takeaway is
just to realize that even if

278
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,160
you have a mole of this and a
mole of that, and they're

279
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,810
going to be dissolved into the
same amount of water, because

280
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,160
this dissociates into two
particles and this

281
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,170
disassociates into only one
for every-- or this

282
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,620
disassociates into two moles for
every mole of the crystal

283
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,610
you have-- this doesn't
disassociate; it just stays as

284
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,810
one-- this'll have twice as
large of an effect on the

285
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,300
freezing point change or on the
boiling point elevation

286
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,320
than the glucose will.

287
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,737
