1
00:00:00,716 --> 00:00:06,521
Let's say that I've got two Chuck Norrises (or maybe it's Chuck Norri)

2
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:13,205
and to that I am going to add another three Chuck Norrises

3
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:15,302
So I'm going to add another three Chuck Norrises

4
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:20,204
And this might seem a little bit obvious but how many Chuck Norrises do I now have?

5
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:26,671
Well, two Chuck Norrises - we can represent this as literally a Chuck Norris plus a Chuck Norris

6
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:31,740
So let me do that, a Chuck Norris plus another Chuck Norris - two Chuck Norrises.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,786
You can also view that as 2 times Chuck Norris and this is just another way of representing it

8
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:39,291
And three Chuck Norrises

9
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:45,553
You could view that as a Chuck Norris, plus a Chuck Norris, plus another Chuck Norris

10
00:00:45,553 --> 00:00:50,003
And so we would have a grand total (and this might be very simple for you)

11
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:54,538
But you would have a grand total of 1..2..3..4..5 Chuck Norrises

12
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:57,903
So this would be equal to

13
00:00:57,903 --> 00:01:00,893
5 Chuck Norrises

14
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:02,653
Now let's get a little bit more abstract here

15
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:05,299
Chuck Norris is a very tangible thing

16
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:09,153
So let's go to a little bit more of the traditional algebraic notation.

17
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,955
If I have two X's

18
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:16,371
And remember 2x - you can view this as two X's or two times X.

19
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:21,187
And to that I were to add 3 X's

20
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,309
How many X's do I have?

21
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:27,340
Well, once again, 2 X's that's 2 times X and you can view it as an X plus an X.

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,448
We don't know what the value of X is but whatever that value is we can add it to itself

23
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:35,050
And then three X's are going to be that value

24
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,711
I'll do it in that same green colour

25
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:39,154
Three X's are going to be that value

26
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:40,181
plus that value

27
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:43,849
plus whatever that value is

28
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:46,609
And so how many X's do I now have?

29
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:50,812
Well, I'm going to have 1..2..3..4..5 X's

30
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:56,413
So 2x plus 3x is equal to

31
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:57,091
5x

32
00:01:57,122 --> 00:02:00,283
And if you think about it, all we really did (and hopefully you conceptually get it)

33
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:04,013
We just added the two numbers that were multiplying the X.

34
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:06,227
And these numbers, the two or the three

35
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,198
they're called "coefficients"

36
00:02:07,213 --> 00:02:12,969
Very fancy word - but it's just this constant number, this regular number, that's multiplied by the variable.

37
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:16,749
You just added the two and the three to get your 5x.

38
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:18,826
Now let's think about this a little bit more

39
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:23,247
Let's go back to this original expression, the two Chuck Norrises plus three Chuck Norrises.

40
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:26,367
Let's say, to that we were to add

41
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,866
Let's say we were to add some type of a...

42
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:31,867
Let's say we were to add seven plums over here

43
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,066
So this is my drawing of a plum

44
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:38,135
So we have seven plums plus two Chuck Norrises plus three Chuck Norrises

45
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:40,984
And let's say that I add another two plums

46
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:43,282
I add another two plums here

47
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:45,071
So what would this whole thing be?

48
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:47,846
Well, I wouldn't add the seven to the two to the three plus the two

49
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:49,971
We're adding different things here!

50
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:51,949
You have two Chuck Norrises and three Chuck Norrises

51
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:54,718
So they're still going to simplify to five Chuck Norrises

52
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:57,065
And then we would separately think about the plums

53
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:59,302
We have seven plums and we're adding another two plums

54
00:02:59,302 --> 00:03:01,497
We're going to have nine plums

55
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:04,486
Plus nine plums

56
00:03:04,486 --> 00:03:07,565
So this simplifies to five Chuck Norrises and nine plums

57
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:12,053
Similarly, over here, if I had instead of just 2x plus 3x

58
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:15,368
If I had 7y

59
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:20,215
7y plus 2x plus 3x plus 2y

60
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:22,080
What do I now have?

61
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,868
Well, I can't add the X's and the Y's

62
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:26,430
They could very well represent a different number

63
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,119
So all I can do is really, add the X's (and then I get the 5x)

64
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:31,705
And then I'd separately add the Y's

65
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:34,556
If have seven Y's and to that I add two Y's

66
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:36,724
I'm going to have nine Y's

67
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:40,138
If I have seven of something and I have two of something, I now have nine of that something

68
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:43,176
So I'm going to have nine Y's

69
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:45,225
So you add that (we'll do that in a different colour)

70
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,476
You add this

71
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:48,710
... and this

72
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,324
... you get that

73
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:53,908
You add the X's

74
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:56,490
... you get that right over there

75
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,762
So hopefully that makes a little sense

76
00:03:57,762 --> 00:03:59,207
Actually, I'll throw out one more idea

77
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:01,077
So given this, what would happen if I were to have

78
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:08,681
2x plus 1 plus 7x plus 5?

79
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,977
Well, once again, you might be tempted to add the two plus the one

80
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:12,323
But they're adding different things!

81
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:14,490
These are two X's, this is just the number one

82
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,623
So you really just have to add the X's together.

83
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,184
So you're going to say "well I've got two X's

84
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:21,694
and I'm going to add seven X's to that"

85
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,605
Well that means that I now have nine X's

86
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,997
And then separately, you would say

87
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,128
"Well, I've got just the abstract number one

88
00:04:27,128 --> 00:04:28,597
and then I've got another five"

89
00:04:28,597 --> 00:04:32,597
One plus five is going to be equal to six.
