2
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:06,346
We're at the Musée d'Orsay, and we're looking at

3
00:00:06,346 --> 00:00:11,073
a cast from 1917, the year that Rodin died,

4
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:13,454
of his "The Gates of Hell," which is

5
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:17,997
this huge project that the artist worked on

6
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:19,445
for the last decades of his life,

7
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:20,954
that he never finished. And in fact,

8
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,899
we're not even sure how it fits together,

9
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:26,116
because it was found in pieces in his studio.

10
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:29,696
And so we're looking at a plaster cast, to be specific.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,539
It's impossible to think about doors without thinking about

12
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:36,046
Ghiberti's doors on the Baptistry of the Cathedral of Florence,

13
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:37,951
which were called the "Gates of Paradise,"

14
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:39,204
because they were so beautiful.

15
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:41,381
So this is a modern answer to that, isn't it?

16
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:44,126
Right, because those of course depict Biblical scenes

17
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:45,919
from the Old and New Testament,

18
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:48,871
but here we're really unmoored from that tradition,

19
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:51,145
from that iconography, in many ways.

20
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:52,574
Well, it's a literary tradition, and it's referring back

21
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:54,854
to Dante, but ever so loosely.

22
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,836
So we have Dante at the top there -

23
00:00:56,836 --> 00:00:58,175
- Right, he's in the tympana.

24
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:00,525
You know, that's also a stand-alone sculpture,

25
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:02,618
which is called "the Thinker," and is here

26
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:05,078
Dante, in a sense, gazing into Hell.

27
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:07,369
I think we should actually say, right at the front,

28
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:08,619
that this was a commission,

29
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:12,306
and this was intended to actually be for a building

30
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,422
that was to be on the site of the Musée d'Orsay,

31
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:17,583
which was to be a museum of decorative arts,

32
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,581
which was never built.

33
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:21,002
But this was a commission that Rodin got,

34
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:24,272
and when he had finished the design of the doors,

35
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:26,009
he was ready to cast it, but then

36
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,404
the project itself fell through,

37
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:28,899
so he kept working on it.

38
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:32,766
And in a sense, the sculpture continued to evolve.

39
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:35,893
You do see so many figures that you recognize

40
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:38,367
as stand-alone sculptures by Rodin,

41
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:41,118
but the thing that strikes me most is

42
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,501
just how much the figures emerge

43
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,625
from the "background" of the doors.

44
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,101
And I said "background" sort of in quotes,

45
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:50,373
- And the "doors" should be in quotes!

46
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:51,698
- And the "doors" should be in quotes, right!

47
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:52,699
Because they could never function any more.

48
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:56,108
But it's like, the doors don't even look like solid forms.

49
00:01:56,108 --> 00:02:00,121
They're like vapor from which these forms emerge

50
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,667
and spill out into our space.

51
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:05,793
It's almost as if we imagined the surface of those doors

52
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,697
to be the surface of the ocean,

53
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:09,884
and sort of waves coming forward,

54
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:12,619
and these figures sort of rising and then falling.

55
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:14,914
And there's this sort of constant sense

56
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:16,197
of motion and undulation.

57
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:19,408
In a sense, form taking shape and then

58
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:22,823
form receding into a sort of indistinctness.

59
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:26,093
Almost like a sense of eternal becoming.

60
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:28,078
So, this sort of foment of the creative.

61
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:29,954
But this dark notion, because

62
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:31,922
the stand-alone figures that we're seeing

63
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:33,306
are figures that are tragic.

64
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:35,450
We have Paolo and Francesca,

65
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,903
we have Ugolino,

66
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:39,600
- the figures who Dante finds in Hell,

67
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,701
who are being tortured and punished

68
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:42,899
for their sins on Earth.

69
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:45,225
All the way at the top, instead of angels

70
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:46,297
we have three Shades.

71
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:48,246
These are figures that are actually a repeat.

72
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:50,703
So, it's one figure that's seen three times,

73
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,502
almost sort of cinemagraphic, in a sense,

74
00:02:53,502 --> 00:02:57,166
but creating a kind of unified form with sort of -

75
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,475
- it's a little bit difficult to see from below -

76
00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:00,809
but with shoulders that actually create

77
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:03,893
a flat plateau, and three arms

78
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:04,935
that sort of pull downward,

79
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,300
and pull our eye down into the Gates themselves.

80
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,407
You know, I'm so reminded of Michelangelo

81
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,385
when I look at all of these figures,

82
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:13,836
and the expressive power of the body,

83
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:16,154
especially the male body,

84
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,871
and also the way that some of the forms are fragmented

85
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:22,289
reminds me of looking at ancient Greek and Roman sculpture.

86
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:25,708
So, this is a really modern reinvention of sculpture.

87
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,163
Yes. Clearly informed by Michelangelo,

88
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,778
clearly informed by the classical.

89
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:31,706
But this notion of the fragmented self,

90
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:35,176
this notion of re-use, this notion of reworking -

91
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:36,971
very much a nineteenth century,

92
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:38,811
very much a modern notion.

93
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:40,854
And in a way, I think, the forms,

94
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,956
although derived from the narrative

95
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:47,006
of Dante's "Inferno," really come to take on

96
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:49,664
a kind of more universal significance about

97
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:52,750
the human condition, about suffering,

98
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,705
about sin, about emotion, and the power of the body.

99
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:08,116
