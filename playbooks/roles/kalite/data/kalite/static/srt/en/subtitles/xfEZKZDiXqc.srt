1
00:00:01,046 --> 00:00:01,462
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,462 --> 00:00:04,190
We're now going to be in the
next section, section four in

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,220
our fourth test. And that's
problem one, 594.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,420
Problem one.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:22,462
x minus y is equal to 8. y is equal to 3z. And z is equal to 2. What is x?

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,766
z is equal to 2, y is equal
to 3z, so y is equal to 6.

7
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:34,470
So x minus 6 is equal to
8, or x is equal to 14.

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,796
E.

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,060
I already said z
is equal to 2.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,440
I sometimes forget what I just said. Maybe I'm aging.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,980
Problem number two.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,142
Todd is older than Marta,
but younger than Susan.

13
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:54,320
So, let's say their first
letter is their age.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,423
So let's say Todd is older than
Marta, so his age is greater than Marta.

15
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:08,402
But he's also younger than
Susan, for his age is less than Susan's age.

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,390
Oh I think I did this problem
inadvertantly.

17
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,440
If t, m, and s represent the
ages in years of Todd, Marta,

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,450
and Susan respectively, which
of the following is true?

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,700
And exactly what I
drew is choice A.

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,530
And this comes straight
from their statements.

21
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,067
I literally was just writing
this because I thought they

22
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:25,690
were going to ask something
harder.

23
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,843
But this they're saying Todd is
older than Marta, so t is greater than m.

24
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,605
And Todd is younger than Susan,
so t is less than s,

25
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:35,100
so that's just choice A.

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,570
Problem number three.

27
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,642
If the areas of two regions are
equal,

28
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:46,331
and the sum of the areas of the regions is 5,

29
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:49,760
what is the average of the areas of the two regions?

30
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,670
So area 1 equals area 2. We know that, right?

31
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,420
And we also know that the
sum of the areas is 5.

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,200
So area 1 plus area
2 is equal to 5.

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,757
But then, of course, we know
that area 2 is the same thing as area 1.

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,316
So we also know that area 1
times 2 is equal to 5,

35
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:15,100
or that each of the areas is 2.5.

36
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,630
And area 2 would also be 2.5.

37
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,103
We know that because they're
equal to each other,

38
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:21,460
and when you add them up it's 5.

39
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,450
So they're each going to
be half of that,

40
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,970
so they're each 2 and 1/2.

41
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,905
And they want to know, what is
the average of the areas in the two regions.

42
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,360
Well they're the same
number, right?

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,550
So if you average two of the
same number, the average is

44
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,620
going to be that number.

45
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,140
You could add them and divide
by 2, but you're

46
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,600
going to get 2.5.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,460
And if you look at the
choices, where's 2.5?

48
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,062
Well, 2.5 is the same thing as 2 and
1/2,

49
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:49,320
which is the same thing as 5/2, so it's choice B.

50
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,570
Next problem.

51
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,750
I'll switch colors.

52
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,420
Problem number four.

53
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,733
Let s be the set of all integers
that can be written as

54
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:06,410
n squared plus 1, where
n is a non zero integer.

55
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,947
n is greater than zero, and it is an integer.

56
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:10,160
It is a non zero integer.

57
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,970
Which of the following
integers is an s?

58
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,220
So n squared plus 1.

59
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,130
So let's get a feel
for what it is.

60
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,280
When n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

61
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,890
When n is 1, n squared,
plus 1 is 2.

62
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,410
2 squared plus 1 is 5.

63
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,240
3 squared plus 1 is 10.

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,180
4 squared plus 1 is 17.

65
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,390
It's always going to be one more
than a perfect square.

66
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,980
25 plus 1 is 26.

67
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,100
There's 37, right?

68
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,080
So the choice is, it
has to be one more

69
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,430
than a perfect square.

70
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,370
So which of the following
integers is an s?

71
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,300
So choice A is 16.

72
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,530
16 is a perfect square, but
it's not one more than a

73
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,120
perfect square, right?

74
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,980
Similarly, choice B, 28.

75
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,040
28 minus 1 is 27. That's
not a perfect square.

76
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,350
35 minus 1 isn't a
perfect square.

77
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,150
39 minus 1 isn't a
perfect square.

78
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,290
And if you look at
choice E, 50.

79
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,330
50 minus 1 is 49, which is,
of course, 7 squared.

80
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,832
Actually we would have gotten
there if we had just done one more, right?

81
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,529
7 squared plus 1, 49 plus
1, is equal to 50.

82
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,600
The important thing to realize
is that, the integers in s are

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,890
integers that are one more
than a perfect square.

84
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,500
So you just have to look at the
choices and say, which of

85
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,230
these is one more than
a perfect square?

86
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:35,008
Let's do problem number five.

87
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:40,140
So I have a circle here,
that's my circle.

88
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,070
And it has a triangle
inside the circle.

89
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,180
It looks something-- I try to
draw these as close to what

90
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,640
they drew in the book
as possible.

91
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,447
There's point like that, there's
point like that,

92
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:57,880
and then there's a triangle
that looks like that.

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,110
And they write this is the
center, of course, is o.

94
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,850
They're saying that this
right here is x.

95
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,700
They say that this
right here is y.

96
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,880
And then the question reads, in
the figure above, point o

97
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,640
is the center of the circle.

98
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:21,540
If x is equal to 40 degrees,
what is the value of y?

99
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,270
And you'll be like, how
do I figure this out?

100
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,725
I know the angles of a triangle
add up to 180, and all that,

101
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,000
but they've only
given me one angle,

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,894
and I don't know the angle.

103
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:32,327
Or so you think you don't
know this angle.

104
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:34,280
And whenever you see this,

105
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,540
one of the things that should
immediately enter your mind

106
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,500
when you see this in the SAT is,
the sides of this triangle

107
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,350
are the radius of the circle, right?

108
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,730
It's the radius of the circle, right?

109
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,789
Because every time it gets to the end point,

110
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:47,620
and they actually it draw like that.

111
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,521
So if this is the radius, we know that this side is going to be equal to this side.

112
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,127
Because both of these sides are
the length of the radius of the circle.

113
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,580
And they do this a
lot in the SAT.

114
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,840
If something is a radius of a
circle, it never changes.

115
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,150
Anywhere you draw it, right?

116
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,660
The radius is constant as you
go around the circle.

117
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,880
So if this side is equal to this side,

118
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,020
what do we know happens?

119
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,550
It's an isosceles triangle, and the base angles are equivalent.

120
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,390
So this is y, we also know that this is y.

121
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,873
Because they're the base angles.

122
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:18,200
of -- you know -- they're corresponding angles
to these two sides, right?

123
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,820
They're the base angles
for this triangle.

124
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,280
Now we can solve it.

125
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:29,727
We could say, x, which is 40 degrees, plus y plus y is equal to 180.

126
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,360
Or we could say 40 plus 2y is equal to 180.

127
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,240
2y is equal to 140.

128
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,190
y is equal to 70 degrees.

129
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,212
And that is choice D.

130
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,376
Next problem.

131
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,510
Problem number 6.

132
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,603
A simple square is any integer greater than 1

133
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:58,170
that has only three positive integer factors:

134
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,540
itself, its square
root, and 1.

135
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,580
Which of the following
is a simple square?

136
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,071
It can only have three factors, it can't anything else.

137
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,370
So, for example, if we wrote
all of the perfect squares;

138
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:22,350
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36;

139
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,330
if we write the factors,
this factor only has 1.

140
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,630
This factor has 1, 2 and 1.

141
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,920
This has 1, 3 and 9.

142
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,060
I'm just writing out
all the factors.

143
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,080
1, 2, and 4.

144
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,160
Here would be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.

145
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,390
I'm just doing this
as an example.

146
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,400
You shouldn't do this
on the SAT.

147
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,630
But I want to explain
what they're saying.

148
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,530
All of these numbers are
perfect squares, right?

149
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:54,500
But notice, 16 has itself, 1, and its perfect square, and it has some extra factors.

150
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,717
While these numbers only have
its square root, and themselves, and 1 as factors.

151
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,750
So these are simple squares, right?

152
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,300
So if we look at the choices,
choice A, 121.

153
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,810
121, I know 1 is a factor,
I know that's 11 squared.

154
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,660
I know it's 121.

155
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,400
And I think, other than that,
there's not any other factors.

156
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
It's not divisible by 3.

157
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,900
B is 100.

158
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,170
100's got a ton of factors.

159
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,650
I mean it's got 1,
10, and 100.

160
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:30,930
It also has 2 and 50,

161
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:36,259
it has 4 and 25, it has a ton of factors other than its square root, so it's not choice B.

162
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:39,159
Choice C, 81, same thing.

163
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,990
It could be 1, 1 times 81,
it could be 9 times 9.

164
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,640
Or it could be 27 times 3,
and so forth and so on.

165
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,890
So it's not choice C.

166
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,290
I think A is our prime
contender.

167
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,670
Choice D, 64.

168
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,890
Once again, tons of factors
outside of its square root.

169
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,803
You know, it has 1, 64, and 8, but it also has 2 times 32.

170
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,180
It has -- you know, 4 times 16, and
you could go on.

171
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,810
64 has a ton of factors.

172
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,010
And, finally, choice E.

173
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,790
33.

174
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,070
E doesn't work, because that's
not even a perfect sqaure.

175
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,593
What squared equals 33? I don't know. So that doesn't even work.

176
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,240
So it's definitely choice A.

177
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,080
Next problem.

178
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,820
Actually I only have 40 seconds
left, so I'll do it in the next video.

179
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,479
See you soon.
