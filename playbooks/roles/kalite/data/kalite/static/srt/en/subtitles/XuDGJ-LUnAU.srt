1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,370
We're on problem 141.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,000
On Jane's credit card account,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,580
the average daily balance for a 30 day billing cycle--

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,900
when I see these long paragraphs it starts to give you a

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,050
headache-- the average daily balance for a 30 day billing

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:20,370
cycle is the average of the daily balances at the end of

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,920
each of the 30 days.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,130
OK, so they take the average balance of each of the days

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,430
and then they average it. OK.

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,860
At the beginning of a certain 30 day billing cycle,

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,030
Jane's credit card account had a balance of $600

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,770
at the beginning. What problem is this? 141.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,050
So at the beginning, she had a balance of $600. Fair enough.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,000
Jane made a payment of $300 on the account

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,400
during the billing cycle.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,580
So this is the beginning of the month,

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,210
and then at some point-- this is 30 days later--

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,580
at some point she made a $300 payment.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,720
Fair enough. Continuing.

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,540
If no other amounts were added or subtracted from the account

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,750
during the billing cycle, what was the average daily balance

22
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,560
on Jane's account for the billing cycle?

23
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,870
OK, so I think I'm visualizing this right.

24
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,560
If we say that this is days,

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,000
where this is day 0 and this is day 30.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,570
So essentially, at the end of every day, so at the end of

27
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,250
day 1-- so at the beginning of a certain billing cycle Jane's

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,000
credit card account had a balance of $600.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,030
So we don't know. She might have paid it on day 1.

30
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,390
So I'm not going to put any labels here.

31
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,700
But she starts at 600.

32
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,680
And that's her balance until on some day she pays off half

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,010
of it, and her balance goes down like that.

34
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,170
So the question is, what is the average?

35
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,430
So it's going to be $600 times a certain number of days,

36
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,390
plus $300 times a certain number of days, divided by 30.

37
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,420
So let me write that down.

38
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,140
The average is going to be equal to $600 times however

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,860
many days she carried the $600 balance plus $300 times

40
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,980
however many days she kept the $300 balance.

41
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,360
And that's going to be 30 minus x.

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,420
If she paid after 15 days, she would have had a $600 balance

43
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,150
for 15 days and then she would have had the $300 for the

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,860
remainder of the days.

45
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,270
If she paid after one day, then you would have the $300

46
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,470
balance for 29 days.

47
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,120
And all of that divided by 30. That's the average.

48
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,840
And I try to do that from the get-go, because I just want to

49
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,940
get my algebraic brain around the problem so it

50
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,070
becomes less abstract. So statement number one.

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Let me keep that in the screen.

52
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,330
Statement number one tells us Jane's payment cycle was

53
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,140
credited on the 21st day of the billing cycle.

54
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,000
So that means she had a $600-- that x in this example--

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,570
that she had a $600 balance for 20 days.

56
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,700
And then on the 21st day her balance would have gone to $300.

57
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,120
So the average is going to be equal to $600--

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,460
she had a $600 balance for the first 20 days.

59
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,980
Times 20 plus 300 times the remainder days.

60
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,600
So 300 for 10 days.

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,130
And that's all divided by the number of days.

62
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,960
So statement one, alone, is enough to figure out her

63
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,360
average balance for the month. Statement two.

64
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,900
The average daily balance through the 25th day of the

65
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,050
billing cycle was $540. This is interesting.

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,510
So $540 is the average through the 25th day.

67
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:40,680
So if we average the first 25 days-- so

68
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:47,550
her balance was $600 for x days, plus $300 for the remainder.

69
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:53,000
Only the first 25 days. So it's x minus 25.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,050
So you can actually take this equation and solve for x.

71
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,570
It's actually a linear equation. And I'm sure this time.

72
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,560
Multiply both sides by 25, you get a number.

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,660
And then you can distribute this out.

74
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,010
Add all the x terms. Solve for x.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,450
And then once you solve for x, you can just use this equation

76
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,040
up here to figure out the average daily balance for 30 days

77
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,890
So actually, each of these statements independently are

78
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,480
sufficient to figure out this problem.

79
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,360
Actually, it was very critical that we kind of thought about

80
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,610
in this term from the get-go.

81
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,090
Otherwise this would have been a very hard problem to get

82
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,010
your hand around. But it's interesting.

83
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,080
I, strangely, really like that problem.

84
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,020
Anyway, next problem. 142.

85
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,250
If x is an integer,

86
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:48,010
they're asking is 9 to the x plus 9to the minus x equal to b?

87
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,070
Who knows?

88
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:59,200
Problem one says 3 to the x plus 3 to the minus x is equal to

89
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,930
the square root of b plus 2.

90
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,810
So right from the get-go I don't see-- I mean there's 3's

91
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,840
there's 9's, there seems to be some relationship.

92
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,030
Let's square both sides of this equation,

93
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,010
see if it can reduce to something that's useful here.

94
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,560
So the right hand side is easy.

95
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,580
The left hand side, if you square it you get 3 to the 2x.

96
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,020
And then you get plus 2 times these multiplied by each other.

97
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:32,260
3 to the x, 3 to the minus x plus 3 to the minus 2x is

98
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,070
equal to b plus 2. I just squared both sides.

99
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,080
3 to the x times 3 to the minus x, that just equals 1, right?

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,100
You could add the exponents, that's equal to 3 to the 0.

101
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,590
That equals 1.

102
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,930
Or you could view that as 3 to the x divided by 3 to the x.

103
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,000
Either way, that equals 1.

104
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,720
Then you're left with 2 on both sides of the equation.

105
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,090
So you can get rid of that.

106
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,380
So then we're left with 3 to the 2x plus 3 to the minus 2x

107
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,800
is equal to b.

108
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,250
But then we could rewrite this. Think about this.

109
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,000
3 to the 2x, that's the same thing as 3 squared to the x.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,210
And this is the same thing as 3 to the minus 2 to the x is

111
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,020
equal to b.

112
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,860
And I think now bells are ringing in your head.

113
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,990
3 squared, that's the same thing as 9 to the x plus--

114
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,020
I should do 3 squared to the minus x. That's easier.

115
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,040
Plus 9 to the minus x is equal to b.

116
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,990
So statement number one actually reduced to what we

117
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,010
were trying to prove.

118
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,000
So statement number one, at least alone, is sufficient.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,750
Let's see what statement number two gets us.

120
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:44,420
Statement number two says x is greater than 0 is equal to b.

121
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,960
Let's see. The original was 9 to the x plus 9 to the minus

122
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,110
x is equal to b. So they're now saying that b is equal to 0.

123
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,240
So how does that help us? If b is equal to 0--

124
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,730
let's subtract 9 to the minus x from both sides.

125
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:15,830
You get 9 to the x is equal to minus 9 to the minus x.

126
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:23,590
Now let me multiply both sides by negative 9 to the x.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,380
I just want to make this-- minus 9 to the x times minus

128
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,010
9 to the x. I'm just trying to simplify it.

129
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,520
So what do you have here?

130
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,330
The minus sign, minus 9 to the 2x, right?

131
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,030
Just add the exponents.

132
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,150
Is equal to-- a minus times a minus is a positive--

133
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,010
and then a minus x and a positive x.

134
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,030
Add them together, you get 0. So 9 and 0 is 1.

135
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:59,110
That simplifies to minus 9 to the 2x is equal to 1.

136
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,600
So can this ever be true?

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,060
Let me think about that.

138
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,490
The only way that something that's non 1 or non negative 1,

139
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,930
the only way that when you raise it to a power you can get a

140
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,020
1 is if you raise it to a 0th power.

141
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:30,100
So this is only true if x is equal to 0.

142
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,480
But they tell us that x is greater than 0.

143
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,560
So, actually, this is an interesting case.

144
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,240
Using the information they gave us in problem number two--

145
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,860
I just want to make sure I'm not missing something.

146
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,830
Statement one was sufficient. Can we prove--

147
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,490
well,we don't have enough information to prove the statement.

148
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,300
We have enough information to disprove the statement but not

149
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,850
to prove it. So I'm going to stick with a.

150
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,820
I was going to say that we can say whether the statement is

151
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,080
true or false, but we definitely don't have enough

152
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,880
information with just statement b to prove--

153
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,070
so they want to know, right.

154
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,010
You have to be able to prove the statement is true.

155
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,160
Statement two actually proves that it is false.

156
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,180
It doesn't prove that it's true.

157
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,350
It answers the question but says no. So statement one, alone,

158
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,670
is sufficient to say that that statement is true.

159
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,060
And I'll continue in the next video.
