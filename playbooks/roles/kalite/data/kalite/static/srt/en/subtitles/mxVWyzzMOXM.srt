1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,450
In the last video we talked
about the scenario where a

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,230
company, for whatever reason,
it just couldn't

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,200
pay it's debt holders.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,880
So let's say these are debt
holders right here.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,690
This is the debt, or
the liabilities.

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,250
It couldn't pay it's
debt holders.

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,510
It went into bankruptcy, and it
was determined that these

8
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,040
assets that it had right here,
that it made no sense

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,440
operating them as a company.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,880
And then the bankruptcy court
essentially just decided to

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,850
liquidate it.

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,840
And we learned that the debt
holders were actually more

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,130
senior to the equity holders.

14
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,670
And they get paid first. And if
there wasn't enough money

15
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,840
to pay all of the debt holders,
then the equity

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,380
holders got nothing.

17
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,750
And that was called
a Chapter 7.

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,700
We're just focusing on the
corporate world right now.

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,790
Maybe we'll do personal soon.

20
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,230
So that's Chapter
7 liquidation.

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,290
That was the last video.

22
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,120
And in that case, and I think
that's what most people

23
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,140
associate when you say that a
company has gone bankrupt.

24
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,310
That it'll just disappear.

25
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,820
That people just say,
OK, these assets

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,560
don't make any sense.

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,830
They can't pay these guys.

28
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,440
We're just going to take these
into possession by the courts

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,660
and then just liquidate
the assets.

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,290
But that raises kind of an
obvious question of, well,

31
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,220
what if these assets are
worth something?

32
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,600
What if I sell a socks website,
and socks have gotten

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,940
even more popular.

34
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,770
And the only problem is I just
can't pay all of the interest

35
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,060
that I owe on the debt.

36
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,330
Right?

37
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,120
Maybe, for whatever reason, I
took out a really crazy loan

38
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,520
that was variable rate.

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,950
Or for some reason, I have to
pay back some loans because I

40
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,310
messed-- and I'll talk
more about covenants

41
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:27,870
and things like that.

42
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,470
Covenants are pretty much a
bunch of rules that the debt

43
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,220
holders say, look, you're good,
but if any of these x,

44
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,190
y, or z things happen, we can
take you into bankruptcy.

45
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,070
And we could force you
into bankruptcy.

46
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,760
So maybe because of that,
I'm in bankruptcy.

47
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,730
But it's determined that these
assets, right here, are

48
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,690
actually worth more as an
operating entity than they are

49
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,120
if you were to liquidate them.

50
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,370
A good example might be, I don't
know, a car company.

51
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,490
Right?

52
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,345
Let's actually take this example
as a car company,

53
00:01:55,345 --> 00:02:00,860
because it's very salient to
our, at least it was-- I've

54
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,050
heard a lot less about the auto
bailouts, but it was very

55
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,950
salient at the end
of last year.

56
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,509
So let's say that these are
car factories and land and

57
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,560
whatever else.

58
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,180
And if we're the debt holders,
and let's say it goes into

59
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,940
bankruptcy.

60
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,370
Let's say this is
generating cash.

61
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,690
And I'll teach you in a future
video how do you see what is

62
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,490
the cash being generated
by the assets.

63
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,720
And then you have to subtract
out the cash that has to be

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,420
used to pay the debt holders,
because you're paying

65
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,170
interest, and then what's
left over for equity.

66
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,000
And I'll show you how to do that
on an income statement.

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,760
But let's say this is generating
a lot of cash.

68
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,340
Right?

69
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,680
It's generating a good bit of
cash, but let's say, these

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,240
guys eat up interest. Right?

71
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,310
So some of the cash will go to
the debt holders as interest.

72
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,800
And let's say, for whatever
reason, either interest rates

73
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,275
went up, or they had a bad
quarter or a bad year, and

74
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:53,330
they just didn't generate enough
cash, let's say they

75
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,040
couldn't pay off one of
the debt holders.

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,620
And that debt holder says,
hey, you couldn't pay my

77
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,880
interest payment, or
you couldn't pay

78
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,920
the principal payment.

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,220
I'm taking you into
bankruptcy.

80
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,545
Right?

81
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:04,740
I'm taking you into
bankruptcy.

82
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,460
So it goes into bankruptcy.

83
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,920
And in this situation,
immediately we realize it

84
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,700
makes no sense to shutter
this asset.

85
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,300
If we were just to shut down
the factory and lay off the

86
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,360
employees, we're going to get
nothing for these assets.

87
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,520
Because the land is in a part of
the country where'd there's

88
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,340
no obvious buyer for the land.

89
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,010
An empty car factory is pretty
much useless, especially when

90
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,380
the other people in the industry
are in no mood to buy

91
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,530
the factories from you.

92
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,310
So everyone decides that it's
in their best interests to

93
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,420
keep this thing running.

94
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,090
So what happens is that the
debtor stays in possession of

95
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,170
the assets.

96
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,730
So you can kind of view the
debtor as the equity holders

97
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,910
and the management
of the company.

98
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,970
So they stay in possession
of the assets.

99
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,500
And actually what happens is--
because these guys didn't have

100
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,905
enough cash to pay off their
debt holders-- what happens is

101
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:51,680
that they take on a
new loan, called a

102
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,270
debtor-in-possession loan.

103
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,235
And this new loan is the
most senior loan.

104
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,810
It's called DIP financing.

105
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,520
It's actually a great business,
although it's become

106
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,770
scarce recently.

107
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,105
It's a great business
because you're at

108
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:06,340
the top of the stack.

109
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,065
You're more senior than
even the senior guys.

110
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,940
And it's called DIP financing.

111
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,190
Debtor-in-possession
financing.

112
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,209
And what this provides is a
company with some kind of

113
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,630
cushion cash so that it can keep
operating, so it can keep

114
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,100
the lights on.

115
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,000
So it's essentially a debt.

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,550
It's just a very senior
type of debt.

117
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,150
And it happens once a company
has entered bankruptcy.

118
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,690
Right?

119
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,220
And this bankruptcy that
we're going to talk

120
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,630
about is Chapter 11.

121
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,810
Chapter 11 restructuring.

122
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,780
And in Chapter 11 restructuring,
you keep

123
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,150
operating the company.

124
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,280
You might do some things on the

125
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,220
left-hand side of the equation.

126
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,465
You might want to sell off some
of the assets and all of

127
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:48,680
that, but we won't
go into that.

128
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,770
Most of what you do is you
rearrange this side of the

129
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,675
balance sheet.

130
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:57,200
And this is why, you probably--
every airline has,

131
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,470
some of them, have gone into
bankruptcy multiple times, but

132
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,100
they still exist. It's not
like when you go into

133
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,710
bankruptcy the company
just disappears.

134
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,170
The assets will persist and all
of this gets reorganized

135
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,100
on this side.

136
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,870
A lot of times when someone goes
into Chapter 11 and then

137
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,920
they come out of it and they
go back into it, they call

138
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,730
that Chapter 22, and
then Chapter 33.

139
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,630
I think you get the idea.

140
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,240
So anyway, what happens
in Chapter 11?

141
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,250
So the assets-- essentially it
becomes kind of the bankruptcy

142
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,590
court takes over, and they
hire some investments.

143
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,190
They'll get the
debtor-in-possession financing

144
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,400
so that the company has some
cash to operate, pay the

145
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,990
bills, and pay the employees
and whatever else.

146
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,230
The company keeps operating as
it always would so it can pay

147
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,820
its suppliers and operate
as a regular business.

148
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,960
And then all of these guys
hire a bunch of lawyers.

149
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,930
And they start negotiating
with each other.

150
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,650
And essentially there will be
a bank associated with the

151
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,160
bankruptcy court whose whole
job-- and it's all part of a

152
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,650
negotiation-- is
to value this.

153
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,960
And it's often, maybe this
debtor right here,

154
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,690
he'll hire one bank.

155
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,820
This debtor will
hire one bank.

156
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,080
Maybe the management will
hire another bank.

157
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,670
And everyone's going to come
up with bankruptcy plans.

158
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,730
But bankruptcy plans
are usually

159
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,160
of one or more varieties.

160
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,370
It's essentially just saying,
well, we need to value these

161
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,060
assets, right?

162
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,910
We're not selling it.

163
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,250
So we're not just going
to get cash.

164
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,510
We're going to hire
some bankers.

165
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,180
And we'll do a lot of videos
on that in the future.

166
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,640
And they're just going to say--
based on the prospects

167
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,080
of this company, how fast it's
growing or how fast it's not

168
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,440
growing, or how much cash it's
generating in a year-- they're

169
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,815
going to assign a value to it.

170
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:43,880
So let's say that this guy up
here, he hires a banker.

171
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,500
And this banker says-- Let's
say this was originally the

172
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,290
same situation.

173
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,650
This was $10 million.

174
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,065
Let's say that the liabilities
were $6 million.

175
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:56,280
And that the original equity
was $4 million.

176
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,260
Right?

177
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,130
And let's say these bankers
evaluate the business.

178
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,330
They make detailed models.

179
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,760
They take it in the context of
the current macro environment.

180
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,290
And they say, you know what?

181
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,520
I think this company
is actually

182
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,780
only worth $5 million.

183
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,960
And given that it's worth $5
million, and we think that it

184
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:24,120
can sustain-- it's only worth $5
million and there's no way

185
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,360
that it can pay interest
on $6 million of debt.

186
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,590
Right?

187
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,240
It doesn't have enough cash to
generate $6 million of debt.

188
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,630
We think it can afford
$2 million of debt.

189
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,085
Right?

190
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:37,890
So what will happen is,
the new company--

191
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,010
And this is just a plan.

192
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,900
And then once you have a plan,
then everyone has to vote on

193
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,470
it, and there are things called
cram downs-- and we''l

194
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,460
do that in more detail--
but the plan will

195
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,760
say, you know what?

196
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,480
The assets are worth
$5 million.

197
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,770
I thought I was using
the square tool.

198
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,590
Undo.

199
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,270
This plan might say, you
know, those assets

200
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,520
are worth $5 million.

201
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,280
And the company can only handle
$2 million of debt, not

202
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,530
$6 million of debt.

203
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:14,180
So now, it can only handle $2
million of debt, and then

204
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:20,360
there will be $3 million
left of equity.

205
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
Right?

206
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,270
And I'll call this
the new equity.

207
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,990
Because sometimes this
can get confusing.

208
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,490
So let's just say for a second--
and I want you to

209
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,080
think about it-- what is
everyone's incentive?

210
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,440
This guy up here, his incentive
is to value the

211
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,510
company as lowly as
possible, right?

212
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,190
Because then he gets more
of the company.

213
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,530
I think that'll be clear
to you in a second.

214
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,130
This guy's incentive
is to say, no, this

215
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,380
company is worth a lot.

216
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,520
So all of you guys are going
to get paid back and then I

217
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,610
get what's left over.

218
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,740
And you're probably asking, what
do you get paid back for

219
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,850
not liquidating it?

220
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,670
And the answer is the new
shares of the company.

221
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:59,780
So what happens is that this
stock-- let's say this plan

222
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,270
gets passed.

223
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,100
This plan right here.

224
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,370
In this situation, these
guys up here were the

225
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,840
most senior, right?

226
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,180
Let's say there was $2 million
of senior debt up here.

227
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,700
Let me write that in
a different color.

228
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,620
There's $2 million of
senior debt up here.

229
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,180
So what they'll do is they'll
actually get $2

230
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,210
million of the new debt.

231
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,880
They're most senior.

232
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,730
And then all of these other $4
million, who are more junior--

233
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,060
let me see if I can
color it in.

234
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,930
I know it's hard to read-- these
other $4 million guys,

235
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,370
instead of getting any kind of
cash or any kind of debt

236
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,370
securities for having been owed
this money, they'll get

237
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,390
the new stock.

238
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,890
So they'll get $3 million
of new stock.

239
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,550
Let me see if I can
draw that in.

240
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,930
So this $3 million of new equity
will go to these guys.

241
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,150
And this unsecured guy down
here, he's not going to get as

242
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,290
much equity.

243
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,750
He'll be impaired
a little bit.

244
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,370
And the old equity guys, the
stock's going to go to 0.

245
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,490
They're not going
to get anything.

246
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,480
So the old shareholders of the
company are wiped out.

247
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,150
They go to 0.

248
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,280
And essentially, the debt
holders become the new

249
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,000
shareholders of the company.

250
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,070
You'll often see when a company
goes into bankruptcy

251
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,960
but it's getting reorganized,
you'll often see some people

252
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:30,180
start to buy up this debt or
these bonds, right here,

253
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,820
because they want to be the
new equity holders.

254
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,075
When this company emerges from
bankruptcy-- let's say that

255
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:38,740
this is how it emerges from
bankruptcy-- they want to be

256
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,850
these guys, the new
equity holders.

257
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,100
Because usually when you value
it, you want to undervalue it

258
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,540
a little bit.

259
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,490
I know I've overdrawn this
picture a little bit too much.

260
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,700
But the debt guys, especially
the senior debt guys, they

261
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,510
want to be safe.

262
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,810
They want to say,
you know what?

263
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,590
We've already been hurt
by this company.

264
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,300
They're already not
paying our debt.

265
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,845
We want to assign as low a
possible value to the company

266
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:01,870
as possible-- in this
case $5 million-- so

267
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,940
that we make sure.

268
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,645
Hopefully the company ends up
being worth $10 million again,

269
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:11,780
in which case these guys
right here make out

270
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,030
like bandits, right?

271
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,080
If the company was really worth
$10 million but the

272
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,450
bankruptcy court values it at $5
million, these guys get all

273
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,280
of the shares of the company.

274
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,880
These guys get wiped out, even
though the company really was

275
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,810
worth something.

276
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,030
So let's say the company emerges
from bankruptcy like

277
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,360
this, but it actually turns out
there were $10 million.

278
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,800
Then let's say a year
later the company

279
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,170
starts doing well again.

280
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,570
And let's say that someone could
value the company again

281
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,060
at $10 million.

282
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,970
Now it only has $2
million of debt.

283
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,050
And now you have $8 million
worth of equity.

284
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,330
So these guys-- maybe they were
owed $2 or $3 million

285
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,470
before, and they got $3 million
of the new equity,

286
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,780
they might have made
out like bandits.

287
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,790
Because now all of a
sudden, that equity

288
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,550
could be worth a lot.

289
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,610
That's not always the case.

290
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,670
But that's the view from the
debt holders' point of view.

291
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,510
The equity holders, you can
imagine, they don't want to be

292
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,980
left with nothing.

293
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,640
They'll hire their
own bankers.

294
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,315
And their bankers, they'll
probably submit a plan that

295
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:03,930
says, no, no, no, no.

296
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,890
This company is worth
at least $8 million.

297
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,910
So up here $8 million.

298
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,470
And we think it can handle
$4 million of debt.

299
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,550
So they'd want a scenario like
this, where they think the

300
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,270
company's worth $8 million.

301
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,060
It can handle $4 million
worth of debt.

302
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,310
And so it has $4 million
worth of equity.

303
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,520
And of course, the first $6
million of the value-- so the

304
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,000
$4 million of debt, and then $2
million of the equity will

305
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,940
go to the debt holders, right?

306
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,090
Because they were owed $6
million to begin with.

307
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,620
And then what's left over, which
is essentially-- so this

308
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,780
is $2 million of equity, and
then you'd have $2 million of

309
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,050
equity here-- this $2 million
of new equity, right?

310
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,700
This is the new shares of the
company will be given to the

311
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,470
old shareholders
of the company.

312
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,320
So that's what the shareholders
want.

313
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,560
I know this gets a little
confusing, but it all ends up

314
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,140
being valuing the assets as you
emerge from bankruptcy.

315
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,020
You say, you know,
it's generating

316
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,500
cash, it's worth something.

317
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,240
And then you pay people off
according to seniority.

318
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,500
And first you pay them off.

319
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,250
You say, OK, I still
owe you some money.

320
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,960
But this company can't support
$6 million of debt.

321
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,090
It can now support $2 million.

322
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,680
And whatever's left, people
are paid with actually

323
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,150
shares-- new shares--
of the company.

324
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,080
Not the old shares.

325
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,820
So the old shares
will go to 0.

326
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,560
So you can imagine a world
where GM goes bankrupt.

327
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,520
Right now, the shares
of GM go to 0.

328
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,330
GM old goes to 0.

329
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,750
But the assets keep operating,
and that's why some people are

330
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,970
a little bit misleading in
this whole automotive

331
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,810
bankruptcy debate.

332
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,440
They're kind of using scare
tactics to say, oh, if GM goes

333
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,790
bankrupt, then these assets are
just going to disappear.

334
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,070
No, they'll just
keep operating.

335
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,750
If it makes sense to operate
them, they'll keep operating.

336
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,170
The only people who
will lose big are

337
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,620
the old equity holders.

338
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,900
And then some of the unsecured,
the more junior

339
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,700
levels of debt, will probably
lose some money.

340
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,290
But if the assets are
worth operating,

341
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,175
they'll continue to operate.

342
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:00,690
And if the people, if it makes
sense to have them employed,

343
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,410
they'll keep working.

344
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,230
