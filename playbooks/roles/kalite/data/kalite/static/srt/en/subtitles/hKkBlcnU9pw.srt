1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,390
Let's do some examples comparing absolute values.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,480
So, let's say we were to ask ourselves

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,234
how -9, the absolute value of -9 I should say,

4
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:19,042
how that compares to the absolute value of

5
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:24,058
-let me think of a good number--the absolute value of -7.

6
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,846
So, let's think about this a little bit and

7
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:27,912
let's think about what -9 looks like or

8
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:29,073
where it is in the number line and

9
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:30,931
where -7 is on the number line.

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,671
Let's see where the absolute values mean and

11
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:36,411
then we should probably be able to do this comparison.

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,315
So there are a couple ways to think about it.

13
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:41,220
One is you can draw them on the number line.

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,908
So, if this is 0 and this is -7

15
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:49,669
and then this is -9 right over here.

16
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:52,177
Now when you take the absolute value of a number,

17
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,742
you are really saying how far is that number from 0,

18
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:58,493
whether it is to the left or the right of 0.

19
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:02,998
So for example, -9 is 9 to the left of 0.

20
00:01:02,998 --> 00:01:07,084
So the absolute value of -9 is exactly 9.

21
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:16,279
This evaluates to 9. -7 is exactly 7 to the left of 0.

22
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:20,227
So the absolute value of -7 is +7.

23
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:22,409
And so, if you were to compare 9 and 7

24
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,081
then this is a little bit more straight forward.

25
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:29,167
9 is clearly greater than 7.

26
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:32,278
And if you ever get confused with the greater than and less than symbols,

27
00:01:32,278 --> 00:01:35,645
just remember that the symbol is larger on the left hand side,

28
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:37,735
so that is the greater than side.

29
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:41,914
If I were to write this, and this is actually also a true statement.

30
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:44,190
If you took this without the absolute value signs,

31
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,567
it is also true that -9 is less than -7.

32
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:53,033
Notice the smaller side is on the smaller number.

33
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:56,700
And so that is the interesting thing: -9 is less than -7

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,024
but their absolute values, since -9 is further to the left of 0,

35
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:04,507
it is the absolute value of -9 , which is 9,

36
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:07,900
is greater than the absolute value of -7.

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,546
Another way to think about it is

38
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,967
if you take the absolute value of a number,

39
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:14,770
it really is just the positive value of that number.

40
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,507
So if you took the absolute value of 9 that equals 9.

41
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,967
Or the absolute value of -9, that is also equal to 9.

42
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:24,198
When you think of it visually, that is

43
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:27,634
because both of these numbers are exactly 9 away from 0.

44
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:32,046
This is 9 to the right of 0 and this is 9 to the left of 0.

45
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:33,857
Let's do a few more of these.

46
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:37,453
So let's say that we wanted to compare

47
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:43,749
the absolute value of 2 to the absolute value of 3.

48
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:47,836
Well the absolute value of a positive is just going to be that same value.

49
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:52,018
2 is 2 to the right of 0. So this is just going to evaluate to 2.

50
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:53,900
And then the absolute value of 3,

51
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,567
that is just going to evaluate to 3.

52
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:57,263
That is actually pretty straight forward.

53
00:02:57,263 --> 00:03:00,833
So 2 is clearly the smaller number here

54
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,167
so we clearly get 2 is less than 3.

55
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,700
Or the absolute value of 2 is less than 3.

56
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,900
So we have a less than right over here.

57
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,633
Let's say you wanted to compare

58
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:15,933
-I am trying to find a suitable color-

59
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:19,233
the absolute value of -8 to the absolute value of 8.

60
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:23,116
One way to think about it is that they are both 8 away from 0.

61
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:25,916
This is 8 to the left of 0 and this 8 to the right of 0.

62
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,749
So both of these things evaluate to 8.

63
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:34,183
Absolute value of negative 8 is 8 and absolute value of 8 is 8.

64
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:38,084
So clearly 8 is equal to 8.

65
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,980
Let's do a couple more examples.

66
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,815
Let's say that I wanted to compare the absolute value of -1 and

67
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:48,900
I want to compare that to +2.

68
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:57,967
So the absolute value of -1 is just positive version of -1 which is just 1.

69
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:00,189
So 1 is clearly less than 2.

70
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:01,350
Or, the other way to think about it is

71
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:07,037
the absolute value of negative 1 is clearly less than 2.
