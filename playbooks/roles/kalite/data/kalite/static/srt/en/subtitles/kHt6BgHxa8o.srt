00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:10,689
For me, the special thing about a Buddha image is often the smile,

3
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:14,133
that beautiful, transcendent smile,

4
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:19,080
and behind the smile is the story of how the Buddha got to the smile.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,086
-He was seeking transcendence from human suffering, and all part of this journey from growing up in a life full of luxury,

6
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:28,808
and leaving the walls of his palace

7
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:32,697
and encountering four things that changed the course of his life forever:

8
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:37,619
a corpse, a sick man, a holy man and an old man.

9
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,536
And through that he realised that life is full of suffering.

10
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:45,455
-He realised that the beautiful body of a prince

11
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:52,122
was really a receptacle for pus and urine and excrement...

12
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:55,455
the body would be diseased, it would grow old -

13
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,457
and these things were impermanent.

14
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:02,739
Where was release, where was happiness, where was salvation?

15
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:08,541
And what we see in this statue is the moment of realisation.

16
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,405
Suffering comes from desire,

17
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:16,537
desire can be transcended by right acts and right thought...

18
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:20,121
We see the smile of liberation on his lips,

19
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:25,239
we see the hand pointed to the earth, calling on the earth to witness his enlightenment.

20
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:29,406
It's useful to remember that the worshipper would look up -

21
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:34,457
the Buddha is sacred, the statue is placed high in relation to us,

22
00:01:34,457 --> 00:01:43,204
and smiles down on us, and gives us the sense that we too can overcome pain and suffering of the world

23
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:46,634
and give in to a transcendent place.

24
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:49,454
-We can see that he grew up in a life of luxury,

25
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:55,227
the elongated ears, which reveals that he would have worn really heavy earrings,

26
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:59,279
-But the ears mean something else besides; yes the lobes are distended,

27
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:05,908
yes, the lobes held jewellery, but he also has ears that mark him as a particularly special person.

28
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:10,399
-We can see various 'lakshanas', which represent Buddha's enlightenment.

29
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,408
The 'urna', between his eyes, represents the moment of spiritual awareness,

30
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:20,127
and the 'ushnisha' on the top of the head the moment of enlightenment.

31
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:26,002
And also often we see the Buddha sitting on a lotus flower, a symbol of getting beyond pain

32
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:30,500
and overcoming obstacles to achieve goodness,

33
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:37,041
because the lotus flower lives in the mud, and eventually cleanses itself to become beautiful.

34
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,546
-He is often portrayed in the robes of a monk.

35
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:47,457
Somebody who has left the world, gone to live, in the Buddha's story, in the forest.

36
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:52,048
Throughout Asia, monks often live in mountain monasteries,

37
00:02:52,048 --> 00:03:01,305
they have withdrawn from the stress and strain of normal everyday social life and the pain that it engenders among us.

38
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:08,673
And this is a Thai statue, and if you look you see the lithe body of a beautiful South-East Asian Prince,

39
00:03:08,673 --> 00:03:15,541
you see the grace of the hands that might even make you think of the way dancers dance in Thailand,

40
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:20,979
-So even though it's a classic Buddha, it's fairly recent and not from India.

41
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:23,252
-Buddhism is a travelling religion.

42
00:03:23,252 --> 00:03:26,921
Buddhism went North and Buddhism went South:

43
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:33,330
Northern Buddhism, sometimes known as 'Mahayana Buddhism', the Buddhism of the greater vehicle,

44
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,251
Theravada Buddhism - well, Theravadans claim the original form -

45
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:42,753
for Theravadans, enlightenment is an individual project.

46
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:48,910
Buddhism also went North, and there enlightenment is a more collective project,

47
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,085
Buddhism is a more collective project,

48
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:54,547
one of my old professors used to say,

49
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:58,009
"Theravadan Buddhism, that is like getting to nirvana by private car.

50
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:01,473
Mahayana is getting to nirvana by public bus."

51
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:04,503
-[LAUGHS] I think I prefer public bus!

52
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:10,500
-We'll see how different statues reflect the tastes and the characteristics

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,422
of people living in all of the different places where Buddhism travelled.

54
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,584
-Another Buddha, totally different, also recognisable as a Buddha,

55
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:23,676
but look at those elaborate robes and the hair, and the facial features...

56
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:32,653
-Yes, there's a good reason why this statue looks the way it does and it's a great example of how Buddhism travelled.

57
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:34,843
This is a statue from Gandhara,

58
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:41,476
Gandhara in Pakistan, on the edge of the Af-Pak border, that area that's so fraught today.

59
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:46,142
And, if you look at the statue, you see the facial hair, the features,

60
00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:50,841
suggest something of people who live in that part of the world,

61
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:53,298
but look at those flowing robes,

62
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:57,433
those might recall a Greek statue.

63
00:04:57,433 --> 00:05:02,881
The reason for that, people think, is because this was the easternmost extent of Alexander's empire,

64
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:11,202
this was a part of Asia that had very close ties to the Greco-Roman world,

65
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:19,014
and a place where styles of sculpting probably were influenced by those traditions.

66
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:23,843
-This Buddha is not calling on the earth to witness his enlightenment,

67
00:05:23,843 --> 00:05:27,234
it's a whole different 'mudra', a whole different posture,

68
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:31,846
-And yet he's still in the lotus pose, he has the long ears,

69
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:37,516
and he has that meditative expression on his face.

70
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:42,591
-So now, moving to Japan, this is an entirely different representation of the Buddha.

71
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:46,705
To me it's a bit... austere? Almost a bit intimidating,

72
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:49,864
the black robes and the staff in his hand,

73
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:53,697
although recognisable because of the lotus flower that he's standing on,

74
00:05:53,697 --> 00:06:00,037
-And the long ears! This is a Japanese figure, a very elegant, very austere one,

75
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:03,936
as you've said, but this is Jizo the bodisattva,

76
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:07,097
and he's actually a very benign figure.

77
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:13,263
It's again this idea of enlightenment via the big bus: bodhisattvas help us,

78
00:06:13,263 --> 00:06:21,681
we're down here in the world of pain, and there are beings who put off their own transcendence to be there for us.

79
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:26,098
The most popular figure is Guanyin, a female bodhisattva,

80
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:29,864
who, in many respects resembles a mother.

81
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:37,592
Now Jizo is sometimes identified with Guanyin, he again swing back to the masculine side,

82
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:43,430
but Jizo, Jizo is there in the world of the dead to help people get through.

83
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,762
He's not an underworld judge, he's not a punishing figure,

84
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:50,683
Jizo says, come huddle under my cloak and I'll help you.

85
00:06:50,683 --> 00:06:53,708
-But he is associated with death, and the underworld...

86
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:58,631
-In a positive sense. 'Cos we've all gotta go there, we need somebody on our team.

87
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:04,764
In Japan he is often associated with children, a protector of children,

88
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:09,635
you see shrines to Jizo in neighbourhoods. And those are usually folksy figures,

89
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:15,021
they're a little bit more approachable than this very austere statue.

90
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:20,857
And he is a protector of dead children, there will be Jizo shrines in Japanese temples,

91
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:26,308
and there'll be a lot of little Jizo figures that represent the children themselves,

92
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:30,096
and people will leave candy and toys for them.

93
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:33,346
They're very very poignant places.

94
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:39,874
-My goodness, what a radical change to the fat happy laughing Buddha that we see all around New York City!

95
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:43,262
All around the world, in shops, in the back of taxi cabs,

96
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,432
-And there's a good reason for that,

97
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:49,874
because this is a Buddha associated with good fortune, with fertility

98
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:53,004
and by extension, wealth.

99
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:57,352
This is the Buddha that helps you when you're dealing with this quirky market,

100
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,401
maybe makes things turn out in your favour...

101
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:05,504
This is the Buddha of the future, there are many Buddhas, many enlightened beings,

102
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:11,345
Prince Siddhartha, the Buddha we think of as <i>the</i> Buddha, was actually only one,

103
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:15,644
this particular Buddha, Maitreya, the Buddha of the future,

104
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:22,099
is a being who is an apocalyptic figure, he signifies changing times

105
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,244
and as a consequence he seems very magical.

106
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:30,801
-He's also inspired by a legend of a monk that lived a thousand years ago,

107
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,518
Hotei, who travelled around, carrying a sack,

108
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:37,983
as Buddha would have also carried a sack quite often,

109
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,078
delivering goods to people,

110
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:44,914
candy to children as the legend holds, rice to adults for their fields,

111
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:48,275
almost a Santa Claus type of figure.

112
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:55,528
-And in the historic existence of the monk Hotei, people probably thought,

113
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:58,933
'ah the Buddha of the future is among us.'

114
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:04,801
And so the legend of the monk gets equated with the idea of the Buddha of the future.

115
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:10,778
-You find people rubbing the Buddha's belly, for prosperity, for wealth, for happiness.

116
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:15,944
-And this is a wonderful example of how religion becomes responsive to people's needs,

117
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:20,852
how people take ideas from different places and transform them,

118
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:25,023
and make them their own, cause them to speak to themselves, to their own needs,

119
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,696
to their moment.

120
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,976
