1
00:00:00,103 --> 00:00:05,768
[music]

2
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:09,734
We're in the vast complex that is San Lorenzo in Florence,

3
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:13,138
in Michelangelo's Laurentian Library vestibule -

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,394
that is, the staircase moving up into the library itself.

5
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:20,911
Well, it's a whole room, including a staircase that moves up into the library.

6
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:26,025
The staircase is broad and spills out into this room,

7
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,784
which is itself quite small.

8
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:31,531
It leaves almost no space in front of the staircase.

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,112
The staircase has such a sense of momentum,

10
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:35,534
because it seems to literally,

11
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:37,309
at least in its central aisle,

12
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:40,555
to pour forward, almost as if it's pools of liquid.

13
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:42,957
We don't feel like the wall that's opposite it

14
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:44,699
gives it enough room for it to continue,

15
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:47,353
and it might actually, in a sense, swamp us.

16
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:52,621
Yeah, I was not at all prepared for how overwhelming the staircase would be in this space.

17
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:54,473
It just fills it up.

18
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:57,847
The staircase has two rectilinear aisles on either side,

19
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:01,814
and they make the organic quality of the central piece

20
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:05,304
feel even more round, even more liquid.

21
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:07,630
The staircase is thought to be perhaps

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,383
the very first freestanding staircase in architectural history.

23
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:14,796
It's made out of the same cool gray stone

24
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:18,035
that Brunelleschi had so often used in the previous century.

25
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:20,070
Although the plan was to make it out of wood.

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,021
Yeah. The original specs by Michelangelo were

27
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:24,822
that these to be made out of walnut,

28
00:01:24,822 --> 00:01:29,203
which would have matched very nicely the desks and the wood in the library above,

29
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:33,038
seeming as if the library itself was somehow pouring out and down.

30
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:35,860
Right. And it would have warmed up the space a little bit more, I think.

31
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,832
And of course, the space is intensified

32
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,379
not only because of the scale of the staircase

33
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,233
in relationship to the cubic dimensions of the room,

34
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:48,914
but also because of the wild structures that Michelangelo creates

35
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:50,286
that surround the staircase.

36
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:51,749
Yeah. The walls are -

37
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:53,321
- Well, are there walls?

38
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,585
It's hard to find the walls, because Michelangelo has covered them

39
00:01:56,585 --> 00:02:00,342
with various elements borrowed from classical antiquity,

40
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:04,360
but really transformed, described as Mannerist architecture.

41
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,745
And I think it makes sense to use that term,

42
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:08,194
because when we think about Mannerism,

43
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,139
we think about a flaunting of the rules.

44
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:14,855
If anything, classical architecture has lots of rules

45
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:18,022
about how things are used, which element goes where,

46
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:19,361
what the proportions are;

47
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:22,181
and Michelangelo is disregarding all of that

48
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:25,410
and recombining - there's a kind of freedom here

49
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,020
from that weight of classical antiquity.

50
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,634
So previous to this, when architects look back

51
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:31,733
to the classical tradition,

52
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,948
they looked back to the books of Vitruvius.

53
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:36,285
They looked back to rules. And you're absolutely right,

54
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:40,242
Michelangelo is in a sense taking the letter forms of antiquity,

55
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:42,222
but creating new words out of them.

56
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:45,362
These are clearly columns, pediments, pilasters;

57
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:47,195
but they're used and combined in ways

58
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:50,131
that have never existed in the history of architecture previous.

59
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:51,839
So let's just point out a few elements.

60
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,276
One of the most obvious as we stand down at the bottom are [sic]

61
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:59,249
the brackets, which are usually used as an ornamental expression of support

62
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:00,531
for something heavy above.

63
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:03,657
And which Michelangelo used in the new sacristy in that way.

64
00:03:03,657 --> 00:03:06,517
But here, he's lifted them out of that context

65
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:10,642
and instead they hang, as opposed to support something over them,

66
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,276
so they have absolutely no purpose;

67
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:16,119
but they're even more powerful and even more muscular.

68
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,286
Well, they're oversize.

69
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:19,717
Especially considering how low down on the floor.

70
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:23,576
And so, they are a clear signal to anybody walking into this room:

71
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:26,614
Here's a vocabulary that is being reinvented, reused.

72
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:30,061
And they're reset. They're sort of of set back into the wall.

73
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,799
And then we also notice other things,

74
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,290
like the pilasters that frame these blind windows

75
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,942
on either side of the doorway, which taper downward

76
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:42,904
and which have fluting only at the bottom.

77
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:44,552
So, the tapering downward is sort of

78
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:46,678
the oddest kind of reversal.

79
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:49,454
The ancient Greeks often tapered upward

80
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:51,671
in order to create the illusion of height.

81
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,182
But here, we have that reversal,

82
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:57,344
and it is this very curious, willful reconfiguration.

83
00:03:57,344 --> 00:04:00,377
The columns are virtually freestanding,

84
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:04,332
but are existing in niches as if they are sculpture.

85
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:07,350
And I think that's a metaphor that is important for Michelangelo.

86
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,401
He is first and foremost a sculptor.

87
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:10,944
But he comes to architecture,

88
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:15,037
and here frames architecture as if it were a figure,

89
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:16,753
as if this were sculpture.

90
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:19,438
But there are some very strange passages that result.

91
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:22,643
Not only do we have a sense that they are decorative

92
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:28,196
when in fact, studies have shown that those encased columns are actually structural -

93
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:29,752
which is an unexpected flip -

94
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,681
but as those columns and those bays for the columns

95
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:36,515
meet the corners, you have the columns actually separated

96
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:40,599
by a kind of internal double-edged pilaster.

97
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:42,699
And so, how does that even work?

98
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,797
It's absurd for me to even call them pilasters,

99
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:46,783
and yet that's what they must be.

100
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:51,390
It really feels as though those corners where we see the capitals come together,

101
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,795
and the pilaster in between,

102
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,166
and these embedded columns

103
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:58,565
almost like there's a world behind the wall.

104
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,973
There's something mysterious in the corners,

105
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:02,648
and around and behind them.

106
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,511
There's drama, there's mystery,

107
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:07,097
and there's a kind of invitation to understand

108
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:09,524
that these are elements that can be moved and changed,

109
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:11,520
that pushes beyond the constricture

110
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,819
with which classicism had been understood for so long.

111
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,787
It all implies a kind of virtuosity,

112
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:19,362
and his knowledge of the classical forms,

113
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,910
and to subvert them.

114
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,582
This is a space that speaks to Michelangelo's supreme self-confidence.

115
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:27,428
Should we walk upstairs and go into the library?

116
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,087
Yeah.

117
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,329
We've walked up the staircase,

118
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,679
past the eddies that pool at the sides of each of the stairs,

119
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,372
and we've entered into the library,

120
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:37,364
which is a much warmer space,

121
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:40,871
because of the coffered ceiling, and all of the stalls for reading.

122
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:42,695
All of this designed by Michelangelo.

123
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:45,884
After the drama of the vestibule,

124
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:51,171
there's definitely a sense of relief and calm entering this library space.

125
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:52,503
It's a serious space,

126
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:55,358
and you feel that through the vocabulary of classicism

127
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:57,805
being used in a more orderly manner.

128
00:05:57,805 --> 00:06:04,251
Michelangelo's still crowding the walls with these pilasters that seem very severe.

129
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:09,164
The molding, the blind frames at the top level

130
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:10,346
above the windows.

131
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:11,425
The windows are quite large,

132
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:14,508
meant to let in as much natural light to assist the readers as possible.

133
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:18,084
We also have a very strong horizontal element

134
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:20,944
formed by cornices above the windows.

135
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:23,488
And a kind of false clear story.

136
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:25,965
Creating a real sense of perspective.

137
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:27,819
And rhythm, and a kind of unity,

138
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:30,895
so that as a reader perhaps, you feel as if you're one among many,

139
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:32,736
engaged in a serious act.

140
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:35,817
This was a library that contained the manuscripts of the Medici family.

141
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:41,638
It's sort of useful to remember that books were among the most precious objects that one could own.

142
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:44,278
They weren't paperbacks. These were handmade objects.

143
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,688
This was a room that really is a physical expression

144
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:51,015
of the importance of learning in 15th and 16th century Florence.

145
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:54,925
I can't imagine a better exemplar in the importance of the classical as

146
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:58,752
only a point of origin, only a point of departure.

147
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:03,588
Walking out of the library and back down into Michelangelo's vestibule,

148
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:07,462
you're really struck by just how he separates the library,

149
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:10,674
and its sense of the rarefied, from the world.

150
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:15,357
Yeah. The vestibule really does provide a kind of point of transition.

151
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:18,342
When you come out of the library, you see that staircase,

152
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:23,260
with a rather steep angle, pouring down into this very narrow space.

153
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,993
You really feel like you're leaving one world

154
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:26,840
and entering another.

155
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,986
And then of course, when you step out of the vestibule

156
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:30,796
and into the cloister,

157
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:33,304
we're yet in another world again.

158
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:37,854
So, even in this spiritual space of the contemplation of the cloister itself,

159
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:40,110
the ancient tradition that is so different,

160
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,763
such a radical departure from the intensified, invented environment

161
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,474
