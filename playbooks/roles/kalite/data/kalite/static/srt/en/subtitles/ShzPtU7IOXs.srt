00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:04,787
In this video we're gonna talk about the law of demand

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,708
which is one of the core ideas of micro-economics.

3
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,522
And luckily for us, it is a fairly intuitive idea.

4
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:16,600
It just tells us that if we raise the price of a product,

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,615
that will lower the quantity demanded for the product.

6
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:23,738
The quantity demanded will go down,

7
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:25,870
and you can imagine the other side of that.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:31,000
If we lower the price of a product,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,856
that will raise the quantity demanded of that product.

10
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:40,333
And the law of demand says, just kind of generally

11
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,986
what we'll see in a few videos from now,

12
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:44,968
that there are some exceptions to this.

13
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:46,800
But to make this a little concrete,

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,899
let's think about the demand for a certain product.

15
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,000
And one thing I'm gonna clear here,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,133
and I want to take great pains to not mess this up,

17
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,459
is that when we talk about the word DEMAND,

18
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:59,815
in a formal economic sense,

19
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:02,067
we're not talking about a quantity,

20
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:03,368
we're actually gonna talk "all else equal",

21
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:05,322
"ceterus perebus"

22
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:10,051
all the relationship between price and quantity demanded.

23
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:11,714
If we talk about an actual quantity,

24
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:14,092
we should say the quantity demanded.

25
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:18,151
So DEMAND vs QUANTITY DEMANDED,

26
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:19,975
these are two different things.

27
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:22,581
If it‘s a little confusing to you right now,

28
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:23,771
hopefully by the end of this video

29
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:25,658
the difference between demand and quantity demanded

30
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:27,320
will become a little bit clearer,

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,355
and definitely over the next few videos.

32
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,708
Because in this video we're gonna focus on,

33
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:34,864
how the quantity demanded changes relative to price.

34
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:38,000
In future videos we'll talk about how the entire relationship,

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,940
how demand changes based on different factors.

36
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,655
But to make things concrete,

37
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:47,712
let's say I'm about to release my science fiction book,

38
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:50,839
space whatever..I don't know...the book I want to release..

39
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:54,940
So I'm gonna release some e-book,

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,518
And we've done some market study

41
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:58,793
or we just know how the price is

42
00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:00,422
or how the demand is related to price,

43
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:02,338
or price is related to demand.

44
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:06,745
And we're gonna show that in a DEMAND SCHEDULE,

45
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:08,611
which is really just a table

46
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:09,702
that just shows

47
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:15,064
how the price... and actually I made my first mistake.

48
00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:17,155
I just said how price relates to demand.

49
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:20,552
I should say how price relates to quantity demanded,

50
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:23,255
and how quantity demanded relates to price.

51
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:26,236
So a demand schedule, it shows

52
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:29,642
a relationship between price and quantity demanded.

53
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:31,640
ALL ELSE EQUAL.

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,250
So we're gonna have multiple scenarios here.

55
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,492
So this column is for scenarios.

56
00:02:39,508 --> 00:02:41,488
This column let me put my price.

57
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:50,515
This column I put my quantity demanded.

58
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:52,149
So a scenario...

59
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:54,379
Let's call this a scenario A.

60
00:02:54,379 --> 00:03:00,112
I could price my book at $2.

61
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:02,717
And I'll get a ton of people downloading it at that price.

62
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:05,759
So I will get 60,000 people

63
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,503
download my book at that price my e-book.

64
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:12,883
Scenario B, I could raise the price by $2.

65
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:17,291
So it's now at $4 and then that kills off a lot of the demand.

66
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,100
Now the quantity demanded goes down to

67
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,643
40,000 people downloading it.

68
00:03:21,643 --> 00:03:23,372
Then I go to scenario C.

69
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:25,048
If I raise by another $2,

70
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:26,733
so now I'm at $6,

71
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:32,333
that lowers the quantity demanded to 30,000.

72
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,635
I will do a couple more of these.

73
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:37,338
Scenario D, I raise another $2.

74
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:39,768
So I get to $8 now.

75
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:44,337
Now the quantity demanded goes down to 25,000.

76
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:46,247
And I'll do one more of these

77
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:47,977
-See what color I haven't used yet-

78
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,604
-I haven't used yellow yet-

79
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,826
Scenario E, I raise it to $10.

80
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:59,714
Now the quantity demanded let's just say it is 23,000.

81
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:02,802
So this relationship,

82
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:05,244
this shows the law of demand right over here.

83
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,767
And this table that shows,

84
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:09,384
how the quantity demanded relates to price and vice versa.

85
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:11,528
This is what we call the DEMAND SCHEDULE.

86
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:14,800
Now we can also, based on this demand schedule,

87
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,299
draw a DEMAND CURVE.

88
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,203
We're really just gonna plot these points and

89
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:20,720
draw the curve that connects them

90
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,372
because these aren't the only scenarios.

91
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:24,656
Anything between them is also possible.

92
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:26,093
We could charge $2.01 for the book.

93
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:28,313
We could charge $4.50 for the book.

94
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:31,267
And so that‘s what the demand curve captures a little bit better,

95
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:34,026
because it’s a continuous curve and not just 5 points.

96
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:35,813
So let's do that.

97
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:37,101
Let’s graph it.

98
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:39,438
And this is one of those conventions of economics

99
00:04:39,438 --> 00:04:41,277
that I am not a fan of,

100
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:45,513
because people often talk about changing the price

101
00:04:45,513 --> 00:04:48,824
and how the quantity demanded changes from that.

102
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:51,457
And in traditional...in most of math and science,

103
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,400
the thing that you're changing

104
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,593
you normally put on the horizontal axis.

105
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:58,118
So if I was in charge of the convention of economics

106
00:04:58,118 --> 00:05:02,102
I would plot price on the horizontal axis right over here.

107
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,944
But the way it's done typically

108
00:05:03,944 --> 00:05:06,343
is that price is done on the vertical axis.

109
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:07,969
So you're used to seeing it

110
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,740
in kind of the traditional class environment.

111
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,980
I'll do the same.

112
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,345
So we'll put price in the vertical axis

113
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:21,396
and we'll put quantity demanded in the horizontal axis.

114
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,821
And now the quantity demanded goes all the way up to 60,000.

115
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:29,748
So that's a 10..20..30..40..50..60

116
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:31,817
So it's 10 ... this is in thousands

117
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:38,265
20...30...sorry not 45...40...50 and 60

118
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:41,489
and this is in thousands.

119
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:43,866
And the price goes up to $10

120
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,101
from $2 to $10.

121
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:55,333
Let's say this is 2..4..6..8 and 10.

122
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,664
So let's plot the scenarios.

123
00:05:57,664 --> 00:06:00,741
So Scenario A, price is $2

124
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:03,105
60,000 units are demanded.

125
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:06,002
That is Scenario A, right over there.

126
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:09,184
Scenario B, when the price is $4,

127
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:11,450
40,000 units are demanded.

128
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,038
$4, 40,000 units that's right over there.

129
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:16,392
That's Scenario B.

130
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:25,647
Scenario C, $6, 30,000 units.

131
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:28,897
Scenario D, $8, 25,000 units.

132
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:32,827
$8, 25 is right about there.

133
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:36,158
That looks like 25,000 right in between. That's close enough.

134
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:39,968
So that right over there is Scenario D.

135
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:41,846
And then finally Scenario E,

136
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:46,706
$10, 23,000 units.

137
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,187
So that would be something like that.

138
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:51,080
That is Scenario E.

139
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,711
And so we can actually have prices anywhere between them

140
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,029
and maybe we can go even further.

141
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:56,744
So this right over here.

142
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:58,560
So if I were to draw the demand curve,

143
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,609
it could look something like this.

144
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:03,546
A demand curve would look something,

145
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:06,899
-I'm trying to do my best to draw a straight continuous line-

146
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,937
could look something like that.

147
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:10,994
It could keep going on and on.

148
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:13,990
And so these are two ways to show demand.

149
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,103
So I'm just going back to what I said earlier.

150
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:20,908
The quantity demanded is, all else equal, for a given price,

151
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,267
how many units people are willing to download

152
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,626
or buy of my e-book.

153
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:30,366
When we talk about the demand itself,

154
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,023
we're talking about this entire relationship.

155
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:34,523
So this demand itself,

156
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:36,410
is this entire demand schedule.

157
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,591
Or another way to think of it is,

158
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,293
is this entire demand curve.

159
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:42,813
If demand were to change,

160
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:45,118
we would actually have a different curve.

161
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:46,702
This curve would shift

162
00:07:46,702 --> 00:07:49,672
or the entries in this table would shift.

163
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:52,018
If the quantity of demand changes,

164
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:53,422
we move along this curve.

165
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:54,865
When you hold everything else equal

166
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:57,277
and you only change price.

167
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,921
So hopefully that makes that clear.

168
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:01,106
When everything else is equal

169
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,542
and you're only changing price,

170
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:04,080
you're not changing demand.

171
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,780
You're changing the quantity demanded.

172
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,967
The demand, because everything else is equal,

173
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,615
is this relationship.

174
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,746
In the next few videos,

175
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:12,249
we'll think about what does happen,

176
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:16,000
when you do change some of those other factors.
