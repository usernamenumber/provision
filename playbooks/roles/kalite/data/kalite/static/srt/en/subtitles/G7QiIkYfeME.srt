1
00:00:00,364 --> 00:00:00,364
   

2
00:00:00,364 --> 00:00:02,773
So I'm going to write out a number
then we're going to think about

3
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:06,073
how we could say
or actually write that number.

4
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,127
So...I'm just going to write it out.
I'm going to have to resist the temptation

5
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:11,826
to actually speak it out
'cause that's normally how I operate,

6
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:14,661
but I'm not going to do that right now.

7
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:17,080
I'm not gonna do that right now.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,332
So there's several ways that we can
pronounce this, and I encourage you to pause it

9
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:23,598
and try to pronounce it yourself.
You might not even need to pause it!

10
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:27,947
Well, the first thing that jumps out - 
well we've got twenty thousand and then some.

11
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:31,817
So maybe we should write it that way.
So we've got, we've got...

12
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:35,902
...twenty thousand...twenty...

13
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:39,602
Actually let me write it out as numbers first, 
to really decompose it.

14
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:43,782
So we have twenty thousand,
and then what do we have on top of that?

15
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:47,364
Well we have five tenths.

16
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:51,091
This is the tenths place, 
so we can literally rewrite that as

17
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:54,706
five tenths...five tenths...

18
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:59,759
then we have zero...zero hundredths.

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,331
I'll write that as a hundredths place
just so that we can keep track of it,

20
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,967
and then finally we have seven thousandths.

21
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,668
That's the thousandths place,

22
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:14,205
so we can write that plus seven thousandths.

23
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:18,484
So if we were to write down 
everything I just...that I just spoke out loud,

24
00:01:18,484 --> 00:01:22,816
we would just say that this is twenty
(let me write that a little bit neater)...

25
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,564
...this is twenty thousand...

26
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:34,351
...twenty thousand and five tenths...
...and five...

27
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,989
Let me write out the word...

28
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:42,033
...and five tenths and seven thousandths...

29
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:46,870
...and seven thousandths...

30
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:51,528
Now this isn't the only way to say this.
Another way of thinking about it

31
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:56,631
is to try to merge the five tenths and 
the seven thousandths in terms of thousandths.

32
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:59,932
So let's think about this. 
So we could write this as...

33
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:03,642
...so once again we would have
our twenty thousand...twenty thousand...

34
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:07,887
...but instead of five tenths and seven thousandths
let's write our five tenths in terms of thousands.

35
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:11,095
And the easiest way to do it is to multiply 
the numerator and the denominator both, here...

36
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:14,016
...by a hundred. So then we will have...

37
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:20,408
...so this five tenths is the same thing as 
five hundred over a thousand.

38
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,820
And this seven thousandths is still
seven thousandths,

39
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,806
and these two combined are 
five hundred and seven over a thousand.

40
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:32,152
Five hundred seven over a thousand.

41
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:37,501
So we could just call this: twenty thousand 
and five hundred and seven thousandths.

42
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:40,660
So let's write that down. 
So we could just say this is

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,960
twenty thousand...

44
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,875
...twenty thousand...

45
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,562
...and...and...

46
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:54,244
...five hundred...

47
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:57,222
...and seven...

48
00:02:57,222 --> 00:03:01,339
...five hundred and seven thousandths.

49
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:08,272
Thousandths...thousandths, thousandths
this is one over a thousand,

50
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,875
while this right over here (thousand of course),

51
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:15,155
actually represents one thousand.
So we've got twenty thousands

52
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:19,448
(that's that right over there)
and five hundred seven thousandths.
