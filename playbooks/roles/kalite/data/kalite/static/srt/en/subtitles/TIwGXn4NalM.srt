1
00:00:00,568 --> 00:00:02,686
I'm now going to do a few classic problems

2
00:00:02,686 --> 00:00:04,677
that show up a lot at math competetions

3
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:06,759
and sometimes on standardized tests,

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,708
and they seem like very daunting

5
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,321
and intimidating problems, but hopefully

6
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:11,386
over the course of this video,

7
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,748
you'll realize that

8
00:00:12,748 --> 00:00:14,221
if you kind of see what they're asking for,

9
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:15,703
it's really not that bad.

10
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:17,208
So let's try this first one right over here.

11
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,127
They tell us

12
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:18,596
a

13
00:00:18,596 --> 00:00:19,009
a +

14
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:19,410
a + b

15
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:19,873
a + b +

16
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:20,467
a + b + c

17
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:21,308
a + b + c =

18
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:21,872
a + b + c = 7

19
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:23,016
and then they ask us, what is

20
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:23,601
5a

21
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:23,602
5a +

22
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:24,023
5a + 5

23
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:24,520
5a + 5b

24
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,006
5a + 5b +

25
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:25,555
5a + 5b + 5

26
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:27,468
5a + 5b + 5c equal to?

27
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:28,552
And the first reaction is like,

28
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:30,950
"Well, you just gave me one equation right over here,

29
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,410
one equation with three unknowns,

30
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,136
how do I solve for a, b, or c?

31
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:35,231
Don't I have to be able to solve for

32
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:36,650
a, b, or c in order to figure out

33
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,802
what 5a + 5b + 5c is?"

34
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:43,919
So I'll let you think about that for a second.

35
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,588
So, the big idea here

36
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:49,418
is to realize that 5a + 5b + 5c

37
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:51,117
that's just the same thing as

38
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:51,813
5

39
00:00:51,813 --> 00:00:52,481
5(

40
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:53,602
5(a

41
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:54,132
5(a +

42
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:55,283
5(a + b

43
00:00:55,283 --> 00:00:55,802
5(a + b +

44
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:56,898
5(a + b + c)

45
00:00:56,898 --> 00:00:58,199
If you distribute the 5 here,

46
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,084
5 times a,

47
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:00,846
5 times b,

48
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:02,031
5 times c,

49
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:04,167
you get 5a + 5b + 5c,

50
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:05,272
another way you can think of it is

51
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:06,942
we are factoring a 5 out.

52
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,219
If you factor a 5 out,

53
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,650
you are left with 5(a + b + c)

54
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,753
Now, how do we evaluate this?

55
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:18,913
Well, that first equation gave us all

56
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,601
the information that we needed.

57
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:24,389
They told us that a + b + c

58
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:25,775
They told us that a + b + c = 7

59
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:28,045
a + b + c

60
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:29,732
a + b + c = 7

61
00:01:29,732 --> 00:01:34,121
so 5(a + b + c) is the same exact thing,

62
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:35,153
and I think you see

63
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:36,515
where this is going now,

64
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:37,368
is 5(

65
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:40,565
is 5(7)

66
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:41,683
is 5(7), and now this becomes

67
00:01:41,683 --> 00:01:43,064
pretty straightforward,

68
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:46,149
and that's going to be equal to 35.

69
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:47,363
Let's do one more of these,

70
00:01:47,363 --> 00:01:48,096
and this is going to be

71
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:49,195
a little bit more involved,

72
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:53,464
but hopefully you see the same idea.

73
00:01:53,464 --> 00:01:55,134
So we're told,

74
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:55,325
a

75
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:55,581
a +

76
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:55,848
a + b

77
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:56,119
a + b +

78
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:56,317
a + b + c

79
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,581
a + b + c is equal to -1

80
00:01:58,581 --> 00:01:59,762
And we have two more variables here,

81
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:00,416
we're told that x

82
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,108
we're told that x + y

83
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:02,000
we're told that x + y is equal to 7

84
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,218
and then they ask us this big hairy thing,

85
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:05,177
what is this equal to?

86
00:02:05,177 --> 00:02:06,453
And I'll give you a few seconds

87
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:09,320
to give it a little bit of thought.

88
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,486
Well, you can imagine,

89
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:11,982
you're given three variables

90
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:13,104
with one equation up here,

91
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:15,336
another two variables with another equation,

92
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,351
we have five unknowns with two equations,

93
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:18,321
there's no way we're going

94
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:19,482
to be able to individually figure out what

95
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:19,698
a

96
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:19,798
a or

97
00:02:19,798 --> 00:02:20,020
a or b

98
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,489
a or b or

99
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:20,672
a or b or c

100
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:20,936
a or b or c or

101
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:21,265
a or b or c or x

102
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:21,500
a or b or c or x or

103
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:21,834
a or b or c or x or y

104
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:22,847
a or b or c or x or y is,

105
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:24,415
but maybe we can use

106
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:25,754
what we saw in the last example

107
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,000
to solve this.

108
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,826
And so what we might want to do

109
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:29,742
is rearrange it so that we have the

110
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:32,582
xs and ys kind of grouped together,

111
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:33,662
and the as, bs, and cs

112
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:34,727
kinda grouped together.

113
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:35,953
So let's try that out.

114
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:36,955
Let's focus first on the

115
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:37,491
as,

116
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:37,862
as, bs,

117
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:38,116
as, bs, and

118
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:38,740
as, bs, and cs

119
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,130
So we have -9a, -9b --

120
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,962
I'll go in alphabetical order --

121
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:46,659
-9b and -9c, and I think you see

122
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:47,984
what's emerging.

123
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:51,665
And then let's work on the xs and the ys.

124
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:55,833
And then we have -7x, and

125
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,567
then we have a -7y

126
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,903
So, all I have done is rearranged

127
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:03,296
this expression here,

128
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,082
but this makes it, in a way,

129
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:07,260
a little bit clearer of what's

130
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,823
going on here.

131
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:12,030
These first three terms,

132
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,452
I can factor our a -9,

133
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:16,076
and I get -9

134
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:17,350
and I get -9(a

135
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,815
and I get -9(a +

136
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:18,921
and I get -9(a + b

137
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:19,183
and I get -9(a + b +

138
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:20,433
and I get -9(a + b + c)

139
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,631
and these second two terms,

140
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:23,319
I can factor out a 7.

141
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,549
-7

142
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:24,985
-7(

143
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:25,655
-7(x

144
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:26,305
-7(x +

145
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:27,203
-7(x + y)

146
00:03:27,203 --> 00:03:27,634
and just to verify,

147
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:28,771
if you wanted to go the other way,

148
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:30,839
multiply this -7 times (x + y)

149
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:31,960
and you'll get this

150
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,935
Multiply -9 times (a + b + c),

151
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:35,528
(distribute it)

152
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:37,519
you'll get this right over here.

153
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,321
And so this makes it a little bit clearer.

154
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:44,054
What is (a + b + c) equal to?

155
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:45,251
Well they tell us right over here,

156
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:49,354
a + b + c is equal to -1

157
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,133
this whole expression is -1,

158
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,088
at least in the parentheses,

159
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:55,338
and what is (x + y) equal to?

160
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:56,746
(Let me do this in a new color)

161
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:58,089
What is (x + y) equal to?

162
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:59,217
Well, they tell us right over here,

163
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:03,371
x + y is equal to 7

164
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:05,964
So this whole thing simplifies to

165
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:06,565
-

166
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:07,536
-9

167
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:08,169
-9(

168
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:08,821
-9(-

169
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:11,643
-9(-1)

170
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:12,117
-9(-1) -

171
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:14,699
-9(-1) - 7

172
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:15,934
-9(-1) - 7(

173
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:18,430
-9(-1) - 7(7)

174
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,465
and so this is equal to--

175
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:21,217
we're in the home stretch--

176
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:25,201
-9(-1), well that's positive 9,

177
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:29,304
and then -7(7) is negative 49

178
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:31,184
so it's 9 - 49,

179
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:31,829
which is equal to

180
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:31,948
which is equal too

181
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:32,095
which is equal tooo

182
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:32,244
which is equal toooo

183
00:04:32,244 --> 00:04:33,582
which is equal toooo!

184
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:35,789
negative 40.

185
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:45,019
And we are done.
