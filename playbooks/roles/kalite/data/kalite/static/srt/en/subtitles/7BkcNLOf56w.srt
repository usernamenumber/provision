1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
Lets do another one of these dependent probability problems

2
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:06,115
You have 4 coins in a bag

3
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:12,199
3 of them are unfair in that they have a 45% chance of

4
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,560
coming up tails when flipped

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,214
the rest are fair

6
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:20,437
so for the rest of them they have a 50% chance of tails or 50% chance of coming heads

7
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:25,852
You randomly choose one coin from the bag and flip it 4 times

8
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:30,352
What is the percent probability of coming 4 heads

9
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:32,329
So lets think about it

10
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:37,083
when we put our hand in the bag and and we take one of the coins out

11
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:40,514
there is some probability that we get an unfair coin

12
00:00:40,514 --> 00:00:50,145
and 3 of the 4 coins are unfair so there is a 3/4 probability that we get an unfair coin

13
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:57,760
and there is only one of the 4 coins which is fair so there is a 1/4 probability

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,006
that i get a fair coin

15
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:04,922
now, given that I have so unfair-- Lets remind ourselves

16
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:11,937
a unfair coin has a 45% chance of coming up tails so this means that I have a 45% chance

17
00:01:11,952 --> 00:01:15,906
of tails which also means -- we have to be careful here

18
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:17,529
because they are asking us about heads

19
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:19,891
If I have a 45% chance of getting tails that means

20
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:24,799
I have a 55% chance of getting heads, right?

21
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,175
when I have a 100% chance of getting on of these 2

22
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:31,252
If its 45% for tails then 100 - 45 is 55 for heads

23
00:01:31,283 --> 00:01:41,160
For the fair coin I have a 50% chance of tails and 50% for heads

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,445
fair enough

25
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:44,699
now I want to know in either of these senarios

26
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:47,891
what is the percent probability of getting 4 heads

27
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:53,475
so if given--I have got the unfair coin the probability of getting

28
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:57,722
4 heads is going to be 55% for each of those flips

29
00:01:57,722 --> 00:02:01,914
so the probability of getting exactly 4 heads is going to be

30
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:12,052
0.55 times 0.55 times 0.55 times 0.55 and so the probability

31
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:17,514
of picking an unfair coin and getting 4 heads in a row

32
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:22,068
is going to be equal 3/4 times all of this business over here

33
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:28,868
so thats 3/4 times and this is 0.55 times itself times 4 times

34
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:35,268
so I could write it as 0.55 to the 4th power

35
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:37,891
And we will get the calculator out in a second

36
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,129
and actually calculate what this is

37
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,337
now lets do the same thing for the fair coin

38
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:43,991
If I did pick a fair coin

39
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:47,060
the probability of getting heads four times in a row

40
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:55,091
is going to be 0.5 times 0.5 times 0.5 times 0.5

41
00:02:55,091 --> 00:03:05,129
or the probability of getting the fair coin which is 1/4 chance and getting 4 heads in the row is going to be

42
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:13,006
1/4 times all of this so its going to be 1/4 times -- this is just 0.5 times itself 4 times so that's

43
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:16,391
so thats 0.5 to the 4th power

44
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:19,952
so lets get the calculator out to caculate one of these

45
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:30,522
so we get 3 divided by 4 times -- and it knows when I do the multiplication

46
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:32,806
its not in the denominator here

47
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:35,422
so its 3/4 times -- and I will just do it in parentheces

48
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:38,345
not to do in parenthesies because it the order of operation

49
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:47,160
so .55 to the fourth power is equal to 0. -- let me write it down

50
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,752
take it off the screen so that I can write properly

51
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:53,437
actually let me do both of these calculations

52
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:55,122
so this probability is that one right over there

53
00:03:55,122 --> 00:04:03,814
and then this one down here is 1 divided by 4 times .5 to the 4th power

54
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:06,760
so its equal to that right over there

55
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,568
and so lets be clear

56
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:14,968
the probability of picking the unfair coin and then getting 4 heads in a row

57
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:20,075
is this top number its like roughly 6.9% chance

58
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:23,637
that you get the unfair coin and then get 4 heads in a row

59
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:27,191
the probability that you get the fair coin and then get 4 heads in a row

60
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:31,099
is even lower -- its only a 1.6% chance

61
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:35,437
now the probability of getting 4 heads in a row either way is going to be

62
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:39,643
the sum of this and this or the sum of that and that

63
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:42,574
which is going to be --let me get my calculator out

64
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:46,381
so its going to be equal to I could just take the previous Ans

65
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:48,312
let me just e type it so that I don't confuse you

66
00:04:48,358 --> 00:05:08,274
so .015625 + .0686296875 -- I am going to round it anyway

67
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,789
wont matter too much

68
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:14,036
so if I take the sum -- let me take this of screen so I can still see

69
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:15,428
and that let me write it

70
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:24,720
so what I got here this one is 0.068629 -- I willl round it 7

71
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,320
and this down here was 0.015625

72
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,036
and when you add these 2 up

73
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:37,182
because we just care about getting 4 heads either way

74
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:40,266
there is a probability of getting it this way, the unfair coin

75
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:42,397
this is the probability of getting it with the fair coin

76
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:46,382
we want it either way so lets add the 2 which we have already

77
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,974
done on our calculator so if you add that number to that number

78
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:56,513
you get 0.08425 -- its keeps going -- I am just going to round it

79
00:05:56,513 --> 00:06:11,443
so this is equal to8.425% or 8.43% chance of getting 4 heads in a row

80
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:14,420
and once again that's a slightly

81
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,536
higher number than if all the coins were fair

82
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:22,105
because there's a 3/4 chance that I get a coin that has

83
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:24,243
a better than even chance of getting heads

84
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:27,066
so thats why this number is going to be a little bit higher than the

85
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:33,697
probability if I had a fair coin of just getting 4 heads in a row
