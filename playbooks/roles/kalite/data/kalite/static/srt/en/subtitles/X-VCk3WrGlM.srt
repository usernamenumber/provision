1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,940
In the last video, we saw a potential mechanism

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,310
where if we reacted hydrogen bromide

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,120
with this alkene right over here,

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,780
that we could essentially add.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,190
We had the addition of this halide

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,060
to what started as an alkene,

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,210
and then it ended up as 2-bromo-pentane, as an alkane.

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,780
But when we did that, we made a somewhat arbitrary decision,

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,750
or I didn't explain why we made the decision.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,630
We said, look, this hydrogen is going to be partially positive,

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,430
because this guy's so electronegative,

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,040
and maybe when it's partially positive, it'll be attracted.

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,680
Maybe it'll just bump in just the right way into

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,710
one of these carbons.

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,510
It'll maybe swipe its electron.

16
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,250
We somewhat arbitrarily in the last video decided

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,220
that it would swipe this guy's electron.

18
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,480
But you could just as easily imagine a world

19
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,830
where it swipes an electron from this guy.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,100
So let's draw a mechanism for that

21
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,050
and just think about

22
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,620
which one is more likely to actually happen.

23
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,390
So what happens?

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,510
So once again, this guy--

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,770
let me draw all of his valence electrons,

26
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,930
so this is the bromine.

27
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,910
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven valence electrons.

28
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,440
You have the hydrogen.

29
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,220
I'll do it in the same color.

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,350
The hydrogen has its electron right there.

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,210
This is partially positive

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,370
and this is partially negative.

33
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,720
The hydrogen might want to swipe one of these electrons away.

34
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,190
Let's do it from this guy right here.

35
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,780
So he has this electron right over here,

36
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,640
so the other side of that bond,

37
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,840
it goes to the hydrogen when the hydrogen goes near it,

38
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,200
or maybe it's attracted to it.

39
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,510
And when it goes to hydrogen,

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,800
then the hydrogen lets go of the electron

41
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,460
that the bromine wanted all along,

42
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,110
because it's so electronegative.

43
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,840
So then that electron goes to the bromine.

44
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,810
So after we do that, what will it look like?

45
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,210
What will be the next step in our reaction?

46
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,710
And it will look fundamentally different

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,020
than this right over here.

48
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,960
So now what happens?

49
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,910
So we have a carbon bonded to two hydrogens,

50
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,170
and it only has a single bond to the other carbon,

51
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,400
which is bonded to the original hydrogen right over there.

52
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,980
Let me write my hydrogens a little bit--

53
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,950
actually, let me write this whole thing a little bit neater.

54
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,660
So you have your carbon bonded to a hydrogen

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,790
and another hydrogen,

56
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,570
and now it only has a single bond to this carbon right here,

57
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,780
which is bonded to a hydrogen and then the rest of the chain.

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,530
Let me just draw the rest of the chain right here.

59
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,160
And now this electron went to the hydrogen.

60
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,390
The other electron that

61
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,130
it was paired with is still with this carbon,

62
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,820
so now this carbon is now bonded to

63
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,030
that hydrogen over there.

64
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,790
So this blue electron is now with the hydrogen.

65
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,520
Let me draw.

66
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,780
So the blue electron that was here

67
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,000
has now gone over to the orange hydrogen.

68
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,660
Let me draw it a little bit neater than that.

69
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,430
It has now gone over to this hydrogen right over there.

70
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,310
And then the hydrogen lost its electron to the bromine.

71
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,530
So the bromine originally had seven valence electrons:

72
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,390
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

73
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,120
And then it nabbed an extra electron from the hydrogen,

74
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,880
so now it will have a negative charge.

75
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,640
It is a negative ion.

76
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,660
It is bromide.

77
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,200
It's a bromide anion, I guess you could call it.

78
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,930
And since this guy lost an electron,

79
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,210
he had four valence electrons, lost one to the hydrogen,

80
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,140
he now has a positive charge.

81
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,250
He's a carbocation.

82
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,710
So notice the difference.

83
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,800
Before, this guy lost the electron,

84
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,170
and so the hydrogen bonded to this carbon.

85
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,490
In this situation, this guy lost the electron,

86
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,290
so the hydrogen bonded to the other carbon.

87
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,410
And so you can imagine, from here,

88
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,680
something very similar happens

89
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,260
as what happened in the first video,

90
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,200
but now it happens to this carbon right over there.

91
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,650
So let's do that.

92
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,920
This carbon is positive.

93
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,920
The bromide ion is obviously negative,

94
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,830
so maybe he'll want to swipe his electron away.

95
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,560
So this electron then goes to the carbocation

96
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,500
and then it will form a bond.

97
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,020
This green will go to the carbocation

98
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,700
and then this purple one still stays with the bromine.

99
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,910
And so they'll have a bond.

100
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,350
They're paired up, you can imagine it.

101
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,880
So then we're left with,

102
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,810
we have a carbon.

103
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,190
We have our original hydrogens.

104
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,530
We have this carbon, that hydrogen,

105
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,760
the rest of the chain: CH2, CH3.

106
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,940
And then you have this hydrogen right here that it bonded to.

107
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,510
That was our first step.

108
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,470
And now the bromine has bonded to this carbon right over here.

109
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,960
The bromine has bonded over to that carbon right over there.

110
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,800
And we're done!

111
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,140
This is another possible mechanism.

112
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,380
This one we ended up with 2-bromopentane, right?

113
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,740
Because it's on the number two carbon.

114
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,100
Here we have 1-bromo-pentane.

115
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,470
One, two, three, four, five.

116
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,340
Still five carbons.

117
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,000
It's just the bromine is attached to the one carbon here,

118
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,890
attached to the two carbon here.

119
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,220
So we now need to think about it,

120
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,960
because on a first cut,

121
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,470
these both seemed like reasonable mechanisms.

122
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,110
But if you did it experimentally,

123
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,070
you would see that this is the one that you'd really observe.

124
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,700
I actually haven't done this exact experiment,

125
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,620
so I don't know the proportions.

126
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,650
But you're going to observe this one disproportionately.

127
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,390
The great majority of the products

128
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,120
that you see are going to be this one, not that one.

129
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,270
And so the question is, well, you know,

130
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,760
they both seem like reasonable things to do up here.

131
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,760
Why is this one so much more likely to happen than that one?

132
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:57,810
It all comes from something called Markovnikov's rule.

133
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,860
And there's a couple of ways to think about it.

134
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,640
When Markovnikov thought it up, or he observed it,

135
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,530
it seemed to work.

136
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,630
They weren't 100% sure about why it worked.

137
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,650
We can think a little bit about why it worked.

138
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,140
So Markovnikov's rule,

139
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,130
a couple of ways you can think about it.

140
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,650
You can think of it as the thing that already has more hydrogens

141
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,960
is more likely to get more hydrogens,

142
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,970
so that's what happened here.

143
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,760
This thing had more hydrogens on it

144
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,570
than the right carbon right here.

145
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,290
This right carbon had a hydrogen,

146
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,810
but it had some other alkyl group attached to it.

147
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,800
And so the thing that had more hydrogens

148
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,240
ended up with the hydrogen,

149
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,790
and then the thing that had more groups,

150
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,870
this character right here had more groups, right?

151
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,120
He had one group over here.

152
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,450
This carbon over here had no groups.

153
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,480
He ended up with the bromine.

154
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,050
So the thing that has more hydrogens

155
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,980
ends up with more hydrogens.

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,920
The thing that has more groups ends up with more groups.

157
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,720
So I guess you kind of go more in the direction

158
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,020
that you are going in.

159
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,130
But that still is just a rule, so why does that make sense?

160
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,050
It starts to make sense when you think about

161
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,640
that in both mechanisms,

162
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,390
we had to have a carbocation.

163
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,850
We talked about it in the last video.

164
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,160
We had a carbocation right over there.

165
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,150
This is the left carbon being a carbocation.

166
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,400
This is the right carbon being a carbocation.

167
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,950
And Markovnikov's rule all comes from

168
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,320
which carbocation is more stable,

169
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,280
which one has a lower energy level.

170
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,980
It turns out that the carbocation

171
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:33,650
that is a bonded to more electron-rich molecules or atoms

172
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,600
is going to be more stable.

173
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,790
You can imagine it has more things that,

174
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,210
look, it's positive, but it has more carbons around it

175
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,880
so it can share some of those electrons.

176
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,300
The electron clouds will help it out a little bit

177
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,650
to be a little bit more stable.

178
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,000
This one right here is only bonded to one other carbon,

179
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,960
so not as much sharing.

180
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,950
This is bonded to two.

181
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,680
So, in general, when you're only bonded to one other carbon,

182
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,240
you're called a primary carbon.

183
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,460
And if you're carbocation,

184
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,860
this is a primary carbocation right here.

185
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,130
This guy is bonded to two carbons,

186
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,830
so he would be called a secondary carbon.

187
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,180
Since it's a carbocation, it's a secondary carbocation,

188
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,680
so this right here is secondary.

189
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,450
So a secondary carbocation is more stable than a primary.

190
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,150
And actually a tertiary,

191
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,090
if you had another carbon group here or something else

192
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,380
that had a lot of electrons around it,

193
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,600
that would be even more stable.

194
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,840
So bonded to three things, more stable than two things.

195
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,470
And when I say two things, two things other than hydrogen,

196
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,460
and then, more stable than one.

197
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,980
So Markovnikov's rule all is a byproduct of the fact

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,040
that this carbocation is more stable

199
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,960
than this one over here.

200
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,410
That's because it's secondary versus primary.

201
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,400
Because it's secondary,

202
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,350
it can borrow electrons from some of its friends.

203
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,820
It has more neighbors to borrow electrons than this one.

204
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,250
And since this is more stable,

205
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,020
this is more likely to happen.

206
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,670
This is a more likely intermediate to have.

207
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,860
This is a less likely outcome to have in general.

208
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,460
And that's why you're more likely

209
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,550
to get to this left product,

210
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,960
the 2-bromo-pentane than the 1-bromo-pentane.
