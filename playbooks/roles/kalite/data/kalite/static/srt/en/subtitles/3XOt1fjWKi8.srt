1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:04,669
We're asked to identify the numerator and denominator

2
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:07,881
in the fraction three over four, or three-fourths.

3
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:11,171
Let's rewrite this, so it's nice and big.

4
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:12,700
So let me just write the fraction.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,979
So we have three over

6
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:18,555
three over four.

7
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:20,476
Three over four.

8
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:23,700
Now, they want us to identify the numerator and denominator,

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,967
The Numerator.

10
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:28,500
So the numerator is just the number on top.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,363
So the numerator is the three right there.

12
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:33,839
And then they want us to find the denominator.

13
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:36,962
The denominator is just the number on the bottom.

14
00:00:36,962 --> 00:00:38,210
It's the four.

15
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,579
So if they say, what's the numerator? Three.

16
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,110
What's the denominator? It's four.

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,457
Just the number on the bottom.

18
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:44,539
They could have just called this the

19
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:45,500
number on the bottom,

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,605
they could have just called this

21
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:47,685
the number on the top.

22
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:49,206
Now to think about what this represents,

23
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:50,638
what this fraction represents,

24
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:53,361
you can think of it as three out of four

25
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:55,310
pieces of a pie, that's how I think about it.

26
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,589
You can imagine, the denominator tells us

27
00:00:57,589 --> 00:00:59,538
What are we taking a fraction out of?

28
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:01,680
Or how many pieces are there?

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,543
So let's imagine a pie like this.

30
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:05,212
So we could draw it like,

31
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:07,739
well we could draw it as a square pie,

32
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,481
So we could draw it as a square pie,

33
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:13,207
So this is what the denominator represents,

34
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,940
this is what the number on the bottom represents.

35
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,596
And then three says,

36
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:21,851
We are representing three of those four pieces.

37
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:25,179
So this three tells us that out of four possible ones,

38
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:27,692
we are using three.

39
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:30,541
Or maybe we're eating three.

40
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,594
So you can imagine someone says,

41
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:33,557
"I ate three-fourths of a pie"

42
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:35,147
This would be read as three-fourths,

43
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:37,560
they're eating the blue portion of the pie

44
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,821
if we cut it this way.

45
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,460
If we imagine a round pie,

46
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,098
it would look like this--

47
00:01:42,098 --> 00:01:44,374
Let me draw a round pie...

48
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:46,859
So that is my round pie.

49
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,061
Let me cut it into four equal pieces.

50
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:52,287
Or roughly equal pieces.

51
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:54,444
And if someone says,

52
00:01:54,444 --> 00:01:57,878
"I ate three-fourths of this pie"

53
00:01:57,878 --> 00:01:59,891
where the three is the numerator,

54
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:01,090
and then the four, and you'd

55
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,791
read that as three-fourths,

56
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,294
The four is the denominator.

57
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:06,394
They would eat this much of the pie.

58
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:10,208
They would eat three of the four pieces.

59
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,074
They would eat three of the four.

60
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:15,724
So this is one piece, this is two pieces,

61
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:20,834
and this is three pieces.

62
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,081
So you can imagine the four,

63
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:22,999
the denominator,

64
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:25,147
represents the total number of pieces

65
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:27,426
in the pie, and the three represents

66
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:30,356
how many of those we ate.
