1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,720
We're asked to solve and graph
this system of equations here.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,810
And just as a bit of a review,
solving a system of equations

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,090
really just means figuring out
the x and y value that will

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,910
satisfy both of these
equations.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,230
And one way to do it is to use
one of the equations to solve

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,990
for either the x or the y, and
then substitute for that value

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,820
in the other one.

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,870
That makes sure that you're
making use of both

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,780
constraints.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,830
So let's start with this bottom
equation right here.

12
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,900
So we have y minus
x is equal to 5.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,100
It's pretty straightforward
to solve for y here.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,350
We just have to add x to both
sides of this equation.

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,850
So add x.

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,800
And so the left-hand side,
these x's cancel out, the

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,980
negative x and the positive x,
and we're left with y is equal

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,520
to 5 plus x.

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,780
   

20
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,970
Now, the whole point of me doing
that, is now any time we

21
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,340
see a y in the other equation,
we can replace it

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,970
with a 5 plus x.

23
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,010
So the other equation was-- let
me do it in this orange

24
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,940
color-- 9x plus 3y
is equal to 15.

25
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,020
This second equation told us, if
we just rearranged it, that

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,840
y is equal to 5 plus x, so we
can replace y in the second

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,740
equation with 5 plus x.

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,460
That makes sure we're making
use of both constraints.

29
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,260
So let's do that.

30
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,100
We're going to replace
y with 5 plus x.

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,380
So this 9x plus 3y equals 15
becomes 9x plus 3 times y.

32
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,540
The second equation says
y is 5 plus x.

33
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,510
So we're going to put 5 plus
x there instead of a y.

34
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:42,020
3 times 5 plus x
is equal to 15.

35
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,520
And now we can just
solve for x.

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,970
We get 9x plus 3 times 5
is 15 plus 3 times x is

37
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,720
3x is equal to 15.

38
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:04,870
So we can add the 9x and the 3x,
so we get 12x, plus 15, is

39
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,570
equal to 15.

40
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:13,820
Now we can subtract 15 from both
sides, just so you get

41
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,870
only x terms on the
left-hand side.

42
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,270
These guys cancel each other
out, and you're left with 12x

43
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,210
is equal to 0.

44
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,480
Now you divide both sides by 12,
and you get x is equal to

45
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,380
0/12, or x is equal to 0.

46
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,160
So let me scroll down
a little bit.

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,880
So x is equal to 0.

48
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,430
   

49
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,520
Now if x equals 0, what is y?

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,850
Well, we could substitute
into either one of these

51
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,750
equations up here.

52
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,610
If we substitute x equals 0 in
this first equation, you get 9

53
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:51,340
times 0 plus 3y is
equal to 15.

54
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,100
Or that's just a 0, so you
get 3y is equal to 15.

55
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,730
Divide both sides by 3, you get
y is equal to 15/3 or 5.

56
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,170
y is equal to 5.

57
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,040
And we can test that that also
satisfies this equation.

58
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,760
y, 5, minus 0 is also
equal to 5.

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,720
So the value x is equal to--
I'll do this in green. x is

60
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,690
equal to 0, y is equal
to 5 satisfies

61
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,590
both of these equations.

62
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,230
So we've done the first part.

63
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,430
Let's do the second part, where
we're asked to graph it.

64
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,510
The second equation is pretty
straightforward to graph.

65
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,420
We actually ended up putting
it in mx plus

66
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,650
b form right there.

67
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,130
And actually, let
me rewrite it.

68
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,330
Let me just switch the x and the
5, so it really is in that

69
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,550
mx plus b form.

70
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,710
So y is equal to x plus 5.

71
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:45,185
So its y-intercept is 5--
1, 2, 3, 4, 5-- and

72
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:46,690
its slope is 1, right?

73
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,040
There's a 1 implicitly being
multiplied, or the x is being

74
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,650
multiplied by 1.

75
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,830
So it looks like Let me see
how well I can draw it.

76
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,450
The line will look like that.

77
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,640
It has a slope of 1.

78
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,560
You move back 1,
you go down 1.

79
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,960
You move forward
1, you go up 1.

80
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,750
That's a pretty good job.

81
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,670
So that right here
is this equation.

82
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,760
Now let's graph that
top equation.

83
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,530
And we just have to put it
in mx plus b form, or

84
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,079
slope-intercept form.

85
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,110
And I'll do that in green.

86
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,620
So we have 9x plus 3y
is equal to 15.

87
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,630
One simplification we can do
right from the get-go is every

88
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,620
number here is divisible by
3, so let's just divide

89
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,460
everything by 3 to make
things simpler.

90
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,180
So we get 3x plus
y is equal to 5.

91
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,430
Now we can subtract 3x
from both sides.

92
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,380
   

93
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,900
We are left with y is equal
to negative 3x plus 5.

94
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,955
So that's what this first
equation gets turned into, if

95
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:54,740
you put it in slope-intercept
form. y is equal to

96
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,850
negative 3x plus 5.

97
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,100
So if you were to graph it,
the y-intercept is 5.

98
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,900
0, 5.

99
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,350
And then its slope
is negative 3.

100
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,570
So you move 1 in the
x-direction, you move down 3

101
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,970
in the y-direction.

102
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,210
Move 2, you would move down 6.

103
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,870
2, 4, 6.

104
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,120
Move 2, you go 2, 4, 6.

105
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,190
So this line is going to look
something like this.

106
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:23,410
It's going to look something
like that right there.

107
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,160
As you can see, the solution to
this system is the point of

108
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,090
intersection of these
two lines.

109
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,900
It's the combination of x and y
that satisfy both of these.

110
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,090
Remember, this pink line, or
this red line, is all of the

111
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,670
x's and y's that satisfy
this equation: y minus

112
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,060
x is equal to 5.

113
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,060
This green line is all of the
x's and y's, or all the

114
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,810
combinations of them, that
satisfy this first equation.

115
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,950
Now, the one x and y combination
that satisfies

116
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,420
both is their point
of intersection.

117
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,370
And we figured it out
algebraically using

118
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,320
substitution.

119
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,780
That happens at x is equal to 0,
y is equal to 5. x is equal

120
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,600
to 0-- this is the x-axis-- y
is equal to 5 right there.
