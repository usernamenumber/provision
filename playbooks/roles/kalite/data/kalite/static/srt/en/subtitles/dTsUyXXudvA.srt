1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,786
So we talked about inhaling and exhaling.

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:07,206
And I mentioned that the key first step 
for both of them is kind of

3
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:10,374
the change in volume: going up in volume 
and going down in volume.

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,239
But I didn't really talk about how that happens exactly.

5
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:15,409
So, I'll kind of jump into that now.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,299
And let me begin by telling you that 
in the middle of your chess,

7
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:22,424
you have this enormous kind of bone that goes down.

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,587
I'm drawing it out of proportion 
just to make it very clear

9
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:26,756
where the bone is being.

10
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:30,550
Go ahead and feel on your own body 
this bone which we called

11
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:35,541
either the breast bone or the more 
technical name is sternum.

12
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:36,800
Write that down here.

13
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:39,724
The sternum is this middle bone and

14
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:42,784
all the ribs on both sides attached there.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,830
So, you've got a total of 14 ribs and 7 pairs of them.

16
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:51,288
Actually, I should say 14 pairs of ribs.

17
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:53,639
I don't want you to think there're 14 in total.

18
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:57,260
There are actually 14 in total and 7 pairs of the ribs.

19
00:00:57,452 --> 00:01:03,451
So 14 ribs actually attached directly 
to this bone, the sternum bone.

20
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:05,552
So in white, these are the ribs.

21
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:07,580
And between the ribs, you actually have muscles.

22
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:10,682
So I'm gonna draw some of these muscles 
between the ribs.

23
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:14,700
And these muscles are all going to have 
their own nerve

24
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:17,502
that allows them to contract.

25
00:01:17,718 --> 00:01:23,681
So, these muscles are controlled 
by your body or your brain.

26
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:29,371
And their name, let me just jot down here on the side, 
is "intercostal muscle".

27
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:32,843
And "inter" just means "between". 
So, this is the name of the muscle.

28
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:35,914
And "costal" refers to the ribs.

29
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:37,818
So, when you see that word "costal",

30
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,217
you'll know we're talking about the ribs.

31
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:44,121
So what's between the ribs is these muscles: 
intercostal muscles.

32
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:47,858
And they're gonna start moving outwards

33
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:50,877
when your brain says, 
"hey I want to take a deep breath!"

34
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:53,717
So, these muscles are going to contract

35
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:57,045
and the ribs are gonna move outwards.

36
00:01:57,234 --> 00:02:00,579
So these go out. And you also have...

37
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,909
Let me just make a little bit of space on this xxx.

38
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:06,336
You also have another muscle 
that kind of right down here.

39
00:02:06,548 --> 00:02:11,375
And it has kind of a an upside down U shape to it.

40
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:15,275
So I'm drawing it kind of like a dome. 
You can think of it as a dome.

41
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:19,147
And this dome is the floor. If you remember,

42
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:20,995
we talked about the floor of the thorax.

43
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,174
So this is of course, our diaphram muscle.

44
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:25,510
So, you've got a diaphragm muscle.

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,086
And this one when it contracts, it's gonna go...

46
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:30,426
instead of going out, it's gonna go down.

47
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:32,922
So it's gonna kind of flatten out.

48
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:38,631
And I can actually draw this if you just 
stick with me for a moment.

49
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:40,528
I'm gonna erase this dome-like shape.

50
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:44,955
And I'm gonna draw it when it looks like as it's contract.

51
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:47,154
So when it contracts, this is actually 
going to be more flat.

52
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:53,623
And this flat diaphragm, as you can see, is now

53
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,678
further down that it used to be.

54
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:59,206
And as it goes down, all of the structures

55
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:01,693
that are inside the space, so the two lungs,

56
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,530
and of course, I didn't draw the heart here,

57
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,488
but the heart would be this kind of this cardiac notch.

58
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:08,618
If you want me to, I can even draw that heart here.

59
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,164
This is our heart here.

60
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,082
They're all going to kind of physically moved down.

61
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:15,347
So this is our heart and our lungs.

62
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:20,443
They are physically gonna be kind of drawn downwards and out.

63
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:25,813
They're gonna also move out as 
the intercostal muscles move out.

64
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:30,166
So you have expansion of these lungs, 
that's basically the idea.

65
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:32,084
And if you kind of zoom in on this,

66
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:35,015
to kind of see exactly what this expansion looks like,

67
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:38,198
when I say, you know, you have more volume, the lungs,

68
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:41,573
really what I should be saying, 
if I want to be more exact,

69
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,496
is that all the alveoli, if these are the alveoli,

70
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,819
let's say this is another branch,

71
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:48,411
this is another alveolar right here;

72
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:52,300
all these alveoli, they are actually expanding.

73
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:56,631
And you have about 500 million alveoli.

74
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,383
You can just kind of fathom how big a number that it is.

75
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:01,237
It's an enormous number of alveoli.

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,925
If I was actually drawing them here... drawing forever, right?

77
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,878
It'll take forever to kind of write out 
this many different alveoli.

78
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:12,371
But basically what happens is that, when the ribs go out,

79
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:13,505
the diaphragm moves down.

80
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:19,933
These alveoli are actually being pulled out. 
They are actually pulled outwards.

81
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:23,417
So they are actually gonna be getting larger in size.

82
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:25,304
They literally look like they've grown in size.

83
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:28,269
And, this is what they look like.

84
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,175
And actually, if you take even a closer look,

85
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:35,986
you'll see that these alveoli have around them, 
a bunch of protein.

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,242
The cells around them have a bunch of protein.

87
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:41,629
And this protein is called "elastin".

88
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:45,382
And you can guess what elastin might do.

89
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:48,777
It has kind of a similar sound to the word "elastic".

90
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:52,525
Elastin is basically kind of like a rubber band.

91
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:55,796
So you kind of thinking of elastin as a rubber band.

92
00:04:55,948 --> 00:05:00,035
And, when the muscles move down and out,

93
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:03,210
and the alveoli pulled open,

94
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:05,247
let me actually kind of scroll up,

95
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,726
because you can kind of go back to the idea of inhaling.

96
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,639
What is happening? Well, we have 
a couple things happening.

97
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:17,419
One, you have muscles contracting. Muscles contract.

98
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:20,015
And when I say "muscles", you know I'm talking about

99
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:21,932
all those intercostal muscles in your diaphragm.

100
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,692
And as a result of the muscles contracting,

101
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:30,269
you have now the alveoli, alveoli are streched open.

102
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:33,527
So those rubber bands are elastin, protein,

103
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,283
are literally physically being stretched open.

104
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:39,203
So the alveoli are stretched open.

105
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:45,386
And keep that in mind, because 
what's gonna happen then is,

106
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:48,855
when the muscles relax, which is 
what happens when you exhale,

107
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:50,883
when the muscles relax,

108
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:54,158
what do you think is going to happen to that elastin?

109
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:55,360
Well, it's like a rubber band,

110
00:05:55,518 --> 00:05:56,926
if that's what I'm saying, it's gonna be like,

111
00:05:57,085 --> 00:06:01,828
then the alveoli are going to recoil. 
They are gonna recoil.

112
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:06,859
And that's actually the driving force for 
why the volume goes back down.

113
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:09,661
So if you have a bunch of rubber bands 
that you're stretching out...

114
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,171
Let me actually bring up the picture 
so you'll see really clearly.

115
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:17,367
If you're physically kind of using your muscles 
to help pull this stuff open,

116
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:22,198
then the moment that you start pulling open, 
the moment that you,

117
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,651
you know, stop contracting those muscles,

118
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:26,203
now you have a nice big volume.

119
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,013
What's gonna happen?

120
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:31,915
All these elastin molecules are gonna snap back.

121
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,218
We'll do it with a different color.

122
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:34,937
I'll do it with this color.

123
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:37,374
They are gonna snap back like this.

124
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:42,766
All that protein are gonna snap back into 
kind of the original size.

125
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,234
And when they do, this thing gets smaller.

126
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:48,552
So my alveoli kind of goes back to its original size,

127
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:50,298
which is much smaller than this.

128
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,765
Let me actually show you that

129
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,815
even though contraction is what opens up things

130
00:06:57,008 --> 00:07:01,494
it's the recoil that kind of brings things back down 
to their normal size.

131
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,019
Let me erase this to make it kind of neater drawing.

132
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:09,185
So you can see it now, inhaling, the way that 
we actually increase the volume,

133
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:12,098
is by pulling things open through contraction.

134
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,161
And this actually requires energy, right?

135
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:20,380
Remember, you can't contract a muscle 
without spending chemical energy.

136
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:22,532
So this takes chemical energy.

137
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:25,837
And we usually think of this molecule ATP

138
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,921
as the specific type of chemical energy 
we're gonna use.

139
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:33,707
And to exhale, when you reduce the volume,

140
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:37,034
it's gonna be driven by this elastic recoil.

141
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,308
So that's a type of elastic potential energy.

142
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:48,283
So, this process of kind of inhaling and exhaling

143
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:50,292
is really a little different from each other.

144
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,518
On the one hand, you're using ATP;

145
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:54,489
you're actually burning through these molecules.

146
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:55,960
And when you exhale,

147
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:58,666
you're actually not using chemical energy anymore.

148
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:01,210
You're just using that elastic potential energy,

149
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,005
kind of the same sort of energy that you can imagine

150
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:06,753
you would have if you snap a rubber band.

151
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,392
So, let's stop there. We'll pick up the next video.
