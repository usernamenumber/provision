00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:09,859
What I want to do in this video is try to get a

2
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:11,896
good understanding of how the US Federal

3
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:14,246
income tax rates schedule works and also

4
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:15,951
what people mean when they say tax

5
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:18,790
brackets or what it means to be in a tax bracket

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,861
So let's say that I make a hundred thousand dollars

7
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,284
and I'm single and I'm not going to go into

8
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:26,308
the deductions or anything fancy like that

9
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:29,844
So let's say I make one hundred thousand

10
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:31,584
dollars in a given year

11
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:33,527
and these numbers will change as the tax

12
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:36,658
code changes but the general idea is the

13
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:38,434
same thing although the details might change

14
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:41,127
so the way the rate schedule works is that

15
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,343
the first eight thousand three hundred and

16
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:46,582
fifty (8350) of my 100 000 dollars will be

17
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:51,682
taxed at 10%. so the first 8350 dollars will be taxed at 10%.

18
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:57,999
so I'll be paying what thats pretty easy to calculate I'll be paying eighthundred and thirty-five dollars on that first

19
00:00:58,253 --> 00:01:05,685
8350 dollars. now the next 25 600

20
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:14,020
or the next from 8350 to 33950 that will be taxed at 15% that will be taxed at 15%. s

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:20,736
so this amount right over here

22
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:34,769
i will have to pay 15% on that. so the difference between 33950 and 8350 is 25600. so 25600 times 15%.

23
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,870
i will calculate it all at the end using a calculator.

24
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:44,235
now the next 48300 dollars is going to be taxed at 25%

25
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:48,186
so let me draw that over here. so the next, this next slug over here is going to be taxed at 25%. this

26
00:01:48,186 --> 00:02:06,570
is the difference between 82250 and 33950 that is 48300. so its going to be 48300 times 25%. and then

27
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,870
finally the remainder the amount above 82250 since I dont get into the next bracket above that this part

28
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:20,668
right here is going to be taxed at 28%. so this part right over here is going to be taxed at 28%. let

29
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:28,020
me get my trusty calculator out to figure out what that is so if that's going to be taxed at so the difference

30
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:44,136
between 100000 dollars and 82250. so 100, 100 thousand dollars minus eighty two fifty is 17750 so is

31
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:55,585
17750 times 28%. and now i can use the calculator to calculate all of these. so its going to

32
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:57,838
be lets do it all at once.

33
00:02:57,838 --> 00:03:06,726
17750 times 28%. ill say that as point two eight percent.

34
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:07,226
plus 48300, forty eight thousand three hundred

35
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:27,562
times 25% , point two five. plus 25600, 25600 times 15% point one five finally plus eight hundred and

36
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:41,262
thirty five dollars. im going to pay 21720 dollars. so this is the sum of all of these in total, im going to pay 21 000 i already forgot the number

37
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:46,946
twenty one thousand seven hundred, seven hundred and twenty.

38
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:50,846
dollars. and i want to make sure you don't have the misconception. notice you only pay 28% on the incremental

39
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:52,847
amount when you enter that bracket

40
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:57,062
so you dont pay this 28%% on the entire hundred thousand dollars. just on the increment above 2250.

41
00:03:57,062 --> 00:04:01,062
you dont pay the 25% of the entire amount just the increment between the 33 and 82.
