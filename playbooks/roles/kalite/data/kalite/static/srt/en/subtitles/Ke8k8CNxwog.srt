1
00:00:00,464 --> 00:00:03,771
We were able to already answer some interesting questions

2
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:08,341
about the different plans at super yoga studio, using the equations we set up.

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,092
But I'm a very visual guy.

4
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:15,455
I wanna make sure I analyze the problem fully before I spend my hard earned dollars.

5
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:17,613
What I wanna do now,

6
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:21,649
is really see a visual representation for the relationsship between

7
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:25,544
how many session I attend and how much its gonna cost me.

8
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:29,240
I'm gonna do it for the trial plan and the basic plan.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,440
And to do that down here on the horizontal axis, I'm going to plot the number of sessions I attend.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,557
So S is equal to the number of session I attend.

11
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:41,778
And here on the vertical axis,

12
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:46,964
I'm gonna plot how much its gonna cost me depending on how how many session I attend.

13
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,631
So C is equal is equal to my monthly cost.

14
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:53,599
So let's think about these points right over here,

15
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:56,009
and how these equations relates to what we might end up drawing.

16
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:04,138
So the first point here, is that if I spend, if I go to no sessions,

17
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:06,239
it's gonna cost me zero dollars.

18
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,606
Where would I plot that?

19
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:10,272
Right over here.

20
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:15,890
If I attend no session, and I should have marked off zero here, its gonna cost me zero dollars.

21
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,873
That is this point. Just like that.

22
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:24,687
If I attend 1 session, it will be $12.

23
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:26,763
Where would I plot that?

24
00:01:26,763 --> 00:01:30,843
Well, 1 session is gonna cost me $12.

25
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:34,746
This is $15 so $12 is right around there.

26
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:36,750
I'll put it there.

27
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,947
If I attend 2 sessions, where would I plot that?

28
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:49,465
Well, 2 session is going to cost me $24, so right about there.

29
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:51,407
What about 3 sessions?

30
00:01:51,407 --> 00:01:53,813
I could keep going to 4, 5, 6 sessions,

31
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:57,814
but I'll try 3, and I think you get the general idea.

32
00:01:57,814 --> 00:02:03,893
3 sessions cost $36.

33
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:06,324
You see that all of these points seem to sit on a line.

34
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:08,502
I will attempt my best to draw that line.

35
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:16,644
And this line, it essentially describes all the possible combination of cost for a given number of sessions.

36
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:20,565
So any point, specially if we allow fractional sessions.

37
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:26,208
That is not conventional practice for most yoga studios but this one is a Super Yoga studio.

38
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:31,843
and it allows you to attend 4 1/2 session or 1 1/2 sessions or exactly half a session.

39
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:35,197
So if you attend half a session, its going to cost you $6.

40
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,516
Another way to think about it is,

41
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:40,746
if you attend zero session it'll be zero dollars.

42
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:47,167
But then as you add a session, so you go one step right, it's going to cost you $12 more.

43
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,874
so then you are gonna go up $12,

44
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:56,174
so we went to right one, we went up $12. If we go to the right one more we go $12 up again.

45
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:59,895
Because every session we add is gonna cost us $12 extra $12.

46
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:05,878
We go from $0 to $12 to $24 to $36, if you add another session you add another $12.

47
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,599
If you take away a session you will go $12 down.

48
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,172
It is a kind of way of thinking about how steep this line is.

49
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:16,542
Every time you go one to the right you go $12 up.

50
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:19,630
Now, let's think about the same thing for the basic plan.

51
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,314
How we might plot that.

52
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:26,276
We will start with this point right over here.

53
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:31,533
And basic plan, when I go to zero session it costs me $20.

54
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:35,633
Where would I plot that on my graph?

55
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:39,862
So zero session is going to cost me $20. That is that point over there.

56
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:44,161
What about one session?

57
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:49,911
Well one session is going to cost me $28.

58
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:54,474
Another way of thinking about it: you pay $20 no matter what

59
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:59,546
and as you add one session your total cost went up $8.

60
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:01,588
This scale and this scale is not the same.

61
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:05,010
If I did it to scale you would see these lines would look a lot steeper,

62
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,452
and I would have to let this axis go a lot taller.

63
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:12,394
But hopefully you get the idea, you add one session, we went up by $8.

64
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:14,166
You add another session,

65
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,026
so that was 1 and $28. That is that point over there.

66
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:22,111
If you have 2 sessions, its gonna cost us $36.

67
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:25,335
Where would we plot that?

68
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:29,614
2 sessions are gonna cost $36 so, that is over there.

69
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,949
Or another way to think of it.

70
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:36,935
We were at $28 and we added a session, so we add another $8 to our cost.

71
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:41,149
So $28 plus $8 gets us to $36.

72
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:44,187
Now let's do this other point. And once again, we can keep going.

73
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:48,118
Where would we plot the 3 sessions?

74
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:51,793
So, if we attend 3 sessions, its gonna cost us $44.

75
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:57,127
That's right about there.

76
00:04:57,127 --> 00:05:00,633
Once again we added a sessions and we added $8 to our cost.

77
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:17,431
And you see these two seem to..., although I did not draw it as well as I can, these two seem to sit on a line.

78
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:19,268
This by itself is interesting,

79
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:24,143
but what might be even more interesting, is where these two lines intersect.

80
00:05:24,143 --> 00:05:29,217
We see that they have different steepnesses so at some point they should intersect

81
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:30,500
And what's exciting about...

82
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,528
Well, actually, I will let you think about it.

83
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:35,231
What is exciting about where these two lines intersect?

84
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:40,244
What does it tell us about the sessions and the cost at those points?

85
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:45,689
I'll leave you there, and we will explore this more in the next video.
