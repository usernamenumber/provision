1
00:00:06,718 --> 00:00:10,446
- So, here we are at Dulwich Picture Gallery, in London and we are looking at

2
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:14,710
Rembrandt - A girl at the window, which is from about 1645

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,203
and this is just one of those pictures that... it hooks you. You know, when you're

4
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:21,551
at the cafe, and you're staring out, just gazing at the world go by.

5
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:24,046
That's what she seems to be doing in this picture.

6
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:27,278
And that rosy cheeks. But just like gazing off into the distance.

7
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,402
- Yeah, that's true. And being the viewer of this painting kinda puts you

8
00:00:30,402 --> 00:00:33,737
into that imagined scenario that she's looking at.

9
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:37,469
If you'd kinda walk back and forth, it kinda is one of those portraits that

10
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,839
seems like her eyes follow you.

11
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:43,374
- The way we're gazing at her she's gazing back at us.

12
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:46,905
- And it's funny because there's very little background with us. I mean, we don't really know

13
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:51,236
where she is. And it's called "Girl at the window", but you don't see much of a window there.

14
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:53,721
- Definitely, leaning on the ledge.

15
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:56,885
- And yet she's so captivating, even without any background.

16
00:00:56,885 --> 00:01:00,365
- Rosy cheeks... she makes you think what temperature it is, what she'd been doing

17
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:04,216
to have those cheeks. Is she always like that, you know, flashed in her face.

18
00:01:04,216 --> 00:01:07,293
And her age, you know, when I first looked I thought: "A young girl."

19
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:10,104
And the more I look at her, the more I see some kind of...seems to be wisdom in there.

20
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:13,846
She's got gold chains on around her neck. She's holding them, so it makes you

21
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:17,342
question this states, 'cause her clothes, again...

22
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:20,111
Is that a night dress? Is she a servant girl?

23
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:23,882
- I mean, to Rembrandt's credit, of course, but he really does make you

24
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:28,097
kind of psychologically interested in her, without giving you...

25
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:30,206
I mean, he hasn't put house in the background

26
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:34,053
and he hasn't given her clothes that exactly tell you who she is or how old she is.

27
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:40,306
And he kind of made you interested in her simply by how he's painted her in this very basic way.

28
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:42,938
- And her parted lips...Is that a smile?

29
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:45,175
It's almost that Mona Lisa question, isn't it?

30
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:46,365
Is she smiling at us? Is she not?

31
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:48,466
Is she staring past us? Is she looking at us?

32
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:52,238
And I love the colour, the way he's used that kinda of texture of the paint,

33
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:57,681
the dry, rasping paint that he's put on her cheeks and the highlights in her hair really bring her to life.

34
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:02,039
- Kind of contrast in different areas of painting, as well how kind of dark and nondescript

35
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,626
to the background gets.

36
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:07,294
And even the ledge she is leaning on he's done with very quick brushstrokes.

37
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:12,437
And then the detail in the draping of her shirt, and again that both rosy cheeks...

38
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:14,839
Her skin looks like it would be soft to touch.

39
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:17,404
- Definitely. This is definitely not one of those ones...

40
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,458
You just want to fall into it. I find this interesting, 'cause it marries what i want to do -

41
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,885
I want to keep gazing, that's it, in that people watching way

42
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:26,402
which is what she's doing in the painting.

43
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:29,594
They say that, when Rembrandt painted this picture, he hang it outside

44
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:34,265
facing out to his apartment window, and people walking in the street shouted up

45
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:37,005
'cause they felt it was so realistic, like she was really there.

46
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:39,016
- Oh, a real girl in the window.

47
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:43,016
Maybe that was where the name came from, rather than window being actually painted.
