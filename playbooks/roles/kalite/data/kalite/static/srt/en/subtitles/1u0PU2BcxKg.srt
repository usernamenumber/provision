1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,350
Let's review a little bit of all
we learned about titration

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,070
curves, and see if we can divine
any new information.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,600
So let me draw a
couple of them.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,725
I'll just do very simple
quick and dirty ones.

6
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:18,810
And these of course, the x-axis
is the amount of strong

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,980
acid you're adding.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,630
In this case, it's my favorite
strong acid.

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,100
It's sodium hydroxide.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,165
You're increasing the amount of
sodium hydroxide solution

11
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:28,040
in either case.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,740
That's the titrator or I think
the word is titrand.

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,280
Or it also could be considered
the reagent.

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,070
And this is, of course,
the scale is pH.

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,130
Over here.

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,170
We'll call this 7.

17
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,170
Down here, 0.

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,130
And that's 1.

19
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,400
So I have some mystery acid
here, and it looks

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,290
something like this.

21
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:54,956
That as I increase my base,
my pH increases.

22
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:58,030
   

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,520
And then at some point
over there.

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,280
And then it levels off.

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
My pH is really high.

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,050
And you look at that one.

27
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,870
And then let me see,
I have another one.

28
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,120
And it look something
like this.

29
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,740
   

30
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,670
At some point, bam, it
just goes like that.

31
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,220
And then it goes like that.

32
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,740
So my question is if you look at
least two, first of all, is

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,040
one of them a strong
acid or weak acid?

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,260
Or is it one or the other?

35
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,380
And if you look at this,
you say, OK.

36
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,160
Let's look at the equivalence
points.

37
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,220
And the equivalence points
are the steepest

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,170
points on these curves.

39
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,650
On this one, the equivalence
point is right about there.

40
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,870
On this one, the equivalence
point is right about there.

41
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,310
And remember, equivalence point
is the point at which

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,480
your hydroxide from your strong
base has essentially

43
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,320
sopped up all of the acid
in your solution.

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,690
Right?

45
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,850
So this is your equivalence
point right here.

46
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,720
Now in this case, we stopped
up all of the acid in our

47
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,220
solution at this equivalence
point.

48
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,790
And our pH 7.

49
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,450
So we've completely turned
into a neutral solution.

50
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,610
Because we know that we were
dealing with a strong acid.

51
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,479
So this is a strong acid.

52
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,729
Let me do a different color.

53
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,250
   

54
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,920
We were titrating
a strong acid.

55
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,010
How do we know that?

56
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,570
because at the equivalence
point, our strong base has

57
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,150
completely neutralized it.

58
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,400
There's nothing that's
really of basic

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,260
nature that's left over.

60
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,960
You do have the conjugate base
of the strong acid left over,

61
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,270
but the conjugate base
of a strong acid

62
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,750
really isn't basic.

63
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,380
If I have HCl and it
disassociates into hydrogen

64
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,300
and chloride-- and obviously,
it only exists in

65
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,270
hydrogen and chloride.

66
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,150
This form doesn't exist.

67
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,080
This isn't an equilibrium
reaction.

68
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,370
This is how it looks in
an aqueous solution.

69
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,560
You're like hey, I sopped up all
of this stuff once I'm at

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
my equivalence point.

71
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,990
Don't I have all of
these chloride

72
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,250
conjugate bases there?

73
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,010
Won't that make my pH go up?

74
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,760
Be more basic?

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,450
And I say, no.

76
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:07,880
Because the conjugate base of a
strong acid is pretty much a

77
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,610
neutral molecule.

78
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,820
It has no real basic
properties.

79
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,500
If it had some basic properties,
this would turn

80
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,400
into an equivalence.

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,150
You would actually have some
movement the other way.

82
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,960
But you don't.

83
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,770
If you stick a bunch of chloride
anions in water, it's

84
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,600
not going to start
creating hydrogen

85
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,960
chloride out of the blue.

86
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,740
So this has no basic
properties.

87
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,870
So once you have sopped up
all of the hydrogen,

88
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,710
your pH is at 7.

89
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,800
So if you look at the
equivalence point, pH at 7,

90
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,370
you have a strong acid.

91
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,490
Now in this situation, our
equivalence point--

92
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,740
we're at a higher pH.

93
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,000
   

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,310
I don't know.

95
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,000
Maybe that's a pH of 9.

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So we sopped up all of the
acid, but we still have a

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,470
basic solution.

98
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,060
Or, just at that moment, we
still have a basic solution

99
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,010
before we continue to add even
more OH to the solution.

100
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,200
So what must have
been happening?

101
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,490
Well, this must be a weak acid,
because a weak acid, the

102
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,140
reaction looks like this.

103
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,000
HA and it's in equilibrium with
its conjugate base plus

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,250
some hydrogen ions.

105
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,470
   

106
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,020
As you continue to sop up this
and this, the concentration of

107
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,710
this base increases, right?

108
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,310
Your hydroxide from
your strong base

109
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,444
sops this stuff up.

110
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:21,185
The equilibrium goes more and
more to the right by Le

111
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:24,310
Chatelier's Principle
to make up for this

112
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,460
loss of hydrogen ions.

113
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,610
But the whole time that
equilibrium goes to the right,

114
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,020
and we're pulling these hydrogen
ions away, we're

115
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,860
increasing our concentration
of its conjugate base.

116
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,580
And the conjugate base for a
weak acid is a weak base.

117
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,590
But it has basic properties.

118
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,730
This is neutral.

119
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,330
It has no effect on pH.

120
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,410
This is a weak base.

121
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,190
It does affect on pH.

122
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,850
So at the equivalence point,
you've sopped up all of this,

123
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,060
and most of this.

124
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,550
And I mean, for all purposes,
all of it.

125
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,220
But you're still left
with a ton of this.

126
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,640
Essentially all of this, as many
moles of this have been

127
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,270
converted into this.

128
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,510
So at this point, let's say when
you started off, you had

129
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,610
A moles of this and B moles--
these were kind of the

130
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,190
original equilibrium
concentrations of this.

131
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,720
When you're done at the
equivalence point, you have

132
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,150
none of this, and then you
have B plus A of this.

133
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,340
Every mole of this has been
converted into at least 1 mole

134
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,830
of this, plus whatever you
had to begin with.

135
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,500
And because of that, you have
a basic equivalence point.

136
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,570
Your pH will be slightly
above 7.

137
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,430
Let's see if there's anything
else we can divine from--

138
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,800
especially this one here.

139
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,540
Let me write it down.

140
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,630
This is a weak acid.

141
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,140
   

142
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,560
Let me erase some of this.

143
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,810
It's getting messy.

144
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,220
   

145
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,110
Actually, I'll erase
all of this.

146
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,630
You know that we're titrating
with NaOH.

147
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,250
The hydroxide concentration is
going higher and higher.

148
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,620
But we know, for example,
that at this point--

149
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,390
let me write it right.

150
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,950
So OH minus is going up.

151
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,540
You can just view it-- sodium
hydroxide's what we're adding,

152
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,680
but sodium is really just what's
kind of carrying the

153
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,210
hydroxide before we put it into
the aqueous solution.

154
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,730
Once you go in there, the
sodium's kind of useless.

155
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,350
Similarly, if the conjugate--
well, I don't want to go into

156
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,120
that too much.

157
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,240
So we're adding hydroxide.

158
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,280
We get to any equivalence
point.

159
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,770
This is the point where
we have used up

160
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,110
all of our weak acids.

161
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,220
So let me write some
concentrations here.

162
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,240
Let's say at this point on the
left, right here, before I

163
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,100
started titrating anything,
my concentration of my

164
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,430
acid-- it was A.

165
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,780
And let's say my concentration
of my conjugate base--

166
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,030
Remember, this was in
equilibrium, so it's at B.

167
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,970
Now, at this point, remember.

168
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,710
I kept sopping up the hydrogen--
actually, I

169
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,740
shouldn't have erased that.

170
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,510
I shouldn't have erased
the actual reaction.

171
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,550
It's all in an aqueous
solution.

172
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,430
Equilibrium with H plus plus A
minus on an aqueous solution.

173
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,070
Now at this point, this is
some initial equilibrium.

174
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,520
We keep taking this up.

175
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,800
The reaction goes
to the right.

176
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,340
We keep producing more
of the A minus.

177
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,320
Essentially, by the time
we are here, our acid

178
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,430
concentration, let me
do that and green.

179
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,100
Our acid concentration
is essentially 0.

180
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,810
It might be some super small
negative number, but let's

181
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,570
just say for the sake of
simplicity, it's at 0 or very

182
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,630
close to 0.

183
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,240
What's our conjugate base
concentration going to be?

184
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,490
Let me do that in magenta.

185
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,455
Our conjugate base
concentration, and I know I'm

186
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:43,620
getting messy because I'm
overwriting this.

187
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, every mole of this that
was moving forward in the

188
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,900
reaction turned into 1 mole of
this and 1 mole of that.

189
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,590
This stuff kept getting sopped
up by our titrator, our

190
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,870
reagent, but we ended up
with 1 mole of this so.

191
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,090
So we went from A moles
to 0 of our acid.

192
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,470
We went from B moles of our
conjugate base to B plus A

193
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,900
moles of our conjugate acid.

194
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,890
Interesting.

195
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,670
Now.

196
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,390
What can we do with this?

197
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,880
Well, if we can somehow figure
out the point along this curve

198
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,070
where we had an equal amount
of our acid and conjugate

199
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,290
base, there might be something
interesting

200
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:22,950
that we could do it.

201
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,340
And actually, I'll tell you
what's the interesting thing.

202
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,480
Let me write that the

203
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,860
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

204
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,430
I always have trouble
pronouncing the second L in

205
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,260
Hasselbalch, but I'm
doing my best.

206
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,809
But the Henderson-Hasselbalch
Equation tells us-- let me do

207
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,970
it down here.

208
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:44,860
Actually, I'm running
out of space.

209
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,420
I'll do it here.

210
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,560
The pH of-- and remember, this
is only true of a weak acid or

211
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,900
a weak base.

212
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,910
There is no equilibrium constant
for a strong acid or

213
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,560
strong base.

214
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,660
So you can only use
Henderson-Hasselbalch and what

215
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,890
I'm about to do now-- I'm going
to call it the half

216
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,160
equivalence point, and
I'm going to talk

217
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,830
about that a second.

218
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,680
You can only do this with a weak
acid or a weak base when

219
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,770
that's what you're actually
titrating.

220
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,760
Of course you're always
titrating with a strong acid

221
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,110
or strong base, but the solution
that you're trying to

222
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,480
figure out has to
be a weak one.

223
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,790
So that tells us that the pH
is equal to the pKa, or the

224
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,620
negative log of the acid
equilibrium constant, plus the

225
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,720
log of your conjugate base
concentration divided by your

226
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,190
conjugate acid concentration.

227
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,300
And we proved this a couple
of videos ago.

228
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,150
You essentially just take the
log on both sides of the

229
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,100
equilibrium equation
and you do a little

230
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,330
algebra and you get this.

231
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,410
Nothing fancy.

232
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,050
But what's interesting when
these two things are equal to

233
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:45,690
each other.

234
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,530
When the concentration of your
conjugate base is equivalent

235
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,660
to the concentration
of your weak acid.

236
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,440
Well then this whole thing
is going to be 1.

237
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,050
Right?

238
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,580
And what's the log of 1?

239
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,040
Well, 10 to the 0 power is 1.

240
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,460
So log base 10 of 1 is 0.

241
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,140
So this whole thing will be 0.

242
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,260
So that's interesting.

243
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,840
When you have your concentration
of conjugate

244
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,520
base is equal to your
concentration of your weak

245
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,710
acid, this whole term
turns into 0.

246
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,680
And then your pH is
equal to your pKa.

247
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,170
So if we can figure out the
point on this graph where our

248
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,590
concentration of our acid and
our conjugate base are equal,

249
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,540
and we figure out the pH of that
point, that point will

250
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,310
also tell us the pKa.

251
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,810
So if we don't know what acid
we're dealing with, all of a

252
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,940
sudden we'll be able to
figure out it's pKa.

253
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,210
And we'll know something
about that acid.

254
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,490
If we had a pKa table, hey, this
is ammonium, or whatever

255
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,460
we're dealing with.

256
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,240
So how can we figure out the
point at which these two

257
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,870
concentrations are equivalent?

258
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,280
What you do is you
just say, OK.

259
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,180
This is the equivalent point.

260
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,880
This is the point at
which we've run

261
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,420
out of our weak acid.

262
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,360
You go halfway to there.

263
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,690
This is called a half
equivalence point.

264
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,940
I'll write that down.

265
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,890
   

266
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,460
And you say, at this point,
they're roughly

267
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,130
equal to each other.

268
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,090
And the reason why say roughly
is because you say OK, at this

269
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:28,100
point, my concentration of
my acid is A over 2.

270
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,050
And my concentration of my
base, at this point-- I

271
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,260
started with B and A over 2 gets
more converted into my

272
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,190
conjugate base, so I have
B plus A over 2.

273
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,010
So you may say, hey, wait, I
still have a little bit more

274
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,700
of the base here.

275
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,460
Because I started with
some of the base.

276
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,230
And the reason why you can take
this as a point in which

277
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,030
they're equal is because this
term right here is very, very,

278
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,920
very small for the great
majority of acids.

279
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,480
And actually, when you're doing
an experiment like this,

280
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,680
it doesn't take long to just
go right past that point.

281
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,650
This is almost like your
experimental error.

282
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,670
It doesn't show up.

283
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,150
And if you don't believe me--
actually, let me just do a

284
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,450
little side there to make
you believe that.

285
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,710
So we know an equilibrium
constant is equal to your

286
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,000
concentration of hydrogen times
a concentration of your

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,480
conjugate base over
your concentration

288
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,955
of your weak acid.

289
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:20,760
   

290
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,360
Let's just do this
for ammonium.

291
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,000
The pKa for ammonium is 9.25.

292
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,170
That means that the Ka
for ammonium is 10

293
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,350
to the minus 9.25.

294
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,740
Right?

295
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,350
You could just take the reverse
log of both sides.

296
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,560
But what number is that?

297
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:49,100
10 to the minus 9.25.

298
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,860
is equal to 5.6 times 10
to the negative 10.

299
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:00,560
So that is equal to, roughly,
10 to the negative 10.

300
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,850
So if you just put some of this
into some concentration,

301
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,150
or you put some or your weak
acid into a solution and you

302
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,240
let it get to equilibrium--

303
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,520
If I just do a little algebra.

304
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,170
Your weak acid times your
equilibrium constant is equal

305
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,740
to your concentration of
your hydrogen times

306
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,590
your conjugate base.

307
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,360
Now, if they didn't have any
hydrogen or conjugate base to

308
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,783
begin with, every mole of this
disassociates into 1 mole of

309
00:13:27,783 --> 00:13:28,830
that and 1 mole of this.

310
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,060
So these two things are going
to be equal, right?

311
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,630
So you could even say, it's
the same thing as the

312
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,280
concentration of your
weak base squared.

313
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,900
If you say, hey, this is the
same thing as A minus, they're

314
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,130
going to be equal.

315
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,320
So if you say that that is equal
to your concentration of

316
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,410
your acid times your equilibrium
constant, then you

317
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,030
say your conjugate base
concentration that

318
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,920
you start off with.

319
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,050
And this is all approximatating.

320
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,370
I'm just trying to show
you that your initial

321
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,380
concentration of your conjugate
base is much lower

322
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,810
than your initial concentration
of your

323
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,980
conjugate acid.

324
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,050
So it equals the square root of
your concentration of your

325
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,080
conjugate acid times the
square root of Ka.

326
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,180
In the case of ammonium, the
square root of this is what?

327
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,000
It's going to be like 2 point
something something times 10

328
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,810
to the minus 5 power.

329
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,440
So whatever your concentration
of your weak acid is, let's

330
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,680
say it's ammonium in this case,
you take the square root

331
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,910
of that and then you multiply
times something with a

332
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,030
negative 5 power to get the
concentration of your

333
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,770
conjugate base.

334
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,860
So this is much lower
than that.

335
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,570
These two numbers are much lower
than that number for

336
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,290
most weak acids.

337
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:45,070
So because of that, you can
ignore the amount of conjugate

338
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,980
base you started off with.

339
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,630
And so this point right here,
your half equivalence point,

340
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,390
you can pretty much assume that
your concentrations of

341
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,720
conjugate base and weak acids
are equivalent at that point.

342
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,480
And then by the
Henderson-Hasselbalch

343
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,840
Equation, this term right
here is going to be 1.

344
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,170
The log of 1 is 0.

345
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,550
And the pKa will be
equal to the pH.

346
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,870
So you measure the pH here and
say oh, that's the negative

347
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,150
log of my equilibrium
constant.

348
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,990
That will be my pKa.

349
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,280
   

350
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,800
And until you found out
something else that's

351
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,090
interesting about
your molecule.

352
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,340
