1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,170
In the last video, we started
with these parametric

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,860
equations: x is equal to
3 cosine of t and y is

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,440
equal to 2 sine of t.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,630
And doing a little bit of
algebra, we were able to remove

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,410
the parameter and turn it into
an equation that we normally

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,590
associate with an ellipse.

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:25,340
We got x squared over 9 plus y
squared over 4 is equal to 1.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,370
And we graphed it.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,320
And I'll do that.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,860
Actually I have it from the
previous-- We graphed it and

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,270
we got something that looked
like that right there.

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,460
And we said well why
don't we always just

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,300
represent it like this?

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,030
Well this right here-- this
equation just in terms

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,740
of x and y --it just
represents the shape.

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,510
It doesn't represent the actual
path that-- Let's say that t

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,480
represents an object's point--
an object's position at

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,370
some place and time.

20
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,300
And we went over that.

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,450
And as time progressed,
we went around the

22
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,380
ellipse, in that case.

23
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,400
And as time goes forward, we
kept going around this ellipse.

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,540
But this begs the question: is
this the only set of parametric

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,870
equations that, when we do a
little bit of algebra,

26
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,890
gives this path?

27
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,660
Can we think of another set
that gives-- that would

28
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,350
also, when you do the
algebra, get here?

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,250
And I think we can.

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,820
So let's try a couple.

31
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,050
I mean, we could do a
whole bunch of them.

32
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,500
Actually, maybe we'll do a
whole bunch of them, just to

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,380
see that there-- And what
you'll see is that there's

34
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,550
actually an infinite number
of parametric equations

35
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,690
that have this path.

36
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:38,180
So one could be x is
equal to 3 cosine of 2t.

37
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,830
And the other one is y
is equal 2 sine of 2t.

38
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,370
Like we did in the last video,
let's solve for cosine of 2t

39
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,320
and solve for sine of 2t.

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,660
So we just have to divide both
sides of-- Well, both sides

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,960
of this top equation by 3.

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,700
You get x over 3 is
equal to cosine of 2t.

43
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,770
Divide both sides of
this equation by 2.

44
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,680
You get y over 2 is
equal to sine of 2t.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,100
And we'll use the same trig
identities we did before.

46
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,910
When we did this problem, we
said that sine squared of t

47
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,290
plus cosine squared
of t is equal to 1.

48
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,020
Well if that's true,
so is this true.

49
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,440
Let me see.

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,820
If that's true, then we can
also say that sine squared

51
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:36,140
of 2t plus cosine squared
of 2t is equal to 1.

52
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,100
In fact, sine squared of
anything here plus cosine

53
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,210
squared of anything, as long as
it's the same anything as we

54
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,300
put here-- I can't have a 2t
here and a 3t here, but if this

55
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,805
is a 2 and this is a 2 --then
that's always going

56
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:49,640
to be equal to 1.

57
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,620
You can just fill in the black.

58
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,170
Because this is always going
to be the same angle.

59
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:58,815
So if this is true, we can then
just take this and substitute

60
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:03,745
it in for cosine of 2t and take
the y over 2 and substitute

61
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:05,740
it in for sine of 2t.

62
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,770
And we get the sine of 2t
squared becomes y over 2

63
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:17,010
squared plus cosine of
2t is x over 3 squared.

64
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,780
It equals 1.

65
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,750
And that is exactly what
we had to begin with.

66
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,170
That is the same thing as x
squared over 9-- I'm just

67
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,680
switching the order here --plus
y squared over 4 is equal to 1.

68
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,600
So both of these parametric
equations, both sets of

69
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,830
parametric equations have
the exact same path.

70
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,920
So how are they different?

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,010
Let's see.

72
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,650
If we were to take-- So in
the previous video, we

73
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,550
took this yellow one.

74
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,880
Actually I rewrote it here.

75
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,370
And we did a little table
and we plotted the points

76
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,600
that it hits as you
go around the circle.

77
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,470
So let's do the same
thing for our new set.

78
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,000
So just since I lost it, let me
write the two equations here.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,870
It was x is equal to 3
cosine of 2t and y is

80
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,520
equal to 2 sine of 2t.

81
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,495
Let me make a little table.

82
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:18,570
   

83
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,576
There we go.

84
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:23,334
And we're going to have a t.

85
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:26,430
And we're going to
have an x and a y.

86
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,460
And let's pick the
same values of t.

87
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,780
0 pi over 2 and pi.

88
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,860
When t is 0, cosine
of 2 times 0.

89
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,450
That's cosine of 0, which
is one, times 3, it's 3.

90
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,340
When t is equal to pi over
2, 2 times pi over 2 is pi.

91
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,400
Cosine of pi over 2 is minus 1.

92
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,180
Minus 1 times 3 is minus 3.

93
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,600
When t is equal to pi, cosine
of 2 times pi is 2 pi.

94
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,850
Cosine of 2 pi is the same
thing as cosine of 0.

95
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,120
So that's 1.

96
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,330
1 times 3 is 3.

97
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,430
And then on the y side.

98
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,245
When t is equal to 0,
that's the same thing

99
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:08,740
as sine of 2 times 0.

100
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,480
Sine of 0 times 2 is 0.

101
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,550
Pi over 2.

102
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,330
Sine of 2 times pi over 2.

103
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,070
That's the same
thing as sine of 4.

104
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,140
That's also 0.

105
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,720
0 times 2 is 0.

106
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,820
And then pi.

107
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,070
Sine of 2 pi.

108
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,200
Well, that's also 0.

109
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,430
So here we get a bunch of 0's.

110
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,980
So what happened here?

111
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,110
Let me do it in a
different color.

112
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,260
So in our first situation-- So
they both-- We established that

113
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,325
both this set of parametric
equations and this set of

114
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:42,160
parametric equations, they both
have the same overall, I guess

115
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,670
we could say, shape
of their path.

116
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,340
They're both this ellipse.

117
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,410
But what we saw in the previous
videos, when you plot these

118
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,780
points at time t equals
0, we were right.

119
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,550
This point right here
is that right there.

120
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:07,490
And then at t is equal to pi
over 2, we got right there.

121
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,270
And then at t is equal to
pi, we got over here.

122
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,240
And we did that to establish
that the direction of motion.

123
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,840
If these parametric equations
really are describing some

124
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,960
type of motion, it would
be counterclockwise.

125
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,860
And what happens in this
scenario-- So when t is

126
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,410
equal to 0, we're still
at the point 3, 0.

127
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,900
So they at least-- At t equals
0, you can kind of view them

128
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,890
as starting at the same
point, if we assume we're

129
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,390
starting a t equals 0.

130
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,230
You don't have to
start at t equals 0.

131
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,740
I did that a little bit in the
last video, but you can start

132
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,180
at t equals minus a google
or t equals minus infinity.

133
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,130
So you don't necessarily
have a start point.

134
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,970
But if we assume t equals 0 as
a start point, you could say

135
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,810
that they both started there.

136
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,720
Then at-- let me pick a new
color that I haven't used

137
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,650
yet --then at t is equal to
pi over 2-- Where are we?

138
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,910
We're at minus 3, 0.

139
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,890
We get all the way-- Oh.

140
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,330
That's the same color
I used before.

141
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,170
Let me see this.

142
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,490
Let me do this color.

143
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,080
We're here.

144
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,730
Now notice: in the first one,
when we went from t equals 0

145
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,340
to t equals pi over 2, we
went from here to there.

146
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,700
We went kind of a quarter of
the way around the ellipse.

147
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,720
But now when we went from
t equals zero to pi over

148
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,280
2, where did we go?

149
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,430
we?

150
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,530
Went halfway around
the ellipse.

151
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:36,240
We went all the way from there,
all the way over there.

152
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,190
   

153
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,550
And likewise, when we went from
t equals pi over 2 to t equals

154
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,320
pi with this set of parametric
equations, we went another

155
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,510
quarter of the ellipse.

156
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,100
We went from there to there.

157
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,790
But here, when we go from t
equals pi ever 2 to t equals

158
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,910
pi, we go all of this way.

159
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,100
We go back to the beginning
part of our ellipse.

160
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,450
So what you see is that this
set of parametric equations

161
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,565
has the exact same shape of
its path as this set of

162
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:09,660
parametric equations.

163
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,640
Except it's going around it
at twice as fast of a rate.

164
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,270
For every time when t increases
by pi over 2 here, we go by--

165
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,210
we kind of go a quarter
way around the ellipse.

166
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,830
But when t increases by pi
over 2 here, we go halfway

167
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,290
around the ellipse.

168
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,870
So the thing to realize-- and I
know I've touched on this

169
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,000
before --is that even though
both of these sets of

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,780
parametric equations, when you
do the algebra, they can

171
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,040
kind of be converted
into this shape.

172
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,470
You lose the information about
where our particle is as it's

173
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,050
rotating around the ellipse or
how fast it's rotating

174
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,670
around the ellipse.

175
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,580
And that's why you need
these parametric equations.

176
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,590
We can even set up a parametric
equation that goes in

177
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,120
the other direction.

178
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,730
Instead of having these-- and I
encourage you to play with that

179
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,740
--but if you instead of this,
if you just put a minus

180
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,480
sign right here.

181
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,500
Cosine of minus t and
2 sine of minus t.

182
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,610
Instead of going in that
direction, it would

183
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,860
go in this direction.

184
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,430
It would go in a
clockwise direction.

185
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,750
So one thing that you've
probably been thinking from the

186
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,620
beginning is OK, I was able to
go from my parametric equations

187
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,210
to this equation of ellipse
in terms of just x and y.

188
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,020
Can you go back the other way?

189
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,330
Could you go from this to this?

190
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,300
And, I think you might realize
now, that the answer is no.

191
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,400
Because there's no way, just
with the information that

192
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,560
you're given here, to know
that you should go to this

193
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,230
parametric equation or this
parametric equation or any of

194
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,100
an infinite number of
parametric equations.

195
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:50,540
I mean anything of the form x
is equal to 3 cosine of really

196
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:56,450
anything times t and y is equal
to 3 times cosine of-- As long

197
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,590
as it's the same anything-- I
drew the two squiggly

198
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,240
marks the same.

199
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,250
--as long as these two things
are the same, then you

200
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,620
will have-- they'll both
converge to this shape.

201
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,760
So if you have the shape, you
don't know what parametric

202
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,930
equation you can go back to.

203
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,380
You could make up one,
but you don't know which

204
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,970
one it'll go back to.

205
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,560
And just to kind of hit the
point home of kind of making

206
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,800
up a parametric equation.

207
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,460
Sometimes that's asked of you.

208
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,780
So let's just do a
very simple example.

209
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,570
Let's start with a
normal function of x.

210
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,440
So let's say that we have
the equation y is equal

211
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,990
to x squared plus x.

212
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,690
I just made it up.

213
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,340
And let's say that you were
asked to turn this into

214
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,220
a parametric equation.

215
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,500
And this is often a very hard
thing for people because there

216
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,650
is not one right answer.

217
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,260
You can turn into an arbitrary
number of parametric equations.

218
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,540
I just may do something
really crazy and arbitrary.

219
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,550
I could say x is equal-- When I
have y defined explicitly in

220
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,170
terms of x like this, I can
make x into anything

221
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:56,660
in terms of t.

222
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,620
I could say it's cosine of t
minus the natural log of t.

223
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
I just made that up.

224
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,380
That's just a random thing.

225
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,550
But then if x is this, then y
is going to be equal to-- I

226
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:14,300
just substitute this back in
--cosine of t minus ln of t

227
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:21,240
squared plus cosine
of t minus ln of t.

228
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,800
And we're done.

229
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,550
We just converted this into a
parametric equation or a set

230
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,730
of parametric equations.

231
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:32,660
I could've also just
written x is equal to t.

232
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,010
And then what would y equal?

233
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:40,310
y would be equal to
t squared plus t.

234
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,040
You might say well what's
the difference between this

235
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,240
parametric equation and
this parametric equation?

236
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,250
Well, they're both
going to have the same

237
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,870
shape of their paths.

238
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,790
It's going to be something
like a parabola.

239
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,520
But the rate and the direction
with which they progress

240
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,290
on those paths will be
very very different.

241
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,500
It's actually a very
interesting thing

242
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:58,920
to think about.

243
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,860
There are some paths that you
could take where-- Let's say

244
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,610
that the-- You could set
up a parametric equation.

245
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,080
Let's say that the shape is--
You know everything we've done

246
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,540
so far, we've always been going
in one direction, but you could

247
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,350
have a-- There are scenarios--
And maybe if I have time,

248
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,610
I'll make a video.

249
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,410
And this isn't what-- Let's say
the shape of the path is some

250
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,060
type of, I dunno, let's say
it's a circle of some kind.

251
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm just going to--
That's not this.

252
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,130
I'm doing a completely
different example right now.

253
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,750
I'm just kind of-- Sometimes,
with the ellipses we had paths

254
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,400
that went counterclockwise and
then paths that went clockwise.

255
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,480
You can also have paths that
kind of isolate in between,

256
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,690
move around, move back and
forth along the thing.

257
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,470
So there's all sorts of
parametric equations

258
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,580
that you can define.

259
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,490
And you can say if t
equals from this to this,

260
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,330
you'll use this set of
parametric equations.

261
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,980
If it's another set of
t's, use another one.

262
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,450
So there's all sorts of crazy
things you can do to say what

263
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,510
happens as you move
along the path.

264
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,190
So the difference-- Not that
this is the path of that.

265
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,820
This is actually
more of a parabola.

266
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,130
But the difference between
this and this is how you

267
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,000
move along the shape.

268
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,820
Anyway, I hope you found
that vaguely useful.

269
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:03,933
