1
00:00:00,579 --> 00:00:12,169
We are asked to solve the proportion and we have 8/36 = 10/?

2
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:13,825
Now there is a bunch of different ways to solve this.

3
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:18,148
And I will explore all of them.

4
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,902
So one way to think about it is these two need

5
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:24,231
to be equivalent fractions. So whatever happened

6
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:27,744
to the numerator also has to happen to the denominator.

7
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:31,508
So what do you have to multiply 8 by to get 10?

8
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:36,887
You could multiply 8 * 10/8 will definitely give you 10.

9
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:39,779
So we're multiplying by 10/8 over here.

10
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:44,309
Or another way to write 10/8 is the same thing as 5/4.

11
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,100
So we're multiplying by 5/4 to get from 8 to 10.

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,353
If we did that to the numerator in order to have an equivalent fraction

13
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,513
you have to do the same thing to the denominator.

14
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:59,129
You have to multiply it times 5/4.

15
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:08,550
And so we can say that this n is going to be equal to 36 * 5/4.

16
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,260
Or you could say that this is going to be equal to 36*5 divided by 4.

17
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,464
And now 36 divided by 4, we know what that is.

18
00:01:17,464 --> 00:01:20,684
We can divide both the numerator and denominator by 4.

19
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:22,900
You divide the numerator by 4, you get 9.

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,511
Divide the denominator by 4, you get 1. You get 45.

21
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,000
So that's one way to think about it.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,133
8/36 = 10/45. Another way to think about it is,

23
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:42,108
what do we have to multiply 8 by to get its denominator?

24
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:45,884
How much larger is the denominator 36 than 8?

25
00:01:45,884 --> 00:01:48,321
Let's just divide 36 over 8.

26
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:57,377
So 36/8 is the same thing as-- so we can simplify, dividing the numerator and denominator by 4.

27
00:01:57,377 --> 00:02:02,253
That's their greatest common divisor. That's the same thing as 9/2.

28
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:09,986
If you multiply the numerator by 9/2, you get the denominator.

29
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:12,523
Then we'll have to do the same thing over here.

30
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:25,292
If 36 is 9/2 times 8, let me write this. 8 * 9/2 = 36.

31
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,100
That's how we go from the numerator to the denominator.

32
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,286
Then to figure out what the denominator here is,

33
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:33,869
if we want the same fraction, we'll have to multiply by 9/2 again.

34
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:42,641
So then we'll get 10 * 9/2 = n, is going to be equal to this denominator.

35
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:47,230
And so this is the same thing as saying 10*9 / 2,

36
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,041
divide the numerator and denominator by 2,

37
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:54,763
you get 5/1 which is 45. So 45 = n.

38
00:02:54,778 --> 00:02:56,946
Once again we got the same way,

39
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:59,744
completely legitimate way to solve it.

40
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:03,341
Now sometimes when you see a proportion like this,

41
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,677
sometimes you'll say oh you could cross multiply.

42
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:06,937
And you can cross multiply and

43
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,397
I'll teach you how to do that.

44
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,934
And that's sometimes the quick way to do it.

45
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:12,556
But I don't like teaching it the first time

46
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:13,955
you look at proportions

47
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:15,615
because it's really just something mechanical.

48
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:17,323
You really don't understand what you're doing and

49
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:18,812
it really comes out of a little bit of algebra.

50
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:20,800
And I'll show you the algebra as well.

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,557
But if you don't understand it and

52
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:22,826
if it doesn't make as much sense to you

53
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:25,172
at this point, don't worry too much about it.

54
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:31,394
So we have 8/36 = 10/n. When you cross multiply

55
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:33,770
you're saying that the numerator here

56
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,512
times the denominator over here

57
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:36,823
is going to be equal to,

58
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:40,494
so 8*n is going to be equal to

59
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:44,118
the denominator over here--

60
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:46,027
let me do this in a different colour--

61
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:47,391
the denominator over here

62
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:48,527
times the numerator over here.

63
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:50,190
This is what it means to cross multiply.

64
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,208
So this is going to be equal to 36*10.

65
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,076
Or you could say, let me do this

66
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:00,058
in a neutral colour now,

67
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:04,175
you could say that 8n = 360.

68
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:05,779
And so you're saying 8 times what

69
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,800
is equal to 360. Or to figure out what that

70
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,006
times what is, you divide 360 divided by 8.

71
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:13,264
So we can divide, and this is a little bit of

72
00:04:13,264 --> 00:04:14,429
algebra here, we're dividing both sides

73
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:20,702
of the equation by 8, and we're getting n= 360/8.

74
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:21,271
And you know, you can do that

75
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:24,052
without thinking in strict algebraic terms.

76
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:28,390
You say 8 times what is 360? Well, 8 times 360/8.

77
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:38,774
If I write 8 x ? = 360, well ? could definitely be 360/8.

78
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:40,729
If I multiply these out, this guy and that guy

79
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,132
cancel out and it's definitely 360.

80
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,252
And that's why it's 360/8.

81
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,370
But then we want to actually divide this

82
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,927
to actually get our right answer

83
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:52,105
or a simplified answer. 8 goes into 360.

84
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:55,451
8 goes into 36 4 times. 4 times 8 is 32.

85
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:58,178
You have a remainder of 4. Bring down the 0.

86
00:04:58,178 --> 00:05:03,322
8 goes into 40 5 times. 5 times 8 is 40.

87
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:06,523
And then you have no remainder. And you're done.

88
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:11,647
Once again we got n=45. Now the last way I am going

89
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:13,964
to show you involves a little bit of algebra.

90
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:16,180
If any of the ways before this worked, that's fine.

91
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,914
And where this is sitting in the playlist you're

92
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:19,494
not expected to know the algebra.

93
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:21,337
But I want to show you the algebra just because

94
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:22,185
I want to show you that this

95
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:24,642
cross-multiplication isn't some magic.

96
00:05:24,642 --> 00:05:27,637
That using algebra we will get this exact same thing.

97
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:30,037
But you could stop watching this, if you find this part

98
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:33,662
confusing. So let's rewrite our proportion.

99
00:05:33,662 --> 00:05:43,595
8/36 = 10/n. And we want to solve for n.

100
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:47,015
The easiest way to solve for n is maybe multiply

101
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:48,549
both-- this thing on the left is equal to

102
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,904
this thing on the right. So we can multiply them both

103
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:53,434
by the same thing and the equality will still hold.

104
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:57,666
So we can multiply both of them by n.

105
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,271
On the right hand side, the n's cancel out.

106
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:07,241
On the left hand side we have 8/36 * n = 10.

107
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,648
Now if we want to solve for n, we can literally multiply

108
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:13,980
if we want just an n here, we would want to multiply

109
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,207
this side times 36- I'll do that in a different colour-

110
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:21,400
we would want to multiply this side times 36 times 8.

111
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,505
Because if you multiply these guys out,

112
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:25,276
you get 1 and you just have an n. But since

113
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:26,549
we're doing it to the left hand side, we also

114
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:32,529
have to do it to the right hand side. So times 36/8.

115
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,482
These guys cancel out and we're left with

116
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:42,303
n= 10 * 36 is 360/8. And notice we're getting the

117
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:45,407
exact same value that we got with cross multiplying.

118
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:46,920
And with cross multiplying, you're actually

119
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,365
doing 2 steps. You're actually doing an

120
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:51,378
extra step here. You're multiplying both

121
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,805
sides by n so that you get 8n.

122
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:55,384
And then you're multiplying both sides

123
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:58,366
by 36 so that you get your 36

124
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:00,909
on both sides and you get this value here.

125
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:02,699
But at the end when you simplify it, you'll get

126
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,098
the exact same answer. Those are

127
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:07,224
all different ways to solve this proportion.

128
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:09,551
Probably the most obvious way or the easiest

129
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:11,655
way to do it in your head was either

130
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:13,759
just looking at what you have to multiply

131
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,235
the numerator by and then doing the same thing

132
00:07:16,235 --> 99:59:59,999
to the denominator or maybe by cross multiplication.
