00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Quadrilateral ABCD is a rhombus

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,760
What they want us to prove is that their diagonals are perpendicular,

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,580
that AC is perpendicular to BD

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,170
Let's think about everything we know about a rhombus

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,400
First of all, a rhombus is a special case of a parallelogram

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,770
In a parallelogram, the opposite sides are parallel

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,390
That side is parallel to that side

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,900
These 2 sides are parallel

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,090
In a rhombus, not only are the opposite sides parallel,

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,690
but also all the sides have equal length

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,560
This side is equal to this side, which is equal to that side,

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,960
which is equal to that side right over there

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,610
There's other interesting things we know about

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,780
the diagonals of a parallelogram,

15
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,090
which we know all rhombi are parallelograms

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,720
The other way around is not necessarily true

17
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,560
We know that for any parallelogram, and a rhombus is a parallelogram,

18
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,590
that the diagonals bisect each other

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,640
For example, let me label this point in the center, point E

20
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,390
We know that AE is going to be equal to EC,

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,250
I'll put 2 slashes right over there

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:13,350
We also know that EB is going to be equal to ED

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,840
This is all of what we know, when someone just says that ABCD is a

24
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,040
rhombus, based on other things that we've proven to ourselves

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,840
Now we're gonna prove that AC is perpendicular to BD

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,010
An interesting way to prove it,

27
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,930
and you can look at it just by eyeballing it,

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,510
is if we can show that this triangle is congruent to this triangle

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,360
and that these 2 angles right over here correspond to each other

30
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,840
then they have to be the same and they'll be supplementary

31
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,270
and they'll be 90 degrees so let's just prove it to ourselves

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,940
The first thing we see is we have a side, a side, and a side

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,270
A side a side and a side

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,500
So we can see that triangle, let me write here with a new color,

35
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:09,810
ABE is congruent to triangle CBE

36
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,650
Once we know that,

37
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,550
we know that all the corresponding angles are congruent

38
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:32,650
In particular, we know that angle AEB is going to be congruent

39
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:42,370
to angle CEB because they are corresponding angles

40
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,440
of congruent triangles

41
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,050
This angle right over here is going to be equal to

42
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,450
that angle over there

43
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,660
We also that they're supplementary

44
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,340
Let me write it this way

45
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,240
They're congruent and they are supplementary

46
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,350
These 2 are gonna have the same measure and

47
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,280
they need to add up to 180 degrees

48
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,970
If I have 2 things that are the same thing and

49
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,180
add up to 180 degrees, what does that tell me?

50
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:25,750
That tells me that the measure of angle AEB is equal to

51
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,640
the measure of angle CEB which must be equal to 90 degrees

52
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,730
They're the same measure and they're supplementary

53
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,640
This is a right angle and then, this is a right angle

54
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,360
Obviously, this is a right angle

55
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,320
This angle down here is a vertical angle,

56
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,270
that's gonna be a right angle

57
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,720
This is a right angle this over here is gonna be a vertical angle

58
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,850
You see the diagonals intersect at a 90 degree angle

59
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,940
so we've just proved

60
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,330
This is interesting

61
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,990
A parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,490
For a rhombus, where all the sides are equal,

63
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,870
we've shown that not only do they bisect each other

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,810
but they're perpendicular bisectors of each other
