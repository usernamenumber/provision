1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,890
Let's talk about a concept
that probably confuses

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,790
chemistry students the
most on some level.

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,210
But on some level it's also one
of the simplest concepts.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,160
And that's the idea of a mole,
which in chemistry is

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,930
different than the thing digging
up your backyard, or

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,060
the thing you want to get
removed from your left eye.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,740
A mole in chemistry
is just a number.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,410
It's just a number, and
the number is 6.02

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,980
times 10 to the 23.

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,540
So it's a very huge number.

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,490
And this is also called
Avogadro's number.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,616
Maybe I will do a video
on Avogadro.

14
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:40,106
Avogadro's Number

15
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,600
But that's all you
need to know.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,160
A mole is just a number.

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,980
There are kind of
more Byzantine

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,090
definitions of a mole.

19
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,570
This actually is not-- actually,
let me copy and

20
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,160
paste it from Wikipedia.

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,190
This is Wikipedia's definition
of a mole.

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,760
And you hopefully at the end of
this video you'll see that

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,650
they're equivalent.

24
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,870
But if you're just getting
exposed to the concept, this

25
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,490
to me, it's just not
an easy concept.

26
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,550
Basically, a "a mole is defined
as the amount of

27
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:15,420
substance of a system that
contains as many elemental

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,860
entities as there are atoms in
12 grams of carbon 12. Well,

29
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,650
Well, I just told you that a mole is
6.02 times 10 to the 23.

30
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,640
So if you just take the
last part, atoms in 12

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,920
grams of carbon 12.

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:40,310
So that means that there are 1
mole of carbon 12-- let me

33
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,100
write it like that--
carbon 12.

34
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:57,550
There are 1 mole of carbon 12
atoms in 12 grams of carbon.

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,670
And so that's why a
mole is useful.

36
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,890
So I could have just instead
of writing 1 mole, I could

37
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,880
have replaced this as there's
6.02 times 10 to the 23 carbon

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,050
atoms, carbon 12 atoms in
12 grams of carbon.

39
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,180
How do you figure that out?

40
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,640
Or I guess, what else
does this mean?

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,690
I mean, we just added in carbon,
they said it's the

42
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,070
amount of substance of any
molecule, if you convert

43
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,210
between atomic mass
units and grams.

44
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,050
This I find very confusing.

45
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,610
How can we apply this
in other places?

46
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,020
So the first thing to realize
is a mole is just a way of

47
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,080
translating between grams
and atomic mass units.

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,800
One carbon 12 atom is what?

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,700
What's its atomic mass number?

50
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,050
It's 12.

51
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,860
That's why it's called carbon
12 instead of carbon 14.

52
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,130
So its mass is 12 atomic
mass units.

53
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,060
So if you have something that
has a mass of 12 atomic mass

54
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,990
units and you have a mole of
them, or you have 6.02 times

55
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,850
10 to the twenty three of
them, all of those atoms

56
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,840
combined will have a
mass of 12 grams.

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:10,020
So another way to think about
it is 1 gram is equal to 1

58
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,000
mole of atomic mass units.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,550
I'll write amu's like that.

60
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:23,690
Or you can write 1 gram is equal
to 6.02 times 10 to the

61
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,220
23 atomic mass units.

62
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,390
And the reason why this is
useful-- and it's kind of

63
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,540
addressed in this Wikipedia
definition there-- is it helps

64
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,140
us translate between the atomic
world-- where we deal

65
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,050
with atomic mass units and we
deal with, oh, we've got an

66
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,960
extra neutron now, let's add
one to our atomic mass

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,540
number-- and translating between
that atomic world and

68
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,540
our everyday world where
we deal in grams.

69
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,490
And just so you know, a
gram is still a pretty

70
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,400
small amount of mass.

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,340
It's 1/1000 of a kilogram.

72
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,210
A kilogram is about 2 pounds.

73
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,590
So this is about 1/500
of a pound.

74
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,470
So this is not much.

75
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:03,570
So there's a ton of atoms in a
very small amount of-- in 1

76
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,100
gram of carbon, or at least in
12 grams of carbon, you have a

77
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,070
ton of atoms. You have 6.02
times 10 to the 23.

78
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,670
And just to hit the point home,
I probably should have

79
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,730
talked about this in the atom.

80
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,610
This is a huge number.

81
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:22,770
To maybe visualize it, if you
think of-- I was told that in

82
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,600
the diameter of a hair, if this
is a hair and this is

83
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,750
diameter of the hair, if you
go this way there 1 million

84
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,130
carbon atoms. 1 million
carbon atoms that way.

85
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:43,660
Or if you were to take an apple
and you were to try to

86
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,170
figure out what fraction, if
you were to make one of the

87
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,020
atoms of an apple-- and
obviously, an apple has a

88
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,795
bunch of different types of
atoms in it-- but if you were

89
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:55,980
to take one of the atoms and
make it the size of the apple,

90
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,690
then the apple would be
the size of the earth.

91
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,190
So an apple atom is
to an apple as an

92
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,310
apple is to the earth.

93
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,810
So these are obviously-- it's
hard for us to even process

94
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,070
things of this size.

95
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,170
When you just have one gram of--
well, let's say you have

96
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,480
1 gram of hydrogen.

97
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,880
1 gram of hydrogen.

98
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,540
If you have 1 gram of hydrogen,
that means you have

99
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,400
1 mole of hydrogen.

100
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,760
How do I know that?

101
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,070
Because hydrogen's atomic
mass number is 1.

102
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,690
So in general, if you just take
any element-- so what is

103
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,715
the mass of, let me just pick,
1 mole of aluminum?

104
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,270
So if I were to take 6.02 times
10 to the 23 aluminum

105
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,240
atoms, what is the mass
of that collection?

106
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,780
Well, each of them have an
atomic mass number of 13.

107
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:08,280
So it's 13 amu's-- I don't
have to put the s there--

108
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,340
times six point-- well, I won't

109
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,200
write that way, actually.

110
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,620
That'll probably just
confuse you.

111
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,810
The easy way to think about is
if you have a mole of an atom,

112
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,360
you take its mass-- I was taking
its atomic number,

113
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,280
that's not good-- you take
its mass number.

114
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,310
In this case let's
say it's 27.

115
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,490
So we're dealing with
aluminum 27.

116
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,760
You take its mass number, and if
you have 1 mole of it, then

117
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,810
the mass of that will
be 27 grams.

118
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,340
So that literally, when you have
one mole of an atom it's

119
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,090
a direct translation between its
mass number and grams. 1

120
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,520
mole of iron, let's say iron
56-- there's obviously many

121
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,450
isotopes or iron-- let's say
we're dealing with iron 56.

122
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,380
You normally don't hear it like
that, but let's say we're

123
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,790
dealing with the isotope
of iron that has a

124
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,610
mass number of 56.

125
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:12,070
So if I have 1 mole of this, 1
mole of this atom right here,

126
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,170
that's going to have a mass of--
the math isn't difficult

127
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:23,180
here-- 56 grams. And if you
think about it, how many

128
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,170
atomic mass units is this?

129
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,850
Well, this is 56 atomic
mass units per atom.

130
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,815
Then you have a mole of those,
so you have 6.02 times 10 to

131
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:37,830
the 23 times 56 atomic
mass units.

132
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,700
And then you divide it by
the number of atomic

133
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,950
mass units per gram.

134
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,390
And you end up with 56 grams.

135
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,330
But the easy way to think about
it is you just take

136
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,280
whatever the mass number is.

137
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,100
If you have silicon, if you have
a mole of silicon, a mole

138
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,150
of silicon will have a mass--
I don't want to say weight

139
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,750
because this should apply to
any planet-- of 28 grams.

140
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,325
What about 2 moles of silicon?

141
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,230
And I'll write its
mass number.

142
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,950
Let's say silicon has
a mass number of 28.

143
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,720
Two moles of silicon.

144
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,010
Well, 1 mole would have a mass
of 28 grams, so 2 moles is

145
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:23,570
going to have a mass
of 56 grams.

146
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:30,100
If I were to say, let's say I
had 4 moles of oxygen, which

147
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,059
has a mass number of 16.

148
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,140
What is the mass of that?

149
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,659
This is a huge number of oxygen
atoms-- what would be

150
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,000
the mass of that?

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,750
Well, it would be 4 times-- 1
mole of oxygen would have a

152
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:52,960
mass of 16 grams, so 4
moles has 64 grams.

153
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,660
It's confusing because we're not
used to using a word like

154
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,490
moles as a number, but all
it is is a number.

155
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,480
And the easy way to think
about is that it lets us

156
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,640
translate between this atomic
mass unit number and grams.

157
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,530
And you say, well, how do
I get that many grams?

158
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,610
Well, I have to have 6.02 times
10 to the 23 carbon

159
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,760
atoms for that collection of
carbon to have a mass of 12

160
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,360
grams. That's all
that mole means.

161
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,445
It's just a number.

162
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:21,740
And I encourage you to kind of
play around with a lot of what

163
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,800
we talked about.

164
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,140
Because it's super important to
have the intuition behind

165
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,780
moles, otherwise you'll get
confused later on when we

166
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,470
start getting into energies
in terms of it requires

167
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,330
kilojoules per mole, and what is
the energy of this reaction

168
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,310
and all that type of stuff.

169
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,970
So just really try to make sure
you digest this as well

170
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,530
as possible.

171
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,290
And let me know if you don't
and I'll maybe make another

172
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,590
video on this because
it's so important.
