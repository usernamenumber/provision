1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Find the slope of the line that goes through the ordered pairs

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(7, -1) and (-3,-1).

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me just do a quick graph of these so we can visualize what it looks like

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let me draw a quick graph over here.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, our first point is (7, -1)

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the x-axis.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(7,-1) is right over there.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(7, -1)

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is of course the y-axis.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then the next point is (-3,-1)

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we go back three in the horizontal direction

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
-3, but the y-coordinate is still -1.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the line that connects these 2 lines will look like this

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It will look like that
