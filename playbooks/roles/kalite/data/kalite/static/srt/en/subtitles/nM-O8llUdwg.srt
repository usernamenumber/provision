00:00:00,603 --> 00:00:05,007
PROBLEM: Construct a line perpendicular to the given line.

2
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:08,341
So, if I can pick two arbitrary points on this line –

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,650
and if I can make a line that is always

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,913
equidistant from those two points,

5
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:14,561
then that line will be perpendicular –

6
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:16,580
– and actually it will be a perpendicular bisector

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,947
of the segment formed by those two points.

8
00:00:18,947 --> 00:00:21,527
Now they don't care whether we're bisecting anything.

9
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:23,309
But they do care about it being perpendicular.

10
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:24,492
So let's do this.

11
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:27,603
So I'm going to draw a circle with my compass.

12
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:30,727
And so let's just pick that point right over there.

13
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:33,230
I can adjust the radius if I like.

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,402
But I might as well –

15
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:35,933
Well, I'll just leave it right over there.

16
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,311
Now let me draw another circle.

17
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:39,515
And this time, I'm going to center it where

18
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:43,562
the first circle intersects with my line.

19
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:45,084
And then I'm going to adjust the radius

20
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:49,949
to overlap with the first dot.

21
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,519
And now, where these two circles intersect,

22
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,515
those are points that are equidistant

23
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:59,783
from both of these centers that I just constructed.

24
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:02,794
So let me draw a line that connects those two.

25
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:05,512
And that line is going to be perpendicular

26
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:08,786
to our original line.
