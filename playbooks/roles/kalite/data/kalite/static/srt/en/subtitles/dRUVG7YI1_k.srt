1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,169
Now this is our solution.

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,365
First, Alice and Bob agree publicly on a prime modulist

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:07,948
and a generator.

4
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:10,696
In this case, 17 and 3.

5
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:17,011
Then, Alice selects a private random number, say 15, and calculates:

6
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:22,802
3 to the power 15 mod 17, and sends this result

7
00:00:22,802 --> 00:00:24,821
publicly to Bob.

8
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:31,524
Then Bob selects his private random number, say 13, and calculates:

9
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:36,600
3 to the power 13 mod 17, and sends this result

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,489
publicly to Alice.

11
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,887
And now the hard of the trick.

12
00:00:40,887 --> 00:00:43,857
Alice takes Bob's public result and rasies

13
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:46,873
it to the power of her private number

14
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:51,457
to obtain the shared secret which in this case is 10.

15
00:00:51,457 --> 00:00:54,813
Bob takes Alice's public result and rasies

16
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:58,029
it to the power of his private number, resulting

17
00:00:58,029 --> 00:01:00,568
in the same shared secret.

18
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:05,626
Notice they did the same calculation, though it might not look like it at first.

19
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:14,009
Consider Alice. The 12 she received from Bob was calculated as 3 to the power 13 mod 17.

20
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:21,079
So her calculation was the same as 3 to the power 13, to the power 15 mod 17.

21
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:29,862
Now consider Bob. The 6 he received from Alice was calculated as 3 to the power 15 mod 17.

22
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:35,169
So his calculation was the same as 3 to the power 15, to the power 13.

23
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:39,308
Notice they did the same calculation with the exponents in a different order.

24
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,619
When you flip the exponent the result doesn't change.

25
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:47,629
So they both calculated 3 raised to the power of their private numbers.
