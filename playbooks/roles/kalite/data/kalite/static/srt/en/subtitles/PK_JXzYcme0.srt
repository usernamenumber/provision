1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,260
We saw in the last video that if
we defined enthalpy, H, as

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,160
being equal to the internal
energy of a system plus the

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,860
pressure of the system times the
volume of the system-- and

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,060
this is an almost arbitrary
definition.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,100
But we know that this is
a valid state variable.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,910
That no matter what you do in
terms of how you get there,

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,330
you're always going to
have the same value.

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,770
Because it's the sum
and product of

10
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,510
other valid state variables.

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,100
But this by itself isn't that
useful or that intuitive.

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,330
But we saw in the last video
that if you assume constant

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,720
pressure-- and that's a big
assumption, but it's not an

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,290
unreasonable assumption for
most chemical reactions.

15
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,780
Because most chemical reactions,
you know, we're

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,480
sitting at the beach with our
beakers, and they're exposed

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,640
to just standard temperature and
pressure, or at least some

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,420
pressure, that's not changing
as the reaction occurs.

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,200
If we assume constant pressure,
we saw that the

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:57,570
change in enthalpy becomes the
heat added to the system at

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,670
that constant pressure.

22
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,090
That P there is just to show you
that hey, this is assuming

23
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,870
that we're dealing with
heat being added

24
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,480
at a constant pressure.

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,090
Fair enough.

26
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,820
So how can we use these concepts
in any useful way?

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,380
Let's say that I had some carbon
in its elemental form

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,150
as graphite, and I add
to that-- say I

29
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,280
have a mole of carbon.

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,010
And I add to that 2 moles
of hydrogen in

31
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,820
its elemental form.

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,810
It's going to be a gas, and
it's going to be as a

33
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,930
molecule, right?

34
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,360
If I just have a bunch of
hydrogen in its gaseous state,

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,670
let's say, in a balloon, I'm not
going to have individual

36
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,760
atoms of hydrogen.

37
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,890
They're going to bond and form
these diatomic molecules.

38
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,800
And if I react them, I'm going
to produce a mole of methane.

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,530
CH4.

40
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,020
But that's not all I'm
going to produce.

41
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,110
I'm also going to produce
some heat.

42
00:01:51,110 --> 00:02:01,250
I'm going to produce 74
kilojoules of heat-- plus 74

43
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,460
kilojoules of heat-- when
I produce that one mole.

44
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,699
I'll do a lower case
k for the kilo.

45
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,330
When I produce that one
mole of methane.

46
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,240
So what's happening here?

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,960
So first of all, how much heat
is being added to the system?

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,740
And let's assume that this heat
just gets released from

49
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,230
the system.

50
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,480
That this isn't an adiabatic
process.

51
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,520
I haven't insulated the
system from anything.

52
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,050
That this just gets released.

53
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,650
It just goes away.

54
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,200
It gets released.

55
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,830
So my question is, how much--
you know, I started off with

56
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,550
this container, I guess we could
call it, that's at a

57
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,700
standard, fixed pressure.

58
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,270
And maybe I had a bunch
of-- well, I

59
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,090
wanted to do the carbon.

60
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,430
I'll do it in gray.

61
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,210
I have a bunch of solid
carbon lying around.

62
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,230
Maybe some type of dust. And
then I have some molecular

63
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,470
hydrogen gas.

64
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,910
Each of those dots is actually
two hydrogen atoms. And then,

65
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,700
I don't know, maybe I shake it
up or something to make them

66
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:05,430
react, and then I get a
bunch of methane gas.

67
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,120
I'll do that in green.

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,080
So now I just have a bunch of
methane gas, and I released 74

69
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,330
kilojoules.

70
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,160
   

71
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,980
So how much heat was added
to the system?

72
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,150
Well, we released heat
from the system.

73
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,980
We released 74 kilojoules.

74
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,700
So the heat added to the
system was minus 74

75
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,170
kilojoules.

76
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,460
Right?

77
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,870
If I asked you the heat
released, then I

78
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,840
would have said 74.

79
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,930
But remember, we care about the
heat added to the system,

80
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,420
is 74 kilojoules.

81
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,820
And I just showed you that
that's the exact same thing as

82
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,070
the change in enthalpy.

83
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,280
   

84
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,990
So how can we think
about this?

85
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,510
What is the enthalpy
of this system

86
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,280
relative to this system?

87
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,650
Well, it's going to
be lower, right?

88
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,550
Because if you take enthalpy--
so the change in enthalpy is

89
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:06,480
the enthalpy of your final
system, minus the enthalpy of

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,720
your initial system.

91
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,970
And we got a negative number.

92
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,600
We got minus 74 kilojoules.

93
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,589
So this has to be lower than
this by 74 kilojoules.

94
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,680
So this enthalpy right here
is less than this

95
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,640
enthalpy right here.

96
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,850
So if we were to actually draw
it on a diagram, if I were to

97
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,490
draw the reaction-- let's say
that this is just time or

98
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,290
something, as the reaction
proceeds, that axis.

99
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,340
And on the y-axis, I'll
draw enthalpy.

100
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,150
So the reaction starts off at
your initial enthalpy, Hi and

101
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,970
that's this state right here.

102
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,760
So you start there.

103
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,615
I'll do it in the yellow
of that container.

104
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:50,680
   

105
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,060
You start there.

106
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,270
And then, I don't know, you
shake it up, or I'm not going

107
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,180
to go into the activation
energies, so it might have

108
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,160
little hump and all of
that, but who knows.

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,320
But then we end up at
our final enthalpy.

110
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,090
We have this final enthalpy,
right here, after the reaction

111
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,510
has occured.

112
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,910
That's this state right here.

113
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,790
This is H final.

114
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,680
So you can see, you've had this
drop off in enthalpy.

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,530
And what's interesting here is,
is not so much what the

116
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,240
absolute value of this enthalpy
is here, or what the

117
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,150
absolute value of this
enthalpy here is.

118
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,580
But now that we have enthalpy,
we can kind of have a

119
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,260
framework for thinking about
how much heat energy is in

120
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,970
this system relative
to this system.

121
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,310
And given that there's less
heat energy in this system

122
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,100
than that energy system, we
must have released energy.

123
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,960
And you know, to some degree,
I told you that from the

124
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,120
beginning, right?

125
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,990
I told you that energy
is released.

126
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,910
And the word for this we
use is exothermic.

127
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,860
   

128
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,920
Now, if you want to go the
other way-- let's say we

129
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,000
wanted to go from methane and
go back, you'd have to add

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,510
heat into the reaction.

131
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,500
If you wanted to go backwards
through this reaction, go

132
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,290
upwards, you would have to add
that heat content to get that

133
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,850
positive delta H, and
then you would have

134
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,430
an endothermic reaction.

135
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,350
So if a reaction releases
energy, exothermic.

136
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,940
If a reaction needs energy to
occur, it's endothermic.

137
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,560
   

138
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,390
Now you might be asking, Sal,
where'd that energy come from?

139
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,400
So I started at this
enthalpy here.

140
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,836
And enthalpy has this weird
definition right here, and

141
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,510
then'll ended up as that
other enthalpy here.

142
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,520
And as you see, enthalpy,
the pressure

143
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,090
we're assuming is constant.

144
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,250
Let's say the volume isn't
changing much in this

145
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,360
situation, or maybe doesn't
change at all.

146
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,030
So most of the change is going
to come from the change in

147
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,680
internal energy, right?

148
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,030
There's some higher internal
energy here, and some lower

149
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,080
internal energy here
that's causing the

150
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,990
main drop in enthalpy.

151
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,620
And that change in internal
energy is really a conversion

152
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,630
from some potential energy,
up here, into

153
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,870
the heat that's released.

154
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,830
So there was some heat that was
released, 74 kilojoules,

155
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,360
and so our internal
energy dropped.

156
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,750
And what all of this does is,
it gives us a framework so

157
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,380
that if we know how much heat
it takes to form or not form

158
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,370
certain products, then we can
kind of predict how much heat

159
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,450
will either be released, or how
much heat will be absorbed

160
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,880
by different reactions.

161
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,190
And so here I'm going to touch
on another notion.

162
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,920
The notion of heat of formation,
or sometimes it's

163
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,770
change in enthalpy
of formation.

164
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,640
So the way they talk about
it is, the change

165
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,390
in enthalpy of formation.

166
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,840
And it's normally given
at some standard

167
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,990
temperature and pressure.

168
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,190
So you put a little, usually
it's a naught, sometimes it's

169
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,270
just a circle in there.

170
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:37,310
And what that is is, what is the
change in enthalpy to get

171
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,480
to some molecule from
its elemental form?

172
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,420
So for example, if we want it
for methane-- if we have

173
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,150
methane there, and we want
to figure out its heat of

174
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:56,630
formation, we say, look, if
we form methane from its

175
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,080
elemental forms, what is the
delta H of that reaction?

176
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,480
Well, we just learned what the
delta H of that reaction was.

177
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,750
It was minus 74 kilojoules.

178
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,080
Which means that if you form
methane from its elemental, I

179
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,500
guess, building blocks, you're
going to release 74

180
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,900
kilojoules of energy.

181
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,625
That this is an exothermic
reaction.

182
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,590
   

183
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,940
Because you've released heat,
you can say that the methane

184
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,180
is in a lower energy state, or
it has a lower potential

185
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,170
energy, than these guys did.

186
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,620
And because it has
lower potential

187
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,990
energy, it's more stable.

188
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,460
I mean, one way to think of it
is, if you have a guy, you

189
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,840
have a mountain here, and down
here, you have a ball.

190
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,650
And this isn't, you know, a
complete, direct analogy.

191
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,090
But the analogy to potential
energy is, look.

192
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,000
When you're down at a lower
potential energy state, you

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,670
tend to be more stable.

194
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,990
And so, in the everyday world,
if you have a bunch of methane

195
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,830
sitting around, the fact that
it has a negative heat of

196
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,020
formation, or a standard heat
of formation, because I have

197
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,490
that naught here, or a negative
standard change in

198
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,270
enthalpy of formation-- those
are all the same things--

199
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,480
tells me that methane is
stable relative to its

200
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,030
constituent compounds.

201
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,690
And actually, you can look
these things up.

202
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,500
You don't have to memorize them,
but it's good to know

203
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,010
what they are.

204
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,850
And I copied all of this stuff--
actually, let me get

205
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,390
the actual tables from
Wikipedia down here.

206
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,270
I copied all of these directly
from Wikipedia.

207
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,750
These give you the standard
heat of formation

208
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,760
of a bunch of things.

209
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,050
And if you look down here, for--
let's see if they have

210
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,110
methane-- right there, this is
what we were dealing with.

211
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,030
They're telling us essentially
the delta H of the reaction

212
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,280
that forms methane.

213
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,240
   

214
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,000
This point table right there
tells us that if we start off

215
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,030
with some carbon in a solid
state, plus two moles of

216
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,860
hydrogen in a gaseous state,
and we form one mole of

217
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,860
methane, that if you take the
enthalpy here minus the

218
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,930
enthalpy here-- so the change
in enthalpy for this

219
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,320
reaction-- at standard
temperature and pressure, is

220
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,100
going to be equal to minus
74 kilojoules.

221
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,990
Per mole.

222
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,170
And this is all given
per mole.

223
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,580
So if you have a mole of this,
two moles of this, to form one

224
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,340
mole of methane, you're
going to release 74

225
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,880
kilojoules of heat.

226
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,370
So this is a stable reaction.

227
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,850
Now there's a couple of
interesting things here, and

228
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,050
we'll keep using this table
over the next few videos.

229
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:46,200
You see here, monoatomic oxygen
has a positive standard

230
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,590
heat of formation.

231
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,300
Which means it takes
energy to form it.

232
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,620
Right?

233
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,360
That if you have a reaction, let
me just say, the reaction,

234
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,180
I'll write it this way.

235
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:05,980
One half of molecular oxygen as
a gas to go to one mole of

236
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,290
oxygen in its gaseous state.

237
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,060
This tells us that this
state has more

238
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,330
potential than this state.

239
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,980
And in order for this reaction
to occur, you have to add

240
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,190
energy to it.

241
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,860
You have to put the energy
on the other side.

242
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:29,340
So you'd have to say,
plus 249 joules.

243
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,500
So you might say, hey, Sal,
that doesn't make sense.

244
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,000
Oxygen is just oxygen.

245
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,800
Why is there a heat of
formation of oxygen?

246
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,260
And that's because you always
use the elemental form as your

247
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,500
reference point.

248
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,870
So oxygen, if you just had
a bunch of oxygen sitting

249
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,790
around, it's going to
be in the O2 form.

250
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,020
If you have a bunch of hydrogen,
it's going to be H2.

251
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,590
If you have a bunch of nitrogen,
it's going to be N2.

252
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,830
Carbon, on the other hand, is
just C, and it tends to be in

253
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,710
its solid form as graphite.

254
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,620
So all heats of formation are
relative to the form that you

255
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,050
find that element when you have
a pure version of it.

256
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,020
Not necessarily its atomic form,
although sometimes it is

257
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,400
its atomic form.

258
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,450
Now, in the next video, we're
going to use this table, which

259
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,690
is a very handy table-- I cut
and pasted parts of it-- to

260
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,470
actually solve problems. In this
last video, I gave you

261
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,550
the heat of formation,
and we just thought

262
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,490
about it a little bit.

263
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,720
In the next few videos, we're
going to use this table that

264
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,580
gives us standard heats of
formation to actually figure

265
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,800
out whether reactions are
endothermic-- meaning they

266
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,040
absorb energy-- or exothermic--
meaning they

267
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,750
release energy-- and we'll
figure out how much.
