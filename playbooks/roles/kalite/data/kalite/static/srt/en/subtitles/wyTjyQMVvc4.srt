1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,480
So let's say I have a function
of x and y; f of x and y is

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,470
equal to x plus y squared.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,400
If I try to draw that,
let's see if I can have

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,100
a good attempt at it.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,590
That is my y axis-- I'm going
to do a little perspective here

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,440
--this is my x axis-- I make do
the negative x and y axis,

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,180
could do it in that direction
--this is my x axis here.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,150
And if I were to graph this
when y is 0, it's going to be

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,720
just a-- let me draw it in
yellow --is going to be just a

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,310
straight line that looks
something like that.

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,050
And then for any given
actually, we're going to

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,010
have a parabola in y.

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,230
y is going to look
something like that.

15
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,335
I'm just going to it in
the positive quadrant.

16
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:41,780
It's going to look
something like that.

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,980
   

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,090
It'll actually, when you go
into the negative y, you're

19
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,905
going to see the other half of
the parabola, but I'm not going

20
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:50,370
to worry about it too much.

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,980
So you're going to
have this surface.

22
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,190
it looks something like that.

23
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,140
Maybe I'll do to another
attempt at drawing it.

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,930
But this is our ceiling we're
going to deal with again.

25
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,340
And then I'm going to have
a path in the xy plane.

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,660
I'm going to start at the
point 2 comma 0. x is

27
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,430
equal to 2, y is 0.

28
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,670
And I'm going to travel, just
like we did in the last video,

29
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,380
I'm going to travel along a
circle, but this time the

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,630
circle's going to
have of radius 2.

31
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,650
Move counter clockwise
in that circle.

32
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,610
This is on the xy plane,
just to be able to

33
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,040
visualize it properly.

34
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,500
So this right here's
a point 0, 2.

35
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,055
And I'm going to come
back along the y axis.

36
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:35,640
This is my path; I'm going to
come back along the y access

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,220
and then so I look a left here,
and then I'm going to take

38
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,640
another left here in and
come back along the x axis.

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,930
   

40
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,540
I drew it in these
two shades of green.

41
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,680
That is my contour.

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,830
And what I want to do is I want
to evaluate the surface area

43
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,260
of essentially this little
building that has the roof of f

44
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,020
of xy is equal to x plus y
squared, and I want to find the

45
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,620
surface area of its walls.

46
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,705
So you'll have this wall right
here, whose base is the x axis.

47
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:09,250
Then you're going to have this
wall, which is along the curve;

48
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,490
it's going to look something
like kind of funky wall on

49
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,410
that curved side right there.

50
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,550
I'll try my best effort to
try to-- it's going to be

51
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:25,510
curving way up like that
and then along the y axis.

52
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,270
   

53
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,240
It's going to have like a half
a parabolic wall right there.

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,150
I'll do that back wall
along the y axis.

55
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,400
I'll do that in orange,
I'll use magenta.

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,530
That is the back wall
along the y axis.

57
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,660
Then you have this front
wall along the x axis.

58
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,230
And then you have this weird
curvy curtain or wall-- do that

59
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,020
maybe in blue --that goes along
this curve right here, this

60
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,740
part of a circle of radius 2.

61
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,890
So hopefully you get
that visualization.

62
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,670
It's a little harder; I'm
not using any graphic

63
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,680
program at this time.

64
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,900
But I want to figure out
the surface area, the

65
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,270
combined surface area
of these three walls.

66
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,390
And in very simple notation we
could say, well, the surface

67
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:16,430
area of those walls-- of this
wall plus that wall plus that

68
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:22,570
wall --is going to be equal to
the line integral along this

69
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,020
curve, or along this contour--
however you want to call it

70
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,820
--of f of xy,-- so that's x
plus y squared --ds, where ds

71
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,220
is just a little length
along our contour.

72
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,450
And since this is a closed
loop, we'll call this a

73
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,500
closed line interval.

74
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,560
And we'll sometimes see
this notation right here.

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,080
   

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,480
Often you'll see that
in physics books.

77
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,870
And we'll be dealing
with a lot more.

78
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,330
And we'll put a circle
on the interval sign.

79
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,060
And all that means is that the
contour we're dealing with is a

80
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,750
closed contour; we get back
to where we started from.

81
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,770
But how do we solve this thing?

82
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,660
A good place to start
is to just to find

83
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,630
the contour itself.

84
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,830
And just to simply it, we're
going to divide it into three

85
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,040
pieces and it essentially just
do three separate

86
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,290
line integrals.

87
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,770
Because you know, this isn't
a very continuous contour.

88
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,050
so the first part.

89
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,980
Let's do this first part of
the curve where we're going

90
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,640
along a circle of radius 2.

91
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,770
And that's pretty easy to
construct if we have x-- let me

92
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:25,850
do each part of the contour in
a different color, so if I do

93
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,920
orange this part of the contour
--if we say that x is equal 2

94
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:39,440
cosine of t and y is equal to 2
sine of t and if we say that

95
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,680
t-- and this is really just
building off what we saw on the

96
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,960
last video --if we say that t--
and that this is from t is a

97
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,170
greater than or equal to 0 and
is less than or equal to pi

98
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,270
over 2 --t is essentially going
to be the angle that

99
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,200
we're going along the
circle right here.

100
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,040
This will actually
describe this path.

101
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,820
And if you know, how I
constructed this is little

102
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,980
confusing, you might want
to review the video on

103
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,860
parametric equations.

104
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,360
So this is the first
part of our path.

105
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,080
So if we just wanted to find
the surface area of that wall

106
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,940
right there, we know we're
going to have to find

107
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,670
dx, dt and dy, dt.

108
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,970
So let's get that out
of the way right now.

109
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:28,770
So if we say dx, dt is going to
be equal to minus 2, sine of t,

110
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:34,495
dy, dy is going to be equal to
2 cosine of t; just the

111
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:35,840
derivatives of these.

112
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,350
We've seen that
many times before.

113
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,290
So it we want this orange
wall's surface area, we can

114
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,675
take the integral-- and if any
of this is confusing, there are

115
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:47,400
two videos before this where we
kind of derive this formula

116
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,170
--but we could take the
integral from t is equal to 0

117
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:59,260
to pi over 2 our function of x
plus y squared and

118
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,610
then times the ds.

119
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,570
So x plus y squared will
give the height of

120
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,550
each little block.

121
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,360
And then we want to get the
width of each little block,

122
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,690
which is ds, but we know that
we can rewrite the ds as the

123
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:18,930
square root-- give myself some
room right here --of dx of the

124
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,310
derivative of x with respect to
t squared-- so that is minus 2

125
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,160
sine of t squared --plus
the derivative of y with

126
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:36,660
respect to t squared, dt.

127
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,050
This will give us the orange
section, and then we can worry

128
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,820
about the other two walls.

129
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,410
And so how can we
simplify this?

130
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,670
Well, this is going to be equal
to the integral from 0 to pi

131
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:55,000
over 2 of x plus y squared.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,180
And actually, let me write
everything in terms of t.

133
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,250
So x is equal to 2 cosine of t.

134
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,910
So let me write that down.

135
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:13,310
So it's 2 cosine of t plus y,
which is 2 sine of t, and we're

136
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,830
going to square everything.

137
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,780
And then all of that times
this crazy radical.

138
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,880
Right now it looks like a hard
antiderivative or integral to

139
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,780
solve, but I we'll find
out it's not too bad.

140
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,380
This is going to be equal to
4 sine squared of t plus

141
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,380
4 cosine squared of t.

142
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,020
We can factor a 4 out.

143
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,450
I don't want to forget the dt.

144
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,820
This over here-- let me just
simplify this expression so I

145
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,260
don't have to keep
rewriting it.

146
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,820
That is the same thing is
the square root of 4 times

147
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,650
sine squared of t plus
cosine squared of t.

148
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,800
We know what that
is: that's just 1.

149
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,516
So this whole thing just
simplifies to the square

150
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:58,650
root of 4, which is just 2.

151
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,120
So this whole thing simplifies
to 2, which is nice for

152
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,290
solving our antiderivative.

153
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,860
That means simplifying
things a lot.

154
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,620
So this whole thing simplifies
down to-- I'll do it over here.

155
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,320
I don't want to waste too much
space; I have two more walls to

156
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,760
figure out --the integral from
t is equal to 0 to pi over 2.

157
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,660
I want to make it very clear.

158
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,700
I just chose the simplest
parametrization I

159
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,080
could for x and y.

160
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,630
But I could have picked
other parametrizations, but

161
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,250
then I would have had to
change t accordingly.

162
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,200
So as long as you're consistent
with how you do it, it

163
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,020
should all work out.

164
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,290
There isn't just one
parametrization for this curve;

165
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,130
it's kind of depending on how
fast you want to go

166
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,140
along the curve.

167
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,450
Watch the parametric functions
videos if you want a little

168
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,900
bit more depth on that.

169
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,860
Anyway, this thing simplifies.

170
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,400
We have a 2 here; 2 times
cosine of t, that's

171
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,720
4 cosine of t.

172
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,500
And then here we have 2 sine
squared sine of t squared.

173
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,430
So that's 4 sine squared of t.

174
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,390
   

175
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,230
And then we have to multiply
times this 2 again, so

176
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,970
that gives us an 8.

177
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,750
8 time sine squared of t, dt.

178
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,040
And then you know, sine squared
of t; that looks like a

179
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,840
tough thing to find the
antiderivative for, but we can

180
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,150
remember that sine squared of,
really anything-- we could say

181
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,660
sine squared of u is equal
to 1/2 half times 1

182
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,290
minus cosine of 2u.

183
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,700
So we can reuse this identity.

184
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,380
I can try the t here; sine
squared of t is equal to 1/2

185
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,540
times 1 minus cosine of 2t.

186
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,050
Let me rewrite it that way
because that'll make the

187
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,390
integral a lot easier to solve.

188
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,530
So we get integral from 0 the
pi over 2-- and actually I

189
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,080
could break up, well I won't
break it up --of 4 cosine of

190
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,550
t plus 8 times this thing.

191
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,350
8 times this thing; this
is the same thing as

192
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,020
sine squared of t.

193
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:02,250
So 8 times this-- 8 times 1/2
is 4 --4 times 1 minus cosine

194
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,590
of 2t-- just use a little trig
identity there --and

195
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,390
all of that dt.

196
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,430
Now this should be reasonably
straight forward to get

197
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,800
the antiderivative of.

198
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,980
Let's just take it.

199
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,500
The antiderivative of this
is antiderivative of cosine

200
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,610
of t; that's a sine of t.

201
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,150
The derivative of
sine is cosine.

202
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,050
So this is going to be 4 sine
of t-- the scalars don't affect

203
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,470
anything --and then, well let
me just distribute this 4.

204
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:34,640
So this is 4 times 1 which
is 4 minus 4 cosine of 2t.

205
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,630
So the antiderivative of 4 is
4t-- plus 4t --and then the

206
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,880
antiderivative of minus
4 cosine of u00b5 t?

207
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,970
Let's see it's going
to be sine of 2t.

208
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:51,590
   

209
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:58,900
The derivative of sine of
2t is 2 cosine of 2t.

210
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,660
We're going to have to have a
minus sign there, and put a 2

211
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,420
there, and now it
should work out.

212
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,740
What's the derivative
of minus 2 sine of t?

213
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,240
Take the derivative of
the inside 2 times

214
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,400
minus 2 is minus 4.

215
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,740
And the derivative of sine
of 2t with respect to

216
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,280
2t is cosine of 2t.

217
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,830
So there we go; we've figured
out our antiderivative.

218
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,260
Now we evaluate it
from 0 the pi over 2.

219
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,000
   

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,420
And what do we get?

221
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,210
We get 4 sine-- let me write
this down, for I don't want to

222
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:34,100
skip too many --sine of pi over
2 plus 4 times pi over 2--

223
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:42,040
that's just 2 pi minus 2 sine
of 2 times pi over 2 sine of

224
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,620
pie, and then all of that minus
all this evaluated at 0.

225
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,580
That's actually pretty
straightforward because

226
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,670
sine of 0 is 0.

227
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,490
4 times 0 is 0, and sine of
2 times 0, that's also 0.

228
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,190
So everything with the
0's work out nicely.

229
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,350
And then what do we have here?

230
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,770
Sine of pi over 2-- in my head,
I think sine of 90 degrees;

231
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,320
same thing --that is 1.

232
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,980
And then sine of pi is
0, that's 180 degrees.

233
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,670
So this whole thing
cancels out.

234
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,440
So we're left with 4 plus 2 pi.

235
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,290
So just like that we were able
to figure out the area of this

236
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,520
first curvy wall here,
and frankly, that's

237
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,710
the hardest part.

238
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,760
Now let's figure out the
area of this curve.

239
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,220
And actually you're going to
find out that these other

240
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,830
curves as they go along the
axes are much, much, much

241
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,760
easier, but we're going to
have to find different

242
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,480
parametrizations for this.

243
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,390
So if we take this curve
right here, let's do a

244
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,590
parametrization for that.

245
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,490
Actually, you know what?

246
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,630
Let me continue this in the
next video because I realize

247
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,920
I've been running
a little longer.

248
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,110
I'll do the next two walls and
then we'll sum them all up.
