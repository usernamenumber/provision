1
00:00:00,216 --> 00:00:04,391
[music]

2
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:08,141
This is a painting that's actually about the things we can't see.

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,974
We're looking at Holbein's "The Ambassadors,"

4
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:14,629
from 1533, here in the National Gallery in London.

5
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:17,684
On the left, Jean de Dinteville,

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,311
who was an ambassador from France living in England;

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:20,311
   

8
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,129
and on the right, Georges de Selve, his friend,

9
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,091
a bishop and also an ambassador.

10
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:28,293
Both of these men are in England.

11
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:30,479
And Holbein, who was a Swiss painter,

12
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:33,059
had moved to England because he could get work here.

13
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,161
And in fact, within a short time after making this painting,

14
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,048
he would actually become the painter

15
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:39,848
to the King of England, Henry VIII [the Eighth].

16
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:42,309
King Henry VIII is about to break away

17
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,847
from the Pope in Rome, from the Catholic Church;

18
00:00:45,847 --> 00:00:49,477
and we know that the French ambassador was in England

19
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:51,469
to keep an eye on Henry VIII

20
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,314
during this tumultuous period.

21
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:56,114
And we see within the painting references

22
00:00:56,114 --> 00:00:58,799
to the turmoil that is taking place in England.

23
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,324
But it's all within an even greater context.

24
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:03,722
So let's start with the two men.

25
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:06,226
We see Jean de Dinteville on the left.

26
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:07,935
And he's the one who commissioned this painting,

27
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,868
and he's the one whose house the painting hung in.

28
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:16,072
And he's obviously represented as an enormously wealthy and successful man,

29
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:21,338
with his fur-lined cloak, and velvet and satin clothing and -

30
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:22,421
- He holds a dagger!

31
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:24,945
-He holds a dagger, on which is inscribed his age,

32
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:27,142
which was 29, so he's a very young man.

33
00:01:27,142 --> 00:01:31,007
And Holbein really described his clothing

34
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,213
with a sense of clarity and detail that we expect

35
00:01:34,213 --> 00:01:36,955
of that Northern tradition that Holbein comes from.

36
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:39,227
And then on the right, Georges de Selve

37
00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:42,334
is dressed more modestly, in a fur cloak.

38
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:45,789
And he's got his elbow on a book.

39
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,059
And it really is an interesting kind of contrast.

40
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:50,056
We have that dagger on the one side,

41
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:51,258
and a book on the other -

42
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:53,531
references which are actually quite traditional

43
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,596
to the active versus the contemplative life.

44
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:59,758
And Georges de Selve's - the book that he's got his elbow on -

45
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:03,220
has inscribed on it his age, which is 25.

46
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,259
Of course, we're meant to look at both of them,

47
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,758
but even more than that, perhaps,

48
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:08,673
we're meant to look at what's in the middle of the painting,

49
00:02:08,673 --> 00:02:11,597
which is all these objects on these two levels of shelves.

50
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:13,967
Holbein is just brilliant in his ability

51
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:18,587
to render textures and the material reality of those objects.

52
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:20,673
And of course, they also mean something.

53
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,290
On the top shelf, we have objects that are related

54
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,265
to the heavens - to the study of astronomy,

55
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:26,712
and to the measuring of time;

56
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:28,384
and on the lower shelf,

57
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,849
things that are more earthly.

58
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,716
We have a terrestrial globe,

59
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:34,220
and a lute, and a book about arithmetic,

60
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,259
and a book of hymns.

61
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:38,092
The painting is functioning basically as a grid.

62
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,935
On the left you have the active life,

63
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:42,217
on the right you have the contemplative life;

64
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:44,456
at the top you've got the celestial sphere,

65
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,457
at the bottom the terrestrial sphere.

66
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,169
Look at the beautifully foreshortened lute

67
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,323
on the bottom shelf.

68
00:02:50,323 --> 00:02:53,291
Lutes were traditionally objects that were rendered

69
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,350
in order to learn perspective, and here

70
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,980
there's just this masterful representation

71
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,295
of the way in which that lute is much shorter than it should be,

72
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:03,921
because we're seeing it on end.

73
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:05,751
But if you look very closely,

74
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:09,590
and it's possible because of Holbein's high-pitched clarity,

75
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,650
you can see that one of the strings is actually snapped.

76
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,385
It's broken.

77
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:16,426
Art historians understand this as referring to

78
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:19,505
the discord in Europe at this time, the discord in the Church.

79
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:22,215
That can also be seen in the hymnbook,

80
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:23,565
which is just below that.

81
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:27,253
It's open, and it's so precisely painted that it can actually be read.

82
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:30,002
It's a translation of a hymn by Martin Luther,

83
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,243
of course the head of the Protestant Reformation.

84
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:35,380
So all of this luxury - we haven't even mentioned,

85
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,904
for instance, the Oriental carpet -

86
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:40,682
all of these objects, all of the extraordinary fashion that they wear -

87
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:44,072
all of this stands on a mosaic floor,

88
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:46,386
with this beautifully detailed tiling.

89
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:49,599
And it's seen in perfect linear perspective.

90
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,620
And this is reference to an actual floor at Westminster Abbey.

91
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,119
And what's important to know is that that floor in that church

92
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,505
is actually a kind of diagram,

93
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:02,757
and it's meant to represent the macrocosm -

94
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:04,516
that is, the cosmic order.

95
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:08,505
If we look at the very large form that occupies the foreground,

96
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:10,796
- you know, I had a student once that, when she looked at this,

97
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:12,702
said it looked like a piece of driftwood

98
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:15,921
that had somehow been placed down oddly in the foreground.

99
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:19,309
It does, but when you go to the right corner

100
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:22,045
of the painting, and kind of crouch down a bit -

101
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:24,443
-or look at it in a mirror, at an angle -

102
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:27,179
- what we're really looking at is an anamorphic image,

103
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:31,258
a kind of image that's been artificially stretched in perspective.

104
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:33,465
And it's a skull, a human skull.

105
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,360
It's something that you can't see

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,006
when you can see the other things in the painting,

107
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:40,505
but it's something you can see

108
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:43,599
when you don't see the other things in the painting.

109
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:44,422
So you have a choice.

110
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:46,907
You can either stand in such a way as to see the skull,

111
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:48,779
but then everything else is distorted,

112
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:50,097
or vice versa.

113
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:51,910
Front and center in this painting,

114
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,196
really in a sense the star of the painting,

115
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:57,602
is this skull, which is a traditional symbol of death -

116
00:04:57,602 --> 00:04:58,821
- a "memento mori" -

117
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:00,743
That's right, a reminder of death -

118
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:03,498
and that's a very common element that we see in paintings -

119
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:05,843
But here, we have a painting that seemed

120
00:05:05,843 --> 00:05:08,626
for a moment to be celebrating these earthly achievements,

121
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:10,428
and now seems to be undercutting it.

122
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:11,417
Exactly.

123
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:13,681
And then, if you look even more carefully,

124
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:16,180
in the extreme upper left corner of the painting,

125
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,967
peeking out from behind the curtain,

126
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:22,426
you can just make out a little sculpture of a crucifixion.

127
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:25,372
But then we have this question that goes back to Holbein,

128
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:28,417
and that is about representation.

129
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,776
So you have the lute that you referred to,

130
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:32,284
that's perfectly foreshortened;

131
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:36,917
or that floor that's a perfect perspectival illusion also,

132
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:41,361
so this ability to render reality so perfectly.

133
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:43,232
And then you have Holbein choosing

134
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:47,262
to represent the skull in an un-naturalistic way,

135
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:52,173
so choosing to represent the earthly things in a realistic way,

136
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:55,388
but choosing to represent that which is supernatural,

137
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,183
or that which is transcendent, in a way that is

138
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:02,431
not according to that perfect illusionism.

139
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:06,322
And I think that Holbein really wants us to see that contrast.

140
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:09,957
Look at the relationship between the lute and the skull.

141
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:14,828
The skull is distorted so extremely that it really is hard to read.

142
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:17,013
But when we think about stretching something,

143
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:19,398
you generally think about stretching it horizontally,

144
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:20,303
or perhaps vertically.

145
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:22,563
But to do so diagonally is very particular.

146
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:24,931
The lute is resting on that shelf,

147
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:28,258
and I had mentioned before that it was heavily foreshortened.

148
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:31,689
It really is foreshortened at an angle that is very close

149
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:34,309
to the angle of the distortion of the skull,

150
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:37,681
but remember, foreshortening is another kind of distortion.

151
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:40,288
And so in a sense, they are both distortions,

152
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:43,186
but one is a distortion that creates a reality

153
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:46,302
of our world, as we see, but it's a reminder

154
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:49,567
that perhaps what we see is not really truth.

155
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:52,017
That's right. It's not all there is.

156
00:06:52,017 --> 00:06:55,511
So hold on, because this painting was all about

157
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:57,519
what these men had achieved in life.

158
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,470
And what human beings had achieved historically,

159
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,525
through our investigation of the world.

160
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:06,770
And so, the two elements that are half-hidden in this painting,

161
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,181
the crucifix and the skull, point to the limits

162
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,513
of earthly life, the limits of earthly vision,

163
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:19,820
of man's knowledge, and the inevitability of death,

164
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,277
and the promise of Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

165
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:32,068
