1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
   

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,806
We are on number six, which
I will do in this color.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:09,740
   

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,110
If y is the midpoint of
x, z, which of the

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,190
following must be true?

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:26,130
So if I had a line, x, z, y is
the midpoint of this, right?

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,290
So this length is equal to this
length, because equal

8
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,650
distance between the two.

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:36,770
So the choices they give us,
choice one, they say yz is

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,150
equal to 1/2xz.

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,500
   

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,370
Let's see, yz is this length,
and xz is this whole length.

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,630
And yeah, sure, yz is going to
be 1/2 of the whole length,

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,870
because it's the midpoint.

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,330
Because this is the same
distance as this distance, so

16
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,870
this distance will be
1/2 of the whole.

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,920
So this is right.

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:12,870
Two: 1/2xz is equal to 2xy.

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,170
So now they're saying
1/2 of this entire

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,625
distance is equal to xy.

21
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,080
It's not equal to 2xy.

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,330
This is wrong.

23
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,380
This would have been right
if there wasn't a 2 here.

24
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,920
If we got rid of this,
then it's right.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,400
Then it's something
similar to this.

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,410
Then it would be saying
that this is 1/2

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:31,930
of the whole thing.

28
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,110
But when you put that 2 here,
it makes it wrong.

29
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,630
xz is actually equal to 2xy,
so that's not right.

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,490
So this is not right.

31
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:48,910
And choice three says,
2xy is equal to xz.

32
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,060
And this looks right, because
that's saying this

33
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,560
distance times 2.

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,580
So the times 2 will give us the
whole distance, and the

35
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,160
whole distance is xz.

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,210
The whole distance is xz,
so this is right.

37
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,340
So choices one and three are
correct, and that is choice E.

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,120
Next problem, number seven.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:15,230
   

40
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:30,030
If 2r is equal to 5s, and 5s
is equal to 6t, what does r

41
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,650
equal in terms of t?

42
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,160
And these are easy, because you
don't really have to solve

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,390
for anything.

44
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,490
2r is equal to 5s, 5s is
equal to 6t, so 2r is

45
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,352
equal to 6t, right?

46
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:43,770
So 2r is equal to 6t.

47
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,380
2r is equal to something that's
equal to 6t, so 2r is

48
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,262
equal to 6t.

49
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:49,090
And they want to know
r in terms of t.

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:56,000
So r is equal to-- divide both
sides by 2-- r is equal to 3t,

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,250
which is choice C.

52
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,830
   

53
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,080
Problem eight.

54
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,610
   

55
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,120
A total of k passengers
went on a bus trip.

56
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,360
   

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,080
Each of the n buses that were
used to transport the

58
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,640
passengers could seat a maximum
of x passengers.

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,875
So n buses, x capacity.

60
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,950
   

61
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:33,930
If 1 bus had 3 empty seats-- so
1 had 3 empty seats-- and

62
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,230
the remaining buses were filled,
which of the following

63
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:43,460
represents the relationship
among n, x, and k?

64
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,690
Well, let's think about
what happens.

65
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:53,080
Essentially, we used all of
our capacity except for 3

66
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,300
seats, right?

67
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,840
So we could say-- I don't know
how they want to write it, but

68
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,530
I'll just say what I'll
write-- so the total

69
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,215
passengers traveled-- that's
what they said is k-- is going

70
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,160
to be equal to our
total capacity.

71
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,790
Our total capacity is n buses
times x people per bus.

72
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,410
But then we know that there
are 3 empty seats.

73
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,250
We would be done if there
were no empty seats.

74
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,000
Then we would have just said,
well, we had n buses.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,320
Each of them held its entire
capacity, so we

76
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,080
took n times x people.

77
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,550
We know that there are 3 empty
seats out of all the buses.

78
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,200
There's 1 bus with
3 empty seats.

79
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,150
So we know that there's 3 less
people than the full capacity.

80
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,070
So that's our answer,
k equals nx minus 3.

81
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,631
And that is choice A.

82
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:45,330
It wasn't too bad, huh?

83
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,300
Problem number nine.

84
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,130
Looks like Sal's going to
have to do some drawing.

85
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,095
   

86
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:54,780
I haven't used red
in a long time.

87
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,265
Probably because it's tacky,
but I'll use red.

88
00:04:57,265 --> 00:05:01,240
So I have this line here.

89
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,710
I have another line that,
at least from the

90
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,750
drawing, looks parallel.

91
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,035
I don't know if it is.

92
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:10,446
I know that we can assume that
we have this line that looks

93
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:13,220
like it goes in like that.

94
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,160
Almost done.

95
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,490
And then I have a line that
looks something like this.

96
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:27,480
And then the labels are, this
is 80 degrees, and they tell

97
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:36,880
us that this, right here,
is 50 degrees,

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,470
and this is x degrees.

99
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:40,850
That's all they tell us.

100
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,292
And this is line l, this
line m, this is line k.

101
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:48,510
And they say the figure above
line l is parallel to line m.

102
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,010
Well, OK, so we know-- and they
look parallel too-- What

103
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,810
is the value of x?

104
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,250
This is the angle game, if
you've seen the geometry

105
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,410
videos that I've done.

106
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,370
Well, first of all, we can just
figure out corresponding

107
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,590
angles, or we'll do our
best to figure out

108
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,465
corresponding angles.

109
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:10,475
So let me ask you a question.

110
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:16,640
If this angle is 80 degrees,
what is-- and when I do these

111
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,950
problems, I literally just try
to figure out all the angles

112
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,760
in a direction that will
eventually get me to x-- so

113
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,900
what angles can I figure out?

114
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,700
Well, if this is 80,
what angle is this?

115
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,070
Well, these 2 angles are
supplementary, right?

116
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,385
So they add up to 180.

117
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:36,740
So this is 80, this is going
to be 100 degrees.

118
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:43,410
Now, if this angle right here
is 100 degrees, well, then

119
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,760
what is-- well, let's just
keep doing this--

120
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,010
what is this angle?

121
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,100
   

122
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, they're alternate interior
angles, right?

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,430
And if you remember from your
parallel lines in geometry

124
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,890
class, or if you remember from
the videos on alternate

125
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,560
interior angles, or on the angle
game I've done, we know

126
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,190
that this angle is equal
to this angle.

127
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,930
So this angle is also
100 degrees.

128
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,920
And we know that because this
line right here is a

129
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,720
transversal, and these two
lines are parallel.

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,670
That's how we can make
that assumption.

131
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,800
Now, if this is 100, this angle
is 50, what's going to

132
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,080
be this angle right here?

133
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,380
Well, once again, we know that
these 3 angles together form

134
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,990
180, right?

135
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,340
All 3 combined are
supplementary.

136
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,140
So if 100, 150-- so these are
150, so this one has to be 30

137
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,040
degrees, because it all
adds up to 180.

138
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,400
I think we're almost there.

139
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,840
If this angle is 30 degrees,
what is x?

140
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,920
What is this angle?

141
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,610
Well, this angle and x are also
supplementary, so they

142
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,240
have to add up to 180 degrees.

143
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,740
So if this is 30,
then x is 150.

144
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,965
These are supplementary
along this line.

145
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:04,980
And so x is 150 degrees,
and that is choice A.

146
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,600
   

147
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:17,020
Next problem, problem 10.

148
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:26,510
They tell us 3x squared is less
than 3x, and the whole

149
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,590
thing squared.

150
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,679
For what value of x is the
above statement false?

151
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:43,250
OK, so the choices are A is
minus 3, B is 0, C is 1/3, D

152
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:49,950
is 1, and then E is none of
the above, essentially.

153
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,070
OK, so let's see, is it
false for this one?

154
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,430
Minus 3 squared, so it's 3 times
9 is less than-- what's

155
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,260
3 times minus 3?-- minus 9
squared is less than 81.

156
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,950
So 27 is less than 81.

157
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,410
That's true.

158
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,950
For 0, 3 times 0 squared
is 0, is less than 0

159
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,820
squared, which is 0.

160
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,610
Well, that's not true.

161
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,910
0 is less than 0?

162
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,040
Not true.

163
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,596
So this is our choice,
choice B.

164
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,580
Well, I only have 30 seconds
left, so I'll do number 11 in

165
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,710
the next video.

166
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,370
I'll see you soon.

167
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,800
