1
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:08,529
The signal fire is no doubt one of the oldest technologies

2
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:10,662
for transmitting information –

3
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:14,509
perhaps dating back to the first controlled use of fire.

4
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,142
It allows one person to influence another's belief state –

5
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:21,119
across a distance.

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,775
Because with the ability to notice

7
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:25,762
either the presence or absence of something,

8
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:29,937
we are able to switch between one of two belief states.

9
00:00:29,937 --> 00:00:32,719
One difference. Two states.

10
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:37,198
And ff we look back in history,

11
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:39,240
we find that this was of great importance

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,712
to military powers,

13
00:00:40,712 --> 00:00:44,249
which all rely on effective communications.

14
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:45,382
And a great place to begin

15
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:47,796
is with the Greek myth of Cadmus –

16
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:50,035
a Phoenician prince who introduced

17
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:52,638
the 'phonetic' letters to Greece.

18
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:53,956
The Greek alphabet –

19
00:00:53,956 --> 00:00:55,773
borrowed from the Phoenician letters –

20
00:00:55,773 --> 00:00:58,471
along with light, and cheap, papyrus –

21
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:00,598
effected the transfer of power

22
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:03,982
from the priestly to the military class.

23
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:07,073
And Greek military history provides clear evidence

24
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:09,484
of the first advancements in communication,

25
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:12,455
stemming from the use of signal torches.

26
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:16,672
Polybius was a Greek historian born in 200 BC.

27
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:18,155
He wrote 'The Histories,' which is

28
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:19,903
a treasure trove of detail related to

29
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:23,022
the communication technologies of the time.

30
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:26,462
He writes: "The power of acting at the right time

31
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:30,390
contributes very much to the success of enterprises.

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,005
And fire signals are the most efficient of all devices

33
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:36,412
which aid us to do this."

34
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:40,470
However, the limitation of a signal fire was clear to him.

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,449
He writes:

36
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,821
"It was possible for those who had agreed on this

37
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:47,144
to convey information that, say, a fleet had arrived.

38
00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:48,836
But when it came to some citizens

39
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:50,897
having been guilty of treachery,

40
00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:53,557
or a massacre having taken place in town –

41
00:01:53,557 --> 00:01:57,093
things that often happen, but cannot all be foreseen –

42
00:01:57,093 --> 00:02:01,565
all such matters defied communication by fire signal."

43
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:03,277
A fire signal is great when

44
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:06,254
the space of possible messages is small –

45
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:11,452
such as enemy has arrived or not arrived.

46
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:13,646
However, when the message space – which is

47
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:17,101
the total number of possible messages – grows,

48
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:20,334
there was a need to communicate many differences.

49
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:23,173
And in The Histories, Polybius describes a technology

50
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:25,722
developed by Aeneas Tacticus –

51
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:28,481
one of the earliest Greek writers on the art of war –

52
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,132
from the 4th century BC.

53
00:02:31,132 --> 00:02:33,997
And his technology was described as follows:

54
00:02:33,997 --> 00:02:35,625
"Those who are about to communicate

55
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,313
urgent news to each other by fire signal

56
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:40,043
should procure two vessels

57
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:42,845
of exactly the same width and depth.

58
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,908
And through the middle should pass a rod,

59
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:47,879
graduated into equal sections –

60
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,493
each clearly marked off from the next,

61
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:52,174
denoted with a Greek letter."

62
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:53,895
Each letter would correspond to

63
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:56,525
a single message in a look-up table which contain

64
00:02:56,525 --> 00:03:01,217
the most common events that occur in war.

65
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:04,119
To communicate, they would proceed as follows:

66
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,020
First, the sender would raise his torch

67
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,916
to signal he had a message.

68
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,938
The receiver would then raise his torch,

69
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:12,374
signaling he was ready to receive it.

70
00:03:12,374 --> 00:03:15,649
Then, the sender would lower his torch,

71
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:18,361
and they would both begin to drain their vessels

72
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:22,544
from a bored hole of equal size at the bottom.

73
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:24,831
Now, when the event is reached,

74
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,880
the sender raises his torch

75
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,872
to signal that they should both stop the flow of water.

76
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:34,200
This results in equal water levels,

77
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,114
denoting a single shared message.

78
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:40,638
This ingenious method

79
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:44,920
used differences in time to signal messages.

80
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,433
However, its expressive capabilitiy was limited,

81
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,873
mainly due to its speed.

82
00:03:50,873 --> 00:03:53,089
Polybius then writes of a newer method –

83
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:55,511
originally devised by Democritus –

84
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:58,744
which he claims was "perfected by myself,

85
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:01,411
and quite definite and capable of dispatching –

86
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:02,712
with accuracy –

87
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:04,916
every kind of urgent message."

88
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,336
His method – now known as the 'Polybius Square' –

89
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:08,902
works as follows:

90
00:04:08,902 --> 00:04:11,039
Two people, seperated by a distance,

91
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,692
each have 10 torches –

92
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:15,209
separated into two groups of five.

93
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,294
To begin, the sender raises a torch

94
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:20,063
and waits for the receiver to respond.

95
00:04:20,063 --> 00:04:22,518
Then, the sender lights a certain number

96
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:26,268
from each group of torches – and raises them.

97
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,887
The receiver then counts

98
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:36,512
the number of torches lit in the first group.

99
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:39,152
This number defines the row position

100
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:41,908
in an alphabetic grid they share.

101
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:43,860
And the second group of torches

102
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,329
signifies the column position in this grid.

103
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,093
The intersection of the row and column number

104
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:52,327
defines the letter sent.

105
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:54,101
Realize, this method can be thought of

106
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,734
as the exchange of two symbols.

107
00:04:56,734 --> 00:05:00,215
Each group of five torches is a symbol,

108
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:02,828
which was limited to five differences –

109
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:05,327
from one to five torches.

110
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:07,644
Together, these two symbols multiply

111
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:12,512
to give 5 x 5 = 25 differences –

112
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,142
not 5 + 5.

113
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:17,272
This multiplication demonstrates

114
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:21,417
an important combinatorial understanding in our story.

115
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:25,069
It was explained clearly in a 6th-century-BC

116
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:28,713
Indian medical text, attributed to Sushruta –

117
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:32,389
an ancient Indian sage – as follows:

118
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:34,619
"Given 6 different spices,

119
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:38,174
how many possible different tastes can you make?"

120
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:41,061
Well, the process of making a mixture

121
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:44,384
can be broken down into in six questions:

122
00:05:44,384 --> 00:05:46,963
Do you add A? Yes or no?

123
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,885
Do you add B?

124
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:50,055
C?

125
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:51,142
D?

126
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,180
E?

127
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,508
and F?

128
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:55,898
Realize, this multiplies into

129
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:59,324
a tree of possible answer sequences –

130
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:05,074
2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64 ...

131
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:07,896
64 different sequences of answers

132
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:10,759
are therefore possible.

133
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,538
Realize that given n yes-or-no questions,

134
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:20,021
there are 2 to the power of n possible answer sequences.

135
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:24,245
Now in 1605, Francis Bacon clearly explained

136
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:26,786
how this idea could allow one to send

137
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,849
all letters of the alphabet,

138
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:31,140
using only a single difference.

139
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,651
[Regarding] his 'bilateral cipher,' Bacon wrote, famously:

140
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:37,543
"The transposition of two letters by five placings

141
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:40,734
will be sufficient for 32 differences.

142
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,108
For by this art, a way is opened whereby a man

143
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:47,072
may express and signify the intentions of his mind –

144
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:51,067
at any distance of place – with objects which are capable

145
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,219
of a two-fold difference only."

146
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:56,538
This simple idea of using a single difference

147
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:58,538
to communicate [all of the letters of] the alphabet

148
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:01,415
really took flight in the 17th century,

149
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:03,607
due to the invention of the telescope

150
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:08,178
by Lippershey, in 1608, and Galileo, in 1609.

151
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,338
Because quickly, the maginification power of the human eye

152
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:15,927
jumped from 3, to 8, to 33 times – and beyond.

153
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:18,067
So the observation of a single difference

154
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:21,239
could be made at a much greater distance.

155
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:26,332
Robert Hooke, an English polymath interested in

156
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:30,130
improving the capability of human vision, using lenses,

157
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,856
ignited progress when he told the Royal Society, in 1684,

158
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:37,917
that suddenly, "with a little practice,

159
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:41,012
the same character may be seen at Paris,

160
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:45,546
within a minute after it hath been exposed at London."

161
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:48,027
This was followed by a flood of inventions

162
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,969
to pass differences more effectively

163
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:54,149
across greater distances.

164
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:58,831
One technology, from 1795, perfectly demonstrates

165
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:02,352
the use of a single difference to communicate all things.

166
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:05,703
Lord George Murray's 'shutter telegraph'

167
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:09,926
was Britain's reaction to the Bonapartist threat to England.

168
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:12,778
It was composed of six rotating shutters,

169
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:16,579
which could be oriented as either 'open' or 'closed.'

170
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,884
Here, each shutter can be thought of as a single difference.

171
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:24,484
With six shutters, we have six questions: open or closed –

172
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:29,498
providing us with 2^6, or 64, differences –

173
00:08:29,498 --> 00:08:33,662
enough for all letters, digits, and more.

174
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:37,655
Now realize that each observation of the shutter telegraph

175
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:39,893
can also be thought of as the observation

176
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:45,056
of one of 64 different paths through a decision tree.

177
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:55,242
And with a telescope, it was now possible to send letters

178
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:58,741
at an incredible distance between beacons.

179
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:01,156
However, an observation in 1820

180
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:03,795
led to a revolutionary technology,

181
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:07,279
which forever changed how far these differences

182
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,209
could travel between signaling beacons.

183
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,339
This ushered in new ideas

184
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,596
which launched us into the 'Information Age.'
