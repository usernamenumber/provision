1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,450
Let's say I have a horizontal
pipe that at the left end of

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:21,000
the pipe, the cross-sectional
area, area 1, which is equal

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,900
to 2 meters squared.

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:36,380
Let's say it tapers off so that
the cross-sectional area

6
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:44,350
at this end of the pipe,
area 2, is equal to

7
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,600
half a square meter.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,670
   

9
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,890
We have some velocity at this
point in the pipe, which is

10
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,530
v1, and the velocity exiting
the pipe is v2.

11
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,510
The external pressure at this
point is essentially being

12
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,920
applied rightwards
into the pipe.

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:17,980
Let's say that pressure
1 is 10,000 pascals.

14
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,540
The pressure at this end, the
pressure 2-- that's the

15
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,810
external pressure at that point
in the pipe-- that is

16
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:33,190
equal to 6,000 pascals.

17
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,620
Given this information,
let's say we have

18
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,556
water in this pipe.

19
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:41,260
   

20
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,700
We're assuming that it's laminar
flow, so there's no

21
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,420
friction within the pipe, and
there's no turbulence.

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,530
Using that, what I want to do
is, I want to figure out what

23
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,030
is the flow or the flux of the
water in this pipe-- how much

24
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,000
volume goes either into the pipe
per second, or out of the

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,210
pipe per second?

26
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,760
We know that those are the going
to be the same numbers,

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,180
because of the equation
of continuity.

28
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,500
We know that the flow, which
is R, which is volume per

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,100
amount of time, is the same
thing as the input velocity

30
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,350
times the input area.

31
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,010
   

32
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:30,860
The input area is 2, so it's
2v1, and that also equals the

33
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:37,750
output area times output
velocity, so it equals 1/2 v2.

34
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:44,635
We could rewrite this, that v1
is equal to 1/2 R, and that v2

35
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:46,510
is equal to 2R.

36
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,650
This immediately tells us that
v2 is coming out at a faster

37
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,690
rate, and this is based on
the size of the openings.

38
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,810
We know, because V2 is coming
out at a faster rate, but we

39
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,630
also know because we have much
higher pressure at this end

40
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,600
than at this end, that the water
is flowing to the right.

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,980
The pressure differential, the
pressure gradient, is going to

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,060
the right, so the water
is going to

43
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,070
spurt out of this end.

44
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,170
And it's coming in this end.

45
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,380
Let's use Bernoulli's equation
to figure out what the flow

46
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,110
through this pipe is.

47
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:32,740
Let's just write it down: P1
plus rho gh1 plus 1/2 rho v1

48
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:39,370
squared is equal to
P2 plus rho gh2

49
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,590
plus 1/2 rho v2 squared.

50
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,000
This pipe is level, and the
height at either end is the

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,500
same, so h1 is going
to be equal to h2.

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,270
These two terms are going to be
equal, so we can cross them

53
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,360
out-- we can subtract that value
from both sides, and

54
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,570
we're just left with P1.

55
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,630
What's P1?

56
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:13,280
P1 is 10,000 pascals plus 1/2
rho times v1 squared.

57
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
What's v1?

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,940
That's R over 2-- we figured
that out up here.

59
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:26,160
v2 times R over 2 squared is
equal to P2, and that's 6,000

60
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,520
pascals plus 1/2 rho
times v2 squared.

61
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,360
We figured out what v2 is--
v2 is 2R squared.

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,570
Let's just do some
simplification, and so let's

63
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,130
subtract 6,000 from both sides,
and we're left with

64
00:04:45,130 --> 00:05:09,470
4,000 plus rho R squared over
8 is equal to 1/2 times R

65
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,070
squared times 4.

66
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:15,570
So this is 2 rho R squared.

67
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,830
We could multiply both sides of
this equation by 8, just to

68
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,010
get rid of this in the
denominator, so we would get

69
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:33,620
32,000 plus rho R squared is
equal to 16 rho R squared.

70
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,710
Subtract rho R squared from both
sides of this question,

71
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:49,550
and we get 32,000 is equal
to 15 rho R squared.

72
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,140
Then what's rho?

73
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,430
What's the density of water?

74
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,200
The density of water is 1,000
kilograms per meter cubed, so

75
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,900
this is 1,000.

76
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,920
Let's divide both sides
by 15 times rho.

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:14,350
We get R squared is equal to
32,000 divided by 15 rho-- rho

78
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:22,470
is 1,000, so R squared is equal
to 32,000 over 15,000,

79
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,980
which is the same thing
is 32 over 15.

80
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,320
R is equal to the square root
of 32 over 15, and that's

81
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,880
going to be meters
cubed per second.

82
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:45,010
   

83
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:52,920
I get 32 divided by 15 is equal
to 2.1, and the square

84
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,040
root of that 1.46.

85
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:06,760
So the answer is R is equal to
1.46 meters cubed per second.

86
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,830
That is the volume of water that
is either entering the

87
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,340
system in any given second, or
exiting the system in any

88
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,290
given second.

89
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,910
We can figure out the
velocities, too-- what's the

90
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,790
velocity exiting the system?

91
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,000
What's two times that?

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,010
It's 2.8 meters per second
exiting the system, and going

93
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:31,650
in it is half that, so it's
0.8 meters per second.

94
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,902
Hopefully, that gives you--
actually, 0.7 meters per

95
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:40,700
second-- a bit more intuition on
fluids, and that's all I'm

96
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,810
going to do for today.

97
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,370
I'll see you in the next video,
and we're going to do

98
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,620
some stuff on thermodynamics.

99
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,900
