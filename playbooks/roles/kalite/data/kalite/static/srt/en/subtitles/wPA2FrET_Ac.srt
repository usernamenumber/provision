1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,200
Before I go on with problem 143,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,860
I actually have a bone to pick with problem 142.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,620
We actually went through it correctly,

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,760
although I probably did a couple of more steps then I had to.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,460
Because when I do them in real time my brain wanders.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,560
But now that I've had time to sit and look at it a little bit

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,630
I realize that I think

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,040
the GMAT people may have made a mistake.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,690
So what was the problem?

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:26,590
The problem itself was 9 to the x plus 9 to the minus x

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,680
is equal to b. The problem is,

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,870
do we have enough information to answer this question?

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,660
That's how they phrase it.

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,750
They don't say do you have enough information to say that

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,580
this is true.

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,160
They say do we have enough information

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,200
to answer this question.

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,220
So if I have enough information to say, no, this is not true.

19
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,190
That statement should still be good.

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,830
So we can ignore statement number 1.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,480
In the last video I showed that that was sufficient.

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,380
I still agree that that is completely sufficient.

23
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,020
But let's look at statement number 2.

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,410
According to the GMAT people,they say that

25
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,740
statement number 2 is not sufficient to answer this question.

26
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,920
I'll argue that it is.

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,690
Because they say that statement number 2 says that

28
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,500
x is greater than 0, which is equal to b.

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,440
I take this to mean that x is greater than 0

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,100
and 0 is equal to b or b is equal to 0.

31
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,490
Maybe I'm misunderstanding that,but that's the only way

32
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,790
I can think of interpreting this thing.

33
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,720
So if b is equal to 0, what is the statement

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,310
that we're trying to see if we can answer,

35
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,490
or the question that we're trying to answer?

36
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,660
What does that boil down to?

37
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,680
Well then the question boils down to

38
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:32,990
9 to the x plus 9 to the minus x is equal to 0.

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,310
My question to you is, if I'm taking 9 to any power,

40
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,310
to any power whatsoever,

41
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,170
can I ever get 0 or a negative number?

42
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,790
In fact, the only way I can get to 0 is

43
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,190
if I do 9 to the minus infinity power, right?

44
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,930
Because that equals 1 over 9 to the infinity.

45
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,250
So that might approach 0.

46
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,130
But even if I said x was infinity here,

47
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,700
on this side I would have 9 to the infinity here.

48
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,510
This would be infinity plus 0.

49
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,800
So it would still approach infinity.

50
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,090
So there's actually no way--

51
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,110
and that's the limit and all that,

52
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,870
I don't want to get confused-- but there's no way.

53
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,700
Some people think, oh,

54
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,760
if I'm taking it to a negative exponent,

55
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,750
maybe that becomes a negative power.

56
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,190
No, a negative exponent just means an inverse.

57
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,680
So this could be written as 1 over 9 to the x is equal to 0.

58
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,860
So if x becomes a very large number,

59
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,870
this becomes very positive and this approaches 0.

60
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,120
If x becomes a very, very, very, very small fraction,

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,870
this number becomes a small number.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But then this is the inverse of a small number,

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,210
so this becomes a large number.

64
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,720
Actually, if x becomes negative, these just switch places.

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,830
This becomes 1 over 9 to the positive x.

66
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,580
You got the point.

67
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,770
These are just negatives of each other, these exponents.

68
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,990
If x was 0, then both of these are equal to 1.

69
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,510
So then you get 2 is equal to 0.

70
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,160
The way I see it, statement 2 answers our question.

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,730
But the answer is no,

72
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,890
9 to the x plus 9 to the minus x does not equal b

73
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,020
because statement 2 says b is equal to 0.

74
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,450
But anyway, I don't harp on this too much,

75
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,620
but I think they actually made a mistake.

76
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,870
Because statement 2, in my mind,answers the question.

77
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,100
It just doesn't say that the question is true.

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,100
Let's move on to the next question. But it's good.

79
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,950
I think discussions like that,even though some poor chap--

80
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,590
because apparently these are real GMAT questions--

81
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,370
some poor chap might have gotten it wrong.

82
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,730
But we can use that as a piece of instruction.

83
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,040
So anyway, 143.

84
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,650
They say if m is greater than 0 and n is greater than 0,

85
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:47,420
is m plus x over n plus x greater than m over n.

86
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,850
Interesting.

87
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,020
So they're essentially saying,if I have m over n

88
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,400
and then I add the same number, we call that x,

89
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,330
to both the numerator and the denominator

90
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,270
does that make the whole fraction bigger?

91
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,710
I'll just give you a little intuition right now.

92
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,470
If I had a very small number for x, relative to m and n,

93
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,100
it doesn't change the fraction much.

94
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,490
Well, let me put it this way.

95
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,450
If I had anything, whatever x is, and the larger x is,

96
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,580
the more that this fraction is going to approach 1.

97
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,860
You think about it, if m is 1, and n is 2,

98
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,640
and x is 1 million, and x is 1 million,

99
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,700
then that million is going to overpower the m and the n.

100
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,790
You probably remember that a little bit from your limits.

101
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,870
But I just want to give you that intuition.

102
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,290
Regardless of what m and n are,if x gets suitably large,

103
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,720
then this will approach 1.

104
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,130
But I don't know if that's going to help us.

105
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,320
Let's look at the statements.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,510
Statement 1, m is less than n.

107
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,820
So if m is less than n,

108
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,520
this says that this is going to be less than 1.

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,690
So it's going to be a fraction.

110
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,590
I just said that if I add an x to the numerator

111
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,990
and the denominator of something, you're going to approach 1.

112
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,970
But we have to be careful

113
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,090
because they didn't tell us that x is positive.

114
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,280
So I might be subtracting x.

115
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,260
Maybe this x is a negative 1 million.

116
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,540
Let me give you that example.

117
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,360
So let's say m is less than n.

118
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,330
So let's say that m is equal to 1, n is equal to 2.

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,410
So we could say if x is 1 million--

120
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,780
let's say something similar, let's say x is 100--

121
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,960
so m plus x would be 101 and n plus n would be 102.

122
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,840
That is easily greater than 1/2.

123
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,110
You say, oh, excellent.

124
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,360
Statement 1 is sufficient.

125
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,880
First of all, that doesn't prove sufficiency,

126
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,550
but it's easy to prove that it's not sufficient.

127
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,390
Because what if x were minus 100.

128
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,430
Then it would be 1 minus 100 would be minus 99.

129
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,780
Then 2 minus 100 would be minus 98.

130
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,490
Is that a greater than 1/2? Well, no.

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,610
This is a little over minus 1.

132
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,280
So it's actually a negative number.

133
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,660
It's going to be less than 1/2.

134
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,850
So statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

135
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,580
Because I can pick an m and an n using statement number 1,

136
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,300
and then an x.

137
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,680
I could pick different x's

138
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,770
where the statement is either true or not true.

139
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,970
This one is not true.

140
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,150
I'm trying to cross that out.

141
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,670
Let's look at statement number 2.

142
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:22,310
Statement number 2 tells us that x is greater than 0.

143
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,050
So let's think about just x being greater than 0 alone.

144
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,100
Does that help us?

145
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,290
Well, it does help us if m is less than n.

146
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,240
Because I just gave the example that if m is less than n--

147
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,370
so if you're starting with some fraction that's less than 1--

148
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,970
and you add a positive number to both the numerator

149
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,210
and the denominator,

150
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,290
you're just going to get a little bit closer to 1.

151
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,040
So you're actually going to

152
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,630
increase the value of that fraction

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,190
You could test it out on a bunch of different numbers, right?

154
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,580
If you add 1 to the numerator and the denominator of 1/2,

155
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,820
you get 2/3.

156
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,860
If you add another 1, you get 3/4.

157
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,040
If you add another 1, you get 4/5.

158
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,380
So you see how this continues.

159
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,360
As you add more and more to the numerator and the denominator,

160
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,460
it approaches 1.

161
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,450
This x greater than 0 satisfies our problem

162
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,950
with the first statement.

163
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,170
Because our first says, oh, what if x is negative?

164
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,150
Then it doesn't work.

165
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,380
But let's think about whether x greater than 0

166
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,900
by itself is enough to answer this question.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,730
It works when m is less than n.

168
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,950
So it works in conjunction with statement 1.

169
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,070
But what if n is greater than m?

170
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,680
What if we start with an equation like 4 over 2?

171
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,570
4 over 2, is that-- let me make sure I get that--

172
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:52,090
is that less than 4 plus x over 2 plus x

173
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,920
for any x greater than 0?

174
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:59,820
Well, let's add 4 to the numerator and the denominator.

175
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,310
So then this would be equal to 8 over 6.

176
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,160
This number right here is 2.

177
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,250
This number right here is 1 1/3.

178
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,040
So it's not true.

179
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,780
If x is equal to 0, this statement still doesn't work

180
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,600
if n is greater than m.

181
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,050
So in order for this statement to be true,

182
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,480
or in order to answer this question,

183
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,100
you actually need both pieces of information.

184
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,600
So both statements together are sufficient to

185
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,670
answer this question.

186
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,180
Next problem, 144.

187
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,040
If n as a positive integer--

188
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,970
so they tell us n is greater than 0--

189
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,800
is 1/10 to the n less than 0.01?

190
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:53,210
So what they're saying is 1/10 to the n less than 0.01.

191
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,510
Well, what's 0.01? Well, let me write it out.

192
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,780
So this statement,

193
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,410
that's another way of saying 1/10 to the n less than--

194
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:09,740
0.01 is 1 over 100, which is the same thing as 1/10 squared.

195
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,850
Well let's just think about it a little bit.

196
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,890
Let me look at the statements

197
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,010
before I go off on my own tangent.

198
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:25,900
So statement 1, they say n is greater than 2.

199
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,650
So if n is greater than 2, as n increases,

200
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,090
is that going to make this whole number smaller or bigger?

201
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,050
Well, if I take a fraction,especially 1/10,

202
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,140
and I increase it to more and more powers,

203
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,330
I actually end up going more and more

204
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,640
behind the decimal point.

205
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,210
If n is greater than 2, at n equals 2, you get 0.01.

206
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,410
Then if n is equal to 3,

207
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,640
although it doesn't have to be an integer.

208
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,950
Actually they tell us it's an interger.

209
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,290
So if n equals 3, what is it?

210
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,160
So they say n has to be at least 3

211
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,030
because it's a positive integer.

212
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,140
So what's 1/10 to the third power? It's 0.001.

213
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,200
That's definitely less than 0.01.

214
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,940
What's 1/10 to the fourth power? That's 0.0001.

215
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,860
That's definitely less than 0.01.

216
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,830
So this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.

217
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,090
Statement 2.

218
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,450
Another way you view this is,

219
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,830
this inequality could be written as 10 to the minus n

220
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,630
is less than 10 squared.

221
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,620
Then this is only going to happen if minus--

222
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,310
no, actually that's not a good way to go about it.

223
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,100
I think the way I explained it the first time

224
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,750
is probably the better way. All right.

225
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:47,950
The second statement they say is 1/10 to the n minus 1

226
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,320
is less than 0.1.

227
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,480
So what we could do here is

228
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,310
just multiply both sides of this equation by 1 over 10.

229
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,230
What happens?

230
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:05,940
You get 1/10 times 1/10 to the n minus 1 is less than--

231
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,270
what's 1/10 times 0.1?

232
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,310
Well, it's 0.01, right?

233
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,520
It's 1/10 of that.

234
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,160
What does this simplify to?

235
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,730
You have 1/10 to the first power times 1/10 to the n minus 1.

236
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,500
You add the exponents.

237
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,300
You could put a first power there.

238
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, this is equal to 1/10 to the n is less than 0.01.

239
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,680
which is the statement that we originally had,

240
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,300
1/10 to the n is less than 0.01.

241
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,060
So statement 2 is actually equivalent to

242
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,080
the original problem statement.

243
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,400
So each of these statements,independently,

244
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,760
are sufficient to answer the question.

245
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,890
See you in the next video.
