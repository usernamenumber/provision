1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:03,920
We're in the National Gallery in Washington, D.C.,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,412
and we're looking at a really beautiful painting.

3
00:00:06,412 --> 00:00:11,852
It's Raphael's "Alba Madonna," from about 1510.

4
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:17,461
Raphael was famous for his incredibly beautiful and sweet Madonnas,

5
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:20,383
and this is a perfect example of that.

6
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:21,889
And it's a really unusual painting.

7
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,899
You have the Virgin Mary,

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,116
you have the young Christ on her lap;

9
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:29,772
but if you look at the way that her arms are extended,

10
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:31,240
and the way that her lap is extended,

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,634
it's almost as if she's really a kind of a throne for him to sit on.

12
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:38,969
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. But we have essentially the same cast of characters

13
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,759
that we have in Leonardo's "Virgin of the Rocks."

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,222
So, the third figure -

15
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:45,367
St. John the Baptist.

16
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:46,784
And then, how could you tell -

17
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:49,119
-and then the only thing that's missing here that was in the Leonardo

18
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,439
was the figure of an angel.

19
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,681
And of course, we've entered into the High Renaissance now,

20
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:57,149
in a way that, in a sense the angel has really disappeared,

21
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,627
those sort of overt expressions -

22
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,197
spiritual figures, right.

23
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:02,911
That's right, those sort of overt expressions of the Divine.

24
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:03,847
Right, that's right.

25
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:06,379
In a sense they've been replaced by nature itself.

26
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:09,269
Raphael's definitely has looked at Leonardo,

27
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,615
and his Madonna has her arm around St. John

28
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:15,524
much the same way that she does in "The Virgin of the Rocks,"

29
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:15,993
Yes.

30
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,281
And we have those lingering -

31
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,915
- well after all, she is his aunt.

32
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:20,336
That's true.

33
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:23,634
We have those lingering faint halos.

34
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:25,340
The faintest trace still.

35
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,791
Right. And they're going to be gone.

36
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,766
Actually, I suppose with Leonardo they'd already been gone,

37
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:32,114
but Raphael's still holding on to them a bit.

38
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:35,840
But you're right, there's a kind of overwhelming humanism here,

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,673
a humanism that's transcended by the ideal beauty of the figures.

40
00:01:40,673 --> 00:01:44,492
So, he's really expressing divinity through this ideal beauty, then.

41
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:49,883
Yes. And also, I think, through the incredibly fluid and graceful way

42
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:50,945
that the figures move.

43
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,145
Almost like dance.

44
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,616
It is almost like dance.

45
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:55,385
It's incredibly complicated.

46
00:01:55,385 --> 00:02:01,053
Mary looks down past St. John, almost looking into the future,

47
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:06,055
her arm around him, her left hand holding a page in the Bible.

48
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:09,250
The Christ Child twisting his body.

49
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,867
He's sort of accepting the cross, right?

50
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:16,204
A kind of acceptance of his destiny, of his sacrifice.

51
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:20,314
Mary has her right leg tucked under her left leg, coming up;

52
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:23,621
there's a sense that she's almost caught moving here.

53
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:26,637
There's nothing static about any part of this image.

54
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:29,221
And even though there's this lack of this static,

55
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:33,181
there's also a kind of, I guess because of their scale within the landscape -

56
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:34,212
they're very monumental.

57
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:35,391
Yeah, there's this monumentality,

58
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:37,839
this sort of sense of seriousness here.

59
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:38,740
Absolutely.

60
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,672
And they are in this beautiful natural environment.

61
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:44,766
And yet, we get a sense of a kind of classicism.

62
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,994
I mean, he's . . . Raphael is in Rome,

63
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,667
and he's really looking at -

64
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:49,801
-at the classical, yes.

65
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,442
-at the classical.

66
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:52,784
And he's concurrently working on -

67
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:54,191
-This is quite a moment.

68
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:57,725
-&quot;La Stanza della segnatura,&quot; and &quot;The School of Athens&quot; included there;

69
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:59,930
and at the same time, Michelangelo, of course,

70
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,013
is painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling.

71
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:02,965
Right at this moment!

72
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:09,170
So there's this incredible interest in monumental, serious figures,

73
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,062
and monumental commissions, and major masterpieces.

74
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:15,370
But this is a fairly modest painting.

75
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,462
In its scale -

76
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,497
It's about three feet?

77
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,338
Yeah, that's right.

78
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:20,890
I mean, this is just something he sort of does on the side.

79
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,602
Amazing, isn't it?! What a man!

80
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:25,813
[chuckling] Going back to the idea of Leonardo -

81
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:27,560
Yes, there's a lot of Leonardo here.

82
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,672
There - I mean, if you look at the delicate and careful renderings, for instance -

83
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:32,058
- of the flowers -

84
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:33,426
Yeah, these botanical specimens,

85
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:34,813
very much like in "Madonna of the Rocks" -

86
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:36,713
Very much like the "Madonna of the Rocks."

87
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:39,605
Hard to know if Raphael himself is looking at Northern Renaissance painting,

88
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:42,855
or if he's got that influence sort of indirectly.

89
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:43,628
So, that's interesting.

90
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:45,024
We talked about the classical influence,

91
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,346
but also a little bit of the North.

92
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:49,222
Yes. And we have an oil painting here -

93
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:51,266
That's right, that's right. Originally on panel.

94
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:58,100
- and we have none of that kind of sfumato, smoky mysteriousness that we have in Leonardo.

95
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,409
There's a real clarity here, and sweetness,

96
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,184
instead of mystery, I think.

97
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:04,798
It's just - I mean, if you look at the composition,

98
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:06,765
it's just so beautifully handled.

99
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,490
Within the circular frame.

100
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,434
Which is a tough thing!

101
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:13,555
Oh my God, it's really hard! To make things fit comfortably, within that circular shape?

102
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:14,947
And the figures don't feel cramped -

103
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:15,331
- No.

104
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,608
- they feel as if they have room to move.

105
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:19,662
And yet, it does not call attention to the circle at all,

106
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:23,477
to the ronde. It's just this really carefully rendered and -

107
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:26,442
this incredible kind of intimacy, as well, between the figures.

108
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:28,020
I mean, they're not really looking at each other,

109
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,378
although Christ may be sort of looking at John.

110
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:33,555
John, as you said, is sort of looking upward, towards heaven;

111
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:36,997
Mary seems to almost be looking a little bit past the two of them,

112
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:40,084
but nevertheless, there's this wonderful kind of bond, this wonderful kind of -

113
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:40,857
- There is.

114
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:42,140
- This beautiful kind of intimacy.

115
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,691
And there's a kind of interaction between the figures

116
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:47,696
that I think is really unique to the High Renaissance.

117
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:52,549
It's the loss of that kind of static separateness between the figures

118
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:55,153
that was still there in the Early Renaissance.

119
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:56,185
I forget what Vasari calls it.

120
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:58,846
It's a little bit of a kind of clunkiness that's still there.

121
00:04:58,846 --> 00:04:59,945
Yeah, a kind of isolation of the figures.

122
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:00,460
Yeah.

123
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,107
But we see it disappear certainly in Leonardo's &quot;Last Supper,&quot;

124
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:06,745
and of course we also see that in Michelangelo's ceiling,

125
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:08,292
which is being painted at this very moment.

126
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:12,471
Yes. That idea of unifying the composition within a pyramid shape also is here.

127
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:14,920
And the atmospheric perspective is just -

128
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,284
It's gorgeous, isn't it?

129
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,683
Beautiful. Do you think that looks like a Tuscan hillside?

130
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:21,691
You know, I would think so, except that -

131
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:23,053
because of the classical influence,

132
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:24,693
and because of the idea that he's in Rome,

133
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:27,807
maybe something closer to the outskirts of Rome.

134
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,065
Especially with some of the older buildings in the back.

135
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:34,812
Very picturesque. Really the kind of thing that later 18th century painters will pick up on.

136
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:37,727
Mmm-hmmm. And is she sitting and looking at her right side,

137
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:39,474
is she leaning on some rocks?

138
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:41,804
It must be, or sitting against a tree stump.

139
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:42,891
It's a little bit hard to make out.

140
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:45,937
So we have the idea of The Madonna of Humility,

141
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:47,693
seated on the ground,

142
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:50,572
an image which emphasizes her humbleness.

143
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:54,852
And even though she sort of provides her body as a throne for Christ,

144
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:56,695
she herself is sitting on the ground.

145
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:58,975
It's a very humble figure.

146
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,820
That's right. Humble, but still having a kind of, um -

147
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,285
- divinity.

148
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:03,284
- divinity, and importance;

149
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:06,619
and part of that again comes from the classicizing of the pose of the figures.

150
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:09,022
But also, look here, Raphael has dressed,

151
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:11,364
at least, Mary in classical garb.

152
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:12,232
Very classical. And in fact,

153
00:06:12,232 --> 00:06:14,673
the way her clothing clings to her leg

154
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:19,777
reminds me of classical sculpture. I mean, it's very specific.

155
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:24,355
That's true. Probably sculpture that Raphael would not have seen yet, right?

156
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:24,896
Things that are in Greece.

157
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:25,401
Maybe, right.

158
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,698
But nevertheless, you're right. Maybe there were some sources.

159
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:31,671
But he must have seen some ancient Greek relief sculptures, I imagine.

160
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,409
Yeah. I mean, there was real interest at this moment.
