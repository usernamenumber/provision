1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,490
Welcome back. I almost ran out of time in that last video,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,490
so let's just start from the beginning for

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,430
problem number fourteen. So I drew the figure,

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,820
and they told us that this line is perpendicular to that line

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,320
and they drew it here.And that this is perpendicular to that,

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,210
and they drew it there.

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,730
They told us this was 125 degrees,this is x.

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,730
And then the one piece of information they tell us,

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,580
is that LN,this line,is equal to LM. And I marked it here.

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,620
What we said at the end of the last video was,

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,900
well if these two sides are equal,

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,770
we also know from geometry class,

13
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,870
that the base angles are also going to be equal.

14
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,730
And then let's see what we can do with that,

15
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,200
whether we can figure out x.

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,980
Well the first step we can do, is we can say,

17
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,230
well if this is 125 degrees, what is this angle right here?

18
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,540
Well they're going to have to add up to 180,

19
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,930
because they're supplementary.

20
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,920
So this is going to be,what's 180 minus 125?

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,520
Well what's 80 minus 25? It's 55 degrees.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,890
So if that's 55,then this is also going to be 55.

23
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,520
And then if these are both 55,what is this angle up here?

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,110
Well they're all in a triangle,so they have to add up to 180.

25
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,950
So 55 plus 55 is 110,so this one has to be 70 degrees.

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,950
Or 180 minus 110. You have to add up to 180 degrees.

27
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,380
So this is 70 degrees right here.

28
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,620
And now can we figure out what this angle is here?

29
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,080
This is what I call the angle game.

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,870
You just have to keep figuring out of angles.

31
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:42,080
Well if this is 70 degrees,this angle plus this angle,

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,350
they're going to be complementary.

33
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,110
They're going to come out to 90,because this is 90.

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,690
So all we have left is 90 degrees here.

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,580
So if these two have to add up to 90 degrees,

36
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,710
then this is 20 degrees. That says 20.

37
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,150
I know I wrote it really small,you probably can't read it.

38
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,840
We know that this whole thing is a right angle

39
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,240
because this is a right angle.

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,470
So if this is 90,we know that this whole thing is 90.

41
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,550
So this is 20. And now finally,I think we're ready for x.

42
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,750
Because x plus 90 plus 20 has to be equal to 180

43
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,590
because it's in the same triangle.

44
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,930
So x plus 90 plus 20 is equal to 180.

45
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:26,440
x plus 110 is equal to 180. x is equal to 70 degrees.

46
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,810
And we are done. Next problem.

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,820
Problem number fifteen.

48
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,150
A measuring cup contains 1/5 a cup of orange juice.

49
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,580
It is then filled to the 1 cup mark that is a mixture

50
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,150
containing equal amounts of orange,

51
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,550
grapefruit and pineapple juices.

52
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,590
What fraction of the final mixture is orange juice?

53
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,330
This is interesting. You have 1/5 already orange juice,

54
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,390
and then the next 4/5 is going to be equal parts--

55
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,030
because we're going to fill to the 1 cup mark.

56
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:19,210
It's going to be equal parts orange,grapefruit--

57
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,270
I'll just write grape--and pineapple.

58
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,780
So the next 4/5 is going to be split amongst these three,

59
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,600
and it's equally.

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,350
So how much more orange juice are we putting in?

61
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,650
We took 4/5,and 1/3 of this 4/5 is going to be orange juice.

62
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,080
So the amount of orange juice we're putting in now

63
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,930
is 1/3 times the 4/5. So we're putting in 4/15 orange juice.

64
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:58,650
And we already had 1/5 orange juice. So 1/5 plus 4/15.

65
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:06,420
That equals 3/15 plus 4/15,which equals 7/15.

66
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:13,540
That is the final mixture of orange juice.

67
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,230
And doesn't that make sense intuitively?

68
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,470
That makes sense because there's 20% orange juice,

69
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,790
and then we're adding maybe a little bit less than a 1/4.

70
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,930
So we'll have a little bit less than 1/2 in the glass.

71
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,340
All right. Next problem.

72
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,260
I don't know,my cousin's answer seems a little suspicious.

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,540
She had marked up this book.All right.Problem number sixteen.

74
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:55,830
If a plus 2b is equal to 125% of 4b. So that equals 125%.

75
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,170
If you want to write 125% as a decimal,

76
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,440
which I like to do,it's 1.25.

77
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,990
125% of 4b,what is the value of a over b?

78
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,660
So we want to figure out a over b.

79
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,970
Let's just solve this thing.

80
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,560
So a plus 2b is equal to,what's 1.25 times 4?

81
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,970
If you have $1.25 and you have that 4 times,it's $5.00,right?

82
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,960
4 times 1 and then 4 times a quarter,

83
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,490
that's another dollar,so that's 5b.

84
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,210
And then subtract 2b from both sides.

85
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:34,610
You get a is equal to 3b. Divide both sides by b,

86
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,420
and you get a over b is equal to 3.

87
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,670
And you are done the problem. Problem number seventeen.

88
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,280
They have a number line.

89
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,390
This number line,let me see how much

90
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,980
I have to draw of this number line,to minimize my drawing.

91
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:02,860
They say 0 is here,1 is here. How many hash marks are there?

92
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,570
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 hash marks. Oh it says there.

93
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,610
On the number line above,

94
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,950
there are 9 equal intervals between 0 and 1.

95
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:25,720
What is the value of x? So there's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

96
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,980
I have 9 equal intervals,and then x is right--

97
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,060
I'm just going to make sure I draw it correctly.

98
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,900
We have 2 marks,and then we have x.

99
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,150
And actually we have the square root of x.

100
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,420
So they're 9 equal intervals,right?

101
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,880
So we could just do this is 1/9,this is 2/9,this is 3/9,

102
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,860
4/9,this is 8/9,this is 9/9.

103
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:57,070
This is 8/9,this is 7/9,this is 6/9,this is 5/9,

104
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,460
because 9 equal intervals.

105
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,220
So we know that the square root of x is equal to 6/9.

106
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,050
Square both sides. What's 6/9? That's the same thing as 2/3.

107
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,260
So you square both sides. You get x is equal to 4/9.

108
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,890
2 squared,3 squared. We are done. Next problem.

109
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,460
Problem eighteen.

110
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,930
In the xy-coordinate plane,the distance between point B--

111
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,430
so B is the point 10 comma 18.

112
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,800
The distance between the point B and the point A--

113
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,830
A is point x comma 3.

114
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,590
So the distance is 17 between these points.

115
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,590
What is one possible value of x?

116
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,720
So this is the distance formula,and the distance formula

117
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,230
is really just the Pythagorean theorem. What we do is we say,

118
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:06,510
well the distance squared is equal to the change in x squared

119
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,850
plus the change in y squared.

120
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,780
And this is really just the Pythagorean theorem.

121
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,190
If you haven't learned that yet,

122
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,340
actually I don't think I've done a distance formula video,

123
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,010
that's on my to-do list.But I'll do that.

124
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,240
It's just the Pythagorean theorem.

125
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,450
The distance squared,so 17 squared,is equal to--

126
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,890
what's the change in x?

127
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:33,320
So let's just call that 10 minus x squared plus--

128
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,680
and then we know that change in y--so 18 minus 3.

129
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,970
So it's 15 squared. I know 15 squared is 225.

130
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:54,290
This is going to be equal to x squared minus 20x.

131
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:10,940
It could be plus 100. What's 17 squared? 17 times 17?

132
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:21,880
7 times 7 is 49. 1 times 7 is 7,plus 4 is 11. 0 17.

133
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:32,350
It is 289. And so then we can subtract 289 from both sides.

134
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,070
So you get 0 is equal to x squared minus 20x plus--

135
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,650
add these two together--325 minus 289.

136
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,180
I only have 10 seconds left,

137
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,380
so I'll do it in the next video.
