1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:04,613
You don't need numbers or fancy equations to prove the Pythagorean Theorem, all you need is a piece of

2
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:09,404
paper. There is a ton of ways to prove it, and people are inventing new ones all the time, but I am

3
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:14,234
going to show you my favorite. Only instead of looking at diagrams, we're gonna fold it. First, you

4
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:17,903
need a square, which you can probably obtain from a rectangle if you ask nicely.

5
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:22,502
Step one, fold your square in half one way, then the other way, then across the diagonal.

6
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:27,330
No need to make these creases sharp, we're just taking advantage of the symetries of the square for the

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,853
next step. But, be precise.

8
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:34,482
Step 2: Make a crease along this triangle, parallel to the side of the triangle that has the edges of

9
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:38,986
the paper. You can make it anywhere you want. This is where you are choosing how long and pointy, or

10
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:42,663
short and fat, your right triangle is going to be, because this is a general proof.

11
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:45,906
Now when you unwrap it, you'll have a square centered in your square.

12
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:50,736
Extend those creases and make them sharp, and now we've got we've got four lines all the same distance

13
00:00:50,736 --> 00:00:56,076
from the edges, which will allow us to make a bunch of right triangles that are all exactly the same.

14
00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:58,915
Step three: fold from this point to this one.

15
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:01,756
Basically taking a diagonal of this rectangle.

16
00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:03,900
Now we've got our first right triangle.

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,804
Which has the same shape and area as this one.

18
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:11,288
Let's call the sides: "A little leg", "a big leg", and "hypothenus".

19
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:14,329
Rotate ninety degrees, and fold back another triangle,

20
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:15,906
which of course is just like the first.

21
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:17,645
Repeat on the following two sides.

22
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:22,500
The original paper minus those four triangles, gives us a lovely square.

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,079
How much paper is this ?

24
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,739
Well, the length of a side is the hypotenus of one of these triangles.

25
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,813
So the area is the hypotenus squared.

26
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:35,901
Step four: unfold, and this time let's choose a different four triangles to fold back.

27
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:40,148
Rip along one little leg, and fold back these two triangles.

28
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:42,655
Then you can fold back another two over here.

29
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:47,132
The area of the unfolded paper, minus four triangles, must be the same,

30
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:50,046
no matter which four triangles you remove.

31
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:51,990
So let's see what we've got.

32
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,492
We can divide this into two squares,

33
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:57,032
This one has sides the length of the little leg of the triangle.

34
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:59,238
And this one has sides as long as the big leg.

35
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:03,483
So the area of both together, is little leg squared, plus big leg squared.

36
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:07,083
Which has to be equal to this area, which is hypotenus squared.

37
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,637
If you called the sides of your triangle something more abstract,

38
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:12,331
like: a, b, and c, you'd of course have

39
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,517
a squared plus b squared equals c squared

40
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:14,921
So quick review:

41
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:16,859
Step 0: Aquire a paper square.

42
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:19,907
OK, Step One: Fold it in half three times.

43
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:23,151
Step 2: Fold parallel to the edges anywhere you choose

44
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:24,152
and extend the crease.

45
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:28,306
Step Three: Fold back four right triangles around the square

46
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:32,160
and admire the area hypothenus squared that is left over.

47
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,422
Step Four: unfold and rip along a short side

48
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,197
to fold back another four right triangles

49
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:42,331
and admire the area one leg squared plus the other leg squared

50
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:42,831
that is left.

51
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:44,381
And that is all there is to it!

52
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:45,999
Of course, mathematicians are rebels

53
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,523
and never believe anything anyone tells them

54
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:49,160
unless they can prove it for themselves.

55
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,408
So be sure to not believe me when I tell you things like:

56
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:53,178
This is a square.

57
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:55,659
Think of a few ways you could convince yourself

58
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,888
that no matter what the triangles on the outside look like,

59
00:02:57,888 --> 00:03:00,131
this will always be a square, and not some kind of a rombus

60
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,103
or parallelogram or dolphin or something.

61
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:03,908
Or, you know, maybe it is a dolphin,

62
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:05,880
in which case you should define what a dolphin is

63
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,891
and then show that this fits that definition.

64
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:10,566
Also, these edges look like they line up together.

65
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,902
Do they always do that?

66
00:03:11,902 --> 99:59:59,999
Is it exact?
