00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:06,794
We're in the Prado, in Madrid,

3
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:11,822
and we're looking at Albrecht DÃ¼rer's self-portrait from 1498,

4
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:15,064
where he shows himself, for me, almost like a dandy.

5
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:16,982
He painted this when he was 26,

6
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:19,748
and that's what the inscription says below the window.

7
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:22,020
You can see that he's proud of his looks,

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,372
and proud of his clothes, and mostly,

9
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:26,431
proud of how he could paint.

10
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:30,081
It's so interesting, because he is creating himself here.

11
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:33,298
But he's representing himself not only in terms of his likeness,

12
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:37,266
not only in terms of the class that he's aspiring to,

13
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:40,431
not only in terms of his representation of his own aesthetics,

14
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,550
in terms of his choice of costume,

15
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,263
but he's representing himself as a painter as well, right?

16
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:49,530
As a craftsman, as somebody who is extraordinarily capable.

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,484
And yet at the same time, he's also negating that very ability

18
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:58,858
by rendering himself not in the guise of an artist, of a workman,

19
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:02,490
but wearing actually incredibly expensive kid gloves,

20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,623
and very much not in a workshop environment,

21
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:06,883
but as if he were a nobleman.

22
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:10,642
Right. I mean, it's important to remember that when an artist paints a self-portrait,

23
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:13,102
he's actually probably looking in a mirror,

24
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:15,284
and you know, he's got paint, you know,

25
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:18,769
he's got brushes in his hands, and he's in his studio, and he's painting.

26
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:22,726
So there's a real conscious decision to remove those things,

27
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:24,553
and to show himself in another way.

28
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:28,568
And so the hands are completely fabricated.

29
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:31,778
And yet, in some ways, this is still very much, for me,

30
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:34,857
tied to his identity as an artist.

31
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:36,938
I think he's not only representing himself,

32
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:39,933
but he's representing his abilities, in a sense,

33
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,543
a kind of portfolio piece.

34
00:01:41,543 --> 00:01:45,448
Laying claim to art as something that is intellectual.

35
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:47,678
Ah, see! That's the key, right?

36
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:52,524
This notion that painting is in fact, as you said, an intellectual activity -

37
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:55,320
not just the work of the craftsman, of the cabinetmaker.

38
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,317
Exactly. But something which happens in the artist's mind,

39
00:01:58,317 --> 00:02:02,519
and therefore worthy of a different kind and level of respect.

40
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,423
And I think that's very much here.

41
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:08,423
