1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,350
But what I think about now is the if we're given some triangle,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,720
and here we have triangle ABC

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,910
What are the medians of the triangle

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,670
and how do they relate to each other

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,470
and do they have some interesting properties,

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,960
and you might guess that they do

7
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,860
So the median is, if we start at one of the vertices

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,610
so let's start at this one right over here

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,110
And then we bisect the opposite sides

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,660
So this right here would be a median

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,970
And so it started there, and it bisects this side right over here

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,240
So the length from B to let's call this D

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,160
is equal to the length from D to C

14
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,790
Now, let's do that with every side

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,960
I can draw a median over here, like that

16
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,310
So, let's call this point E

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,840
So the length from A to E

18
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,240
is going to be equal to the length from E to C

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,860
Although it's kind of a little lopsided,

20
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,160
but that gets it pretty close

21
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,960
And then we're gonna draw another median

22
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,430
And I'm not gonna prove it in this video,

23
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,850
but all the medians, and this is another neat thing, that, you know,

24
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,610
when you have three lines that will always intersect at one point,

25
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,450
that all the medians do intersect at one point

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,890
They all are concurrent

27
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,990
They all hit one common point in the center

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,070
So, let's draw it that way

29
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,290
I'm not gonna prove it in this video, so this length,

30
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,680
let's call this point right over here F

31
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,590
So this length right over here,

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,260
this length right over there is equal to that length over there

33
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,760
And the point at which these medians intersect

34
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,090
is called the centroid, the centroid

35
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,360
And when you start studying physics,

36
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,700
if you're actually and this was a uniform triangle

37
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,790
and you were to throw it,

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,010
it would rotate around the centroid right over here

39
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,500
But we'll study it geometrically for now

40
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,470
So let's call this ten centroid well, we've already gone up to F

41
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,780
So let's call this centroid G right over there

42
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,250
Now, what I wanna that by itself is neat that you have a centroid,

43
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,330
that if you were to throw it, if it was a uniform mass,

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,890
it would rotate around the centroid

45
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,520
But what's even neater about this,

46
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,980
is that we can see that we've divided this triangle

47
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,820
into six smaller triangles

48
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,010
What's really cool,

49
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,280
even though these aren't congruent triangles necessarily,

50
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,760
but they do have the same area

51
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,170
And that's what we're going to prove in this video

52
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,190
That these six triangles all have the same area

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,500
Now, to start off, I'm just going to look at two

54
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,650
I'm gonna look at different pairs of triangles

55
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,280
So let's look at let's look at these two triangles right over here

56
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,750
Let's look at those two triangles over here

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,980
And to show that those two have the same area,

58
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,200
we're just going to invoke a very simple principle

59
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,880
So, imagine rotating, just those two triangles over

60
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,610
So just rotating, just those two triangles over

61
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,850
It would look something like this

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,860
It would look something like this

63
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,560
Let me try my best to draw it

64
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,920
Where this would be point G I'll even try to color code it the same

65
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,390
that is point G

66
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,440
That is that side right over there

67
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,230
This is point C

68
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,640
This is point B, that is point B

69
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,430
And then this right over here

70
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,360
would be the second part of that median right over there

71
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,360
That over there would be point D

72
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,770
Now, we know and I didn't draw it I should, at nicely over here

73
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,640
We know that this length is equal to this length right over here

74
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,920
And these two triangles, if we're starting to think about the area,

75
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,790
they have the same base

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,250
And we know area

77
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,430
Area is equal to ? base * height

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,820
So, they definitely have the same base

79
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,080
What about their heights?

80
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,900
Well, they also have the same heights

81
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,160
Both of their heights, both of their height is exactly that tall

82
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,080
They both have the same height

83
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,950
So both of them have the same base

84
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,520
They both have the same height

85
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,460
On an ob on an obtuse triangle right here, the altitude sits outside of it

86
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,050
So that might be a little kind *unclear 00:03:26 7*

87
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,910
So if you have an obtuse triangle like that

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,390
I say obtuse cause this is more than 90 degrees

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,110
Your altitude, your height *unclear 00:03:33 4*

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,310
sit outside of the triangle, but that's okay

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,700
Both of these triangles have the same base, and the same height,

92
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,310
so they must have the same area

93
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,110
So if this one right here has area x,

94
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,520
this one right here will have area x as well

95
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,650
And you can use the exact same logic to say, well, look

96
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,320
This guy and this guy, they have the same base,

97
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,040
and they both have the same height

98
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,620
So if this one right over here is of area y,

99
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,490
then this one over here is also going to be of area y

100
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,150
They will have the same area

101
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,210
And then finally,

102
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,810
we could do the same thing for these two characters up here

103
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,210
They both have the same base

104
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,800
This was BF is equal to FA, and they both have the same height

105
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,550
We drop an altitude like that

106
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,590
And so if we call this area, if we call this area right over here Z,

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,640
you could call that area Z, as well

108
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,190
So, so far, we've shown that we can divide this

109
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,630
into three pairs of triangles that have the same area

110
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,830
But we wanna now show that they all have the same area

111
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,730
And to do that, we can invoke this same principle,

112
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,190
but we'll do it with different sets of triangles

113
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,490
So now, let's look at triangle let's look at triangle BAE

114
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,750
Look at triangle BAE, triangle BAE

115
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,950
So the area of triangle BAE,

116
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,120
area of BAE, is going to be equal to z + z + y

117
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,770
z + z + y

118
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:03,170
And let's look at the area of triangle BEC, BEC right over there

119
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,750
That's going to be,

120
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,060
this triangle right over here, is going to be x + x + y

121
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:16,280
So the area of BEC is going to be x + x + y, but the same principle

122
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,070
They both have the same base, and they both have the same height

123
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,720
We could drop an altitude like this

124
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,690
This one is obtuse, so that the altitude sits outside of it,

125
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,420
but they have the exact same height

126
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,040
So these two areas need to be equal to each other

127
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,300
So you have Z, well, let me just add that up

128
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,900
Now you have 2z + y is going to be equal to,

129
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,510
is going to be equal to 2x + y

130
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,930
2x + y

131
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,790
Subtract y from both sides

132
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,690
You get 2z is equal to 2x

133
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,250
Divide both sides by 2

134
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,330
You get z is equal to x

135
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,600
And so we could say, we could write an x here, and an x there

136
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,800
So we know that all of these will have the same area,

137
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,740
but we still have to worry about these y's here

138
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,480
And to do that,

139
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,580
we just have to kind of rotate the way that we look at it

140
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,790
And now look at triangle ADC

141
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,480
Let me do that in a different color

142
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,750
Triangle ADC, which I'm highlighting right over here

143
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:22,590
Triangle ADC, whose area, so the area of ADC is going to be 2y + x,

144
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,090
is equal to 2y + x

145
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,470
And then look at triangle let's see, what color have I not used yet

146
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,120
Let me use this green

147
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:37,260
Triangle ADB, triangle ADB

148
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,770
Triangle ADB is going to be equal to,

149
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,190
well, you could say it's 2z + x,

150
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,920
but we know that the z's are equal to x

151
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,690
It's really just x + x + x

152
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,910
It's really equal to ADB is equal to 3x

153
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,560
And we have the same idea here

154
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,610
ADB has this base, which is the same as ADC's base,

155
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,420
and they both have the same height

156
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,250
We can draw up an altitude like this,

157
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,460
we can draw up an altitude like that

158
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,330
They have the same height

159
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,160
We're just invoking this principle over and over and over again

160
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,630
So these things have to equal each other

161
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,520
So we get 2y + x is equal to 3x, is equal to 3x

162
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,410
Subtract x from both sides

163
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:25,140
You get 2y is equal to 2x, or, or y is equal to x

164
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,630
So that's a really neat result

165
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,640
You go from each of the vertices of a triangle to the opposite side,

166
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,390
and you bisect that opposite side, and you do that three times,

167
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,730
you have three medians

168
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,160
These lines are called medians, where they intersect as a centroid

169
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,310
You know what's really cool is,

170
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,920
it divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area
