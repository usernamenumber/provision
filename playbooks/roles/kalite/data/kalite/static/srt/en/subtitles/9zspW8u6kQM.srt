00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,770
Welcome to the presentation
on radians and degrees.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,010
So you all are probably already
reasonably familiar with

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,950
the concept of degrees.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,310
I think in our angles models
we actually drill you

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,370
through a bunch of problems.

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:23,460
You're probably familiar that
a right angle is 90 degrees.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,650
Or half a right angle
-- 45 degrees.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,630
And you're also probably
familiar with the concept that

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,610
in a circle -- and that's my
best adept at a circle -- in a

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,760
that's my best attempt of a circle

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,010
circle, there are 360 degrees.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,750
So today I'm going to introduce
you to another measure or unit

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,270
for angles and this
is called a radian.

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,160
   

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,450
So what is a radian?

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,650
So I'll start with the
definition and I think this

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,105
might give you a little
intuition for why it's

18
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:59,910
even called radian.

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,380
   

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,850
Let me use this circle tool and
actually draw a nice circle.

21
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,060
   

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,270
I'm still using the radian
tool, the circle tool.

23
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:14,530
OK.

24
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,430
   

25
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,630
This is a radius of length r.

26
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,500
A radian is the angle
that subtends an arc.

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,210
And all subtend means is if
this is angle, and this is

28
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,520
the arc, this angle subtends
this arc and this arc

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,020
subtends this angle.

30
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,050
So a radian -- one radian -- is
the angle that subtends an arc

31
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,130
that's the length
of the radius.

32
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,780
So the length of
this is also r.

33
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,440
And this angle is one radian.

34
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,140
i think that's messy.

35
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,490
Let me draw a bigger circle.

36
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,010
   

37
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,640
Here you go.

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,860
And I'm going to do this
because I was wondering

39
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,780
why they do radians.

40
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,300
We all know degrees.

41
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,090
But actually when you think
about it it actually makes a

42
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,100
reasonable amount of sense.

43
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,873
So let me use the
line tool now.

44
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:12,980
   

45
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,990
And let's say that this radius
is a length r and that this arc

46
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,460
right here is also length r.

47
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:28,210
Then this angle, what's called
theta, is equal to one radian.

48
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,220
And now it makes sense that
they call it a radian.

49
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,440
It's kind of like a radius.

50
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,100
So let me ask a question:
how many radians are

51
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,420
there in a circle?

52
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,300
Well, if this is r, what is
the whole circumference

53
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,050
of a circle?

54
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,630
   

55
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,540
It's 2 pi r, right?

56
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,050
You know that from the
basic geometry module.

57
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,850
So if the radian is the angle
that sub tends an arc of r,

58
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:03,650
then the angle that subtends an
arc of 2 pi r is 2 pi radians.

59
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,970
So this angle is 2 pi radians.

60
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,510
   

61
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,820
If you're still confused,
think of it this way.

62
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,390
An angle of 2 pi radians going
all the way around subtends

63
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,650
an arc of 2 pi radiuses.

64
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,500
Or radii.

65
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,460
I don't know how to say
the plural of radius.

66
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,110
Maybe it's radians.

67
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,130
And I don't know.

68
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,630
So why am I going through all
of this mess and confusing you?

69
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,580
I just want to one, give you an
intuition for why it's called

70
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,130
a radian and kind of how
it relates to a circle.

71
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,890
And then given that there 2 pi
radians in a circle, we can now

72
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,980
figure out a relationship
between radians and degrees.

73
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,920
Let me delete this.

74
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,190
So we said in a circle,
there are 2 pi radians.

75
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,340
   

76
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,970
And how many degrees
are there in a circle?

77
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,800
If we went around a whole
circle how many degrees?

78
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,360
Well that's equal
to 360 degrees.

79
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,080
   

80
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,520
So there.

81
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,620
We have an equation that sets
up a conversion between

82
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,950
radians and degrees.

83
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:19,390
So one radian is equal to
360 over 2 pi degrees.

84
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,570
I just divided both
sides by 2 pi.

85
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,040
Which equals 180
over pi degrees.

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,710
   

87
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,080
Similarly, we could have
done the other way.

88
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,000
We could have divided both
sides by 360 and we could have

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,530
said 1 degree -- I'm just going
to divide both sides but

90
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,970
360 and I'm flipping it.

91
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,410
1 degree is equal to 2
pi over 360 radians.

92
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,570
   

93
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,260
Which equals pi
over 180 radians.

94
00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,440
So then we have a conversion:
1 radian equals 180 over pi

95
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,220
degrees and 1 degree equals
pi over 180 radians.

96
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,980
Amd if you ever forget
these, it doesn't hurt

97
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,740
to to memorize this.

98
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,520
But if you ever forget it,
I always go back to this.

99
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,810
That 2 pi radians is
equal to 360 degrees.

100
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,450
Or another way that actually
makes the algebra a little

101
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,545
simpler is if you just
think of a half circle.

102
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:31,550
A half circle -- this angle
-- is a 180 degrees, right?

103
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,210
   

104
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,120
That's a degree sign.

105
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,810
I could also write degrees out.

106
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,680
And that's also equal
to pi radians.

107
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,680
   

108
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,250
So pi radians equal 180 degrees
and we can get to see the math.

109
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:57,250
1 radian equals 180 over pi
degrees or 1 degree is equal

110
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,940
to pi over 180 radians.

111
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,495
So let's do a couple of
problems were you'll get

112
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,540
the intuition for this.

113
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,010
If I asked you 45 degrees --
to convert that into radians.

114
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,440
   

115
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,410
Well, we know that 1 degree
os pi over 180 radians.

116
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:32,910
So 45 degrees is equal to 45
times pi over 180 radians.

117
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,850
And let's see, 45
divided by 180.

118
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,360
45 goes into 180 four times so
this equals pi over 4 radians.

119
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,650
   

120
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,600
45 degrees is equal to
pi over 4 radians.

121
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,610
And just keep in mind, these
are just two different units

122
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,070
or two different ways
of measuring angles.

123
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,590
And the reason why I do this is
this is actually the

124
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,700
mathematical standard for
measuring angles, although most

125
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,690
of us are more familiar with
degrees just from

126
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,030
everyday life.

127
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,920
Let's do a couple
of other examples.

128
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,690
Just always remember:
this 1 radian equals

129
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,400
180 over pi degrees.

130
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,200
1 degree equals pi
over 180 radians.

131
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,630
If you ever get confused,
just write this out.

132
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,400
this is what I do because I
always forget whether it's

133
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,570
pi over 180 or 180 over pi.

134
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,550
I just remember pi radians
is equal to 180 degrees.

135
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,840
Let's do another one.

136
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:33,060
So if I were to say pi
over 2 radians equals

137
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,765
how many degrees?

138
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:37,480
   

139
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,660
Well I already forgot what I
had just written so I just

140
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,565
remind myself that pi radians
is equal to 180 degrees.

141
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:55,720
   

142
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,930
Oh, my wife just got home, so
I'm just going to have to leave

143
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,670
the presentation like that
and I will continue it later.

144
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,120
Actually, let me just finish
this problem and then I'll

145
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,270
go attend to my wife.

146
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,140
But we know that pi radians is
equal to 180 degrees, right?

147
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:18,840
So one radian is equal to 180
over -- that's one radian -- is

148
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,660
equal to 180 over pi degrees.

149
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,470
I just figure out the
formula again because

150
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,490
I always forget it.

151
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,500
So let's go back here.

152
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:33,160
So pi over 2 radians is
equal to pi over 2 times

153
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,510
180 over pi degrees.

154
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,585
And that equals 90 degrees.

155
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:47,240
   

156
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,830
I'll do one more example.

157
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,480
   

158
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,915
Let's say 30 degrees.

159
00:08:55,915 --> 00:09:00,950
   

160
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,200
Once again, I forgot the
formula so I just remember

161
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,960
that pi radians is
equal to 180 degrees.

162
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:19,150
So 1 degree is equal to
pi over 180 radians.

163
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:27,220
So 30 degrees is equal to 30
times pi over 180 radians

164
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,320
which equals -- 30 goes
into 180 six times.

165
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,160
That equals pi over 6 radians.

166
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,630
Hopefully you have a sense of
how to convert between degrees

167
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,070
and radians now and even why
it's called a radian because

168
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,880
it's very closely related to
a radius and you'll feel

169
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,210
comfortable when someone asks
you to, I don't know, deal with

170
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,410
radians as opposed to degrees.

171
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,671
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
