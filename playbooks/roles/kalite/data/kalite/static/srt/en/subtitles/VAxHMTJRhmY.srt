1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
   

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,760
In the last video, I hopefully
showed you that if I borrowed P

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,500
dollars, and I borrow it for a
year, and you were to charge me

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,680
an interest rate of r, or you
could say 10r%, then at

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,310
the end-- and we were to
compound continuously.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,900
So we compound every zillionth
of a second, but we compound it

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,100
a trillion times, however many
of those intervals are in a

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,610
year, that at the end of a
year, I would owe you P

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,710
times e to the r dollars.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,780
Fair enough.

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,380
Now, what happens if I
borrow it for two years?

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,070
Well, after one year, we
already said that I would

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,470
owe you P times e to
the r dollars, right?

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,570
And then after two
years, what happens?

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,060
Well, this becomes
the new principal.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,380
You can kind of view it as like
I borrowed this much, then I

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,900
owed this much after a year,
and so this is the new

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,750
principal, so I can
reborrow this, right?

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,980
So if I reborrow this,
this becomes the new P.

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,770
So that becomes the new P, so I
could write Pe to the r, and

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,780
it's going to-- and that
new principal is going to

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,340
compound for another year.

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,340
So e to the r.

24
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,880
So that equals Pe to the 2r.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,330
And similarly, this is
now my new principal.

26
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,710
If I were to borrow it
for another year, it

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,820
becomes Pe to the 3r.

28
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,740
So, in general, if I borrow P
dollars, that's my initial

29
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,870
principal, I borrow it at a
rate of r and I borrow it for

30
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,740
two years, the amount that I
owe after two years

31
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,110
is Pe to the rt.

32
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,990
And once you know this, you are
ready to become your local

33
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,910
banker and to lend people
money continuously.

34
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,220
And let me just do a couple of
examples because I think it

35
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,670
might be a little confusing in
the abstract, but with some

36
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,310
numbers it might all clear up.

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:07,700
OK, so let's say
I borrow $1,000.

38
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,440
Let's say that the
interest rate is 25%.

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,060
That's the annual
interest rate.

40
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,040
Rate is equal to 25%, which
is the same thing as 0.25.

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,810
And let's say I were to
borrow it for three years.

42
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,140
So t is equal to three years.

43
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,580
And we're going to continuously
compound this interest.

44
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,930
So our formula says that the
amount that I'll owe at the end

45
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:45,870
of this is how much I borrowed,
$1,000 times e, to my interest

46
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,240
rate power, 0.25, times the
number of years, times t.

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,630
And so let's-- oh,
sorry, that's 3, right?

48
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:02,610
So that equals 1,000e to
the 0.75 power, and let

49
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,770
me calculate what
that is in Excel.

50
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,180
And just so you know, I
don't know if you're

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,250
familiar with Excel.

52
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,710
In Excel, the e to the power--
so I wrote that it's a 1,000

53
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,700
times-- e to a power
in Excel is exp.

54
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,270
So that's e to some power;
in this case, it's 0.75.

55
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,845
So I get my answer.

56
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:27,480
I don't know.

57
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,360
I think it fell off the
bottom of the screen.

58
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,650
There it is right here.

59
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,780
That's my answer.

60
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,470
Zoom in a little bit because I
think you might have trouble

61
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,710
reading it because it kind of
shrinks it when I

62
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,540
go to YouTube.

63
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,010
$2,117.

64
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:50,210
It equals $2,117, and that's
what you would owe me at

65
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,930
the end of three years.

66
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,010
This is actually the power
of compounding interest.

67
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,250
A lot of people, you know, when
you hear 10% interest rate or

68
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,070
even a 25% interest rate, that
no one really makes a

69
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,870
big deal about it.

70
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,120
But when you compound it, and
especially when you compound

71
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,420
it continuously, it can very
quickly turn into very,

72
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,430
very large numbers.

73
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,380
But let's do another example,
and this might be another kind

74
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,200
of more complicated example,
or something that you might

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,950
actually see in a textbook.

76
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,700
Let's say that I borrow $50.

77
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,400
I borrow $50, and let's say
it's continuously compounded

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,520
at some rate r, and let's
say it is continuously

79
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,470
compounded for 10 years.

80
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:41,690
At the end of 10
years, I owe $500.

81
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,660
What was the rate at
which it was compounded?

82
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,440
So once again, we can
use the same formula.

83
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,650
We could say, well, if my
original principle is $50--

84
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,410
so it's going to be $50
times e to the rate.

85
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,160
We don't know the rate, but
we know that t is equal

86
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,170
to 10 years, so its 10r.

87
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,010
That equals my final payment or
how much I owe once all the

88
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,800
interest and the principal
has compounded.

89
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,440
It's equal to $500.

90
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,000
So we can divide
both sides by 50.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,010
You get e to the 10r
is equal to 10.

92
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,980
And then how do we solve that?

93
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,900
Well, we could take the
log base e of both sides.

94
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,905
Hopefully, you might want to
review the logarithm, but log

95
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:32,910
base e-- e is just a number,
if you ever get confused-- is

96
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,580
equal to log base e of 10.

97
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,160
And log base e on your
calculator is often

98
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,420
written the natural log.

99
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,410
And they called it the natural
log because I'll show you e in

100
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,470
a hundred different-- not
a hundred, but in many

101
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,230
different applications.

102
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,050
It shows up all over nature,
and I think that's why it's

103
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,750
called the natural log.

104
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,660
Anyway, let me see if I can
figure out what Excel's

105
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,590
natural log function is.

106
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,680
So I need to figure out the
natural log, log base e of 10.

107
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,750
Equals LN 10.

108
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,580
Oh, there we go.

109
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,470
There it is right there: 2.3.

110
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,010
   

111
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,250
So first of all, if I say log
base e of e to the 10r, that's

112
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,180
like saying e to what power
is equal to e to the 10r?

113
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,940
So this is the same
thing as just 10r.

114
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,700
   

115
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,600
Why is that?

116
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,350
Because remember, logarithm is
an exponent, so this is saying

117
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,230
e to the 10r is equal
to e to the 10r.

118
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,290
Review my logarithm videos if
that's a little confusing.

119
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,990
I know it's a little
confusing at first.

120
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,510
And then we just figured out
that log base e, so e to the

121
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,780
what power is 10, is 2.--
what was the number?

122
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,850
2.30.

123
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,970
And now-- oh, this
isn't 10 to the r.

124
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,030
This is 10r, right?

125
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,560
And so we want to
figure out what r is.

126
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,700
We divide both sides by 10.

127
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:04,800
We get r is equal
to 0.23, or 23%.

128
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,920
So essentially, if I
continuously compound at an

129
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,500
annual rate of 23%, after 10
years, I'll essentially

130
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,460
owe 10 times the money.

131
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,310
So that's something
good to keep it mind.

132
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,660
Anyway, I'll leave you there,
and I really encourage you to

133
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,440
go back a couple of videos,
rewatch them, play

134
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,030
with the numbers.

135
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,960
Prove to yourself that
that limit exists.

136
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,640
Take that limit that we showed
in the beginning, the limit as

137
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,570
n approaches infinity of 1
over 1 plus n to the n.

138
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,070
All you have to do to prove
this is just put in larger

139
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,010
and larger numbers for n.

140
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,540
And, of course, whatever
number you put in there,

141
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,560
you have to put over here.

142
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,250
You can't put a million
here and a trillion there.

143
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,650
You have to put a trillion
and a trillion, or a

144
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,810
million and a million.

145
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,600
And you'll see that
it converges to e.

146
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,710
And rewatch the videos and
make sure you get kind of

147
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,750
an intuitive understanding
of everything we did.

148
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,770
And then this formula, which
most people, frankly, just

149
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,090
memorize, this Pe to the rt,
will make a lot of sense to

150
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,370
you, and you will have a
permanent neuron for it

151
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,550
the rest of your life.

152
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,790
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

153
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,500
