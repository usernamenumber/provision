1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're on Part B.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Write the first four nonzero terms of the Taylor series for cosine of x about x equals 0.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Use this series and the series for sin of x squared

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
found in Part A to write the first four nonzero terms

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the Taylor series for f

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(so for this f right over here)

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
about x = 0.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's just do the first part

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's first find the first four nonzero terms

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the Taylor series for cosine of x

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
about x equals 0.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's just say—we'll put our kind of

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
formula for the Taylor series up here

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
around x is equal to 0.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we're centering it around x equals 0 right over here.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so if we say h of x is equal to

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cosine of x, then h of 0 is going to be

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to cosine of 0, which is equal to 1.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then if you have h prime of x,

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's going to be equal to negative sine of x.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you could look of here:

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is essentially h of x and this is going

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to be h prime of x.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's essentially just one step ahead

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of where we were with g of x.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll just redo it over here

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just so it's clear.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the first derivative at 0 is

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative sine of 0, which is just 0.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then you have the second derivative—

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
second derivative of h of x.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So derivative of sine of x is cosine of x,

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but we have that negative out front

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's negative cosine of x.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So h prime prime of 0 is going to be

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to—cosine of 0 is 1. You have that

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative out front so it's -1.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then you have the third derivative

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of h is equal to derivative of negative cosine of x

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is positive sine of x.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the third derivative at 0 is going to be

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to 0. And then, this is also,

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then you take the derivative of this,

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you're going to get cosine of x again.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So then the cycle starts again.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I could write, this is also equal to

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the fourth derivative at 0.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right, let me just make it clear what I'm saying.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I take the derivative of this, I get cosine of x.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The fourth derivative of h is cosine of x again.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the fourth derivative at 0 is going to be

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the same thing as the function evaluated

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at 0 which is 1.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so the fifth derivative at 0

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be 0.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The sixth derivative at 0 is going to be -1.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then the seventh derivative at 0

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be 0.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's enough now. I think we have—

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we definitely have four nonzero terms.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have this term—let me pick a nice color here.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have this term, because we have a 1 coefficient.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is going to be a 0 because we have a 0 coefficient.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a nonzero term. Then this is a nonzero term,

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because we have the 1 again.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then this is a nonzero term, because

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have the -1. So we could say,

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cosine of x is approximately equal to—

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because we're just approximating it

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with the first four nonzero terms.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, f of 0 is 1.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's this term right over here.

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Instead of f of x we're calling it h of x right here

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that we don't get confused with

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the original f defined in the problem

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we're going to work on in the second part of—

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this section of the problem.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So cosine of x is equal to 1,

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
f prime of 0, or h prime of 0 is 0, so there's no term there.

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then f prime prime of 0—second derivative—it's -1.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's negative x squared over two factorial.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then you get another 0 for the third degree term.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then you get a 1 for the fourth degree term.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So plus 1—and we don't have to write the 1,

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's implicitly there. Plus 1 times x to the fourth

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over four factorial. And then, the next

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
nonzero term is this -1 over here.

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So -1, we can just write minus,

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's a sixth degree term.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So x to the sixth over six factorial.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're done. Those are the first four

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
nonzero terms of cosine of x.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now let's do the second part of the problem.
