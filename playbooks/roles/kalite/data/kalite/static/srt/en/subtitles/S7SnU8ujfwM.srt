1
00:00:00,532 --> 00:00:03,092
"We hold these truths to be self-evident:

2
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:05,268
That all men are created equal.

3
00:00:05,268 --> 00:00:08,539
That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.

4
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:12,402
That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."

5
00:00:12,402 --> 00:00:21,011
It's just amazing seconds and into the Declaration of Independence that jefferson and Adams and Franklin wrote is part of a committee.

6
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:23,066
And we were looking at that sentence.

7
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:29,281
Let's go on to look at that phrase "they are endowed by their Creator."

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:34,439
It interesting then the they don't really mention Jesus Christ and not even God.

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,509
They talk about the laws of nature and of nature's God. Enough creator

10
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:45,496
These would deist people kind of believe in the notion that there is some grand creator of the universe.

11
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:51,203
But they don't get into the specifics of any particular religious dogma.

12
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:53,599
The other thing is they're balancing.

13
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:55,802
Where do our rights come from?

14
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:57,132
In an earlier draft –

15
00:00:57,132 --> 00:01:00,663
(We will talk about how they edit the early drafts in a later video.)

16
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:06,357
But in an earlier draft, they just it just says they are endowed with certain unalienable rights.

17
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:10,869
And you see that John Adams probably is the one who wants to insert the phrase their Creator.

18
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:16,727
And that was because they started the sentence with we hold these truths to be sacred.

19
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:18,806
But they change that to self-evident.

20
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:23,102
They're trying to say to what extent is it rationality that gives the QQ rights.

21
00:01:23,346 --> 00:01:26,774
To what extent are these rights endowed by God?

22
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:31,786
And I think what they finally come down to is that we all had a creator.

23
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:35,141
And those creator that creator made us all.

24
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:38,665
And so to a certain extent, we were created equal.

25
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:47,032
I create a must love us all we are all created by the same creator, therefore there's a certain equality that we have.

26
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:52,625
And in creating us, he gave us certain unalienable rights.

27
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:56,024
SAL KHAN: Unalienable – this means can't be taken away.

28
00:01:56,198 --> 00:02:01,486
Its can live a rated you can't be can't be separated from you.

29
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:03,688
Can't take these right away.

30
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,920
The King can't take these rights away.

31
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:07,936
In other words, it's not as if we could give up these rights.

32
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:23,661
And in particular, they are talking about this theory of government that John Locke QQ who is one of the philosophers that they QQ English philosopher that period who said that when you create a government order is a government, you give up some of your rights.

33
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:33,457
For example, if we all agree that we're part of a government, we may give up our right, say, to take somebody else's property or whatever it may be.

34
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:35,533
So these are rights you can give up.

35
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:43,819
British written in rights -center on a QQ that she just can't give up or the king can't take away.

36
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:49,423
Once again you've got to look at Thomas Jefferson, who actually own slaves at this point.

37
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:55,281
And he is saying among those unalienable rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

38
00:02:55,428 --> 00:03:02,886
So there's this inherent conflict still between rights, such as liberty that you can take away from a person.

39
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:07,658
And yet Jefferson's writing this phrase when he owned slaves.

40
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:14,337
The phrase life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is also something that derives from John Locke.

41
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:18,769
And these philosophers of the Enlightenment, they were writing in England.

42
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:34,251
At one point, John Locke uses the phrase "life, liberty, and the pursuit of property ," because Locke believes that owning property was an important right you had, and the government couldn't just take your property away.

43
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:45,135
However you can see that they change it to QQ more so than elevated for QQ we each get to pursue our own notion.

44
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:48,994
And what we want to do in our lives happiness.

45
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:52,465
I don't think they just mean happiness, like joy QQ frivolity.

46
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,832
I think they mean pursuit of meaning in life – what gives our life meaning.

47
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:59,939
And these are the unalienable rights.

48
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:08,231
Then they go on and this gets to what's called the contract notion that government is that why do we have governments.

49
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:18,397
And whether it's John Locke or the other philosophers we've talked about, they say the reason we have government is that we all had these right.

50
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:21,685
But we decided to get together.

51
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,998
We instituted governments government – institute it on net.

52
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:31,736
And the reason those governments have their power is because of the consent of the governed.

53
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:45,454
It's like if you and I and twenty people got together and formed a group and we said we were going to form a group and we will give up some of our rights, because the group itself will have certain powers.

54
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,328
But we're consenting to do that.

55
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,218
It's not because of the divine right of kings.

56
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,823
It's to consent to govern the government.

57
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,266
To consent to.

58
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:56,461
The people say, "We will institute government amongst ourselves.

59
00:04:56,735 --> 00:04:58,829
And that's not to take away our rights.

60
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:11,229
That's to secure our rights – rights we I might with the 20 of us might give up our right to that the kind of force things to police each other to the government.

61
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:12,486
So that.

62
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:14,268
But we could have our life liberty and pursuit of happiness.

63
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:15,843
We're more likely to have it secured.

64
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:21,984
And once you get to that theory, you have to say what are the types of rights we would give up?

65
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:26,457
Judges may have the right to decide the traffic laws or the policing of things.

66
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:27,674
Look for a Help.

67
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:29,432
Property contracts are made.

68
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:37,252
But there are certain things that no matter what you QQ, if you were instituting a government among men, you would not give up the right to life.

69
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:39,561
You would not give up the right to liberty.

70
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:47,077
And you would not say I'm going to give up my right to pursue my own life and my own happiness.

71
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:49,900
You would say we want to secure those rights.
