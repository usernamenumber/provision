1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:10,890
In your mathematical careers, you might encounter people who say it is wrong to say that 'i' is equal to the principal square root of negative 1.

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:17,733
And if you ask them why is this wrong, they'll show up with this kind of line of logic that actually seems pretty reasonable.

3
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:21,533
They will tell you that, "Okay. Well, let's just start with -1.

4
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:29,467
We know from definition that -1 is equal to i times i. Everything seems pretty straightforward right now." And then they'll say,

5
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:34,467
"Well look, if you take this, if you assume this part right here, then we can

6
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:38,067
replace each of these i's with the square root of negative 1" And they'd be right.

7
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:43,770
So this would be the same thing as the square root of negative 1 times the square root of negative 1.

8
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:50,132
And then they would tell you that, "Hey, look, just from straight-up properties of the principal square root function,

9
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:58,867
they'll tell you the square root of a times b is the same thing as the principal square root of a, times the principal square root of b.

10
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:05,000
And so, if you have the principal square root of a times the principal square root of b, that's the same thing as square root a times b

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,469
so based on this property of the radical of the principal root, they'll say this over here is the same thing as

12
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:24,451
the squrae root of negative 1 times negative 1 if I have the principal root of the product of 2 things that's the same

13
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,933
thing as the the product of each of their principal roots
I am doing this in other order here.

14
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:33,739
here I had the principal root of the products, over here I have this on the right and then from that

15
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:41,402
we all know that negative 1 times negative 1 is 1 so this should be equal to the principal square root of 1

16
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:45,210
and then the principal squre root of 1, remember this radical means

17
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,867
principal squre root, positive
squre root that is just going to be positive 1 and

18
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:59,142
they'll say this is wrong. clearly negative 1 and positive 1 are not the same thing

19
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:06,200
and therefore you can't make the subtitution that we did in this step and you should then point out is

20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,724
that, this was not the incorrect step that it is true that negative 1 is not equal to 1 but the faulty line of reasoning here was

21
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:24,405
in using this propperty
when both a and b are negative, if both a and b are negative this will

22
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:38,569
never be true, so a and b both can not be negative infact normaly when this property is given,

23
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,888
sometimes is given a little bit in footnotes you might not even notice it because its not relevant when you

24
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:47,207
learning it in the first time but usually they give a little bit of construct there, they usually say for

25
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:55,705
a and b greater than or equal to zero so thats where they listes property this is true for a and b be

26
00:02:55,705 --> 00:03:04,333
greater or equal to zero and in particular it's false if both a and b are negative, Now I've said

27
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:12,267
that, I've just spend lat three minutes saying that people who tell you this is wrong are wrong but with

28
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:19,134
that I said I do say you have to be a little bit careful about it, when we take traditional principal

29
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:24,893
square roots so you take thi principal square root of 4, we know this is positive 2 that 4 actually

30
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:36,921
has two square roots, negative 2 ia also a square root of 4, if you have negative 2 times negaive 2

31
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:44,026
is also equal to 4, this radical symbol here means principal square root or when we just dealing with

32
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:48,067
real numbers non imaginary non complex numbers you can 
really ??? as positive

33
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:54,011
square root, this is two square roots, positive and negative 2 if you have this radical symbol right here, principal square roots it

34
00:03:54,011 --> 00:04:01,070
means the positive square root of 2. So when you start thinking about taking square roots of negative

35
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:06,085
numbers or even in the future you'll do imaginary numbers and complex numbers and all the rest you have

36
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:10,404
to expend the definition of what this radical means, so when you are taking the square root

37
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:19,133
of really of any negative number you'll really saying this is no longer the traditional principal

38
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:25,404
square root function you've now talking this is the principal complex square root function, this is now

39
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:32,370
to find for complex inputs or the domain it can also generate imaginary or complex output or you

40
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:40,590
should call that the range and if you assume that, then really straight from this you get that the

41
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:49,000
square root of negative x is going to be equal to i times the square root of x and this is only and i'm

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,827
going to make this clear because I just told you that this will be false if both a and b are negative,

43
00:04:52,827 --> 00:05:06,620
so this is only true, so we can apply this we can apply this we can apply when x is greater than or equal to

44
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,533
zero, so if x is greater than or equal to zero the negative x is clearly a negative number or I guess

45
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:17,533
it can be zero, it's a negative number and then we can apply this right over here if x was less than

46
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:22,600
zero then we'll be doing all of this nonesense up here and we will start to get nonesense equal

47
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,750
answeres and if you look at it this way you'll say hey look i can be the square of negative 1 if we were

48
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,933
taking the if it's the principal branch of the complex square root function, then you could

49
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:42,610
rewrite this right over here as square root of negative 1 times the square root of x and so really,

50
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:50,041
the real fault in this logic when people say hey negative 1 can't be equal to 1, the real faughlt is

51
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:58,800
using this property, when both a and b when both of these are negative numbers that will come up with

52
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,459
something that is unambiguously false, if you expend the definition of complex or expend the definition of

53
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:11,450
principle root include negative numbers in the domain and including and to include imaginary

54
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,487
numbers then you can do this you can say the the square root of negative x is the qsuare root of

55
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:23,896
negative 1 times or instead (say) the principle square root of negative x, I should be particulare in my

56
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:30,118
words, is the same thing as the principal square root of negative 1 times the principal square root of x

57
00:06:30,118 --> 00:06:35,645
when x is greater than or equal to zero and I don't want confuse you, if x is greater than or equal to

58
00:06:35,645 --> 99:59:59,999
zero this is clearly, this negative x, that is clearly negative or I guess you say a non positive number.
