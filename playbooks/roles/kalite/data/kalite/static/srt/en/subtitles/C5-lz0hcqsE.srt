1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,330
We hopefully know at this point
what a differential

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,490
equation is, so now let's
try to solve some.

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,000
And this first class of
differential equations I'll

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,270
introduce you to, they're called
separable equations.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,570
And I think what you'll find
is that we're not learning

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,420
really anything new.

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,010
Using just your first year
calculus derivative and

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,300
integrating skills, you can
solve a separable equation.

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,240
And the reason why they're
called separable is because

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,090
you can actually separate the
x and y terms, and integrate

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,330
them separately to get
the solution of the

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,170
differential equation.

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,640
So that's separable.

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,000
Separable equations.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,550
So let's do a couple, and I
think you'll get the point.

17
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,600
These often are really more of
exercises in algebra than

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,120
anything else.

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,110
So the first separable
differential equation is: dy

20
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:56,710
over dx is equal to x squared
over 1 minus y squared.

21
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,420
And actually, this is a good
time to just review our

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,050
terminology.

23
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,840
So first of all, what
is the order of this

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,060
differential equation?

25
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,090
Well, the highest derivative
in it is just the first

26
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,430
derivative, so the order
is equal to 1.

27
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,390
So it's first order.

28
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,020
It's ordinary, because we only
have a regular derivative, no

29
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,530
partial derivatives here.

30
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,130
And then, is this linear
or non-linear?

31
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,580
Well, first you say, oh well,
you know, this looks linear.

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,910
I'm not multiplying
the derivative

33
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,050
times anything else.

34
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,280
But if you look carefully,
something

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,160
interesting is going on.

36
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,100
First of all, you have
a y squared.

37
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,610
And y is a dependent variable.

38
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,440
y is a function of x.

39
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,740
So to have the y squared, that
makes it non-linear.

40
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,660
And even if this was a y, if you
were to actually multiply

41
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,280
both sides of this equation
times 1 minus y, and get in

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,740
the form that I showed you in
the previous equation, you

43
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,060
would have 1 minus y squared.

44
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,630
This is actually the first step
of what we have to do

45
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,150
anyways, so I'll
write it down.

46
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,020
So if I'm just multiplying both
sides of this equation

47
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,620
times 1 minus y squared, you get
1 minus y squared times dy

48
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,820
dx is equal to x squared.

49
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,120
And then you immediately see
that even if this wasn't a

50
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,020
squared here, you'd be
multiplying the y times dy dx,

51
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,770
and that also makes it
non-linear because you're

52
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,640
multiplying the dependent
variable times the

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,690
derivative of itself.

54
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,890
So that also makes this
a non-linear equation.

55
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,300
But anyway, let's get back
to solving this.

56
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,690
So this is the first step.

57
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,480
I just multiply both sides
by 1 minus y squared.

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,310
And the real end goal is just
to separate the y's and the

59
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,200
x's, and then integrate
both sides.

60
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,450
So I'm almost there.

61
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,720
So now what I want to do is I
want to multiply both sides of

62
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,940
this equation times dx, so I
have a dx here and get rid of

63
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,375
this dx there.

64
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,790
Let me go here, I don't want
to waste too much space.

65
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:47,440
So you get 1 minus y squared dy
is equal to x squared dx.

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,190
I have separated the x and
y variables and the

67
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,420
differentials.

68
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,510
All I did is I multiplied both
sides of this equation times

69
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,850
dx to get here.

70
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,160
Now, I can just integrate
both sides.

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,680
So let's do that.

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,080
Whatever you do to one side
of the equation you

73
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,930
have to do the other.

74
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,790
That's true with regular
equations or

75
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,560
differential equations.

76
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,180
So we're going to integrate
both sides.

77
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,640
So what's the integral of this
expression with respect to y?

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,350
Let's see.

79
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,730
The integral of 1 is y, the
integral of y squared, well

80
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:27,210
that's minus y to the
third over 3.

81
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,230
And I'll write the plus c here
just to kind of show you

82
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,730
something, but you really don't
have to write a plus c

83
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,020
on both sides.

84
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,145
I'll call the plus the
constant due to y.

85
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:38,750
The y integration.

86
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,420
You'll never see this in a
calculus class, but I just

87
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,670
want to make a point here.

88
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,290
   

89
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,840
I just want to show you that
our plus c has never

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,720
disappeared from when we were
taking our traditional

91
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,780
antiderivatives.

92
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,030
And what's the derivative
of this?

93
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,420
Well that's x to the
third over 3.

94
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,010
   

95
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,300
And this is also going
to have a plus c

96
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,600
due to the x variable.

97
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,390
Now, the reason why I did this
magenta one in magenta and I

98
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,070
labelled it like that, is
because you really just have

99
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,380
to write a plus c on one
side of the equation.

100
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,900
And if that doesn't make a lot
of sense, let's subtract this

101
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,740
c from both sides, and we get y
minus-- let me scroll down a

102
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,650
little bit, my y
looks like a g.

103
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:29,370
y minus y to the third over 3
is equal to x to the third

104
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,270
over 3 plus the constant when we
took the antiderivative of

105
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,380
the x, minus the constant of
the antiderivative when we

106
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,450
took the y.

107
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,500
But these two constants,
they're just constants.

108
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,480
I mean, we don't know
what they are.

109
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,430
There are arbitrary constants.

110
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,170
So we could just write
a general c here.

111
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,170
So you could have just-- you
have to have a constant, but

112
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,310
it doesn't have to be on both
sides of the equation, because

113
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,580
they're arbitrary.

114
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,140
cx minus cy, well, that's still
just another constant.

115
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,900
And then if we want to simplify
this equation more,

116
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,230
we can multiply both sides
of this by 3, just

117
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,430
make it look nicer.

118
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:04,510
And you get 3y minus y to the
third is equal to x to the

119
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,580
third plus-- well, I could
write 3c here.

120
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,190
But once again, c is an
arbitrary constant.

121
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,570
So 3 times an arbitrary
constant, that's just another

122
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,555
arbitrary constant.

123
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:18,610
So I'll write the c there.

124
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,690
And there you have it.

125
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,460
We have solved this differential
equation.

126
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,520
Although it is in implicit
form right now, and it's

127
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,290
fairly hard to get it out
of implicit form.

128
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,550
We could put the c on one side,
so the solution could be

129
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,180
3y minus y to the third minus x
to the third is equal to c.

130
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,660
Some people might like that
little bit better.

131
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,900
But that's the solution.

132
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,780
And notice, the solution, just
like when you take an

133
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,930
antiderivative, the solution
is a class of implicit

134
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,230
functions, in this case.

135
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,320
And why is it a class?

136
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,520
Because we have that
constant there.

137
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,090
Depending on what number
you pick there, it

138
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,360
will be another solution.

139
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,440
But any constant there will
satisfy the original

140
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,780
differential equation,
which was up here.

141
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,540
This was the original
differential equation.

142
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,370
And if you want to solve for
that constant, someone has to

143
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,630
give you an initial condition.

144
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:15,860
Someone has to say, well,
when x is 2, y is 3.

145
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,920
And then you could
solve for c.

146
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,880
Anyway, let's do another
one that gives

147
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,950
us an initial condition.

148
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,180
So this one's a little bit--
I'll start over.

149
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,990
Clear image, different colors,
so I have optimal space.

150
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,690
So this one is the first
derivative of y with respect

151
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:49,940
to x is equal to 3x squared
plus 4x plus 2 over 2

152
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,100
times y minus 1.

153
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,030
This is a parentheses, not
an absolute value.

154
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,280
And they give us initial
conditions.

155
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,640
They say that y of 0 is
equal to negative 1.

156
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,010
So once we solve this
differential equation, and

157
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,860
this is a separable differential
equation, then we

158
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,830
can use this initial condition,
when x is 0, y is

159
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,520
1, to figure out the constant.

160
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,220
So let's first separate
this equation.

161
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,610
So let's multiply both sides
by 2 times y minus 1.

162
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:25,340
And you get 2 times y minus 1
times dy dx is equal to 3x

163
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,620
squared plus 4x plus 2.

164
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,040
Multiply both sides times dx.

165
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,560
This is really just an
exercise in algebra.

166
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,030
And I can multiply this one out,
too, you get 2y minus 2,

167
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,940
that's just this, dy.

168
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:47,390
I multiplied both sides times
dx, so that equals 3x squared

169
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,730
plus 4x plus 2 dx.

170
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,740
I have separated
the equations.

171
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,990
I've separated the independent
from the dependent variable,

172
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,690
and their relative
differentials, and so now I

173
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,570
can integrate.

174
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,840
And I can integrate
in magenta.

175
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,500
   

176
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,950
What's the antiderivative
of this expression

177
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,650
with respect to y?

178
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,080
Well, let's just see.

179
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,100
It's y squared minus 2y.

180
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,450
I won't write the plus
c, I'll just do it on

181
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,200
the right hand side.

182
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,995
That is equal to 3x squared.

183
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:25,400
Well, the antiderivative is x to
the third, plus 2x squared,

184
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,580
plus 2x plus c.

185
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,010
And that c kind of takes care of
the constant for both sides

186
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,159
of the equation, and hopefully
you understand why from the

187
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,080
last example.

188
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,270
But we can solve for c using the
initial condition y of 0

189
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,480
is equal to negative 1.

190
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,870
So let's see.

191
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,950
When x is 0, y is negative 1.

192
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,090
So let's put y as negative 1,
so we get negative 1 squared

193
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,870
minus 2 times negative 1, that's
the value of y, is

194
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,500
equal to when x is equal to 0.

195
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,890
So when x is equal to 0, that's
0 to the third plus 2

196
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,760
times 0 squared plus
2 times 0 plus c.

197
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,260
So this is fairly
straightforward.

198
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,280
All of these, this is all 0.

199
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,940
This is, let's see, negative
1 squared, that's 1.

200
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,600
Minus 2 times minus 1, that's
plus 2, is equal to c.

201
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,170
And we get c is equal to 3.

202
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,710
So, the implicit exact solution,
the solution of our

203
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,080
differential equation-- remember
now, it's not a

204
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,880
class, because they gave us an
initial condition-- is y

205
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:43,170
squared minus 2y is equal to x
to the third plus 2x squared

206
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,260
plus 2x plus 3.

207
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,730
We figured out that's
what c was.

208
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,460
And actually, if you want, you
could write this in an

209
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,800
explicit form by completing
the square.

210
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,180
This is just algebra
this point.

211
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,510
You're done.

212
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,450
This is an implicit form.

213
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,450
If you wanted to make it
explicit, you could add 1 to

214
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:58,890
both sides.

215
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,660
I'm just completing
the square here.

216
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,480
So y squared minus 2y plus 1.

217
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,060
If I add 1 to that side, I have
to add 1 to this side, so

218
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:13,090
it becomes x to the third plus
2x squared plus 2x plus 4.

219
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,940
I just added 1 to both sides
of the equation.

220
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,770
Why did I do that?

221
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,680
Because I wanted this
side to be a perfect

222
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,240
square in terms of y.

223
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,590
Then I can rewrite this side as
y minus 1 squared is equal

224
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:30,500
to x to the third plus 2x
squared plus 2x plus 4.

225
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,110
Then I could say y minus 1 is
equal to the plus or minus

226
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,950
square root of x to the
third plus 2x squared

227
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,210
plus 2x plus 4.

228
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,520
I can add 1 to both sides, and
then I can get y is equal to 1

229
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,080
plus or minus the square root
of x to the third plus 2x

230
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,926
squared plus 2x plus 4.

231
00:10:55,926 --> 00:10:58,470
And it has plus or minus here,
and if we have to pick one of

232
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,335
the two, we'd go back to
the initial condition.

233
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:02,860
   

234
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,800
Well, our initial condition told
us that y of 0 is equal

235
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,200
to negative 1.

236
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,710
So if we put 0 here for x, we
get y is equal to 1 plus or

237
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,065
minus 0 plus 4.

238
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:22,100
So 1 plus or minus 4.

239
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,740
So if y is going to be equal to
negative 1, so we get y is

240
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,580
equal to 1 plus or
minus-- sorry, 2.

241
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,090
If this is going to be equal to
negative 1, then this has

242
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,830
to be 1 minus 2.

243
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,160
So the explicit form that
satisfies our initial

244
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,490
condition, and we're getting a
little geeky here, you could

245
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,970
get rid of the plus, it's 1
minus this whole thing.

246
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,340
That's what satisfies our
initial condition.

247
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,430
And you could figure out where
it's satisfied, over what

248
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,910
domain is it satisfied.

249
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,300
Well, that's satisfied when this
term is positive, this

250
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,130
becomes negative, and you get
it's undefined in reals, and

251
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,470
all of that.

252
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,950
But anyway, I've run
out of time.

253
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,970
See you in the next video.
