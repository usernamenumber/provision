1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,890
We're on problem 135.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,590
I just did some pilates, so I'm slightly out of breath.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,570
If x is less than 0, is y greater than 0?

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:29,890
All right, statement number 1, x/y is less than 0.

5
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,630
So this is actually pretty useful.

6
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,000
They're telling us that x is a negative number.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,910
So we have a negative here,

8
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,510
and we're dividing it by some other number. They're

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,490
telling us that the resulting number is still negative.

10
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:54,030
So we have a negative divided by something

11
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,070
is equal to a negative.

12
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,970
So I think you learned when you learned negative numbers,

13
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,710
if y was negative-- well,

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,590
if y was 0 this would be undefined--

15
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,640
and if y is negative, if this was a negative,

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,480
then when you divide a negative by a negative,

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,970
you would have a positive. So y has to be a positive number,

18
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,810
and it can't be 0. So this actually tells us.

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,740
Statement 1 alone tells us that y is greater than 0 just

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,760
based on the fact that you have a negative.

21
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,800
It's just telling you that a negative divided

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,420
by y is still negative.

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,500
This whole thing is still negative.So y has to be a positive.

24
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:38,070
Statement number 2 tells us y minus x is greater than 0.

25
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's see, add x to both sides.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,850
That tells us that y is greater than x.Well that's not enough

27
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,140
It says if x is 0, is y greater than 0?

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,520
Maybe x is equal to minus 10 and y is equal to minus 9.

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,540
So in this case, y wouldn't be greater than 0.

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,840
Or maybe x is equal to minus 10 and y is equal to plus 9.

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,550
Both of these would satisfy this condition. So we don't know.

32
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,540
This doesn't tell us any information on whether y is

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,410
greater than 0.

34
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,210
So statement 1 alone is sufficient, and statement 2

35
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,120
doesn't do much for us.

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:24,000
Problem 135, no, I already did 135, 136.

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,550
They've drawn a circle there,

38
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,860
so I guess I'll draw a circle as well. So that's the circle.

39
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:40,120
They have a center like that and then it's like that.

40
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,020
There's a right angle right here. They call this O.

41
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,020
They call this X. They call this Z.

42
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,380
Then they actually connect those two points.

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,020
Then they call this, this point right here, that's Y.

44
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,370
Let's see what they're asking.

45
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,080
What is the circumference of the circle above with center O?

46
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,150
So they just want to know the circumference.

47
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,830
So if we could figure out a radius, then we know

48
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,780
circumference is 2 pi times the radius, and we'd be all set.

49
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,050
So let's see what information they give us.

50
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:25,020
Statement number 1, the perimeter of triangle OXZ is

51
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:34,820
20 plus 10 square roots of 2.

52
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,240
Now this is interesting. What do we know about this?

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,020
Well we know that it's going to be an isosceles triangle.

54
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,840
We know that if this length right here is X, that this

55
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,490
length is also going to be X, because this is a circle.

56
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,490
The radius is constant,

57
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,930
and each of these sides are the radius of the circle.

58
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,430
So those are both going to be x. What is this going to be?

59
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,680
We just know from Pythagorean theorem, x squared plus x

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,640
squared is going to be equal to that side squared.

61
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,500
Let's call that c squared.

62
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,580
So you get 2x squared is equal to c squared or c-- I'm

63
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,610
calling this side right here c-- is equal to the square

64
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,070
root of 2, x times the square root of 2. Whatever x is.

65
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,710
So the perimeter of this entire triangle is going to be

66
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,340
two x's, x plus x,

67
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:33,540
so it's going to be 2x plus x square roots of 2.

68
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,240
Statement 1 told us that this perimeter is equal to

69
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,800
this right here.

70
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,030
It's going to be equal to 20 plus 10 square roots of 2.

71
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,480
Well I think you could do a little pattern matching here

72
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,010
and solve for x.

73
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,000
This is actually, even though it might not look completely

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,070
like it, this is a linear equation. You can solve for it.

75
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,030
Immediately that should be, oh, statement 1 is sufficient.

76
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,070
But you can just do a little pattern matching and say,

77
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,090
well, this works when x is equal to 10.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,580
So actually, we are able to figure out what x is equal to.

79
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,630
Then as I said before, x is the radius of this circle.

80
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,680
Then the circumference of the circle, which is what the

81
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,380
whole question is about, that's 2 pi times the radius.

82
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,010
Circumference is 2 pi times the radius.

83
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,830
We just figured out the radius is 10. So it equals 20 pi.

84
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,060
So statement 1 is sufficient. What does statement 2 do?

85
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:33,000
Statement 2, the length of arc XYZ is 5 pi. XYZ is 5 pi.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,980
So they're telling us that this length is 5 pi.

87
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,500
Well do we know what proportion that is of the

88
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,830
entire circumference?

89
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,410
Well sure, because they tell us that this is 90 degrees

90
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,790
right here. This is 90 degrees of 360 degrees of a circle.

91
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,310
So this, the arc length right here,

92
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,460
is exactly going to be 1/4 of the circle.

93
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,000
We know that because 90 degrees is 1/4 of 360.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,030
So 5 pi is going to be equal to 1/4 times the circumference.

95
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,470
Or that the circumference is going to be equal to 20 pi.

96
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,810
So each statement independently, statement 1 or

97
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,170
statement 2, independently, is sufficient to answer this

98
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,470
question, the circumference of the circle. 137,

99
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,110
what is the value of a to the fourth minus b to the fourth?

100
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,570
Immediately just even looking, one thing I'm tempted to do is

101
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:45,740
rewrite this as a squared squared minus b squared squared.

102
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,030
Because I just glanced at statement 1

103
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,000
and they had squares there. So I'm going to do that.

104
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,550
Let me do different letters.

105
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,020
You know that x squared minus y squared is equal to x plus y

106
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,590
times x minus y.

107
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,010
So here, x is a squared and y is b squared.

108
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,190
So this is going to be equal to-- this is just the original,

109
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,680
this is going to be equal to a to the squared--

110
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,840
a squared plus b squared times a squared minus b squared.

111
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,180
Then we could simplified this again.

112
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,020
So this is going to be equal to a squared plus b squared.

113
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,450
We could simplify this as a plus b times a minus b.

114
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,210
I think that's going to be helpful just glancing at the

115
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,740
two statements that they gave us.

116
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:45,840
So statement 1 tells us that a squared minus b squared

117
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,020
is equal to 16.

118
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,060
So that tells us that just this is equal to 16.

119
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,010
That is equal to 16.

120
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,200
That doesn't help me much because I don't know what a

121
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,030
squared plus b squared is going to be.

122
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,140
It just tells me the difference between these two squares.

123
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,050
I don't know whether they're integers or anything.

124
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:15,040
Statement 2 tells me that a plus b is equal to 8.

125
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:22,200
Once again, that doesn't help me tremendously by itself.

126
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,860
If I just know that a plus b is equal to 8,

127
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,000
and I don't know what a minus b is,

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,700
I don't know what all of this is.

129
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,010
But when I use them together, this is interesting.

130
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:39,710
Because we know that a plus b times a minus b is equal to a

131
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,530
squared minus b squared.

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,530
Well they just told us that a plus b is equal to 8.

133
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,060
So a plus b is equal to 8.

134
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:53,110
So 8 times a minus b is going to be equal to a squared minus

135
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,060
b squared, which statement one told us was 16.

136
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,010
So that actually tells us that a minus b is equal to 2.

137
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,170
So now we have two equations with two unknowns,

138
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,870
and we could solve for a and b.

139
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,800
If we can solve for a and b, then we can definitely tell

140
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,030
you what a to the fourth minus b to the fourth is.

141
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,840
Just to show you that, let me do it.

142
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,780
So let's see, a minus b is equal to 2. Add these equations.

143
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,020
2a is equal to 10. a is equal to 5.

144
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,850
Then if a is equal to 5, b is equal to 3.

145
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,040
So our original statement,a to the fourth is 5 to the fourth.

146
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,530
5 to the fourth minus 3 to the fourth.

147
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,580
So whatever-- that's what? 625 minus 81, I think.

148
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,110
It doesn't matter. You can figure it out.

149
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,540
So both statements combined are sufficient to

150
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,000
answer this question.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,020
See you in the next video.
