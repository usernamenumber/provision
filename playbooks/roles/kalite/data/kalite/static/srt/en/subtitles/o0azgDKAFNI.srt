1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,500
We're on problem 214.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,410
Of the 50 researchers in a work group,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,390
40% will be assigned to team A. So let's call that team A.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,870
Of the 50 researchers working,

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,670
40% percent will be assigned to team A.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,020
So 40% of 50, that's equal to 20 go to team A.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,620
And the remaining 60% go to team B.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,530
So B gets the remaining 60%, which is 30 people, right?

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,000
60% percent of 50 is 30.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,600
However, 70% of the researchers prefer team A,

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,950
and 30% prefer team B.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:51,910
So 70%, which is what, 35, prefer A, and 30% prefer team B.

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,770
So the remainder, which is 15, right, or 30% of 50, prefer B.

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,920
What is the lowest possible number of researchers who will

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,720
not be assigned to the team they prefer?

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,030
So there's a lot of pseudo-double negatives here.

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,000
What is the lowest possible number of researchers

18
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,050
who will not be assigned to the team that they prefer?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,760
So this is -- I have to read that a couple of times.

20
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,320
What is the lowest number of researchers

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,950
who will not be assigned to the team they prefer?

22
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,540
So essentially they're saying this is the case

23
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,740
where most people get the team they prefer, right?

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,030
Where as many people as possible to get the team they prefer,

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,730
and then we want the lowest number of people who

26
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,020
didn't get the team they prefer.

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,450
So what's the situation?

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,750
Well, the best situation is -- let's see, 35 prefer A,

29
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,370
so let's say that 20 of them got A.

30
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,050
And then 15 fall into this upset category.

31
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,230
And likewise, out of these 15 that prefer B, well,

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,040
I don't know, let's say that all of them got B.

33
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,600
All of these got B, but then we have to put another 15 in B,

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,180
and that's these 15 people.

35
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,900
So the best case in this area in which all of these people get B,

36
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,730
and 20 of these people get A,

37
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,920
but then you've got to stick 15 people of these in B,

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,310
so those 15 people are going to be upset.

39
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,000
And so that is the lowest possible number of researchers

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,380
who will not be assigned to the team they prefer,

41
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,350
so that's these 15. And that's choice A.

42
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,710
Problem 215.

43
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,220
If m is the average of the first ten positive multiples of 5,

44
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,870
m is equal to average of, I don't know,

45
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,350
let's call it multiples of 5,

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,050
and M is the median of the first ten --

47
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:14,300
and this is the first ten -- and M-- big M--

48
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,730
is equal to the median of the same thing,

49
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,630
what is the value of big M minus small m?

50
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,700
So let's just write them out.

51
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,970
I think that's the simplest way to do it.

52
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,800
The first ten multiples of 5.

53
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:36,010
5, 10 -- the first ten positive multiples of 5.

54
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,990
Right, so we won't count 0.

55
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:45,510
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 -- actually,

56
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,770
let me write it another way,I know this is a little confusing

57
00:03:47,830 --> 00:04:02,500
So this is 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50.

58
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,210
And I just thought of writing it that way for a reason.

59
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,060
So, first of all, they want a little m, which is the mean.

60
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,030
Little m is equal to the average of this.

61
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,540
Let me ask you a question.

62
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,000
If you average-- so I paired these numbers from the lowest

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,230
to the highest, second lowest to second highest.

64
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,400
If you take the sum of this one and this one, you get 55.

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,650
This one and this one, you get 55.

66
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,560
This one and this one, you get 55.

67
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,410
So I think you get the point.

68
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,190
The sum of any two of them are 55.

69
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,000
So if you take the average of any of these,

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,680
the average of 5 and 50 is 27.5.

71
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,380
And that's going to actually be the average for the whole set

72
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,580
because you can pair them up.

73
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,150
The average of 25 and 30, 27.5.

74
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,450
The average of 20 and 35 is 27.5.

75
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,050
And if you don't believe me, I mean,

76
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,740
there's a bunch of ways you can think about this.

77
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,380
You could say, oh, this is the same thing as 55.

78
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,170
If you wanted to figure out the sum of this,

79
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,060
you can say if I sum these, it would be 55 times 5.

80
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,840
So you'd have-- the sum of all of them would be 55 times 5

81
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,840
divided by the total of all of them, which is 10,

82
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,040
which is 55 times 1/2, which is 27.5.

83
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,330
Anyway, there's a bunch of ways to think about it,

84
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,290
but I just wanted to show you a quick way of figuring out the

85
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,140
average of the first ten multiples of 5.

86
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,000
And then they want to know

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,520
what is the median of the first ten positive multiples of 5?

88
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,440
So the middle numbers-- so there's two middle numbers,

89
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,470
these two.

90
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,310
So when you have two middle numbers,

91
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,020
you take the average of them to get the median.

92
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,040
Well, guess what? The average of those two is 27.5.

93
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,040
So big M is equal to 27.5.

94
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,920
So big M minus small m is 0, and that is choice B.

95
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,150
Next question, 216.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,980
If m is greater than 0, and x is m% of y--

97
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:04,390
so x is equal to m/100 times y, right?

98
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,610
If m is 6%-- and this'll turns into 0.06, right?

99
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:20,540
x is m% of y, then in terms of m, y is what percent of x?

100
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,400
OK, so let's multiply both sides of this by 100/m.

101
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,990
So you get 100/m x,

102
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,110
and 100/m times m/100 is just 1 is equal to y, right?

103
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,700
Let me switch the order to so it makes a little more--

104
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:43,000
y is equal to 100/m times x.

105
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,590
So if I wanted to write this as a percentage,

106
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,450
this right here is going to be some type of decimal number.

107
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,490
And so if I have a decimal and I want to multiply,

108
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,870
and if I want to express it as a percentage, I mean,

109
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,190
if this right here is 1,

110
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,390
if I wanted express it as a percentage, it would be 100%.

111
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,130
If this right here ends up being 0.2,

112
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,510
I would multiply it by 100 and get 20%.

113
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,020
So to express this as a percentage, I'd multiply it by 100.

114
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:20,030
So 100/m times 100 is equal to 10,000/m.And that is choice E.

115
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,310
10,000 over m%,which is the same thing as 100/m as a decimal.

116
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,130
Next question, 217. I'll use green.

117
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,550
A certain junior class has 1,000 students,

118
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,340
so the junior class has 1,000 students,

119
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,050
and a certain senior class has 800 students.

120
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,560
So some people dropped out. Maybe they didn't.

121
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,550
Maybe it started bigger or smaller.

122
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,020
Among these students there 60 sibling pairs.

123
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,740
60 siblings-- I already sense a Venn diagram coming--

124
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,390
each consisting of 1 junior and 1 senior.

125
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,790
If one student is to be selected at random from each class,

126
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,070
what is the probability that the two students selected

127
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,820
will be a sibling pair?

128
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,530
If one student is to be selected at random from each class,

129
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,030
what is the probability that the two students will be

130
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,430
a sibling pair?

131
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,330
OK, so how many sibling pair members are there in each class?

132
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,380
Well, there have to be 30 in each class.

133
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,080
So there's 30 sibling pair members in that class and

134
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,770
there's 30 sibling pair members in that class. OK,

135
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,230
so if one student is to be selected at random from each class

136
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,680
what is the probability that two students will be a

137
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,480
sibling pair? OK, so let's say we pick a student

138
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,150
from the junior class first, right?

139
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,000
So first of all,

140
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,800
what's the chances that they're even part of a sibling pair?

141
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,030
Well, that's going to be--

142
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,760
there's 30 of them that are part of a pair,

143
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,770
and there's 1,000 in the class,

144
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,990
so the probability of that happening is 30/1,000,

145
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,020
which is the same thing as 3/100, right?

146
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,060
That's the probability that we got a part of a pair.

147
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,080
Now we're going to go and pick someone from the senior class.

148
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,910
If we want to find this guy's sibling,

149
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,500
we can't just find another sibling pair,

150
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,110
we've got to find this guy's actual sibling. So actually,

151
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,750
only one person in the entire senior class is going to be--

152
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,830
whoever this person we pick from the junior class,

153
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,560
if we did happen to pick one, the only way that we

154
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,150
got an actual sibling pair is if we pick that one person in

155
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,060
the senior class who is this person's sibling.

156
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,000
So there's actually only a1 in 800 chance that we picked them

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,480
So if we multiply that out, that is equal to 3 over--

158
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,010
let's see, what is it? 80,000?

159
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,050
3/80,000, which is not one of the choices.

160
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,010
So what did I do wrong?

161
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,080
Here.

162
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,810
So I see 3/40,000, and for some reason,

163
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,050
I think maybe I'm not counting two scenarios.

164
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,320
There's probably two scenarios in which is this can occur,

165
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,780
right?

166
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,260
I could have picked-- if I go to the junior class first and

167
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,510
there's a 30 in 1,000 chance that I pick the correct sibling,

168
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,790
so that's 3 in 100, and then the odds that I take his

169
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,250
or her sibling from the senior class is 1 in 800.

170
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,700
But maybe then-- let me see if I'm missing some logic here.

171
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,530
Maybe I could have picked-- well, instead of me stumbling

172
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,580
because I'm already over time,

173
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,010
let me continue this in the next video.
