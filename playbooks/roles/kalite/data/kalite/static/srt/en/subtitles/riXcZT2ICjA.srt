00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:07,132
In this video I want to familiarize you with the idea of a limit, which is a super important idea.

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,813
It's really the idea that all of calculus is based upon.

3
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:17,036
But despite being so super important, it's actually a really really really simple idea.

4
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:21,075
So let me draw a function here - actually, let me define a function

5
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:32,800
here. A kind of a simple function. So let's define f(x) - let's say that f(x) is going to be (x-1)/(x-1).

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,084
And you might say, "Hey Sal, look, I have the same thing in the numerator and the denominator.

7
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:42,421
If I have something divided by itself, that would just be equal to one! Can't I just simplify this to f(x)=1?"

8
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:47,944
And I would say, "Well, you're almost true, the difference between f(x)=1 and this thing right over

9
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:57,638
here is that this thing is undefined when x=1. So if you set - let me write it over here - if you have

10
00:00:57,653 --> 00:01:07,267
f(1), what happens? In the numerator, you get (1-1), which is... let me just write it down...

11
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:14,605
in the numerator you get 0, and in the denominator you get (1-1), which is also 0. And so anything divided

12
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:26,764
by 0, including 0/0, this is undefined. So you can make the simplification - you can say that this is

13
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:36,867
the same thing as f(x)=1, but you would have to add the constraint that x cannot be equal to 1. Now this

14
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:43,133
and this are equivalent. Both of these are going to be equal to 1, for all other x'es other than 1. But

15
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:51,340
at x=1, it becomes undefined. This is undefined and this one's undefined. So how would I graph this function?

16
00:01:51,340 --> 00:02:10,496
So let me graph it... That is my y=f(x) axis, and then this over here is my x-axis, and then let's say

17
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:22,799
this is the point x=1, this over here would be x=-1, this is y=1, right up there I can do -1 but that

18
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:28,267
doesn't do much relative to this function right over here, and and let me graph it. So it's essentially for

19
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:42,600
any x other than 1, f(x)=1. So it's gonna look like this... except at 1. At 1, f(x) is undefined, so

20
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,800
I'm gonna put a little bit of a gap right over here, this circle, to signify that this function

21
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,400
is not defined - we don't know what this function equals at 1, we never defined it.

22
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,333
This definition of the function doesn't tell us what to do at 1 - it's literally undefined when x=1.

23
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:09,113
So this is the function right over here, and so once again, if someone were to ask you what is f(1), you'd go...

24
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:14,467
and let's say, well this was a function definition, you would go x=1. Oh wait, there is a gap in my function

25
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:21,148
over here, it is undefined. So let me write it again... well, it's kind of redundant but I'll rewrite it.

26
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:30,313
f(1) is undefined. But what if I were to ask you, what is the function approaching

27
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:44,708
as x=1? And now, this is starting to touch on the idea of a limit. So as x gets closer and closer to 1...

28
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:51,837
what is the function approaching? Well this entire time, what is it getting closer and closer to?

29
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:58,909
On the left hand side, no matter how close you get to 1, as long as you're not at 1, f(x)=1.

30
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:04,790
Over here from the right hand side, you get the same thing. So you could say - and you'll get

31
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,631
more and more familiar with this idea as we do more examples - that the limit as

32
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:24,933
x (and lim, short for limit) - as x approaches 1 of f(x) is equal to...

33
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:29,311
As we get closer we can get unbelievably, infinitely close to 1 as long as we're not at 1...

34
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,190
And our function is going to be equal to 1, it's getting closer and closer to 1,

35
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:39,684
it's actually at 1 the entire time. So in this case, we can say the limit as x approaches 1 of f(x)

36
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:45,395
is 1. So once again, has very fancy notation, we're just saying, "Look, what is the function approaching

37
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:48,133
as x gets closer and closer to 1?"

38
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:54,021
Let me do another example where we're dealing with a curve, just so that you have the general idea.

39
00:04:54,021 --> 00:05:02,533
So let's say that I have the function f(x) - let me, just for the sake of variety, let me call it g(x).

40
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:09,852
Let's say that we have g(x) is equal to - I can define it this way, we can define it as x²

41
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:26,082
when x does not equal 2, and let's say that when x=2, it is equal to 1. So once again, kind of an interesting

42
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:34,133
function that - as you'll see - is not fully continuous. It has a discontinuity. Let me graph it.

43
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:48,225
So this my y=f(x) axis, this is my x-axis right over here. Let's say this is x=1, this is x=2,

44
00:05:48,225 --> 00:06:01,825
this is -1, this is -2... And then let me draw..So everywhere except x=2, it's equal to x². So let me draw it like this,

45
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:08,636
this is gonna be a parabola, it looks something like this... It's gonna look something...

46
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:18,308
Let me draw a better version of the parabola. So it looks something like this, not the most beautifully

47
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:24,341
drawn parabola in the history of drawing parabolas, but I think it will give you the idea of what a parabola

48
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:32,991
looks like, hopefully. It should be symmetric... Let me redraw it, because that's kinda ugly.

49
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:38,467
That's looking better, okay, alright, there you go. Alright.

50
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:48,867
Now, this should be the graph of just x², but it's not x² when x=2. So once again, when x=2,

51
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:55,428
we should have a little bit of a discontinuity here, so I'll draw a gap right over there,

52
00:06:55,428 --> 00:07:00,478
because when x=2, the function is equal to 1.

53
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:09,566
I'm not doing them on the same scale... On the graph of f(x)=x² this would be 4, this would be 2,

54
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:23,547
this would be 1, this would be 3. So, x=2, our function is equal to 1.

55
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:27,856
So this is a bit of a bizarre function, but you can define it this way, you can define a function however

56
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:36,667
you like to define it! And so, notice, it's just like the graph of f(x)=x² except when you get to 2,

57
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:48,252
it has this gap, because you don't use the "f(x)=x² when x=2", you use "g(x)=1".

58
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:50,848
If I've been saying f(x), I apologize for that.

59
00:07:50,848 --> 00:08:04,914
You use g(x)=1, so then just exactly at 2, it drops down to 1, and then it keeps going along the function x².

60
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:11,241
So there is a couple of things. If I were to just evaluate the function - g(2),

61
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,933
well you look at this definition. Okay, when x=2, I use this situation right over here,

62
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:21,538
and it tells me it's going to be equal to 1. Let me ask a more interesting question, or perhaps a more

63
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:32,149
interesting question. What is the limit as x approaches 2 of g(x)? Once again, fancy notation, but

64
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:38,502
it's asking something pretty pretty simple. It's saying "as x gets closer and closer to 2...

65
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:42,240
as you get closer and closer - and this isn't a rigorous definition, we'll do that in future videos -

66
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:52,979
as x gets closer and closer to 2, what is g(x) approaching? So if you get to 1.9, and then 1.999, and then 1.999999

67
00:08:52,979 --> 00:09:00,518
and then 1.9999999, what is g(x) approaching? If you were to go from the positive direction,

68
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:06,656
if you were to say 2.1, what's g(2.1)? What's g(2.01)? What's g(2.001)?

69
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:09,995
What is that approaching as we get closer and closer to it?

70
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:15,733
And you can see it visually just by drawing the graph. As g gets closer and closer to 2...

71
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:20,518
And if we were to follow it along the graph, we see that we're approaching 4,

72
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:26,545
even though that's not where the function is - the function drops down to 1 - the limit of g(x) as

73
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:33,405
x approaches 2 is equal to 4. You can even do this numerically using a calculator.

74
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:39,907
And let me do that, because I think that will be interesting. So let me get a calculator out...

75
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:49,041
Let me get my trusty TI-85 out... So here is my calculator... And you can numerically say,

76
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:57,995
okay, what's it gonna approach as you approach x=2? So let's try 1.9. For x=1.9, you would use this

77
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:05,549
top clause, right over here. So you'd have 1.9², and so you would get 3.61.

78
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:11,683
Well, what if you get even closer to 2? So 1.99, and once again let me square that,

79
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:21,683
well I'm at 3.96. What if I do 1.999 and I square that?

80
00:10:21,683 --> 00:10:27,991
I'm gonna get 3.996. Notice, I'm getting closer and closer and closer to our point.

81
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:37,546
If I got really close - 1.999999999999²? What am I gonna get to? It's not actually going to be

82
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:41,508
exactly 4 - this calculator just rounded things up - because we're gonna get to a number really really

83
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:47,456
really really close to 4. And we can do something from the positive direction, too, and it actually

84
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:52,083
has to be the same number when we approach from the below, what we're trying to approach,

85
00:10:52,083 --> 00:11:00,702
and above what we're trying to approach. So if we try 2.1², we get 4.4...

86
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,902
Let me go a couple of steps ahead...

87
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:09,256
2.0001². So this is much closer to 2 now. Now we're getting much closer to 4.

88
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:12,929
So the closer we get to 2, the closer it seems like we're getting to 4.

89
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:20,333
So once again that's a numeric way of seeing that the limit as x approaches 2 from either direction

90
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:25,000
of g(x) - even though right at 2, the function is equal to 1, because it's discontinuous -

91
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,070
the limit as we're approaching 2, we're getting closer and closer and closer to 4.
