1
00:00:00,697 --> 00:00:02,763
Okay, let's say you're me and you're in math class

2
00:00:02,763 --> 00:00:04,371
and you're supposed to be learning about

3
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:05,690
exponential functions, but you're having

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,674
trouble caring about exponential functions

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,077
because unfortunately your math class

6
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,745
is probably not terribly engaging.

7
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,721
You're supposed to be drawing and labeling some axes

8
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:16,904
so that you can graph this y equals 2 to the x thing

9
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:18,274
and your teacher seems to think

10
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:19,876
that drawing and labeling axes

11
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:21,949
is the very essence of mathematics

12
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:24,543
but you're bored and you can't help but wonder...

13
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:25,797
Why?

14
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:28,398
So you do what any conscientious student would do

15
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:29,697
in this situation and start doodling

16
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,207
and because you're me

17
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:33,321
you like to play games with yourself when you doodle.

18
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:34,505
Here's one game.

19
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:35,991
You're drawing a line, but when it crosses

20
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:37,941
one of the blue lines on your little piece of paper

21
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:39,427
it splits into two lines.

22
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:42,191
Maybe this line is like the neck of the mythical hydra

23
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:44,257
where every time one of its heads gets chopped off

24
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:47,601
by a blue line, it grows two more in its place.

25
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:49,163
You want to see if you can get all the way

26
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:50,829
to the bottom of the page following this rule

27
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,864
because if you do, you can draw

28
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:54,991
all of the little hydra heads at the end.

29
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:56,977
But you don't get very far on your first try.

30
00:00:56,977 --> 00:00:58,793
You decide to try again, this time

31
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,883
spacing things out a little more at the beginning.

32
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:02,368
Unfortunately, things are filling up fast,

33
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:03,832
though you got farther than last time.

34
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:04,903
Maybe if you had more room.

35
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:06,754
Or maybe if you sharpened your pencil more,

36
00:01:06,754 --> 00:01:08,239
you could get to the bottom of the page.

37
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,333
Oh, and don't forget to draw and label your axes.

38
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,831
If each broad swing of Hercules' sword chops off

39
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:14,613
all the heads thus doubling your number, well,

40
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:16,281
you can see where I'm going.

41
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:17,767
I'm not going to try and teach you math,

42
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:19,616
just how to wield it for doodling purposes.

43
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,704
In this case, that's going to be a lot of heads.

44
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:23,615
Good luck Hercules.

45
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:26,448
But maybe drawing binary trees all straight like that

46
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:28,845
is not an interesting game to hold your attention for long

47
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:30,847
so you start drawing them in arbitrary shapes.

48
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:32,907
Or less arbitrary shapes.

49
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:35,002
Maybe you start drawing a binary tree

50
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:36,237
that looks like a tree.

51
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,172
And maybe you can't see this tree in very high quality

52
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:40,207
because your camera, very much like your math class

53
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:43,544
is fuzzy, unfocused, and all together not very good.

54
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:45,379
Maybe you changed the rules slightly and

55
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,601
make a ternary bush where each branch sprouts

56
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:48,963
three more branches.

57
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:51,837
Unfortunately, your math class is 45 minutes long

58
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:54,206
and soon you need a more interesting doodle game.

59
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:56,241
Say you go back to the game

60
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,642
where your line splits at every level.

61
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:00,120
Only this time, instead of trying to squish all the lines in,

62
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,481
you let them hit each other.

63
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:04,601
And when they crash, there's a firey explosion

64
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:07,810
and the crashing lines end there.

65
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,256
Maybe you turn your notebook sideways

66
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:10,370
so that you can make sure

67
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,479
you're getting the horizontal spacing right.

68
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,225
Maybe, to go back to mythology,

69
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:16,212
Hercules has a method where, instead of cauterizing

70
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:19,194
the necks of the Hydra to keep them from growing back

71
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:21,978
he's found that the necks stick together if they get too close

72
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:23,917
And instead of growing new heads,

73
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:26,216
they just fill up with blood.

74
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:28,035
It might seem a little morbid for math class,

75
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:31,255
but maybe, if the curriculum wasn't so appalling

76
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:33,447
and the teaching methods wern't so atrocious,

77
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:35,231
you wouldn't have to entertain yourself

78
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:37,151
with these stories and games.

79
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:38,634
Speaking of this doodle game,

80
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:40,491
something very interesting is happening.

81
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:42,574
Looks like your simple rules about splitting

82
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:45,628
and crashing are creating Sierpinski's triangle.

83
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:47,112
Which is a pretty awesome fractal.

84
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:48,514
But the point is not to learn about fractals

85
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:50,767
or cellular automata or Sierpinski,

86
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,369
but to show that simple doodle games

87
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:53,668
can lead to mathematical results

88
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:56,806
so cool and beautiful that they're famous.

89
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:59,304
At least, famous to people like me.

90
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,651
And if you're good at inventing doodle games,

91
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:01,793
you might even end up

92
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:05,760
doing some real mathematics during your math class.

93
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,709
Anyway, maybe you don't care about accuracy.

94
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:09,581
Maybe you try the game again,

95
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:11,506
only you don't keep track of spacing,

96
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:12,116
and when you make a mistake and

97
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:14,020
accidentally grow heads where you shouldn't

98
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,785
you just roll with it.

99
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:18,043
Now you've introduced an element of random error

100
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:19,313
and you want to know

101
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:20,982
how this will affect the final picture.

102
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:22,966
It still looks like a pretty awesome doodle,

103
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:24,452
and has many of the same elements,

104
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:25,810
though it lacks the structure.

105
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,001
Speaking of the structure,

106
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:28,916
maybe because you're really super bored

107
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,696
and your class is seemingly never going to end,

108
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:34,613
you start looking at the number of necks at each level

109
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:37,199
and trying to figure out the pattern.

110
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,056
Maybe you haven't forgotten about powers of two.

111
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:41,453
Anyway, I hope I've provided you with

112
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:44,583
something entertaining to do next time you're bored.

113
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,000
Good luck with your math class.
