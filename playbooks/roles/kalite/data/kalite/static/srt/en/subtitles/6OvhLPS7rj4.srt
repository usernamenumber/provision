1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
   

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,200
In the next few videos I'm going
to embark on something

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,420
that will just result in
a formula that's pretty

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,870
straightforward to apply.

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,260
And in most statistics classes,
you'll just see that

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,150
end product.

7
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,870
But I actually want to show
how to get there.

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,290
But I just want to warn
you right now.

9
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,170
It's going to be a lot
of hairy math,

10
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,890
most of it hairy algebra.

11
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,290
And then we're actually going
have to do a little bit of

12
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,330
calculus near the end.

13
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,970
We're going to have to do a
few partial derivatives.

14
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,870
So if any of that sounds
daunting, or sounds like

15
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,290
something that will discourage
you in some way, you don't

16
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:29,950
have to watch it.

17
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,619
You could skip to the end and
just get the formula that

18
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,810
we're going to derive.

19
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,040
But I, at least, find it
pretty satisfying to

20
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,450
actually derive it.

21
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,020
So what we're going to think
about here is, let's say we

22
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,870
have n points on a
coordinate plane.

23
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,670
And they all don't have to
be in the first quadrant.

24
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,420
But just for simplicity of
visualization, I'll draw them

25
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,740
all in the first quadarant.

26
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,910
So let's say I have this
point right over here.

27
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,160
Let me do them in different
colors.

28
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,380
   

29
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,580
And that coordinate is x1, y1.

30
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,820
And then let's say I have
another point over here.

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,590
   

32
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,970
The coordinates there
are x2, y2.

33
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,940
And then I can keep
adding points.

34
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,710
And I could keep drawing them.

35
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,130
We'd just have a
ton of points.

36
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,990
There and there and there.

37
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,090
And we go all the way
to the nth point.

38
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,070
   

39
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,330
Maybe it's over here.

40
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,180
And we're just going to
call that xn, yn.

41
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,840
So we have n points here.

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,120
I haven't drawn all of
the actual points.

43
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,720
But what I want to do is find
a line that minimizes the

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,280
squared distances to these
different points.

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,990
So let's think about it.

46
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,610
Let's visualize that
line for a second.

47
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,090
So there's going to
be some line.

48
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,590
And I'm going to try to draw a
line that kind of approximates

49
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,590
what these points are doing.

50
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,930
So let me draw this line here.

51
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,710
So maybe the line might look
something like this.

52
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,330
I'm going to try my best
to approximate it.

53
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,500
Actually, let me draw it
little bit different.

54
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,230
Maybe it looks something
like that.

55
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,190
I don't even know what it
looks like right now.

56
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,470
And what we want to do is
minimize this squared error

57
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,110
from each of these points
to the line.

58
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,840
So let's think about
what that means.

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,230
So if the equation of this line
right here is y is equal

60
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,760
to mx plus b.

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,080
And this just comes straight
out of Algebra 1.

62
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,800
This is the slope on the line,
and this is the y-intercept.

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120
This is actually
the point 0, b.

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,780
What I want to do, and that's
what the the topic of the next

65
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,110
few videos are going to be, I
want to find an m and a b.

66
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,750
So I want to find these two
things that define this line.

67
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,060
So that it minimizes
the squared error.

68
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,040
So let me define what
the error even is.

69
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,050
So for each of these points, the
error between it and the

70
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,470
line is the vertical distance.

71
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,670
So this right here we
can call error one.

72
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,150
   

73
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,670
And then this right here
would be error two.

74
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,680
It would be the vertical
distance between that point

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,410
and the line.

76
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,790
Or you can think of it as the y
value of this point and the

77
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,500
y value of the line.

78
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,560
And you just keep going all
the way to the endpoint

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,760
between the y value of
this point and the y

80
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,840
value of the line.

81
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,060
So this error right here, error
one, if you think about

82
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,880
it, it is this value right
here, this y value.

83
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,570
It's equal to y1 minus
this y value.

84
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,830
Well what's this y value
going to be?

85
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,820
Well over here we have
x is equal to x1.

86
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,970
And this point is the
point m x1 plus b.

87
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,400
You take x1 into this equation
of the line and you're going

88
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,380
to get this point
right over here.

89
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,190
So that's literally going to
be equal to m x1 plus b.

90
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,340
That's that first error.

91
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,450
And we can keep doing it
with all the points.

92
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,450
This error right over here
is going to be y2

93
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,700
minus m x2 plus b.

94
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,290
And then this point right
here is m x2 plus b.

95
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,580
The value when you take
x2 into this line.

96
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,940
And we keep going all the
way to our nth point.

97
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:43,630
This error right here is going
to be yn minus m xn plus b.

98
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,040
Now, so if we wanted to just
take the straight up sum of

99
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,460
the errors, we could just
some these things up.

100
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,390
But what we want to do is a
minimize the square of the

101
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,520
error between each of these
points, each of these n points

102
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,040
on the line.

103
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:07,040
So let me define the squared
error against this line as

104
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,030
being equal to the sum of
these squared errors.

105
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,250
So this error right here, or
error one we could call it, is

106
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,110
y1 minus m x1 plus b.

107
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,620
And we're going to square it.

108
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,330
So this is the error
one squared.

109
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,960
And we're going to go to
error two squared.

110
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:36,580
Error two squared is y2
minus m x2 plus b.

111
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,560
And then we're going to
square that error.

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,100
And then we keep going, we're
going to go n spaces, or n

113
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,340
points I should say.

114
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,290
We keep going all the way
to this nth error.

115
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,690
The nth error is going to
be yn minus m xn plus b.

116
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,705
And then we're going
to square it.

117
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:01,850
   

118
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,480
So this is the squared
error of the line.

119
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:13,870
And over the next few videos, is
I want to find the m and b

120
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:25,360
that minimizes the squared error
of this line right here.

121
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,330
So if you viewed this as the
best metric for how good a fit

122
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,850
a line is, we're going to try to
find the best fitting line

123
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,220
for these points.

124
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,610
And I'll continue in
the next video.

125
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,120
Because I find that with these
very hairy math problems, it's

126
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,210
good to kind of just deliver
one concept at a time.

127
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,750
And it also minimizes my

128
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,040
probability of making a mistake.

129
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,534
