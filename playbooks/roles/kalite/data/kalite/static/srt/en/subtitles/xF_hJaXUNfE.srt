1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,030
In this video, I'm going to
attempt to give you an

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,000
intuition behind why
multiplying binomials involve

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,670
combinatorics

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,950
Why we actually have the
binomial coefficients

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,240
in there at all.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,060
And I'm going to do
multiple colors.

7
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,100
The colors will actually be
non-arbitrary this time.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,180
Just to give you an intuition.

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,200
So let's multiply a plus
b to the third power.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:30,280
Well, a plus b to the third
power, that's a plus b times--

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,540
and I'm going to keep
switching colors.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,450
You're going to have to bear
with me, but it should

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,260
hopefully be fruitful.-- Times
a plus b, times-- let me pick

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,960
an appropriately different
color, maybe a blue--

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,330
times a plus b.

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,820
And let's do this as a
distributive property.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:01:03,490
This equals a times-- go
back in green-- a plus b.

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,370
With a different green.

19
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,010
Want to make sure I use the
right green, just because the

20
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,520
colors matter this time.

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,000
a plus b-- this is tedious,
but it's worth it--

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,560
plus b times a plus b.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:34,890
And then all of that
times a plus b again.

24
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,450
And let's multiply
this inside part.

25
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,910
I'm just going to keep
it and multiply it out.

26
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:49,690
So it's going to be a times
green a-- we know they're all

27
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:56,610
the same a-- plus-- I should do
the pluses in a neutral color,

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,050
but it's OK-- plus a times--
you might be finding this

29
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:07,300
tedious, but it's going to pay
off in the end-- a times b.

30
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:25,400
Then we have plus b times a,
plus yellow b times green b.

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,200
And then all of that--
we're almost there.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,680
We're almost there.

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,580
All of that times a plus b.

34
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,820
And it's essentially,
we're going to multiply

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,320
a times everything.

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,220
This blue a times all of
this, and plus this blue

37
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,080
b times all of this.

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,120
So let's multiply the blue
a times all of this.

39
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,195
So the first term will
be yellow a, green

40
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:48,540
a, and then blue a.

41
00:02:48,540 --> 00:03:00,450
So it'll be a, a, a.

42
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,580
Oh it's a different blue, but
I think you get the point.

43
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,650
Plus this times blue a.

44
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:25,260
So yellow a, green b, and then
blue a, plus yellow b, green

45
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,640
a, blue a-- hopefully I'm
not confusing you-- baa.

46
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,980
b, a, a.

47
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,170
We're almost there.

48
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:45,510
Plus yellow b times
green b times blue a.

49
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,880
So we did all the
blue a's, finally.

50
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,980
There's a blue a.

51
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,210
Plus--.

52
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,750
Now we're going to do the
blue b times everything.

53
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,810
So it's yellow a times green a.

54
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,030
Right?

55
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,290
Yellow a, green a, then blue b,
times green a, times blue b--

56
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,090
almost there, I know this is
tedious-- times blue

57
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,990
b, plus yellow a.

58
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,170
Intuition doesn't
come easy, though.

59
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,710
Yellow a-- so we're on
this term-- yellow

60
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,930
a, green b, blue b.

61
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,110
So green b times blue b.

62
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,810
Now we're at yellow b-- the
good thing about the colors

63
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,630
is it's easy to keep
track of where we are.

64
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:46,980
Plus yellow b times
green a times blue b.

65
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,090
And then we're at the last one.

66
00:04:49,090 --> 00:05:01,830
Plus yellow b, green
b, times blue b.

67
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,070
So this is the expansion
of a plus b to the

68
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,890
third power, right?

69
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,190
We haven't simplified
it at all, and I did

70
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,870
that for a reason.

71
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,520
Because you see that every term
here-- what's happening here?

72
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,200
Every term has exactly
one-- it's 3 numbers

73
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,600
being multiplied, right?

74
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,210
Every term is 3 numbers
being multiplied.

75
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,110
And it's one of, you know, the
yellow number comes from the

76
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,770
first-- from this
yellow a plus b.

77
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,810
The green number-- the
middle number-- comes from

78
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,330
this middle a plus b.

79
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,210
And then the blue number comes
from this right hand a plus b.

80
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,080
And you saw me, I went all
the way through it, right?

81
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,340
So hopefully you
believe this point.

82
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,990
So let's think about it a
couple of different ways.

83
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,550
To generate each of these terms
in the expansion of a plus b to

84
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,360
the third, we're picking either
a or b from-- from the yellow a

85
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,880
plus b, we're picking
either a or b.

86
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,060
Right?

87
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,630
We picked an a here,
we picked an a here.

88
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,920
We picked a b here, a b here,
an a here, an a here, a b--.

89
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,140
And the group from the green
a plus b, we're picking

90
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,580
either an a or a b.

91
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,760
And then from the blue a
plus b, we're picking

92
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,090
either an a or a b.

93
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,890
Right?

94
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,450
So essentially the expansion,
if you think about it, this

95
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:22,950
expansion-- we've essentially
done every way of choosing

96
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,100
3 different things.

97
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,910
Every way of picking either
an a or a b, from these

98
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,130
3 different terms.

99
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,700
And that ends up with
these-- what is this?

100
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,140
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 terms.

101
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,640
Right?

102
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,990
Now let's make it a little
bit-- let's give you a

103
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,150
little bit more intuition
of what's going on.

104
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,640
And I think if you're starting
to realize why this is dealing

105
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,730
with permutations and
combinations, in particular.

106
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,410
Once we simplify
it, what happens?

107
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,990
This is a to the cubed, right?

108
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,130
That's the only a cubed term.

109
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,310
This is a squared b.

110
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,920
What are the other
a squared b terms?

111
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,440
Let's see, a squared b.

112
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,760
This is also a squared b.

113
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,860
So let me write down
all the a squared.

114
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,800
So let's see-- let's
see how many a squared

115
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,210
b terms there are.

116
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,670
I'll do it in a neutral color.

117
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,000
So this is a squared b.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,360
This is ba squared, but
that's also a squared b.

119
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,490
What's another a squared b?

120
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,810
This is also a squared b,
right? a times a times b.

121
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,460
So there was 3 ways
to get a squared b.

122
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,800
And that's why when we
eventually write the expansion,

123
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,230
it's going to-- we know that
the coefficient in front of it

124
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,840
is 3a squared b, right?

125
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,880
The coefficient on the a
squared b term, when we

126
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,620
actually multiply it out.

127
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,870
And we've done that several
times already, when we did the

128
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,360
binomial theorem, which we
took to the third power.

129
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,740
So where did this 3 come from,
and why is that the same thing

130
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,070
as when we learned the
definition of the

131
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,730
binomial theorem?

132
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,770
Why is, you know, does it just
happen to be the case that

133
00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:01,360
that's the same thing as 3
choose 2 times a squared b?

134
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,880
Well, no.

135
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,250
Think of it this way.

136
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,090
We already know that every
term here, every term in the

137
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,880
expansion, we're essentially
picking either an a or a b

138
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,970
from each of these, right?

139
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,500
We have to pick one term
from each of these.

140
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,720
So the way you could think of
it, for a squared b-- to get a

141
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,410
squared b-- we have to
essentially say, well,

142
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,040
how many combinations?

143
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,990
And that's the key word.

144
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,440
How many combinations are
there, where out of these

145
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,910
3 a plus b terms, I'm
choosing the a term?

146
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,920
I'm choosing 2 a terms.

147
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,590
Because to get a squared, I
have to pick an a term twice.

148
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,940
And so that's where I have
to pick 2 a terms out of

149
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,970
the three times I pick.

150
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,630
So I'm picking three times.

151
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,650
Two of the times, I'm
picking an a term.

152
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,050
So out of three times,
I'm choosing 2.

153
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,560
And that's where 3 choose
2 comes from, for the

154
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,880
a squared b term.

155
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,950
And so you could, for the ab
squared term, you could say,

156
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,100
well, I'm picking an a once.

157
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,780
How many ways are there to
choose a once when I'm

158
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,120
taking from 3 things?

159
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,130
So it could be 3 choose 1.

160
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,200
But that's also the same thing,
or should be equal to-- you

161
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,360
could also say, well, I'm
picking-- how many ways are

162
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,770
there to pick b twice if
I'm picking three times?

163
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,870
Well, if it's a b squared,
I'm picking b twice.

164
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,110
So that should be equal to
3 choose 2 ab squared.

165
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,960
And if you work these out, you
will find that, yes, these

166
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,790
both turn out to be 3.

167
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,480
And actually, that's why
there's some symmetry there,

168
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,330
and the combinations
all work out.

169
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,810
But hopefully, that's
giving you an intuition.

170
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,340
Essentially, when you're
doing the-- so the binomial

171
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,280
expansion of this--.

172
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,870
Let me just rewrite it again.

173
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,260
You know, this is a
plus b to the third.

174
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:59,150
It's 3 choose 0 of a cubed b to
the zero, plus 3 choose 1 of

175
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,530
a squared b to the
one, we could say.

176
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:14,860
Plus 3 choose 2 of ab squared,
plus 3 choose 3 of a

177
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,420
to the zero, b cubed.

178
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,350
So what's this saying?

179
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,710
What's 3 choose 3 saying?

180
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:26,180
How many ways-- if I'm choosing
from 3 different things-- how

181
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,670
many ways can I pick
exactly 3 b's?

182
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,490
That's how you can view it.

183
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,200
How many ways can I pick 3 b's?

184
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,750
I'm either picking
an a or a b, right?

185
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,660
You could say it's either a
heads or tails, or you know,

186
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,570
red or black or white,
but it's either a or b.

187
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,800
How many ways can I choose b
three times from 3 things?

188
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,990
Well, when you evaluate this,
you get this to b one,

189
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,830
and that makes sense.

190
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,710
Because it's 1b cubed.

191
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,090
And similarly, I mean, you
could view this as how many

192
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,260
ways, when I'm picking
out of 3 things, can

193
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,760
I pick exactly 0 b's?

194
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,670
That's 3 choose [? b. ?]

195
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,110
How many ways can I
pick exactly 0 b's?

196
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,780
Well, that's the same thing
as how many ways can

197
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,760
I pick exactly 3 a's?

198
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,480
This is also 1.

199
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,420
There's only 1 way to do it.

200
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,520
And that's the way.

201
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,710
Once again, there's only
1 way to do this one,

202
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,380
and this was the way.

203
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,220
There's 3 ways to
get a squared b.

204
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,980
There's 3 combinations.

205
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,260
There's 3 possible-- actually,
well, unique permutations.

206
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,610
But they're all the
same combination.

207
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,340
So there's 3 identical
combinations for picking 2 a's

208
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,490
and a b, and those are this
one, this one, and this one.

209
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,440
So hopefully, I
didn't confuse you.

210
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,830
And hopefully at minimum, that
gives you a glancing intuition

211
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,040
of why combinations are even
involved in the binomial

212
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,180
theorem, or whether they're
even involved when you're

213
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,400
expanding a binomial
to some power.

214
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,020
And at best, I really hope that
I've given you a deep intuition

215
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,430
for why this happens.

216
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,770
I will see you in
the next video.
