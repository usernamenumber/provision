1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,760
In the last video we saw that
it's not just an issue of one

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,440
bank failing.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,380
Because maybe one bank
does fail, some of

5
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,690
its loans come due.

6
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,530
In this case, Bank A
had some loans from

7
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,170
Bank B that come due.

8
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,770
It couldn't liquidate
these assets.

9
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,640
And then it couldn't liquidate
these CDOs for enough money to

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,660
pay for this loan.

11
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,780
So Bank A had to go
into bankruptcy.

12
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,230
Then we saw that could create
a whole chain of events.

13
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,750
Then this loan that Bank B had
made to Bank A, the one that

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,340
actually precipitated
the event, that had

15
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,200
to be written down.

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,440
Because then Bank A is going to
go into bankruptcy and you

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,740
don't know how much you're
going to get

18
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,820
back for that loan.

19
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,210
And of course, everybody who
had loans to Bank A, maybe

20
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,270
Bank D had loans to Bank A.

21
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,640
So maybe this asset right here
was also a loan to Bank A.

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,980
Everyone with loans to Bank A
all of a sudden gets afraid.

23
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,860
They might have to write
down their assets.

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,110
And now, on top of the CDO
problem that we were all

25
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,920
talking about, these smelly
assets that no one wants to

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,920
value correctly, on top of that
you have this issue of

27
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,420
these loans that I made to this
other bank, now all of a

28
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,050
sudden those are impaired
assets.

29
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,890
These are assets that probably
aren't worth what I

30
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,240
thought they were.

31
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,390
And so you have this
situation.

32
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,110
One, Bank A was the
last one to fall.

33
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,230
But maybe everyone starts
looking at Bank C next.

34
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,500
And it's usually reflected
in the stock price.

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,970
People start shorting the stock,
the stock go starts

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,820
going down.

37
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,170
And then Bank C has a situation
where it has some

38
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,560
loan to Bank F, it comes due.

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,800
And because its stock price is
going down, no one wants to

40
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,210
lend it money because they say
oh you're just another Bank A,

41
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,230
I'm not going to
lend you money.

42
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,590
No one wants to jump in and give
them equity, no sovereign

43
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,050
wealth fund.

44
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,620
Because you're just going to
go to zero, why would I buy

45
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,250
any stock for even $1 a share
when it's going to go to zero

46
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,550
because your liabilities are
greater than your equity.

47
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,270
So no one wants to
save them either.

48
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,750
And so now, you have this chain
reaction occurring, this

49
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,540
cascade of negative events.

50
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,830
All the banks are afraid to
lend to any other bank.

51
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,650
And you've probably read
articles that the Fed is

52
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,940
injecting liquidity.

53
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,810
What the Fed was doing was, they
were saying, OK, we'll

54
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,260
take some of these assets
that Bank C has.

55
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,490
We'll take them as collateral
and we'll lend you money.

56
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,460
And even if this was horrible
collateral, the Fed just got

57
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,500
very nervous and just started
lending money to anybody.

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,580
Anybody who was allowed to
borrow from the Fed.

59
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,050
And I don't know if you
remember, but the

60
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:23,750
Fed extended it.

61
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,280
Normally, it's just
commercial banks.

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,480
But at the beginning of the
credit crisis-- or actually

63
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,080
after the Bear Stearns collapse,
the Fed allowed

64
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,910
investment banks and other
people to start borrowing from

65
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,590
the Federal Reserve directly.

66
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,590
Normally, when the Federal
Reserve lends money to

67
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,100
someone, that person borrows
that money, keeps some of it,

68
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,670
and lends the rest
to someone else.

69
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,620
And so that money enters
the system.

70
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,420
And it allows the actual money
supply to increase.

71
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,250
But what's been happening now
is when banks use this money

72
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,720
to borrow from the Fed or to
borrow any money, they used

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,500
these assets as collateral,
they just sit

74
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,240
tight on that cash.

75
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,980
Because they're like, I don't
know what my assets are worth.

76
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,860
I don't know what other of my
assets are going to fail.

77
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,210
When these loans come
due that I owe, I

78
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,330
better have some cash.

79
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,120
Otherwise, I'm just going
to be another Bank A.

80
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,900
So people were borrowing from
the Fed, or borrowing in

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,730
general, but they weren't
lending out again.

82
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,310
So that money just kind of
went into a black hole.

83
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,880
So everyone was just sitting
tight on top of their money.

84
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,030
So what's the problem here?

85
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,600
Well clearly, one bank
failure can lead to

86
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,770
multiple bank failures.

87
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,280
Especially if no one's willing
to lend them more money.

88
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,980
So you can say, oh well the only
problem is all of these

89
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,180
banks just fail and who knows
the world might be

90
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,030
better off for that.

91
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,160
Because you won't have all
these people who frankly

92
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,540
aren't making anything.

93
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,280
Although, I don't want
to say that.

94
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,020
Because there is a use for the
financial services sector.

95
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,190
But to some degree a lot of what
happened in the last five

96
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,160
years, they weren't creating
value, they were just

97
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,950
leveraging up and increasing
the risk in the system.

98
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,420
But anyway, let's
put that aside.

99
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,060
So you might say, OK,
worst case, these

100
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,510
banks all go bankrupt.

101
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,820
They get restructured.

102
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,270
But they come back.

103
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,550
The only negative of that
will be that the current

104
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,180
shareholders lose
all their money.

105
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,720
But that's OK, no
risk no return.

106
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,440
There was risk.

107
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,640
And the risk was that your
stock goes to zero.

108
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,760
But then the banks will come
back with new equity.

109
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
And then they'll
be back in five

110
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,870
years under new ownership.

111
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,800
You might say that's OK.

112
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,280
What the problem is maybe all of
these banks, there's just a

113
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,160
cascade, they go under.

114
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,820
But not all of these loans
that they make out are to

115
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,180
other banks.

116
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,850
Some of these loans they make
out to the real economy, what

117
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,640
everyone is calling
Main Street now.

118
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,500
Some of these loans they're
making out are to a company

119
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,990
that makes tractors.

120
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,400
Or company maybe it's an
agricultural company that

121
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,650
needs loans to buy seeds for
the next year's crop.

122
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,040
So these are loans that are
actually funneled into the

123
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,790
real economy.

124
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,870
And if every bank is just
sitting on their money, then

125
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,190
these loans aren't going to be
made into the real economy.

126
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,040
Those real companies aren't
going to be able to make

127
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,650
investments, to buy seeds, or
to make a loan to build a

128
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,090
factory for a product that's
actually doing quite well.

129
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,080
And so everyone will
be starved off.

130
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,380
And we'll go into this
massive recession.

131
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,590
Because even though there is
good uses of capital, if you

132
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,700
were to give someone a loan,
they could use that loan to

133
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,210
actually create value by
planting seeds, or

134
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,640
by building a factory.

135
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,220
Those loans aren't available.

136
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,770
Those factories won't
get built.

137
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,510
Those seeds won't get planted.

138
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,130
The farmers will
lay off people.

139
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,340
The factories will
lay off people.

140
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,080
And you could imagine,
we'll go into this

141
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,750
economic down cycle.

142
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,560
So that's what Paulson and
the Federal Service

143
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,390
are concerned about.

144
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,070
Although, some people would
debate that they're more

145
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,250
concerned about the banks
than the real economy.

146
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,220
And they're just using the
real economy as kind of a

147
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,040
sideshow or the rationale.

148
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,750
So what are they arguing
that they want to do?

149
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,930
Well they said the crux of this
issue is, if these $2

150
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,090
billion in CDOs, whatever the
CDOs at any of the banks are

151
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,200
holding, if only the people
could realize the value.

152
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,570
If only this $2 billion that
they have on their books could

153
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,230
be turned into $2 billion
of cash, this

154
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,410
wouldn't be a problem.

155
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,180
Because when these loans come
due, if you believe this $2

156
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,520
billion, then all of these banks
have positive net worth.

157
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,780
They all have positive equity.

158
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,110
And then this whole chain
reaction won't happen.

159
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,350
So when the bailout plan first
came out and they said we'll

160
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,340
create this $700 billion
fund to buy some

161
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,830
of these toxic assets.

162
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,500
and at first they said we'll
buy them at a discount and

163
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,070
we'll hold them to maturity
and then we

164
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,010
might even make a profit.

165
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,250
I said, well that might sound
good, but how's that going to

166
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,040
solve this situation?

167
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,260
Because if you were to go to
this bank and buy the CDOs,

168
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,920
you'd be an idiot to pay $2
billion for them if the market

169
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,390
is only giving, instead
of $2 billion, only

170
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,720
$100 million for them.

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,960
Why would you pay $2 billion?

172
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,270
In fact, these $2 billion are
actually based on assumptions

173
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,350
from 2006 when housing prices
can't go down and everyone was

174
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,590
paying off their mortgages.

175
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,880
And everything was rosy.

176
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,120
Those are maybe the assumptions
that drove this $2

177
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,200
billion price.

178
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,710
So if you paid $2 billion for
this asset, sure, you would

179
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,990
save Bank C.

180
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,030
But you would essentially be
buying something that's worth

181
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,660
a lot less.

182
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,970
And even if you held it to
maturity, you're not going to

183
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,600
ever see a present value
of $2 billion.

184
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,280
So when I first read the bailout
proposal, I said

185
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,310
they're going to pay some
discount on that, but that's

186
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,550
not going to help
the situation.

187
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,510
Because let's say these
are only worth

188
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,730
$0.10 on the dollar.

189
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,620
If they paid 10%
of $2 billion.

190
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,530
If the the Fed came in and paid
$200 million for this.

191
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,840
And it's not even clear that
it's worth $200 million, maybe

192
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,620
the market is only willing
to pay $100 million.

193
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,490
But let's say the Fed comes in
and pays $200 million for it.

194
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,700
They would have to mark this
down to $200 million.

195
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,200
So that's $1.8 billion
writeoff.

196
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,910
Something that was worth
$2 billion is

197
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,780
now worth $200 million.

198
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,280
So if you write out $1.8
billion, then you're going to

199
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,610
have minus $800 million
of equity.

200
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,590
Or $0.8 billion of equity.

201
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,970
And then you would still
go bankrupt.

202
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,860
In fact, it would just
force the issue.

203
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,520
If the Fed were to go in and
buy at what they're calling

204
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,250
now fire sale prices,
but it's actually

205
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,470
probably an accurate price.

206
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,470
Even if they were to buy
slightly above that, but still

207
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,680
at a discount, it would
force this bank to

208
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,970
write down this asset.

209
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,890
It might have to then realize
negative equity.

210
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,930
And it would still create this
whole chain of events.

211
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,050
And so this is what the
Fed actually said.

212
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,670
They actually said no we
don't want to buy it

213
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,920
at fire sale prices.

214
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,210
   

215
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,700
I think Bernanke's exact words
were that, we're not going to

216
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,900
buy at fire sale prices, we're
going to buy at hold to

217
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,200
maturity prices.

218
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,980
So to me, what the Fed is
saying, we're going to pay

219
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,680
enough money for these assets so
that these banks still have

220
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,740
positive equity.

221
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,555
And so the these banks can still
pay off any liabilities

222
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:50,010
that come due.

223
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,000
Well you might say, well hey
Sal, that's not a bad idea.

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,370
And I say, that's
a horrible idea.

225
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,470
Because if these are really
worth $100 million, and you're

226
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,440
paying $2 billion for it, you're
essentially writing a

227
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,420
government check,
$1.9 billion.

228
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,740
Let's say this is really
worth minus $0.8.

229
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,000
   

230
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,610
Let's say that they're
really worth zero,

231
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,490
just to simplify things.

232
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,240
Let's say these are actually
worth zero and the government

233
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,150
pays $2 billion for it.

234
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,150
The government is essentially
writing a $2 billion check to

235
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,250
the equity holders
of this company.

236
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,540
The real equity is worth
minus $1 billion.

237
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,880
But the government is going to
essentially write them a $2

238
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,150
billion check so they can get
their billion dollars back.

239
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,330
And it's also going to benefit
the bond holders.

240
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,160
Because if this is worth zero,
not only will these guys get

241
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,980
wiped out, but then these guys
are only going to be able to

242
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,190
capture back some of
these $3 billion.

243
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,000
So these liabilities are going
to be written down.

244
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,800
These guys that are owed $4
billion are only going to be

245
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,230
able get $3 billion back.

246
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,560
So if the government were to pay
$2 billion for this, it's

247
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,700
essentially writing a $1
billion check to the

248
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,110
shareholders and a $1 billion
check to the bond holders or

249
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,880
the people who lent this
company money.

250
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,080
And essentially, those are
the worst people to be

251
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,870
writing a check to.

252
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,350
Because these are the people
who essentially lent money

253
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,630
that shouldn't have been lent.

254
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,020
These are people
who took risk.

255
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,650
They took all the reward over
the last five years and now

256
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,960
when the risk hits, the
government is essentially

257
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,680
having welfare for the
private sector.

258
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,000
So that in my mind is
the worst idea.

259
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,500
The government is arguing, I
know it's bad, and these are

260
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,310
the people we don't want to
reward, but by doing this, we

261
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,390
save the real economy.

262
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,690
Because by doing this,
we prevent this

263
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,990
cascade from happening.

264
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,590
And hopefully, these banks will
still lend to the farmer

265
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:43,200
and still lend to the the guy
who wants to build a factory.

266
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,140
In the next video I want to show
you one, why that might

267
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,000
not be the case.

268
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,250
That even if they were to do
this, as much as I disagree

269
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,010
with it, if it worked
maybe it's worth it.

270
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,230
But one, I'll argue that
it probably won't work.

271
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,950
And two, there are better
ways to do this.

272
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,470
More equitable, more fair
ways to do this.

273
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,780
And we'll show you that
in the next video.

274
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:04,900
