99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Okay so this is our microcontroller board, and let me move the plug here

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
see if I can take some of these plugs out,

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the power comes into this board through these 2 plugs here

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
flows to this socket here and this socket here,

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and there are a number of different components and chips on this

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
board, we're gonna talk about each of them, and sorta what they do

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, in full disclousure, there's certain components I'm not 100% sure

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what this chip does, but I think I know

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we'll go through that and make the best guess that we can.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this I belive is an EE prom, which is an erasable

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
memory chip that's electrically erasable

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
programmable, memoroy chip that stores an

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
indefeninte index of commands for this board, even when the power's

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
shut off. So this chip right here, which is the central processing unit

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
chip and controlls all the functions of this board

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as well as the functions of the entire unit, this chip

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can go and pull indexed commands from this as

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you know, it acts as it's memory

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this is the clock chip, so this one has a little

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
quartz crystal in it, and when quartz, quartz has a

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
an interesting property, when it is squeezed, it can emit a

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
small electrical signal, or when electricity is run to it

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it expands slightly. and because of that its very consistent

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the way that it responds to electricity, and very consistent in

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the way that it expands, and so because of that property

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there able to run electricity to it, and get it to expand, and get a return volt

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
voltage and they can determine

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this device can allow the chips to determine

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
very precise timing. it's the same type of timing that's inside

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of a quartz wristwatch. but anyway

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it allows this board to synchronize itself which is really

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
important when your reading a lot of data from a disk

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you have to make sure the 1s and 0s end up in the right place

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and everything happens in synch, and thats very important there

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as i said before this is the central processing chip that controlls the board

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the functions on the board. i believe this chip is the

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
video and audio processing chip

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so once the data comes in, it's routed through the CPU to this and

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
processed and converted into a signal that your tv

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and stereo will understand. i believe this chip is an aup amp

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
chip will op - basically stands for operational amp

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lifier, and whill boost the signal coming out of this chip

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this signal may be very weak, and in order to travel down

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the chords to go to your tv and stereo you need to boost the signal

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
increase the voltage and thats what this guy can do. this chip

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right here is a motor controller. and so what it does is it controlls the direction

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and speed of the motors, and it does this in a very precise way.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
works with the cpu to make sure the motors are moving in the right direction

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and at the right speed
