1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,390
We're told to graph this
system of equations and

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,040
identify the number of solutions
that it has.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,650
And they have the system
of equations here.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,480
So they want us to graph each of
these equations and think a

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,260
little bit about
the solutions.

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,560
So the first equation here--
I'll rewrite it, so I'll graph

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,790
it in the same color
that I write it.

9
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,000
This first equation's already in
slope-intercept form, y is

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,930
equal to 3x plus 1.

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,120
We see that the slope, or m, is
equal to 3, and we see that

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,720
the y-intercept here
is equal to 1.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,180
So let me be clear, that
is also the slope.

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,590
I just called it m because a lot
of times people say y is

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,850
equal to mx plus b.

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,950
So we can graph it.

17
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,740
We can look at its y-intercept,
the point 0, 1

18
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,000
must be on this graph.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,620
So that's the point
0, 1 right there.

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,640
This is the y-axis, that
is the x-axis.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,380
And the slope is 3.

22
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,170
That means if we move 1 in the
positive x-direction, we're

23
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,785
going to move up 3 in the
positive y-direction.

24
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:03,310
So we move 1 in the x-direction,
we move up 3.

25
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,200
If we moved 2 in the
x-direction, we

26
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,450
would move up 6.

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,210
   

28
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:09,920
Just like that.

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,640
Because 6 over 2 is still 3.

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,200
Likewise, if we moved down 1, if
we went negative 1 in x, we

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,100
would go negative 3 in y.

32
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,700
So negative 1, negative 3.

33
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,760
Because negative 3 divided
by negative 1 is still 3.

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,950
If we went negative 2 in x, we
would go negative 6-- 1, 2, 3,

35
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,770
4, 5, 6 in y.

36
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,140
So these are all points along
the line, and I can connect

37
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,920
the dots now.

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,180
So let me do that.

39
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,520
So let me connect the dots
as best as I can.

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,030
This should be a line,
not a curve.

41
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,050
My hand isn't 100% steady, but I
think you get-- let me do it

42
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,960
a little bit better than that.

43
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,160
I think I can do a better
job than that.

44
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,950
Let me draw-- that's
even worse.

45
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,350
All right.

46
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,565
Last attempt.

47
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:56,130
That's throwing me off.

48
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,645
So last attempt right here.

49
00:01:57,645 --> 00:02:01,540
   

50
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,450
There you go.

51
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,000
So that's that first line
right there. y is

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,480
equal to 3x plus 1.

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,650
So let me do the
second one now.

54
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:13,630
So it's written in standard form
right now, 2y plus 4 is

55
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,560
equal to 6x.

56
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,110
We want to get this in
slope-intercept form, y is

57
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,950
equal to mx plus b.

58
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,070
So a good place to start could
be to subtract this 4 from

59
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,630
both sides.

60
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,710
So it goes on the other side.

61
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,350
So let's subtract 4 from both
sides of this equation.

62
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,110
The left-hand side, we're left
with just a 2y, and then the

63
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,310
right-hand side becomes
6x minus 4.

64
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,780
So 2y is equal to 6x minus 4.

65
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,800
And then to get everything in
terms to solve for y, we just

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,760
have to divide everything
by 2.

67
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,980
So let's divide everything
by 2, and we get y is

68
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,830
equal to 3x minus 2.

69
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,290
So that's the second equation
in slope-intercept form.

70
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,350
So same drill here.

71
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,650
The y-intercept is negative 2.

72
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,100
So we go-- that's negative 1,
negative 2 right there, and

73
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,360
its slope is 3.

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,450
And notice its slope is the
same as the other line.

75
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,530
So it's going to have the
same inclination.

76
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,970
If we move 1 in the x-direction,
we move up 3 in

77
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,450
the y-direction.

78
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,610
1, up 3.

79
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,060
Just like that.

80
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,630
If we go back 1 in
x, we go down 3.

81
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,240
Back 1 in x, we go down 3.

82
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,660
Just like that.

83
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,980
So if we connect the dots
here, it'll look

84
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,940
something like this.

85
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,820
I'll do my best to draw
a straight line.

86
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,530
So the second graph, 2y plus
4 equals 6, we put it into

87
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,660
slope-intercept form
and we graphed it.

88
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,060
Now, the whole point of this
question was to identify the

89
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,820
number of solutions that
it has, the system.

90
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,660
A solution to a system of
equations is an x and y value

91
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,790
that satisfy both of
these equations.

92
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,860
Now, if there were such an x
and y value that satisfied

93
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,630
both of these equations, then
that x and y value would have

94
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,820
to lie on both of
these graphs.

95
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,800
Because this blue line is all of
the pairs of x and y's that

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,690
satisfy the first equation.

97
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,050
The red line is all of the
pairs of x's and y's that

98
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,480
satisfy the second equation.

99
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,390
So if something's going to
satisfy both, it's got to be

100
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,810
on both lines.

101
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,610
When you look here, are
there any points

102
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,710
that are on both lines?

103
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,130
Well, no.

104
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,560
These two lines never
intersect.

105
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,210
A point of intersection is a
point that is common to both

106
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,260
of these lines.

107
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,050
No, they don't intersect.

108
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,300
No intersection.

109
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,480
   

110
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,700
So there is not a solution to
this system of equations.

111
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,520
There is no solution.

112
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,320
We know that because these two
lines don't intersect.

113
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,790
And you didn't even
have to graph it.

114
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,370
The kind of giveaway was that
these are two different lines.

115
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,230
They have different
y-intercepts, but their slopes

116
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,410
are identical.

117
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,650
So if you have two different
y-intercepts and your slopes

118
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,140
are identical, then you have two
different lines that will

119
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
never intersect.

120
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,860
And if they represent a system,
or if they're the

121
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,790
graphs of a system of
equations, that

122
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,880
system has no solution.

123
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,733
