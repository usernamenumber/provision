1
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:06,962
This is a mummy of a young man named Herakleides.

2
00:00:07,331 --> 00:00:12,475
He died in Egypt in the first century A.D. when he was about 20 years old.

3
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:20,162
Mummification was developed by the ancient Egyptians to preserve the body for the afterlife.

4
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:26,817
Typically, all internal organs were removed before mummification, with the exception of the heart,

5
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:32,610
but in this case the heart was removed and the lungs were left intact.

6
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:45,076
Next the body was covered with salt and left for about 40 days until all moisture was eliminated.

7
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:55,977
Perfumed oils and plant resins were rubbed on the body.

8
00:00:58,836 --> 00:01:06,008
Thick layers of resin were applied to glue the strips of linen that were wrapped around the body.

9
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:16,476
The mummy was placed on a wooden board, and more wrappings bound them together.

10
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:27,296
A mysterious pouch, perhaps of religious significance, was placed on the chest.

11
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:36,705
A mummified Ibis, a wading bird with a slender, down-curved bill, was placed on the abdomen.

12
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:41,198
Ibis mummies commonly served as votive offerings to the gods,

13
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:47,645
but this is an unusual case of a bird being mummified with a deceased human.

14
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:51,972
Long linen strips further secured the wrappings.

15
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:55,863
A portrait panel of Herakleides was placed over the face.

16
00:01:55,863 --> 00:02:00,441
A large linen cloth was wrapped around the mummy.

17
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,821
The shroud was painted red with an imported lead-based pigment.

18
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:13,254
This treatment is rare. Very few red-shroud mummies are known to exist.

19
00:02:13,254 --> 00:02:20,589
Egyptian symbols of protection and rebirth were painted on the outer cloth with pigments and gold.

20
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:25,210
Finally, Herakleides' name was written in Greek at the feet.

21
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:34,055
Thanks to this remarkable mummification process, Herakleides' body is with us today.
