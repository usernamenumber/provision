1
00:00:00,505 --> 00:00:03,338
We have three different addition problems right over here...

2
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:08,672
and what I want you to do (so you get the hang of things), is to pause the video and try them on your own.

3
00:00:08,672 --> 00:00:15,154
But as you do them, I want you to really keep in mind and think about what the carrying actually means.

4
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:20,469
So I assume you've tried on your own, 
Now I'll work through them with you.

5
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:30,849
So we have 9 plus 6. 9 ones plus 6 ones. Well 9 plus 6 is 15. Well, we can write the 5 in the ones place, and carry the one.

6
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:33,349
But what did we just do? W.hat does this "1" represent?

7
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:36,535
Well, we put it in the "tens" place... one 10 represents 10..

8
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:44,869
So all we've said is that 9 plus 6 is equal to 10 plus 5. Is equal to one 10 plus 5, which is equal to 15..

9
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:49,869
Now, in the "tens" place... we have 1 plus 0 plus 9... which is 10..

10
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:53,422
So we can write 0 and carry the 1..

11
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:56,088
1 plus 0 plus 9 is 10..

12
00:00:56,088 --> 00:00:57,936
Now... what does that really mean?

13
00:00:57,936 --> 00:01:04,868
Well... this is one 10 plus zero 10s plus nine 10s... which is ten 10s. Ten 10s is 100.

14
00:01:04,868 --> 00:01:11,870
Or another way of thinking about 100, it's one hundred, and zero 10s, so that's all that carrying represents.

15
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:17,178
So now we have a 1, plus a 7, plus a 9. That is going to be 17.

16
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:25,422
Now, we have to remind ourselves: this is in the hundreds place. This is actually 1 hundred, plus 7 hundred, plus 9 hundred, or 17 hundred.

17
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:32,005
Or 1 thousand, 7 hundred. And of course we have this 5 here... and we are done.

18
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:42,505
Now let's try to tackle this one. Now the reason why I wrote it that way is to make sure that we remind ourselves to align the proper places under the appropriate places.

19
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:57,422
So this we rewrite as (let me use that same green color) 373 plus... we want to write the ones under the ones place, and the tens place under the tens place,

20
00:01:57,422 --> 00:02:00,922
so that we're adding the appropriate values.

21
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:07,838
So 3 plus 8 is 11. The 1 in the ones place, and the 1 in the tens place. 10 plus 1 is 11.

22
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:15,536
1 plus 7 is 8. 8 plus 8 is 16. This is actually 16 tens. So let's write down the 16...

23
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:21,069
What is 16 tens? Well, that's 160! So then this 6 is the sixty, and then I have 100.

24
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:25,422
1 plus 3 is 4. But these are actually hundreds, so it's 4 hundreds.

25
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:27,755
So we get 461.

26
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:36,870
Now finally, 9 plus 3 is 12. 2 ones, and 1 ten. 12 is the same thing as 10 plus 2.

27
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:44,755
Now in the tens place... 1 plus 4 plus 9 is 14. So we write the 4, and carry the one.

28
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:53,537
But remind ourselves this is actually 10 plus 40 plus 90... which is 140. Which is the same thing as 40 plus 100.

29
00:02:53,537 --> 00:03:01,936
And then 1 plus 1 plus 2 is 4. But this is the hundreds place. So this is actually 1 hundred, plus 1 hundred, plus 2 hundred... or 4 hundred.

30
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:04,000
And we're done.
