1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,090
   

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,300
We've dealt with the weak acid,
so let's try an example

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,340
with the weak base.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,590
Let's say we had ammonia.

5
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,730
   

6
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,350
That's nitrogen with
three hydrogens.

7
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,370
And it's a weak base because
it likes to accept hydrogen

8
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,750
from water, leaving the water
with just a hydroxide.

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,190
So it increases the hydroxide
concentration.

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,940
So if you have some ammonia
in an aqueous

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,150
solution, plus water.

12
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,430
I'll throw the water in there.

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:35,470
Plus water in an aqueous
solution.

14
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,940
It's a weak base.

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,530
So this reaction doesn't go
in just one direction.

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,890
It's an equilibrium reaction.

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,670
   

18
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,980
And since this is a weak base,
it-- and this is where the

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,140
Bronsted-Lowry definition
really kind of pops out.

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,040
Is that it's a proton acceptor
instead of a donor.

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,960
So it turns into ammonium,
or an ammonia cation.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,970
Ammonium has another hydrogen
on it, so now

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,915
it has another proton.

24
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:11,195
So it's the plus charge.

25
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:12,450
An it's an aqueous.

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,250
And it took that hydrogen
from the water.

27
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,050
So plus OH minus aqueous.

28
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,430
And remember, if you look at
it from the Bronsted-Lowry

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,110
definition , it was
a proton acceptor.

30
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,600
So that made it a base.

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,210
Or if you look at the Arrhenius
definition, it

32
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,010
increased the concentration of
OH in the solution, so that

33
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,860
makes it an Arrhenius base.

34
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,060
But anyway, given that
we have-- let me

35
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,970
pick a random number.

36
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:48,890
Let's say we have 0.2
molar of NH3.

37
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,950
What is going to be the pH?

38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,710
So what's going to be our pH of
the solution, considering

39
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,260
that it's 0.2 molar of NH3.

40
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,350
So the first thing
we need to do.

41
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,930
We need to figure out the
equilibrium constant for this

42
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,220
base reaction.

43
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:10,820
And I just went to Wikipedia--
I wanted to say liquidpedia,

44
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,370
I'm talking about
liquids so much.

45
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,130
And equilibrium.

46
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,170
Equipedia.

47
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,070
But I went to Wikipedia, and
they have a little chart for

48
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,630
almost any compound
you look for.

49
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,880
And they give you pKb.

50
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,120
   

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,760
Which is, you see
that p there.

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,090
That just means it's the
minus log base 10 of

53
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,565
the equilibrium constant.

54
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:38,870
   

55
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,700
And they give that
as being 4.75.

56
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,330
So we can just do a little bit
of math here to solve for the

57
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,000
equilibrium constant.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,620
So let's see.

59
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,220
If we multiply both sides by
negative, you get log base 10

60
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,460
of our equilibrium constant
for this base reaction.

61
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,570
That's why the b is there.

62
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,030
Is equal to minus 4.75,
or 10 to the minus

63
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,400
4.75 should be Kb.

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,540
So Kb is equal to 10
to the minus 4.75.

65
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,040
That's not an easy exponent to
figure out in your head, so

66
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,530
I'll bring out the calculator
for that.

67
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:27,850
So if we take 10 to the 4.75
minus, it equals, let's just

68
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,460
say 1.8 times 10 to
the negative 5.

69
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:37,320
This is equal to 1.8 times
10 to the minus 5.

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,090
So now we can use this
information and we can do a

71
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,260
mathematical thing very
similar to we

72
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,010
did in the last video.

73
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,480
It's going to be hard to
figure out the hydrogen

74
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,760
concentration directly, right?

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,520
Because our equilibrium reaction
only has hydroxide.

76
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,500
But if we know the hydroxide
concentration, then we can

77
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,770
back into the hydrogen
concentration, knowing that

78
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,510
this plus the hydrogen
concentration has to equal 10

79
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,440
to the minus 14.

80
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,620
Or if you figure out the pOH,
that plus the pH has to be 14.

81
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,000
And we did that a couple
of videos ago.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,060
So this equilibrium constant
or this formula

83
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,880
would look like this.

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:24,940
1.8 times 10 to the minus 5
will be equal to-- in the

85
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,880
denominator, we have our
concentration of reactants.

86
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,060
And remember, you don't
include the solvent.

87
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,980
So you only include the NH3.

88
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,480
We have 0.2 molars is what we
put in, but some of it, let's

89
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,980
say X of it, is going to be
converted into this stuff on

90
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,670
the right-hand side.

91
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,380
So in the denominator, we're
going to have 0.2 minus

92
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,870
whatever gets converted into
the right-hand side.

93
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,510
And so then in the right-hand
side, we're going to have x of

94
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,470
NH4 and x of OH.

95
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,300
   

96
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,140
This is the concentration
of ammonia.

97
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,300
And then we have x times x.

98
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,830
This is the concentration of
NH4 plus-- that's a 4.

99
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,320
And then this is the
concentration,

100
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,330
right here, of OH minus.

101
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:15,870
Right?

102
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,860
And we just solve for x.

103
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,850
Let's do that.

104
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,080
Solve for x.

105
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,390
And once we have x, we know
the concentration of OH.

106
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,310
We'll be able to figure out
the pOH, and then we'll be

107
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,900
able to figure out the pH.

108
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,750
OK.

109
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,300
Multiply this times both
sides of this equation.

110
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,060
And just so you know, that same
simplification step that

111
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,380
we did in the previous thing.

112
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:44,260
When this is several orders of
magnitude smaller than this

113
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,830
number right here-- I want to
give you-- heuristics are just

114
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,290
kind of rules of thumb
that sometimes work.

115
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,170
Let's just do the quadratic
equation.

116
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,150
But you can kind of think about
sometimes when you can

117
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,000
get rid of that middle term.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,760
But let's just multiply it.

119
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,450
0.2 two times 1.8 is 0.36.

120
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,980
0.36 times 10 to the
minus 5, right?

121
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,650
2 times 1.8 would be
3.6, this is 0.36.

122
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:20,660
Minus 1.8 times 10 to the
minus 5 x, right?

123
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,942
Is equal to that.

124
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:24,900
x squared.

125
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,260
Let's put everything on the
same side of the equation.

126
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,220
I'm going to move all of these
the right-hand side, so you

127
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,090
get 0 is equal to x squared.

128
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,990
Add this to both sides
of the equation.

129
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:44,520
Plus 1.8 times 10 to
the minus 5 x.

130
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,870
1.8 times 10 to the minus 5.

131
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,940
Just so you can see the
coefficients separate from the

132
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,010
x terms.

133
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:59,860
Minus 0.36 times 10
to the minus 5.

134
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,990
So let's solve this.

135
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,610
And once again, if you wanted
to kind of do it, you could

136
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,720
eliminate this term and then
just figure out the straight

137
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,540
up square root.

138
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,360
But we won't do that.

139
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,890
We'll actually use a
quadratic equation.

140
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,610
So a is 1.

141
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,950
b is this.

142
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,530
That's b.

143
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,200
And this is c.

144
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,340
And you just supply than in
the quadratic equation.

145
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,500
So you get minus b.

146
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,230
So you minus 1.8 times 10
to the minus 5 power.

147
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,060
Plus or minus.

148
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,790
We'll only have to do the plus
because if we do the minus,

149
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,250
we'll end up with a negative
concentration.

150
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,440
So plus, the square root-- we
have to do a lot of math

151
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,970
here-- b squared.

152
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,220
So it's 1.8 times 10
to the negative 5.

153
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,550
So it's 1.8.

154
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,210
If you square it, it's 3.24.

155
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:51,150
So it's 3.24 times-- if you
square 10 to the minus 5-- 10

156
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,630
to the minus 10 minus 4
times a, which is 1,

157
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,380
times c, which is minus.

158
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,860
So it's 4 times-- the minuses
cancel out-- times 0.36 times

159
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,220
10 to the minus 5.

160
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:20,140
Which is 4 times 0.36
is equal to 1.44.

161
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,435
I should have been able
to do that in my head.

162
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:25,440
Now you have 1.44 e minus 5.

163
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,120
Times 10 to-- let
me write that.

164
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,549
So this is 1.44.

165
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,260
And of course all of
this is over 2a.

166
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,390
So let's see.

167
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,789
This is my x value.

168
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,860
My concentration of OH.

169
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,350
So let's see.

170
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:51,380
I have 3.24 times 10
to the minus 10.

171
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,020
That's that.

172
00:08:53,020 --> 00:09:03,870
Plus 1.44 times 10 to the minus
5 is equal to that.

173
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,530
So that's this whole thing
under the radical.

174
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,180
And I want to take the
square root of that.

175
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,520
And so that is to
the 0.5 power.

176
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,680
So I get 0.00379.

177
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,590
So I'll switch colors.

178
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:25,820
So I get x is equal to a minus
1.8 times 10 to the minus 5

179
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:33,320
plus 0.003794.

180
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,660
All of that over 2.

181
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,330
Do the math.

182
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:42,660
So to that I'm going to subtract
minus this point

183
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,060
right here.

184
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,750
I have this value.

185
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,990
I'm just subtracting this.

186
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:53,770
Minus 1.8 e 5 negative
is equal to that.

187
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,750
This is the whole numerator.

188
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,470
And now I need to just
divide it by 2.

189
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:03,680
Divided by 2 is equal
to 0.001.

190
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,430
Let me write that.

191
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,910
So x.

192
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,140
So I'll switch colors
arbitrarily again.

193
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:18,480
x is equal to 0.001888-- I mean,
then there's a 3 and so

194
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,690
forth and so on.

195
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,740
But if you remember from
our original equation.

196
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,490
What was x?

197
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,760
It was what's both the ammonium
concentration and the

198
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,855
hydroxide concentration.

199
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:30,530
We care about the hydroxide
concentration.

200
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:36,060
So this is equal to my
concentration of hydroxide.

201
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,580
Now if I want to figure out my
pOH, I just take the minus log

202
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,610
of this number, which
is equal to--

203
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,830
So let's just take
the log of it.

204
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,180
The log is that, and then I
take the minus of that.

205
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:55,180
So it's 2.72.

206
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,420
And now if we want to figure out
the pH, my concentration

207
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,370
of hydrogen ions-- just
remember, when you're in an

208
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:10,740
aqueous solution at 25 degrees
Celsius, your pK of water is

209
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,870
equal to your pOH
plus your pH.

210
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,730
This at 25 degrees is 14.

211
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,815
Because you have 10 to the minus
14 molar concentration--

212
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,580
well no, actually, I don't
want to go into that.

213
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,720
You have 10 to the minus
7 of each of these.

214
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,510
But anyway, this is equilibrium
constant for the

215
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,310
disassociation of water.

216
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:37,170
This, when water's neutral is 7
or a concentration of OH of

217
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,280
10 to the minus 7.

218
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,760
We can take the minus
log, this becomes 7.

219
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,070
But now we know we have a much
higher concentration of OH.

220
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,080
2.72.

221
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,550
Remember, that minus log
kind of flips it.

222
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,670
So a lower pOH means a higher
concentration of pOH.

223
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,230
Right?

224
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,200
And a lower pOH, if this
is lower, right?

225
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
This is a lower pOH.

226
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,290
That means your pH is higher.

227
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,570
   

228
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,870
So what is your pH
going to be?

229
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:15,024
So your pH is going to be
equal to 14 minus 2.72.

230
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:21,710
So let me do the minus
plus 14 is equal to--

231
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,570
let's just say 11.3.

232
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,650
So your pH is equal to 11.3.

233
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,850
Which makes sense, because we
said this was a weak base.

234
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,680
Ammonia is a weak base.

235
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,070
So it's basic.

236
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,120
So it should increase your
pH above the neutral 7.

237
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,805
So the pH should be greater than
7, but as you compare it

238
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,280
to some of the strong bases
before that took our pH when

239
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,410
you added a molar to 14, this
took our pH-- although we only

240
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:54,010
did add 0.2 molar
of it to 11.3.

241
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,970
Anyway, this is more of a math
problem than chemistry, but

242
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,800
hopefully it clarified
a few things as well.
