1
00:00:00,376 --> 00:00:05,440
When people use the terms 'fascism' or 'fascist' today,

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,810
they're usually using it in a derogatory way

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,440
to refer to a group, a regime, or even an individual

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,940
that is overly aggressive -- and controlling -- and totalitarian.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,631
But its roots

6
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:21,164
actually lie with Benito Mussolini,

7
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:25,769
who was in power in Italy during the 1920s and 1930s,

8
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,359
and through World War II.

9
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,160
And they proudly called themselves the 'fascists,'

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,770
and their ideology as 'fascism.'

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,670
And the word 'fasc...,' -- or the root of

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,530
'fascist' and 'fascism,' come from

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,790
the Italian word 'fascio,' which literally refers to a bundle.

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,750
It comes out of this idea that a bundle of things

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,450
will be stronger together than individually.

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,860
And this is actually the symbol for fascism.

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,449
And this symbol of this bundle - this sheath - of sticks,

18
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,570
this actually predates Mussolini by thousands of years.

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,180
It goes back to Roman times, and even,

20
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,350
based on some of the things I've read,

21
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,000
even predates Roman times, as a symbol of unity,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,700
a symbol of official strength.

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,170
And even before Mussolini came around,

24
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,259
the term was used by many, many, many groups

25
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,270
that viewed themselves as a league of revolutionaries --

26
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,570
a group of people somehow fighting for change.

27
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,869
And Mussolini was no different, when in -- at the end of 1914,

28
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,479
and then early in 1915, he establishes

29
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,030
the 'Fasci d'Azione Revoluzionaria.'

30
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,130
And I'm once again so sorry

31
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,649
for my butchering of an Italian word.

32
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,785
But this literally translates to 'Group Action Revolutionary,'

33
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:53,470
or you could say the 'Revolutionary Action Group,'

34
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,994
founded by Mussolini in 1915.

35
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:59,280
And it was really a splinter of the Socialist party.

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,820
And there's an irony there, because Mussolini --

37
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,119
and fascism in particular -- is associated

38
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:08,316
with strongly anti-socialist ideology.

39
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:09,879
But as we enter into --

40
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:16,892
or as Europe was entering into World War I, in 1914,

41
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:20,599
in 1914, some of the social or the mainstream of the Italian Socialist Party

42
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,200
was against Italy entering the war.

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,870
They wanted Italy to maintain their neutrality.

44
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,045
But you had splinter groups, more nationalist groups,

45
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:30,970
that said, "Hey, look! This is Italy's chance

46
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,633
to claim what's its right.

47
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:37,031
It should join the war on the side of the Entente."

48
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,975
And Mussolini was one of these individuals.

49
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:43,577
And because of his strong pro-war stance,

50
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:45,980
he was actually kicked out of his --

51
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,709
he was head of a socialist paper, in 1914.

52
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,599
And then he, eventually, by 1915 establishes

53
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,686
the 'Fasci d'Azione Revoluzionaria.'

54
00:02:58,686 --> 00:03:00,260
And by the end of World War I,

55
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,110
as we get into 1919, it regroups

56
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,750
under the name 'Fasci Italiani di Combattimento'

57
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,580
So this literally translates as --

58
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,099
You could view 'fasci' as a group or league,

59
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,720
or a 'Revolutionary League of Italians of Combatants,'

60
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,700
or the 'Combatant Italian Revolutionary Group,'

61
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,822
I guess is one way to think about it.

62
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:24,416
Or the 'Italian' ... 'The Group of Italian Combatants '

63
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,488
is another way to think about.

64
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:31,310
And their ideology wasn't well-established,

65
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,040
right when they set up.

66
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,044
It was just really around this idea

67
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:37,295
of being super pro-nationalist.

68
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:38,631
But it began to develop

69
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:42,164
over the course of the 20s and 1930s.

70
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:44,459
The core idea -- and I've already said it multiple times --

71
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,678
is kind of an extreme 'nationalism.'

72
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:51,860
And when we talk about extreme nationalism,

73
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,120
or nationalism in general,

74
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,540
it's talking about the interests of one nation,

75
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,730
of one group, above all others --

76
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,886
about putting the state above all other things.

77
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:07,190
Often times, fascism is viewed as a right-wing group,

78
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,760
but, in its purest form, it's neither left- or right-wing.

79
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,159
At the left end of the spectrum,

80
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,349
you could imagine communist or socialism.

81
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:16,320
I'll write communism,

82
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,159
which you can view as an extreme form of socialism.

83
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,009
And at the extreme right,

84
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,880
you can imagine just complete free market --

85
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,350
complete unfettered free market -- ultra ultra small government.

86
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,570
And fascists and extreme nationalists,

87
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,570
they didn't view themselves

88
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,190
as either end of this spectrum -

89
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,240
they kind of viewed themselves as a separate way,

90
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,509
where everything was subordinate --

91
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:43,880
the economy itself was subordinate to the state.

92
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,120
Now, with that said, they tended to align themselves

93
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,000
more with folks on the right.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,330
So even though they weren't

95
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,074
completely free market capitalists,

96
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:54,653
they were staunchly anti-Communist,

97
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:57,960
and anti-socialist, which caused them to form

98
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,196
alliances a little bit more with the right.

99
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:02,410
But from their point of view, it wasn't one of these

100
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,080
extreme right-wing ideologies

101
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,139
that the government should be subordinate

102
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,810
to the economy -- that the government should

103
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,509
be as small as possible.

104
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,039
It was much more that the economy

105
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:16,914
was there to serve national interests.

106
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:20,270
Some of the other kind of ideologies that

107
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,650
the fascists began to hold is this idea that

108
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,090
force was a legitimate part of politics.

109
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,481
So, force in politics.

110
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:33,320
And we see this when Benito Mussolini's fascists,

111
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,169
through the use of the Blackshirts --

112
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,699
which was their paramilitary group

113
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,910
which allowed them to eventually take

114
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,520
political control and enforce political control --

115
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,070
And we later see it with other groups, like the Nazis,

116
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,212
who also tended to be associated

117
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,433
with fascism

118
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:49,810
and their storm troopers, and their storm battalions,

119
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,520
their paramilitary forces -- that are used to,

120
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,740
essentially, take political control.

121
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,979
The other aspect of them --

122
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:58,750
and as you can imagine, when we're talking about

123
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,350
either Mussolini or the Nazis --

124
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,240
is that they weren't really fans of democracy.

125
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,110
Not only did they think that everything should be

126
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,247
subordinate to the state, but

127
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:09,125
that the state should have absolute control.

128
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,759
So, it's not about democracy.

129
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,550
It's about having a strong leader at the top,

130
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,178
a strong one party at the top.

131
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:17,257
And in the case of Mussolini, it was the Fascists.

132
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:19,617
In the case of Hitler, it ends up being the Nazis.

133
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:23,792
So totalitarian. Completely totalitarian.

134
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,360
And then, they also --

135
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,286
And these kind of all gelled together.

136
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,350
-- this idea of aggressive foreign-policy.

137
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,478
And this aggressive foreign policy is really

138
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:37,540
rooted in this belief of cultural superiority.

139
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,990
And, if you take the case of the Nazis, this belief in racial,

140
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,550
extreme racial superiority -- cultural superiority.

141
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,789
And I'm making a slight distinction there,

142
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,466
because in Mussolini's eyes, he was actually

143
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:49,410
quite disparaging --

144
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,631
even though Hitler looked to Mussolini

145
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:54,050
as something of a role model,

146
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,620
when Mussolini took power in 1922 --

147
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,380
it inspired Hitler's 'Beer Hall Putsch.'

148
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,650
Mussolini did not think much of Hitler

149
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,210
through much of the 1920s, and even early 1930s.

150
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,660
He thought Hitler's ideas of racial purity

151
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,690
were really an illusion --

152
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,279
that there was no racially pure race.

153
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,324
He didn't really appreciate Hitler calling

154
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:18,005
the Italians a mongrel race.

155
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,130
But Mussolini, himself, did think that

156
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,039
the Italians were culturally superior,

157
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,880
and that would be their justification

158
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,440
for an aggressive foreign policy --

159
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,605
for them taking over other territory

160
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:34,291
in Europe and in Africa.

161
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,130
And as we'll see,

162
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,233
because they shared so much in common ideologically --

163
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,876
The Nazis were -- you could kind of view as

164
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,620
a more extreme form --

165
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,900
and the Fascists themselves were quite extreme.

166
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,290
But the Nazis were a more extreme form

167
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,223
of this same ideology.

168
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,189
They will, even though, in the 20s and early 30s,

169
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:54,370
Mussolini is more eager to align himself

170
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,479
with some of the other powers in Europe --

171
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,349
in particular Great Britain and France,

172
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,187
as we go into the second half of 1930s,

173
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:04,759
Mussolini and Hitler find themselves to be kindred spirits.

174
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,069
They both want to be aggressive in their foreign-policy.

175
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,789
They both want to secure other territory.

176
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,000
They both have this idea that they need

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,126
space for their superior populations --

178
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,129
their culturally superior -- and in the case of the Nazis --

179
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:21,270
racially superior populations -- to grow and thrive.

180
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,669
And so, as we enter into

181
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,460
the second half of the 1930s and World War II,

182
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,550
you have Mussolini and the Fascists

183
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,057
become close allies of Hitler and the Nazis.
