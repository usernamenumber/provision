00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,900
Welcome to the presentation
on quadratic inequalities.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,660
Before we get to quadratic
inequalities, let's just start

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,945
graphing some functions and
interpret them and then we'll

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,880
slowly move to the
inequalities.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:26,360
Let's say I had f of x is equal
to x squared plus x minus 6.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,210
Well, if we wanted to figure
out where this function

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,070
intersects the x-axis or the
roots of it, we learned in our

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,210
factoring quadratics that we
could just set f of x

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,735
is equal to 0, right?

10
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:39,460
Because f of x equals 0 when
you're intersecting the x-axis.

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:46,990
So you would say x squared
plus x minus 6 is equal to 0.

12
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,800
And you just factor
this quadratic.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:57,470
x plus 3 times x
minus 2 equals 0.

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:03,270
And you would learn that the
roots of this quadratic

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:11,600
function are x is equal to
minus 3, and x is equal to 2.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,970
How would we visualize this?

17
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,970
Well let's draw this
quadratic function.

18
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,510
Those are my very uneven lines.

19
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,200
So the roots are x is
equal to negative 3.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,180
So this is, right here, x is at
minus 3y0 -- by definition one

21
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,790
of the roots is where
f of x is equal to 0.

22
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,370
So the y, or the f of
x axis here is 0.

23
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,600
The coordinate is 0.

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,130
And this point here
is 2 comma 0.

25
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,360
Once again, this is the x-axis,
and this is the f of x-axis.

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,270
We also know that the y
intercept is minus 6.

27
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,800
This isn't the vertex,
this is the y intercept.

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,710
And that the graph is going to
look something like this -- not

29
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,640
as bumpy as what I'm drawing,
which I think you get the

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,180
general idea if you've ever
seen a clean parabola.

31
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:16,200
It looks like that with x minus
3 here, and x is 2 here.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,080
Pretty straightforward.

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,480
We figured out the roots, we
figured out what it looks like.

34
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,170
Now what if we, instead of
wanting to know where f of x is

35
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,960
equal to 0, which is these two
points, what if we wanted

36
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,290
to know where f of x
is greater than 0?

37
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,200
What x values make f
of x greater than 0?

38
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,050
Or another way of saying
it, what values make

39
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,410
the statement true?

40
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,740
x squared plus x minus 6
is greater than 0, Right,

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,730
this is just f of x.

42
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,470
Well if we look at the graph,
when is f of x greater than 0?

43
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,010
Well this is the f of x
axis, and when are we

44
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,910
in positive territory?

45
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,360
Well f of x is greater than
0 here -- let me draw that

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,890
another color -- is greater
than 0 here, right?

47
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,980
Because it's above the x-axis.

48
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,830
And f of x is greater
than 0 here.

49
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,070
So just visually looking at it,
what x values make this true?

50
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:23,580
Well, this is true whenever x
is less than minus 3, right, or

51
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,440
whenever x is greater than 2.

52
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,560
Because when x is greater than
2, f of x is greater than 0,

53
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,910
and when x is less than
negative 3, f of x

54
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,430
is greater than 0.

55
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,460
So we would say the solution to
this quadratic inequality, and

56
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:46,910
we pretty much solved this
visually, is x is less than

57
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,970
minus 3, or x is
greater than 2.

58
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,890
And you could test it out.

59
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,990
You could try out the number
minus 4, and you should get f

60
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,800
of x being greater than 0.

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,890
You could try it out here.

62
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,110
Or you could try the number 3
and make sure that this works.

63
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,820
And you can just make sure
that, you could, for example,

64
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,410
try out the number 0 and make
sure that 0 doesn't work,

65
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,790
right, because 0 is
between the two roots.

66
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,030
It actually turns out that
when x is equal to 0, f

67
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,040
of x is minus 6, which is
definitely less than 0.

68
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,400
So I think this will give you a
visual intuition of what this

69
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,000
quadratic inequality means.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,510
Now with that visual intuition
in the back of your mind, let's

71
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,090
do some more problems and maybe
we won't have to go through the

72
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,600
exercise of drawing it, but
maybe I will draw it just to

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,190
make sure that the
point hits home.

74
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,140
Let me give you a slightly
trickier problem.

75
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:49,120
Let's say I had minus x squared
minus 3x plus 28, let me

76
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,190
say, is greater than 0.

77
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,600
Well I want to get rid of
this negative sign in

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,350
front of the x squared.

79
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,420
I just don't like it there
because it makes it look

80
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,080
more confusing to factor.

81
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,140
I'm going to multiply
everything by negative 1.

82
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,780
Both sides.

83
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:08,210
I get x squared plus 3x minus
28, and when you multiply or

84
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,160
divide by a negative, with any
inequality you have

85
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,440
to swap the sign.

86
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,860
So this is now going
to be less than 0.

87
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:25,130
And if we were to factor this,
we get x plus 7 times x

88
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,880
minus 4 is less than 0.

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,460
So if this was equal to 0, we
would know that the two roots

90
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,400
of this function -- let's
define the function f of x --

91
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,540
let's define the function as f
of x is equal to -- well we can

92
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,670
define it as this or this
because they're the same thing.

93
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,080
But for simplicity let's define
it as x plus 7 times x minus 4.

94
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,390
That's f of x, right?

95
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,260
Well, after factoring it, we
know that the roots of this,

96
00:05:53,260 --> 00:06:05,600
the roots are x is equal to
minus 7, and x is equal to 4.

97
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,900
Now what we want to know
is what x values make

98
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,000
this inequality true?

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,060
If this was any
equality we'd be done.

100
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,650
But we want to know what
makes this inequality true.

101
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,600
I'll give you a little bit of a
trick, it's always going to be

102
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,160
the numbers in between the
two roots or outside

103
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,120
of the two roots.

104
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,810
So what I do whenever I'm doing
this on a test or something, I

105
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,510
just test numbers that are
either between the roots or

106
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,610
outside of the two roots.

107
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,660
So let's pick a number that's
between x equals minus

108
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,360
7 and x equals 4.

109
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,560
Well let's try x equals 0.

110
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,660
Well, f of 0 is equal to -- we
could do it right here -- f of

111
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:57,360
0 is 0 plus 7 times 0 minus 4
is just 7 times minus

112
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,280
4, which is minus 28.

113
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,100
So f of 0 is minus 28.

114
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,800
Now is this -- this is the
function we're working with

115
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,790
-- is this less than 0?

116
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,140
Well yeah, it is.

117
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,090
So it actually turns that a
number, an x value between

118
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,470
the two roots works.

119
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,940
So actually I immediately
know that the answer here

120
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,340
is all of the x's that are
between the two roots.

121
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,170
So we could say that the
solution to this is

122
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,720
minus 7 is less than x
which is less than 4.

123
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,460
Because now the other way.

124
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,240
You could have tried a number
that's outside of the roots,

125
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,460
either less than minus 7 or
greater than 4 and

126
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,650
have tried it out.

127
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,820
Let's say if you
had tried out 5.

128
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,140
Try x equals 5.

129
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:55,780
Well then f of 5 would
be 12 times 1, right,

130
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,690
which is equal to 12.

131
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,570
f of 5 is 12.

132
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,300
Is that less than 0?

133
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,110
No.

134
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,060
So that wouldn't have worked.

135
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,000
So once again, that gives
us a confidence that we

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,260
got the right interval.

137
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,750
And if we wanted to think about
this visually, because we got

138
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,920
this answer, when you do it
visually it actually makes, I

139
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,640
think, a lot of sense,
but maybe I'm biased.

140
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,770
If you look at it visually
it looks like this.

141
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,890
If you draw it visually and this
is the parabola, this is f of

142
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:52,580
x, the roots here are minus 7,
0 and 4, 0, we're saying that

143
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,230
for all x values between these
two numbers, f of

144
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,390
x is less than 0.

145
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,770
And that makes sense, because
when is f of x less than 0?

146
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,420
Well this is the
graph of f of x.

147
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,570
And when is f of x less than 0?

148
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,480
Right here.

149
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,880
So what x values give us that?

150
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,140
Well the x values that give
us that are right here.

151
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,410
I hope I'm not confusing
you too much with

152
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,960
these visual graphs.

153
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,140
And you're probably saying,
well how do I know

154
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,180
I don't include 0?

155
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,116
Well you could try it out, but
if you -- oh, well how come

156
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:24,690
I don't include the roots?

157
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,030
Well at the roots, f
of x is equal to 0.

158
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,640
So if this was this, if this
was less than or equal to 0,

159
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,290
then the answer would be
negative 7 is less than

160
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,230
or equal to x is less
than or equal to 4.

161
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,620
I hope that gives you a sense.

162
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,460
You pretty much just have to
try number in between the

163
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,250
roots, and try number outside
of the roots, and that tells

164
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,300
you what interval will
make the inequality true.

165
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,640
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
