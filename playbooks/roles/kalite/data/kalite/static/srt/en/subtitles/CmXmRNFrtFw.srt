1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
   

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,940
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,730
Where I had just left off we
were trying to figure out this

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,460
area between these two curves,
and we figured out that it's

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,440
really the area between the
curves between the point 0,

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,520
x equals 0 and x equals 1.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,840
And I was proposing
of a way to do it.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,620
Let's figure out the entire
area under the square root of

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:26,570
x from 0 to 1, and we can
subtract from that, this

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,580
purple area, which is the
area under x squared.

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,220
So just based on the last
example we did, we could just

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,490
write the indefinite integral,
and I'm not going to rewrite

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,970
the fundamental theorem from
calculus, because I think

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,770
you know that by now.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,080
Let me do it in a loud color.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,120
Magenta.

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,770
So I want to know the
larger area, right.

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,355
The area under just
the square root of x.

19
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:49,660
That's Kind of like
the combined area.

20
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:58,710
Well that's just from 0 to 1,
the integral of square root of

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,050
x, because square root of x
is the green function, dx.

22
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:13,020
And I want to subtract from
that the area from 0 to 1

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,450
what's under x squared.

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,110
x squared dx.

25
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,240
And I just want
to make a point.

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,420
This could have just been
rewritten this way.

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,330
You could just rewrite a new
function, which is the

28
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,410
difference of these two
functions, and it would

29
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,120
have been equivalent.

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,070
You could have said this.

31
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,820
This isn't kind of a step of
the problem, but you could

32
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,520
have done it this way.

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,080
In fact, some people
start this way.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,960
See those are the same thing
as the integral from 0 to 1

35
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,120
of square root of x
minus x squared dx.

36
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,720
So you could do this two
separate problems, two separate

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,450
indefinite integrals, or
you could do it as one

38
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,080
indefinite integral.

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,800
Actually that might be even
simpler because when you

40
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,620
evaluate it from 1 to 0 it
simplify things a little bit.

41
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,150
So let's stick with
the second one.

42
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,710
So first of all we just have
to figure out what the

43
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,930
antiderivative of this
inner expression is.

44
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,720
So you haven't seen
square root of x yet.

45
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,100
Do you think you
know how to do it?

46
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,480
Well, I think you do.

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,060
Let's say that equals square
root of x is just x to

48
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,940
the 1/2 power, right?

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,020
So we just use the same
antiderivative rules

50
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,160
we've always used.

51
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,110
We raise it one more power
so it becomes x to the 3/2.

52
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,230
Right, it was 1/2,
we added 1 to it.

53
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,860
And then we divide by
this new exponent.

54
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,370
So dividing by a fraction
is like multiplying

55
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,920
by its reciprocal.

56
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,840
So it's 2/3 x to the 3/2 and
then minus-- I think the second

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,780
term is pretty easy for you--
minus 1/3 x to the third.

58
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,250
That's the antiderivative
of minus x squared, minus

59
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,200
1/3 x to the third.

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:56,120
And we're going to have to
evaluate this thing at 0 and 1

61
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,770
and subtract the difference.

62
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,040
Subtract this expression
evaluated at 0 from this

63
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,030
expression evaluated at 1.

64
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,080
I think I'm running
out of space.

65
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,070
What happens when x equals 1?

66
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,810
1 to the 3/2 is 1.

67
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,755
1 to the third is 1.

68
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:11,130
So it's 2/3 minus 1/3.

69
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,370
Well that's easy.

70
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,180
It's 1/3.

71
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,030
I just put 1 in for x.

72
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,470
And then when x is equal to 0
what is this expression equal?

73
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,700
Well that's easy too.

74
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,530
That's 0.

75
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,720
So there you go.

76
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,520
1/3 minus 0 or 1/3.

77
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,610
That's kind of neat.

78
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,030
   

79
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,940
You know I find is this of
exciting because if just my

80
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,940
intuition I was like, oh I have
these two curves, and I mean

81
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,320
they do intersect at the nice
integer number, but you know

82
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,830
what it's probably going to be
some really messy number

83
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,560
of what the areas between
these two curves, right.

84
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,990
Who knows, maybe it'll involve
some you know-- a circle

85
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,750
involves pi, which is this
really messy number, so maybe

86
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,100
all curves have these
kind of messy areas.

87
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,830
But this one it's just one of
those neat things about math.

88
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,360
The area between the square
root of x and x squared is 1/3,

89
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,000
which is a pretty clean number.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,820
   

91
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,100
Actually let me do one more
problem since I have time.

92
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,260
   

93
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,250
It's a bit of a trick problem.

94
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,970
I mean, you might actually find
this easy, but let's figure out

95
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:38,310
the area between f of x
is equal to-- I don't

96
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,130
know, x to the fifth.

97
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm going to do
something simple.

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,645
Let me draw it actually.

99
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:56,930
   

100
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,730
OK, I'm going to
draw the x-axis.

101
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:04,660
   

102
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,990
x to the fifth is going
to go up super fast,

103
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,780
something like that.

104
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,220
It's going to go up real fast.

105
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,640
Let's say I wanted to figure
out the areas-- this side's

106
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,930
going to go real fast too--
between that, and instead of

107
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:19,180
figuring out the area between
x-axis and that, f of x, I want

108
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:28,730
to figure out the area between
f of x and-- Instead

109
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,530
of figuring out this
bottom area, right?

110
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,380
Like the normal problems we've
done, we would figure out this

111
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,950
type of area, you know,
between two points.

112
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:49,710
Let's say I want to figure out
the area inside of the curve

113
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:56,090
where the height here is 32.

114
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,790
So I want to figure out this
area inside the curve.

115
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,070
How do we do that?

116
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,010
Well one way we could do it is
just like we did the last one,

117
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,970
we can figure out some function
that's essentially a line, a

118
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,030
horizontal line that goes
straight across here.

119
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,800
And we'll essentially just
be figuring out the area

120
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,050
between the two functions.

121
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,460
So what's a function that's
a line that just goes

122
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,820
straight at y equals 32?

123
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,000
I think I just gave
you the answer.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,720
Exactly.

125
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,580
Let me stick with
that greenish color.

126
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,200
So we could say g of
x is equal to 32.

127
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,415
It's just a constant function.

128
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:35,510
It just goes straight across.

129
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,310
And then we need to figure out
what the area is between the

130
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,050
two, so we need to figure out
what are these two points.

131
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,990
   

132
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,240
So when does x to
the fifth equal 32?

133
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean you could solve it
algebraically, you know,

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,954
you could say x to
the fifth equals 32.

135
00:06:53,954 --> 00:07:03,420
x is equal to 2, and
actually, you know what?

136
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,020
I made a mistake.

137
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,760
Let's say that this is not
equal to x to the fifth.

138
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,950
Let's say that f of x is
equal to x to the absolute

139
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,270
value of x to the fifth.

140
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,590
Because the mistake, obviously
x to the fifth is not a

141
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,420
parabola looking thing.
x to the fifth goes

142
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,630
negative like this.

143
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,070
But I have committed so much to
this cup shape that I'll make

144
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,350
it the absolute value
of x to the fifth.

145
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,290
So if I say the absolute value
of x to the fifth is equal to

146
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,170
32, I think you see where
I realized my mistake.

147
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,280
But if I say the absolute value
of x to the fifth is 32,

148
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,800
there's two places
where that's true.

149
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,430
It's x is equal to
plus or minus 2.

150
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,670
These are the two points.

151
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,795
I should have done something
with an even exponent so I

152
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,520
could have had this cup shape,
but anyway the absolute

153
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,280
value solved my problem.

154
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,740
So what is this area?

155
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,180
We know it's between negative
2 and 2, so we just set up

156
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,300
the indefinite integral.

157
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:59,210
It's the indefinite integral
for minus 2 to 2 of the top

158
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,350
function, the top boundary, 32,
minus the bottom boundary.

159
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,250
   

160
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,270
Well, this will be a little bit
tricky, but minus the absolute

161
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,360
value of x to the fifth dx.

162
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,660
And actually instead of doing
this, I think you could see

163
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,160
that there's symmetry here,
so we could just figure out

164
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,690
this area and multiply by 2.

165
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,223
This problem's a little hairy,
just because I had a bad

166
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:29,160
choice of initial function.

167
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,410
Not exactly what I wanted,
but we'll work on forward.

168
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:38,640
So instead of doing that, let's
do the integral from 0 to 2 of

169
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,020
32 minus x to the fifth dx.

170
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,340
And then multiply that by 2.

171
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,060
So what is that?

172
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:56,060
That's 32x minus x to
the sixth over 6.

173
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:05,720
And we're going to evaluate it
from 2 and 0 at 64 minus 64/6.

174
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:13,860
2 to the sixth is 64, and
then 32 times 0 is 0 and the

175
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,370
next is 6, that's 0, so the
answer is 64 minus 64/6.

176
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,880
I'm about to run out of time.

177
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,320
That's just a fraction
problem there.

178
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,230
Oh, and that's half
of it, right?

179
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,370
So we want to
multiply that by 2.

180
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,290
So if we multiply that by
2, we get 128 minus 128/6.

181
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,980
I haven't figured
out what it is.

182
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,850
Well I guess we could
figure it out.

183
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:45,840
It's 128 times 1 minus
1/6 or 128 times 5/6.

184
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,280
And I don't know what that is.

185
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,100
I can multiply if I wanted to,
but I have 10 seconds left

186
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,400
so I'll leave you there.

187
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,365
Hope I didn't confuse you.

188
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:54,170
See you soon.

189
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,400
