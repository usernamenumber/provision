1
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:07,037
We’re in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican,

2
00:00:07,037 --> 00:00:09,844
which has tremendous importance to Catholicism.

3
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,368
This is where the Pope will lead Mass.

4
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:14,277
But perhaps most famously,

5
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:16,528
this is the room that the College of Cardinals

6
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:19,384
uses to decide the next pope.

7
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:22,971
And every surface of this space is decorated –

8
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:25,921
from the beautiful mosaics on the floor –

9
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:28,225
the walls are painted with frescoes

10
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:29,925
by early Renaissance artists.

11
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:32,139
The wall behind the altar was painted

12
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:33,988
by Michelangelo later in his life.

13
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:35,934
And then, of course, the ceiling.

14
00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:37,858
And everybody is looking up.

15
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:39,301
Their necks are craned.

16
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:41,167
And of course, it’s magnificent.

17
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:45,117
We’re here in the late afternoon on a day in early July.

18
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:47,061
The light is diffuse,

19
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:51,420
and it makes those frescoed figures feel so dimensional.

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,590
They feel like sculpture.

21
00:00:53,590 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can imagine what it was like

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when it was unveiled.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how revolutionary

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, he was first and foremost a sculptor.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it wasn’t actually until the very recent cleaning,

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we knew his brilliance as a colorist.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But, for him, lying and drawing

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Trying carving

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Figures out of paint

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you have this extraordinary ability

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to render both strength and elegance, simultaneously.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They have a massiveness and a presence that is charismatic.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But there’s also a sense of elegance and ideal beauty.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let’s describe what we’re looking at.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Okay.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Probably the most important are the series of nine scenes

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that move across the central []

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And those are framed

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by a painted architectural framework that looks real.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It doesn’t look like paint.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
, to create or in the universe

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we move through to the creation of Adam –

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well the separation of the sexe if the creation of the ifs

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the creation of god’s most perfect creatures –

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
human beings.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Innocence the separation of good and evil

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Man and woman disobeying God,

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
causing the expulsion of Adam

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
, the creation of Eve from the garden of Eden.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Scenes of noah

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So these are all scenes from the first book of the Bible –

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the Book of Genesis

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it’s so interesting.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because this is a Catholic Church

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We don’t see images of Christ.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And Christ is present in other ways.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Not only does the disobedience of Adam and Eve

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
make the coming of Christ necessary,

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But when we look on either side of those central scenes ,

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we see the prophets and the cybils

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who predicted the coming of a savior for mankind.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The image of the Libyan Cybil

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Spectacularly beautiful as

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So ‘Cybils’ are these ancient pagan soothsayers

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who can foresee the future,

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and according to the Catholic tradition,

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
foretell the coming of Christ/

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But Look at the Libyans Cybil.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Look at the elegance

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The way that her to toe just reaches down

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and touches the ground

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it seems as if she is the process of moving,

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and possibly of standing

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There is a presence and drama

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Especially.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
She twists her body in an almost impossible way.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we can say Michelangelo

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
has articulated every muscle in the back.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And, in fact, we know that he used a male model

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I’m so taken with the color here.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We spoke only of line, of cultural form.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But after the dramatic cleaning of the Sistine chapel

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
those original colors, their brilliancy, came out.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
She, of course, is reaching back.

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And, presumably, that’s a book of prophecy that she holds.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There’s a look of confidence and knowing on her face.

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The absolute clarity with which

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
she knows the Christ will come.

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sitting on the architecthual framework

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the four corner of all of the central scenes

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are male nude figures that we refer to as ignudi.

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think this is Important because Michelangelo

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
To create levels of reality

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so, for example, the Libyan cybil

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Seated amongst the architecture.

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then set next to her are bronze figures.

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then in the []

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Amongst the architecture

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As you mentioned, other scenes that seem to

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then relief sculptures

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then seated above those, the ignudi.

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it’s so clear we’re at this moment

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at the rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture.

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And Michelangelo is Rome. He’s in the Vatican.

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the High Renaissance.

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It’s so interesting to compare

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the ceiling

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
, with the far darker and more pessimistic view that

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Michelangelo will paint later on the back wall –

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Last Judgment.

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There is a big difference between 1512

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When he begins last judgment.

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Protestant Reformation has begun.

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the Church is under attack.

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Michelangelo’s world had been shattered.

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But when you look at the ceiling, you see instead,

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
all of the optimism,

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
all of the intellectual and emotional power

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that characterizes the High Renaissance,

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in all of its newfound appreciation for the ancient world.

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This was a moment of incredible promise.

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And all of that, shining through these figures.

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let’s not forget that just a few doors away,

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
simultaneously Raphael is painting frescoes

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the Papal Palace.

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what a moment in Rome.
