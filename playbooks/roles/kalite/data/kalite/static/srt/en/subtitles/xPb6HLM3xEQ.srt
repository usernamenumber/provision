1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
   

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,560
Let's keep doing the first
problem from the 2008

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,030
Calculus BC exam.

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,400
We're on Part b.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,790
   

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,640
I think that's too thick.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,970
OK it says, the horizontal line
y equals negative 2 splits

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,460
the region r-- this is
r-- into two parts.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,340
Write, but do not evaluate, an
integral expression for the

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,780
area of the part of r that is
below the horizontal lines.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,980
Let's draw y is equal
to negative 2.

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,500
So y equals negative 2
would look like this.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,460
y is just a constant.

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,350
That's not thick enough.

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,300
I don't know if
you can see that.

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,190
Let me do it as a thick line
and in a darker color maybe.

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,300
y is equal to negative 2 will
look something like that.

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,740
And what they're saying is if
it splits this region r into

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,550
two parts, this part
and this part.

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,260
And what they want to know is
an integral expression for the

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,250
area of the part of r that is
below the horizontal line.

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,670
So they care about the
area of this part of r.

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,570
And remember they just want
us to write the expression,

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,600
not evaluate it.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,470
So that'll hopefully
save us time.

26
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,880
So how do we figure this out?

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,480
Well the easy part is actually
to figure out what the

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,600
expression we're going to take
the definite integral of.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,250
And it's going to be a little
bit harder to figure out

30
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,570
the boundary points.

31
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,510
So what is the expression
within the definite

32
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,510
integral that we will use?

33
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,290
Well, just like we did in Part
a, think about we're going to

34
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,600
take a sum of a bunch
of rectangles.

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,530
And the height of the
rectangles is going to be

36
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,795
the difference between
the two functions.

37
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:44,410
   

38
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,330
And this is y is equal to
negative 2, and then this

39
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,680
function right here is y is
equal to-- and we had written

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,680
it down in Part 3-- but
that's x cubed minus 4x.

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,310
That's this curve right here.

42
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,780
So the height of each of these
little rectangles is going to

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:10,480
be minus 2 minus x to
the third minus 4x.

44
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,150
That's the height of each
of these rectangles.

45
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,630
And then the width of each of
those rectangles we know from--

46
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,760
well, just learning calculus or
learning integrals--

47
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,420
the width is dx.

48
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,600
So we're going to
multiply that times dx.

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,300
And then we're going to take
all of the sums from x is equal

50
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,460
to whatever this point is
to whatever this point is.

51
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,550
So we need to figure out this
point, this value of f, which

52
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,600
is going to be here, and then
this value of x, which

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,350
is going to be there.

54
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,210
And so these are really just
two of the points where

55
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,390
these two functions
intersect each other.

56
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,860
So how do we figure
out those points?

57
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,790
Well what we could do is we can
set them equal to each other,

58
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,640
so we could say at what x
values does x to the third

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,260
minus 4x equal minus 2.

60
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,880
At what x values are
the y values the same?

61
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,120
So we just set them
equal to each other.

62
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,220
If we wanted to write this is a
proper polynomial expression,

63
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:18,650
we would get x to the third
minus 4x plus 2 is equal to 0.

64
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,940
And I actually just tried to
record a video where I was

65
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,120
doing this on the fly, and I
kept staring at this and I was

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,080
like, boy, this is a hard
polynomial to factor.

67
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,220
I kept trying to guess numbers,
or figuring out-- I even tried

68
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,670
to do Newton's method-- and I
kept getting weird numbers, and

69
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,830
I became suspicious of myself.

70
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,410
And then I looked at the
actual test-- actually

71
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,350
I can show it to you.

72
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,840
   

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,940
It says right there, a graphing
calculator is required for some

74
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,390
problems or parts of problems.

75
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,830
And I realized that they
probably want us to use a

76
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,920
graphing calculator to
figure out the roots

77
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,290
of this polynomial.

78
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,550
So let's do that.

79
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,150
It's been a long time since I
actually took AP Calculus, and

80
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,250
now I remember that a graphing
calculator was a big deal.

81
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,425
I just actually downloaded
this TI-85 emulator.

82
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:11,940
So let's use this to figure out
the roots of this polynomial.

83
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,130
Let's turn it on.

84
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,230
   

85
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,040
If we want to figure out
the roots we use the poly

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,900
function, so second poly.

87
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,540
What's the order of
this polynomial?

88
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,550
What's the third-degree
polynomial?

89
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,670
f of x to the third.

90
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,110
So order is 3, enter.

91
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,980
And what are the coefficients?

92
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,302
Well the coefficient on x
to the third term is 1.

93
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:37,880
Go down.

94
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,960
What's the coefficient
on the x squared term?

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,490
Well there is no x
squared term, right?

96
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,910
So that coefficient is 0.

97
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,260
Go down.

98
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,610
What's the coefficient
on the x term?

99
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,690
It's minus 4.

100
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,420
So minus 4.

101
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,980
Go down again.

102
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,720
And then the coefficient
or the constant term.

103
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,390
Well that's just going to be 2.

104
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,403
And now we can just hit solve.

105
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:08,440
   

106
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,820
And we get three crazy numbers,
and this shows you that this

107
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,440
would have been very hard to
solve analytically if you

108
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,490
have a normal brain.

109
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,260
So let's see.

110
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:25,220
There are three places where y
equals negative 2 intersects y

111
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,645
is equal to x to the
third minus 4x.

112
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:31,090
It intersects at minus 2.21.

113
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,650
Well that's off of this
graph, that's not even here.

114
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,290
That's somewhere
off to the left.

115
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,520
This curve probably comes
back down and intersects

116
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,040
over there at minus 2.

117
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,680
But it also intersects at 1.675
which is probably right here.

118
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,980
Right, that looks like 1.675.

119
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,660
It also intersects at 0.539,
which is right there.

120
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,100
So we can use those values that
our graphing calculator gave us

121
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,740
and put it into our
definite integral.

122
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:06,350
So this point right here our
polynomial solver told us

123
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,526
is x is equal to 0.539.

124
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:16,560
So we'll put here 0.539.

125
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,360
And then this point right
here-- so this is our limits

126
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,152
of integration for our
definite integral, right?

127
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:25,193
We're going to sum up these
little rectangles from x is

128
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:35,170
equal to 0.539 to x
is equal to 1.675.

129
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,585
And they told us that they do
not want us to evaluate it,

130
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:39,140
so we are done with Part b.

131
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,500
We could just write this
and we should hopefully

132
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,410
get full credit.

133
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,250
Maybe they'd want you to
simplify this a little bit,

134
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,040
but I'd be surprised if they
were mark off for that.

135
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,240
Anyway, let's do Part c.

136
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,510
If we have time.

137
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,350
Part c.

138
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,490
So they say the region r
is the base of a solid.

139
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,570
For this solid each
cross-section perpendicular

140
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,650
to the x-axis is a square.

141
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,780
Find the volume of the solid.

142
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,310
OK, so this is interesting.

143
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,700
Let me see if I can draw it.

144
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,610
So that curve, I'm going to
draw it kind of with a

145
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,650
perspective so you can see the
solid they're talking about.

146
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,620
So it's the same region r.

147
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,320
So we had a sin
function on the top.

148
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,720
Looks something like that.

149
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,150
And then we had that polynomial
function on the bottom that

150
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,310
looks something like that.

151
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,260
I'm trying to draw
it at an angle.

152
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,270
So just to show you the x-axis.

153
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,760
   

154
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,220
This is going to be the x-axis.

155
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:44,460
   

156
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,660
Let me draw the y-axis.

157
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,110
The way I drew it now it
looks something like this.

158
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,710
Trying to do a little bit of
perspective so that we can

159
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,910
visualize what they're
talking about.

160
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,650
   

161
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,300
So that's the y-axis.

162
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,310
So that's x y.

163
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,720
And what they're saying, this
is the region r again, just

164
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,330
like in the previous two
parts of the problem.

165
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,330
They say the region r is
the base of a solid.

166
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,890
So this is the base of a solid.

167
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,630
For this solid each
cross-section perpendicular

168
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,490
to the x-axis.

169
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,470
So a cross-section
perpendicular to the x-axis.

170
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,210
Let's see if we can draw that.

171
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,310
So this would be
a cross-section.

172
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,100
So it's like we took a knife
and we cut like this, we cut

173
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,140
parallel to the y-axis.

174
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,270
   

175
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,410
Say we took this cross-section
of this solid right now.

176
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,160
They say that it is a square.

177
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,350
So that means that the base has
to be the same height, has

178
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,290
to be the same disk
size as the height.

179
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,460
So if we took the cross-section
of the solid here it

180
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,100
would be like that.

181
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,720
Here it would be a smaller
square like that.

182
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,810
If we took the cross-section
there, it would be a

183
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,080
small square as well.

184
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,140
   

185
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,645
So what they want us to
do is figure out the

186
00:09:00,645 --> 00:09:01,170
volume of the solid.

187
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,500
You can kind of imagine
what it looks like.

188
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,920
It's small squares and the
squares get really big and

189
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,840
then they get small again.

190
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,470
So how do we do that?

191
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,110
Well we do the same thing.

192
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,920
We take the area of each of
these squares-- we know they're

193
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,920
squares-- times each of the
dx's-- the small differential--

194
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,200
and we sum them up
over from 0 to 2.

195
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,440
On the first diagram,
I think that was 2.

196
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,860
Oh, and I'm about
to be out of time.

197
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,150
So I will continue this
problem in the next video.

198
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,480
See you soon.

199
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,871
